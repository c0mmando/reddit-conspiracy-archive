       Let me try to explain it to you. "BlackLivesMatter" is a Soros-funded front group ostensibly protesting White police officers shooting Black criminals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, BlackLivesMatter has essentially ignored that far greater issue of Black criminals shooting Black people.

       The fact that there are some nominal discussions about black on black crime isn't really relevant.

       The reason the comment was made is because recently the mental gymnastics that have been going have lead some to the conclusion that because they believe racism is a social construct that black on black crime doesn't exist. They say that any crime committed by a black person to a black person is due to institutionalized racism and was caused by white people or white males to be exact.

       It has some truth though. When you teach non  violence and you protest and get beat up. All that nonviolence you end up lashing out at your family. You get beat up all the time all day, becomes pretty difficult not to lash out domestically. Our choices and whom we are, are not formed in a vacuum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes forming a theory of thought based on race and teaching it, institutionalizes people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being aware of facts does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact, you beat on people, they will tend to want to beat on other people. It's very difficult for a human being of any color to suffer violence and not become violent themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes so its the chicken or the egg? Does it matter? Not really. Lets accept circumstances have an affect and go from there.

       Wasn't endorsing it but that's the train of thought they use to blame institutionalized racism and white people. They say since white people created institutionalized racism they are responsible for issues in minority communities.

       Yes, it is other people, especially in regard to the people who have been stating black on black crime doesn't exist or isn't an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you implying black on black crime doesn't exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       Black on black crime is an issue in their communities imo finding a way to justify blaming another group of people for it doesn't solve the problem.

       I read your original comment as not understanding why the original poster made a joke of that nature and was relaying the train of thought for the the claim that leads to that joke. It is a pretty ridiculous train of thought imo.

       Their culture is more violent in regard to criminal statistics around the world. Granted that's an oversimplification of the issue which I don't have a lot of time to answer atm

       What does that mean? Do black children in Africa face the same discrimination from their schools, the media, or the police as black children in America? Mostly no. Do they still face social pressure to have lighter skin? Mostly yes. Does Africa's financial wealth match its natural resources? Not at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure how many millionaires you think Africa should have. Overall, it has less than a trillion dollars, which is much less than the other continents.

       Because the point is that Black Lives Matter doesn't care about black violence.  It does.  It's just doesn't get reported. So when Al Sharpton has a major summit in Chicago directly attempting to address gun violence, it goes completely ignored by the media.

       When peaceful protests in Ferguson happen night after night, it gets completely ignored until someone gets violent, then the story is about nothing BUT the violence.

       Police violence against blacks is practically nothing compared to the number of black lives ended at abortion clinics each year. Why is this ignored?

       Pittsburgh just had one where 2 guys ran up on a bbq and killed 5 people, one pregnant. I think the only national attention it got was a short Today show segment and NPR mentioned it. But all the news media covered that trump supporter punching a guy for like a week.

Cause surely a terrorist wouldn't lie..  So really he'd have to stop all immigration to stop all Muslims from entering the country but for some reason that wasn't his plan.. His plan was a bullshit idea that he knows isn't possible but he also knew that it would con some people into voting for him.

       Easiest way is just to ban immigrants from specific Muslim heavy countries. We take in far too many low educated 3rd world immigrants a year anyway. Even have a lottery system. It's a joke. Beyond that though we know the NSA does heavy spying. Truly vetting people shouldn't be that hard. And if we can't vet them don't let them in. Simple.

       Ok..so the plan isn't "ban Muslims" it is "ban countries."  So we will ban Coptic Christians and Yazidi Christians based on where they live.  And how does the NSA spy on people who don't have facebook or cell phones?

       Al-Taqiyya.  That's a Muslim doctrine that allows them to lie about their faith without punishment/consequences especially in times of war or to further their cause.  So the ones who would actually do harm would absolutely know this.

       Just looked it up, no one died in that shooting. The news tends to report less when no one dies. Eg, when I was in college there was a shooting at the mall near my college (Garden State Plaza). It was huge news around here but it was barely a blip in the national news cycle because no one died.

       I'm not sure why you keep talking about the US figurehead president. He doesn't have any say in the policies of the US government. It's about as useless as asking me about British pickpocket rates in relation to which monarch is on the throne at the time.

       So, about the same number of people are being killed with guns per year as usual (less probably),
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/mass-shootings-in-america/">
        even the FBI’s data on mass killings is only about 57 percent accurate

       If you click through and follow the sources you will see that graph is lying. Mother Jones had 25 mass shootings recorded during Obama's term, Wikipedia had no "postal killings" recorded since Obama took office, and the list of "Mass Shootings In The United States By Year" had 47 recorded between 2009 and 2015. Many of the incidents recorded on Wikipedia's list of "Mass Shootings In The United States By Year" also appear on Mother Jones' list of mass shootings, resulting in a number much lower than 162.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, you will notice that each of the sources uses a different definition of mass shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you literally paste the Mother Jones data in Excel and chart it, you do see a slight increase in the total number of fatalities per year, but not enough to be statistically significant (and certainly nothing to suggest Obama is significantly worse), especially if you factor in that this has to be calculated per capita (population always grows).

       in NYC more people are being stabbed,
      </p>
      <p>
       Cops say they’ve put the cuffs on the knife-wielding lunatic in Brooklyn who wore an American flag bandanna as he sneaked up on and slashed a woman in the neck earlier this month.

       Six men were slashed, three of them by a machete-wielding maniac, during two separate incidents at restaurants in Queens and the Bronx early Sunday, police said.

       Interesting thought - the machete-wielders don't fall into the gun control propaganda. The guns are always used to cover the medication OD/withdrawal association. Harder to pull that card to deflect investigation with knives and cars and machetes. :(

       I thought the timing of the captured terrorist in Brussels was suspicous.The French people take to the street over the extended "State of emergency law".One week later the top fugitive terrorist is captured by police.

       They're still happening, just not bubbling up to national news because so many of them are happening, they're not interesting anymore...:/ Check your local rags and you'll see some...kind of wonder if more articles are mentioning the medication connection and that's why they're being kept quiet locally...but probably just that Trump's ridiculous antics make more money for networks right now than dead families.

       Why go on a spree killing now? No matter what flavour of crazy you are, there's a candidate who speaks for you. Crazy ass people typically go on killing sprees for ideological reasons and I can guarantee you we'll see some not long after the election. We'll see fed up kids who were sitting on the edge slip over, because they're mad about this, that or the other thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of very mentally broken people are pinning their hopes on the candidate of their choice and as soon as that candidate loses they'll start a rapid descent to the end. There's kids who fellate the idea of a socialist dream and will buckle under the pressure of society if Sanders loses. There's people who are convinced that blacks and arabs are here to covertly conquer the country; these people will snap if Trump loses.
      </p>
      <p>
       But not until then. A spree doesn't happen until all hope is lost and, for pretty much anyone, a presidential election always represents "hope".
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing is that media attention tends to fuel these and a spree (right now) would get less attention, which lowers the incentive.

        Operation Gladio
       </a>
       was/is a NATO-sponsored &amp; CIA-affiliated series of European(footnote 1) false-flag terrorist bombings, massacres, spree-shootings &amp; assassinations designed to shift European public opinion/political electorate toward right-wing, authoritarian governments, and to create a

        "Strategy of Tension"
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On November 22, 1990, the European Parliament passed a resolution condemning Gladio, requesting full investigations – which have yet to be done – and total dismantlement of the paramilitary structures [used by NATO to accomplish the false-flag attacks].
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1990 European resolution condemned "the existence for 40 years of a clandestine parallel intelligence" as well as "armed operations organization in several Member States of the Community", which "escaped all democratic controls and has been run by the secret services of the states concerned in collaboration with NATO." Denouncing the "danger that such clandestine network may have interfered illegally in the internal political affairs of Member States or may still do so."
       </p>
       <p>
        Examples of such alleged terrorist acts include the strategy of tension in Italy, the 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing, the 1972 Peteano Massacre, the 1978 kidnapping &amp; murder of Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro, the 1980 Munich Oktoberfest bomb blast, the 1982 Bologna Massacre, spree-shootings in supermarkets, assassinations of intelligence officials &amp; counterterrorism officials.

      </p>
      <p>
       (
       <em>
        footnote 1) These attacks occurred primarily during the 1960s through the 1980s, although there is no indication that Operation Gladio was ever discontinued, or was geopolitically limited to European soil.

        Then again, they say "April is the cruelest month."

       You should check out Mark Passio's stuff. Basically it's all about astro-theology and occult symbolism. Even if you don't believe in it, there are those in power who do.
      </p>
      <p>
       So where does April fit into all of this? Simple, March 20th/21st is the date of the vernal equinox. This is a big date for certain people and it sets off what Passio calls ''The season of sacrifice''. It's his theory that explains why so many bad things seem to happen within a one month time period beginning at the end of March.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also suspect that bad stuff is still happening, but the media coverage has been altered during the pre-election period. The reason for this is that they make money from high ratings. Non-stop coverage of a Presidential election brings in way higher ratings than whatever daily murders.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll finish this off with one more thought that some of you might find interesting. Consider the potential effect of all this election coverage, politician's ads etc. Is it possible that the change in the overall media message actually has a powerful enough effect that it can distract certain mentally unstable types from their own internal problems? It might be that all the election coverage gets these people outwardly focused... away from whatever mental issues they have. Maybe distracted enough that we can observe a significant reduction in random shit that normally happens the rest of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a theory. I know it's not really conspiracy-related. But it's a possibility offered for your consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       edt: Also just realized there's a flip side to this (proposed) effect. If election coverage can ''turn it off'', maybe regular programming (or certain types of media content) can make it worse? Definitely some conspiracy potential there.

       Or it starts getting warm, and the days longer. In Seattle, this is gang shooting season... I liken it to the spring rut for animals. Lots of young men, reclaiming their streets and street corner territory after a long dark winter chased them inside. The rhythms of spring compelling them to go out and claim space and impress women with their dominance....
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a seasonal thing, yes. But it doesn't have to be ritual or conspiracy, just nature.

       Yes! This is a fascinating possibility and it makes sense, big-time. I remember reading some of the online postings of a mass shooter, George Sodini, and he mentioned postponing his murder-suicide because he was interested in seeing the outcome of the 2008 election.

       Elections are media spectacles that can add novelty and excitement to the otherwise dreary lives of some of their spectators, especially if those spectators pick sides and spend their time looking forward to their preferred candidate's victory. I can definitely see how an individual on the edge could be distracted from his own troubles, and perhaps could be inspired and given much-needed motivation to continue living, by the entertaining Sanders and Trump phenomena and the other attention-grabbing political firestorms of the day.

       Thank you for informing me about Mark Passio. I've never heard of him before, but his stuff does seem very interesting and I'll be doing some reading on him now. These theories sound very plausible.

       They used many, many other drugs besides LSD. Plus they successfully made Manchurian Candidates that wouldn't even remember they killed using solely hypnosis. Also, MKUltra Subproject 119 was a lit. review of methods for "the remote electronic activation of the human organism."

       Yeah but under certain circumstances it's been used to essentially brainwash people when combined with other things like torture. It's effective at 'wiping' people's minds which then allows the persons brain to be reprogrammed. That's the idea at least.

       MKUltra never really ended. The acronym may have changed but the experiments continued.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Although the CIA insists that MKUltra-type experiments have been abandoned, some CIA observers say there is little reason to believe it does not continue today under a different set of acronyms.[50] Victor Marchetti, author and 14-year CIA veteran, stated in various interviews that the CIA routinely conducted disinformation campaigns and that CIA mind control research continued. In a 1977 interview, Marchetti specifically called the CIA claim that MKUltra was abandoned a "cover story."[90][91]

       Are we talking about real mass shootings, or reality show mass shootings? Real mass shootings are remaining relatively consistent, but those were never really reported on in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the typical reality show shootings(i.e., skinny, autistic white kids), will come back into full swing after the election when there will be a new push of brainwashing/propaganda.

       Allegedly there are "hundreds of mass shootings per year".  I always find that claim hilarious.  Where are all of these hundreds of shootings in the news media?  All we ever hear about are the obvious psy-ops.

       The mass shootings never stop, they just only get reported when its a slow news day or its a school with a high body count. Seriously look in to how many school shootings happened last year, and then think about how many you remember hearing about.

       They are waiting until a month or two before the election and there will be a BIG one, at a hospital, most likely a va hospital(dual benefit of pushing gun control and garnering sympathy for vets, to decrease the publics rationality even further) in the south eastern united states.

       Certainly. The public called BS on the last few FF's in record time(San Bernardino, Vester Flanigan) so the tptb are aware it will take something so charged with pathos that the publics critical faculties are short circuited.

       Kasim Reed is the first mayor of a US state to attend Bildeberg since Clinton. With the Malheur wildlife fiasco and the media pushing gun control and vaccine stories it's clear what they are prepping us for. So say a "domestic terrorist(really a patsy) get's a hold of a nasty strain of virus from the cdc, and than the dastardly villain(check out the etymology of "villain" sometime quite telling) unleashes a hail of bullets in a hospital(I think VA because america LOVES its veterans but could be any hospital) and in the process infects innocent people with a super strain, why than they can mandate vaccines(which will be fda approved and ready for sale within an hour) and take away our gun rights without a whimper.

       You're being silly if you're suggesting that people like Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, or Hillary Clinton are actually the ones mulling how to carry out a false flag and giving the orders. While they might know about it, the people orchestrating the events are not at all known to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       The run-up to the election provides more than enough material to keep the networks busy and ignore real issues. Given that the gun grab has been a failure, and people are clearly waking up to the fakery en masse, the strategy will be tweaked. But they will still find ways to interject hoaxes into the news when they need material, regardless of how busy the presidential candidates are.

       750 kids between 0-17 years old injured or killed this year from guns and we're only in March. Disgraceful amount of kids involved in one way or another in gun activity.

       So you're citing as your source a page that has been proved in the past to be rabidly anti-gun and has manipulated statistics in the past AND was caught doing so?

       Let me try to explain it to you. "BlackLivesMatter" is a Soros-funded front group ostensibly protesting White police officers shooting Black criminals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, BlackLivesMatter has essentially ignored that far greater issue of Black criminals shooting Black people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that there are some nominal discussions about black on black crime isn't really relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understand now?

       The reason the comment was made is because recently the mental gymnastics that have been going have lead some to the conclusion that because they believe racism is a social construct that black on black crime doesn't exist. They say that any crime committed by a black person to a black person is due to institutionalized racism and was caused by white people or white males to be exact.
