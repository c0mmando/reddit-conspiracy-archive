<p>I don&#39;t understand this comment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me try to explain it to you. &quot;BlackLivesMatter&quot; is a Soros-funded front group ostensibly protesting White police officers shooting Black criminals.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, BlackLivesMatter has essentially ignored that far greater issue of Black criminals shooting Black people.</p>

<p>The fact that there are some nominal discussions about black on black crime isn&#39;t really relevant.</p>

<p>Understand now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason the comment was made is because recently the mental gymnastics that have been going have lead some to the conclusion that because they believe racism is a social construct that black on black crime doesn&#39;t exist. They say that any crime committed by a black person to a black person is due to institutionalized racism and was caused by white people or white males to be exact.</p>

<p>At least that is how I follow the explanation I was given</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has some truth though. When you teach non  violence and you protest and get beat up. All that nonviolence you end up lashing out at your family. You get beat up all the time all day, becomes pretty difficult not to lash out domestically. Our choices and whom we are, are not formed in a vacuum. </p>

<p>Yes forming a theory of thought based on race and teaching it, institutionalizes people. </p>

<p>Being aware of facts does not. </p>

<p>Fact, you beat on people, they will tend to want to beat on other people. It&#39;s very difficult for a human being of any color to suffer violence and not become violent themselves. </p>

<p>Yes so its the chicken or the egg? Does it matter? Not really. Lets accept circumstances have an affect and go from there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t endorsing it but that&#39;s the train of thought they use to blame institutionalized racism and white people. They say since white people created institutionalized racism they are responsible for issues in minority communities. </p>

<p>Black on black crime is an issue in their communities imo finding a way to justify blaming another group of people for it doesn&#39;t solve the problem.</p>

<p>I read your original comment as not understanding why the original poster made a joke of that nature and was relaying the train of thought for the the claim that leads to that joke. It is a pretty ridiculous train of thought imo. </p>

<p>Their culture is more violent in regard to criminal statistics around the world. Granted that&#39;s an oversimplification of the issue which I don&#39;t have a lot of time to answer atm</p>

<p>This video explores the issue pretty well</p>

Do they still face social pressure to have lighter skin? Mostly yes. Does Africa&#39;s financial wealth match its natural resources? Not at all.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how many millionaires you think Africa should have. Overall, it has less than a trillion dollars, which is much less than the other continents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you click through and follow the sources you will see that graph is lying. Mother Jones had 25 mass shootings recorded during Obama&#39;s term, Wikipedia had no &quot;postal killings&quot; recorded since Obama took office, and the list of &quot;Mass Shootings In The United States By Year&quot; had 47 recorded between 2009 and 2015. Many of the incidents recorded on Wikipedia&#39;s list of &quot;Mass Shootings In The United States By Year&quot; also appear on Mother Jones&#39; list of mass shootings, resulting in a number much lower than 162.</p>

<p>Additionally, you will notice that each of the sources uses a different definition of mass shooting.</p>

<p>If you literally paste the Mother Jones data in Excel and chart it, you do see a slight increase in the total number of fatalities per year, but not enough to be statistically significant (and certainly nothing to suggest Obama is significantly worse), especially if you factor in that this has to be calculated per capita (population always grows). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why go on a spree killing now? No matter what flavour of crazy you are, there&#39;s a candidate who speaks for you. Crazy ass people typically go on killing sprees for ideological reasons and I can guarantee you we&#39;ll see some not long after the election. We&#39;ll see fed up kids who were sitting on the edge slip over, because they&#39;re mad about this, that or the other thing.</p>

<p>A lot of very mentally broken people are pinning their hopes on the candidate of their choice and as soon as that candidate loses they&#39;ll start a rapid descent to the end. There&#39;s kids who fellate the idea of a socialist dream and will buckle under the pressure of society if Sanders loses. There&#39;s people who are convinced that blacks and arabs are here to covertly conquer the country; these people will snap if Trump loses.</p>

<p>But not until then. A spree doesn&#39;t happen until all hope is lost and, for pretty much anyone, a presidential election always represents &quot;hope&quot;.</p>

<p>The other thing is that media attention tends to fuel these and a spree (right now) would get less attention, which lowers the incentive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On November 22, 1990, the European Parliament passed a resolution condemning Gladio, requesting full investigations – which have yet to be done – and total dismantlement of the paramilitary structures [used by NATO to accomplish the false-flag attacks].</p>

<p>The 1990 European resolution condemned &quot;the existence for 40 years of a clandestine parallel intelligence&quot; as well as &quot;armed operations organization in several Member States of the Community&quot;, which &quot;escaped all democratic controls and has been run by the secret services of the states concerned in collaboration with NATO.&quot; Denouncing the &quot;danger that such clandestine network may have interfered illegally in the internal political affairs of Member States or may still do so.&quot; </p>

<p>Examples of such alleged terrorist acts include the strategy of tension in Italy, the 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing, the 1972 Peteano Massacre, the 1978 kidnapping &amp; murder of Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro, the 1980 Munich Oktoberfest bomb blast, the 1982 Bologna Massacre, spree-shootings in supermarkets, assassinations of intelligence officials &amp; counterterrorism officials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gladio <a href="http://operation-gladio.net/operation-gladio">has been called</a> &quot;the best-kept, and most damaging, political-military secret since World War II&quot;.</p>

<p>(<em>footnote 1) These attacks occurred primarily during the 1960s through the 1980s, although there is no indication that Operation Gladio was ever discontinued, or was geopolitically limited to European soil.</em></p>

<p>You should check out Mark Passio&#39;s stuff. Basically it&#39;s all about astro-theology and occult symbolism. Even if you don&#39;t believe in it, there are those in power who do.</p>

<p>So where does April fit into all of this? Simple, March 20th/21st is the date of the vernal equinox. This is a big date for certain people and it sets off what Passio calls &#39;&#39;The season of sacrifice&#39;&#39;. It&#39;s his theory that explains why so many bad things seem to happen within a one month time period beginning at the end of March.</p>

<p>I also suspect that bad stuff is still happening, but the media coverage has been altered during the pre-election period. The reason for this is that they make money from high ratings. Non-stop coverage of a Presidential election brings in way higher ratings than whatever daily murders. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll finish this off with one more thought that some of you might find interesting. Consider the potential effect of all this election coverage, politician&#39;s ads etc. Is it possible that the change in the overall media message actually has a powerful enough effect that it can distract certain mentally unstable types from their own internal problems? It might be that all the election coverage gets these people outwardly focused... away from whatever mental issues they have. Maybe distracted enough that we can observe a significant reduction in random shit that normally happens the rest of the time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a theory. I know it&#39;s not really conspiracy-related. But it&#39;s a possibility offered for your consideration.</p>

<p>edt: Also just realized there&#39;s a flip side to this (proposed) effect. If election coverage can &#39;&#39;turn it off&#39;&#39;, maybe regular programming (or certain types of media content) can make it worse? Definitely some conspiracy potential there.</p>

<p>Yes! This is a fascinating possibility and it makes sense, big-time. I remember reading some of the online postings of a mass shooter, George Sodini, and he mentioned postponing his murder-suicide because he was interested in seeing the outcome of the 2008 election. </p>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=8258001&amp;amp;page=1">http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=8258001&amp;amp;page=1</a></p>

<p>Elections are media spectacles that can add novelty and excitement to the otherwise dreary lives of some of their spectators, especially if those spectators pick sides and spend their time looking forward to their preferred candidate&#39;s victory. I can definitely see how an individual on the edge could be distracted from his own troubles, and perhaps could be inspired and given much-needed motivation to continue living, by the entertaining Sanders and Trump phenomena and the other attention-grabbing political firestorms of the day.</p>

<p>Thank you for informing me about Mark Passio. I&#39;ve never heard of him before, but his stuff does seem very interesting and I&#39;ll be doing some reading on him now. These theories sound very plausible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the CIA insists that MKUltra-type experiments have been abandoned, some CIA observers say there is little reason to believe it does not continue today under a different set of acronyms.[50] Victor Marchetti, author and 14-year CIA veteran, stated in various interviews that the CIA routinely conducted disinformation campaigns and that CIA mind control research continued. In a 1977 interview, Marchetti specifically called the CIA claim that MKUltra was abandoned a &quot;cover story.&quot;[90][91]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly. The public called BS on the last few FF&#39;s in record time(San Bernardino, Vester Flanigan) so the tptb are aware it will take something so charged with pathos that the publics critical faculties are short circuited.</p>

<p>Kasim Reed is the first mayor of a US state to attend Bildeberg since Clinton. With the Malheur wildlife fiasco and the media pushing gun control and vaccine stories it&#39;s clear what they are prepping us for. So say a &quot;domestic terrorist(really a patsy) get&#39;s a hold of a nasty strain of virus from the cdc, and than the dastardly villain(check out the etymology of &quot;villain&quot; sometime quite telling) unleashes a hail of bullets in a hospital(I think VA because america LOVES its veterans but could be any hospital) and in the process infects innocent people with a super strain, why than they can mandate vaccines(which will be fda approved and ready for sale within an hour) and take away our gun rights without a whimper.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m no newcomer to conspiracy, I have my own forum and a decent sized, but choice readership that followed me from GLP and LOP after I had a total of four posts each with over 500,000 views deleted, because I predicted other things.</p>

While they might know about it, the people orchestrating the events are not at all known to the public.</p>

<p>The run-up to the election provides more than enough material to keep the networks busy and ignore real issues. Given that the gun grab has been a failure, and people are clearly waking up to the fakery en masse, the strategy will be tweaked. But they will still find ways to interject hoaxes into the news when they need material, regardless of how busy the presidential candidates are.</p>

<p>Let me try to explain it to you. &quot;BlackLivesMatter&quot; is a Soros-funded front group ostensibly protesting White police officers shooting Black criminals.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, BlackLivesMatter has essentially ignored that far greater issue of Black criminals shooting Black people.</p>

<p>The fact that there are some nominal discussions about black on black crime isn&#39;t really relevant.</p>

<p>Understand now?</p>
