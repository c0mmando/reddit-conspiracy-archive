<p>&quot;This bill establishes consequences if the Department of Defense (DOD) fails to obtain an audit with an unqualified opinion of its financial statements.&quot;</p>

<p>Ted Cruz seems like the odd man out here but overall sponsorship is mostly Republican, I suppose this falls within the purvey of government shrinking/accountability</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNuHRyip3iA">Bernie Sanders destroyed the Audit The Fed bill.</a>  That&#39;s like...all you need to know right there about who he <em>really</em> works for.  People talk about how he has some &quot;proven track record of working for the people!&quot;, but the real fact of the matter is that that&#39;s all nothing but complete bullshit because, as I&#39;ve said one other occasions, it really doesn&#39;t matter what kind of &quot;voting record&quot; you have of supposedly ”helping the people&quot; when Bernie himself knows that so long as he doesn&#39;t touch his <em>real</em> masters or threaten their fiat currency supplies, then it doesn&#39;t matter <em>what</em> it looks like you&#39;re doing out in the corporate/political world in terms of trying to make any “political change”.  You can look like you&#39;re &quot;one with the people!&quot; all fucking day long - exactly like &quot;Burny&quot; been trying to look like for a long time now - and yet keep your <em>real</em> intentions hidden.  And what are his real intentions?  Well, again, he&#39;s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4aroxd/the_problem_isnt_judaism_or_even_zionism_the/">Khazarian Zionist. 100%.</a>  He protects his masters.  He protects the fiat currency paradigm - the money-out-of-nothing paradigm that keeps the United States and the world absolutely shackled and enslaved.</p>

<p>He&#39;s playing the long game in all this, you see.  He&#39;s very intelligent about what he&#39;s doing, but, at the end of the day, so long as you don&#39;t touch the money changers&#39; supply, you never, ever, really change a thing in the system you work in.</p>

<p>You can &quot;support all the universal health care&quot; or whatever tf he talks about all day long.  So long as you don&#39;t touch the monetary status quo, you will change absolutely <em>nothing</em>.  And lemmie tell you:  Burny <em>knows</em> that.</p>

<p>So what does that mean?  It means that he <em>knows</em> he&#39;s not making any real changes.  He <em>knows</em> he&#39;s only <em>appearing</em> to be &quot;one with the people&quot;...only so he can get voted in.  And if that happens?</p>

<p>Sheeit.  You think America is &quot;The United States Of Israel&quot; <em>now?</em>  lol.  Just wait.  This place&#39;ll turn into one big ass Palestine if Burny gets elected.  We&#39;ll <em>all</em> be Palestinians to Khazarian rule then.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say that Clinton or any of the other fucking sock puppets are any better.  Abso-fucking-lutely not.  Clinton&#39;s an evil piece of shit herself.  100%.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just relating to &quot;Burny&quot; since this is what this OP&#39;s talking about.</p>
