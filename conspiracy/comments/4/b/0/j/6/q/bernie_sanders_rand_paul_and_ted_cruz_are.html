       Ted Cruz seems like the odd man out here but overall sponsorship is mostly Republican, I suppose this falls within the purvey of government shrinking/accountability

       I suspect it's because the Oil &amp; Gas industry need a bigger piece of the budget pie and the Defense budget is taking it.

       Lord knows Sanders would never do an actual "Audit the Fed" proposal.  Wouldn't want to threaten his masters, that's for sure.

        Bernie Sanders destroyed the Audit The Fed bill.
       </a>
       That's like...all you need to know right there about who he
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       works for.  People talk about how he has some "proven track record of working for the people!", but the real fact of the matter is that that's all nothing but complete bullshit because, as I've said one other occasions, it really doesn't matter what kind of "voting record" you have of supposedly ”helping the people" when Bernie himself knows that so long as he doesn't touch his
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       masters or threaten their fiat currency supplies, then it doesn't matter
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       it looks like you're doing out in the corporate/political world in terms of trying to make any “political change”.  You can look like you're "one with the people!" all fucking day long - exactly like "Burny" been trying to look like for a long time now - and yet keep your
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       intentions hidden.  And what are his real intentions?  Well, again, he's a
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4aroxd/the_problem_isnt_judaism_or_even_zionism_the/">
        Khazarian Zionist. 100%.
       </a>
       He protects his masters.  He protects the fiat currency paradigm - the money-out-of-nothing paradigm that keeps the United States and the world absolutely shackled and enslaved.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's playing the long game in all this, you see.  He's very intelligent about what he's doing, but, at the end of the day, so long as you don't touch the money changers' supply, you never, ever, really change a thing in the system you work in.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can "support all the universal health care" or whatever tf he talks about all day long.  So long as you don't touch the monetary status quo, you will change absolutely
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       .  And lemmie tell you:  Burny
       <em>
        knows
       </em>
       that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does that mean?  It means that he
       <em>
        knows
       </em>
       he's not making any real changes.  He
       <em>
        knows
       </em>
       he's only
       <em>
        appearing
       </em>
       to be "one with the people"...only so he can get voted in.  And if that happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheeit.  You think America is "The United States Of Israel"
       <em>
        now?
       </em>
       lol.  Just wait.  This place'll turn into one big ass Palestine if Burny gets elected.  We'll
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       be Palestinians to Khazarian rule then.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't to say that Clinton or any of the other fucking sock puppets are any better.  Abso-fucking-lutely not.  Clinton's an evil piece of shit herself.  100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just relating to "Burny" since this is what this OP's talking about.
