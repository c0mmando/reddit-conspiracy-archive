       A CEO of a fast-food company is causing a stir on social media after claiming that he wants to create a fully automated restaurant.
      </p>
      <p>
       “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person,” Carl’s Jr. CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider.
      </p>
      <p>
       Puzder says the automated restaurant would be cheaper since he wouldn’t have to worry about rising minimum wage.
      </p>
      <p>
       “If you’re making labor more expensive, and automation less expensive- this is not rocket science,” Puzder said.
      </p>
      <p>
       “They’re always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there’s never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case,” says Puzder of swapping employees for machines. “Millennials like not seeing people. I’ve been inside restaurants where we’ve installed ordering kiosks… and I’ve actually seen young people waiting in line to use the kiosk where there’s a person standing behind the counter, waiting on nobody.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say, many customers were less than pleased with the idea.

       Quick economics lesson. When the price of a good...in this case units of labor... goes up, two things happen. One: more sellers enter the market,  and Two: buyers will purchase less.
      </p>
      <p>
       So demanding $15 an hour means that more people will be competing for less jobs as it gets cheaper to automate than employ a human. Employers will start demanding applicants have more education and experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in a nutshell, that's why raising the minimum wage will actually
       <em>
        hurt
       </em>
       the working poor. The laws of economics don't care about fairness.

      <p>
       To be fair, this is a lesson in right-wing economic dogma. Often confused in the US with "economics." But there is a whole world out there that undermines your argument. And the logical conclusion of your argument is that mass slavery is the most economical model. Maybe mass slavery would be best for the capitalists, but it's certainly not best for the population as a whole.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Maybe, maybe not. Outside of your simplistic example, in the real world, there are thousands of other factors that drive business decisions. Decisions in the real world are not made in a laboratory with controlled conditions as your example would imply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, it's clear that "buyers purchasing less" of something can be a good thing. If we paid labor what they do in the 3rd world, companies could hire 10 or 20 times as many employees. But those employees would be lucky to afford a pair of shoes, or shelter with roof over their heads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you so worship your simplistic market principles that you'd like to see the conditions found in Haiti or Bangladesh here in the USA? Because if we followed your comic-book economics, that's what we would do.
      </p>

      <p>
       Sure. And that's a good thing, ultimately. Economic development leads to displacement. When the automobile was invented, it became difficult to find work making horseshoes. When industrial farming was developed, we didn't need to have 50% or 75% of our population working in agriculture. This caused some displacement, but all that freed labor could move on to more meaningful and complex work. Ultimately this is how human civilization advances.
      </p>
      <p>
       If society is ready to stop paying people poverty wages to serve fast food, so be it. Let the machines do it. And let those workers find something else to do that is worth $15 / hour.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Employers will start demanding applicants have more education and experience.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is a factor you are overlooking. Employers can also take less profit. We've rigged the economy over the last 40 years to maximize profit for business owners. If we start to balance things out again, paying workers fair wages, equilibrium will likely first be found in reduction of profits. Prices are determined by supply and demand - not labor costs. Increasing labor costs have no effect on the demand for goods, or the supply of goods. Therefore, to remain competitive, corporations will have to reduce their profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       This should be easy. Corporate profits and the share of the economy taken by the wealthy are at all time highs. They have hoarded almost all the national wealth. It won't hurt for them to spend a little more on labor.
      </p>

       Again, you're reciting

       not economics.

       Ok...you raise some very good points here. I
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       argue those points, but I have to ask you to stipulate two points before I do...otherwise we will get nowhere
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         I'm not parroting Fox News. In fact, i couldn't, since I don't watch television... I cut the cable two years ago (and it was one of the best decisions I ever made). My assertions come directly from my college econ textbook.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We're talking about economics in the US...We have a different situation than Haiti or Bangladesh, so thera's really no use in comparing apples and oranges.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In return, I will stipulate that I am
       <strong>
        NOT

      <p>
       The cost benefit of slavery is actually a completely different topic,and bringing it up was kind of a strawman argument. We already have laws preventing worker abuse,  we're talking about
       <em>
        raising

       minimum wage...which I'm not against. If you look at my other comments in this thread, you will see that.

      <p>
       Yes, there are. So many in fact that it would be impossible to discuss it all at anything less than a doctorate level. That's why economists have a thing called
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus">
        Ceteris Paribus
       </a>
       .. (please don't think I'm talking down to you if you're already familiar with the term. I'm replying to you,but also writing for the larger audience.) where they discuss topics as though only one factor changed, and everything else stays the same. But if you make a change in one factor of production, it affects your overall bottom line.  Therefore, if you increase the cost of labor, in the end profits suffer.

      <p>
       They could, but they wouldn't. The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility says that at some point, adding one more factor of production...like another employee... no longer increases productivity. For example, at McDonalds... if the restaurant is fully staffed at 8 people,  the 9th person they hire can't make them produce hamburgers any faster, since all the workstations are occupied. The 10th person actually gets in the way and decreases production. Again Econ 101.

       I was actually trying to avoid this, but you opened that can of worms...

      <p>
       Minimum-wage jobs are
       <em>
        entry-level
       </em>
       They should be used by high-school kids to get some work experience before college...not as a "living wage" to support a family. If you're trying to support a family working at Mickey D's, you should probably examine your life choices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, i didn't want to work for minimum wage, so I went to college. With the gov't financial aid that was available, I didn't even have to touch my G.I. Bill. There is no excuse for not going to school.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is a factor you are overlooking. Employers can also take less profit.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "Employers" really can't. You're making the mistake of listening to the left-wing dogma about the "evil" corporations. Remember that corporations are mostly owned by stockholders, who the board has to answer to. If the company takes a loss in profits, stock prices go down. Stock prices go down, stockholders sell. Stockholders sell, stock prices fall farther. These stockholders aren't all rich people. If you have a 401k, or mutual fund, you are a stockholder.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the "Corporations can reduce their profits" argument ignores the fact that
       <em>
        Most people in America don't work for corporations!
       </em>
       Most Americans work for small-to-medium size business. I personally have a friend who owns a pizza-and-wings restaurant. His profit margin is razor-thin. I asked him what he was going to do when the minimum wage went to $15. He said that he'd already done the math...if he had to pay $15 an hour,  he would have to lay people off and work more hours himself. See, because of economies of scale, the corporate pizza companies can already.
 sell pizzas cheaper than he can. If he has to pay more for labor, he has to either cut employees or raise prices. (and that assumes that his food costs don't go up because his suppliers' labor costs go up) So, it
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       hurt him to pay more for labor.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Increasing labor costs have no effect on the demand for goods
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You're right about that...to a point
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        , or the supply of goods.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You're wrong about  that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Increasing labor costs won't have an effect on
       <em>
        inelastic
       </em>
       goods... goods that aren't effected by price changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Labor cost does have an effect on supply. If companies are forced out of the market by labor costs,  supply goes down.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Therefore, to remain competitive, corporations will have to reduce their profits
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, no they really can't, and we're not just talking about corporations here.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This should be easy. Corporate profits and the share of the economy taken by the wealthy are at all time highs. They have hoarded almost all the national wealth. It won't hurt for them to spend a little more on labor
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now you're talking about fairness. Wouldn't it be nice if life were fair?

       No matter how much automation there is, just remember one thing. At the top of the heap, there's still going to be a few humans taking in all those extra profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism has always been about a few people "utilizing" the efforts of many others to make more money than they ever could by themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past, this equation has worked out because it always meant jobs for those other people... even if the working conditions sucked and the pay was minimal.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what happens when the people at the top can exploit the labor of machines? What happens when capitalism no longer provides even low paying, tedious jobs?
      </p>
      <p>
       The crucial question is really this... What do the people making increased profits (through automation) do with those profits? This is an important question. Why? Because this is where the answer lies as to where all the newer better jobs are supposed to come from.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not all suddenly going to be making the robots or become robot repairmen. So, for all those fast food workers, truck and cab drivers driver, checkout girls etc. the question remains.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where do they go for employment after their job has been automated?
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone has a convincing answer for this, I'm all ears.

       Problem with this logic is that if you substitute jobs for automation you lose a fraction of your customers because most customers are employees.

Because money inflates we need to inflate wage along with it's growth to maintain value.
