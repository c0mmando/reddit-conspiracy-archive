       Never again will the mainstream media be beleived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never again will the two parties be beleived.
      </p>
      <p>
       A generation of US citizens will walk around for the rest of their live's knowing they live with a fundemental lie of government representation .
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no more "conspiracy theorists" because the conspiracy theories have all been made open for all to see.  There are no disbeleivers left. There is only everyone and those paid or incentivized to spread false disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea how it will affect the future but I am certain it will greatly affect it in one or more ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I will affect work ethic, politics, cooperation, unity, and even entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it is hard to exist with the knowledge you don't really have control over your broad direction ...especially for a people who have been brought up beleiving they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have faith it will bring people together and they will stop allowing themselves to be divided by baited issues danggled by the establishment. At least I hope so.

       This is going to sound harsh, but the elderly generation dying off is going to do wonders for our future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of citizens who still believe these lies and worship the MSM are the elderly, and they are going to defend their government to the grave (literally).
      </p>
      <p>
       In 30 years the
       <em>
        vast
       </em>
       majority of citizens will hate their government, and that is when real change will happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I feel like I need to clarify that I really love the elderly, they are great people at heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're just too blind to see what is really going on.

       I am constantly surprised by the ability of our fellow americans to ignore what is important, while embracing pop culture and utter bullshit.  Not to argue with you, but I doubt many have had the epiphany you think they have had, a percentage, sure.  "Panem et circenses" is what the PTB serve up, so people don't go and get uppity, and it's very effective.

       Well the good news is you don't really have to wake up everyone. Just enough to hit critical mass then the rest of the lemmings tend to follow the herd. That's what they are attempting to do to Trump right now is try to start a movement against him but it's failed thus far.
