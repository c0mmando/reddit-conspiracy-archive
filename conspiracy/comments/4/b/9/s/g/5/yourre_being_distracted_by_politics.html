<p>It&#39;s distracting a lot of good people from real issues that immediately affect the lives of all people.</p>

<p>Posts about GMOs in our food supply, lead and other toxins in our drinking water, and chemicals in the air we breath, are being passed up and overlooked because of meaningless politics over political puppets.</p>

<p>No matter where you are on the environmental debate spectrum. It&#39;s obvious that environment is more important in our lives than politics is. No matter who&#39;s in office we still will have the same environmental problems. In my opinion politics is secondary to my health. I imagine it&#39;s that way for a lot of us.</p>

<p>My hope is we can post more about real problems and circumvent the political smokescreen blocking us from correcting the results of corruption.</p>

<p>If we solve the toxicity in our food, water and air it&#39;s irrelevant who&#39;s in office. </p>

<p>Working within the system hasn&#39;t worked ever. Politics is meant as another source to distract us from solving these real problems ourselves. They are the ones who poison the world, so that you need to buy your life from them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The political spectrum inherently comes with divides. The solution multiplier is to directly work to remediate pollution and its sources.</p>

<p>We can argue all day about amounts of pollution, this is politics, but the fact remains that the pollution is there until we do something about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for being aggressive. I&#39;m trying to be succinct.</p>

<p>Politicians are supposedly representing us. The truth is they represent corporate interests.</p>

<p>As a work around for this negative feed back loop of politics and pollution. We must take direct action against the toxification of our environment.</p>

<p>This looks like building an alternative to industrial living like one poster here has. Another is maintaining a predominately vegan diet. Grow your own vegetables, not matter how trivial the volume might feel. Collect rain water then filter and purify it, or filter municipal water. Create garden plots or natural areas. If we do these things only for ourselves we all still win.</p>

<p>The less energy, electricity or fuel you use the better obviously. </p>

<p>If you want to go farther organize the cleaning of natural areas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand how this might seem myopic. Obviously if it gets to the point of natural rights being stripped the focus should go to war, but still not to politics. It&#39;s not myopic, it&#39;s systematic solution creation. Clean environment is step one.</p>

<p>If we have our basic needs met we will better to be able to resist this kind of horror. We generally lack infrastructure independent of the government and large corporations. If we build alternatives we take some of their power away and comes back to us.</p>

<p>Environmentalism creates truly healthy and beneficial infrastructure.</p>

<p>If the people have their needs met it&#39;s increasingly difficult for governments to justify the need, or build support for, mass imprisonment to the remaining free citizens or the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get anything shadow banned.</p>

<p>I agree with paragraph two. This is precisely why we must focus on cleaning, or keeping clean, the food, water and air in areas we spend a lot of time in. It would defiantly help to produce some of your own electricity too.</p>

<p>Economy is a mess because it&#39;s mostly imaginary at this point. Our economy has almost created an alternate reality for many people.</p>

<p>Religion was a main excuse to go to war. The vengeance inspired by religious wars certainly helps wars continue. But many people would sadly simply follow something else if there wasn&#39;t religion.</p>

<p>There are sadly many people who do terrible things often, which is why it&#39;s increasingly important for people to do good.</p>

<p>The illusion of race like religion has perpetuated many wars.</p>

<p>All you need to know about global warming is that it is happening for some reason. If you keep your food, water and air clean then global warming will probably settle it self out. Again does not hurt to generate your own electricity.</p>

<p>This idea of the mark of the beast is very intriguing. I feel like cellphones are it. It could have been, is, fiat currency too. Or it could be genetic manipulation.</p>

<p>I think most people have faith or hope, so were all religious, or spiritual, to some degree.</p>

<p>Too bad much of Tesla&#39;s work is hidden or destroyed. We could be so much further along technologically. We would probably also have less social struggle. His free energy devices are sorely needed in our era.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry you won&#39;t get shadowbanned for that.  I openly encourage people to join petitions to legalize psilocybin mushrooms and cannabis--and have a full justification for it that actually turns the law on its own head by using the government&#39;s own sources to contradict itself.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s powerful, they probably think it&#39;s laughable.  Why?  Because they&#39;re a bag of dicks.  Or putting it a better way, they are authoritarian bullies who have no respect for cogent argument, consisency, ethics, morals or dogma; or even principle.  If they did, by their own standards there would be no drug war--all would be permitted.</p>

<p>I also post inflammatory stuff about how the medical industry doesn&#39;t know what the fuck they are doing.  Pharma and Nestle (swiss companies generally) are purposefully putting poison in our food (probably because they are a tiny mountainbound country with an increasing population and no where to put their trash so they package it up in their food and ship it to us.... biolaundering is a new term I&#39;m using for exporting your trash into food.</p>

<p>I also post about how the CIA is runnign both sides of the drug war and it&#39;s provable now and nobody cares (well, <em>we</em> care here... I consider everyone outside of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to be a big fat nobody--lol)</p>

<p>There still is general peace in the US that allows us to address environmental problems. If we have our basic needs meet, clean environment, that will help to defuse political turmoil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is that those in power only stay in power precisely because of what they&#39;re doing to the environment. Obama talks about climate change and pollution and then hops in his big dirty plane to fly over. We&#39;re abusing our relationship with the KSA and allowing a growth of extremism for oil. China and India are opening new power plants every two weeks. Even if in the US all our energy was solar, wind, water etc...., it won&#39;t be enough. And what right do we have to tell sovereign nations like China and India not to do what they&#39;re doing re: environment? Nothing.

    <div class="md"><p>So we must directly remediate what they are doing and build solutions.</p>

<p>If each person has a windmill, solar panels, and hydro power if possible at their homes and work it&#39;s entirely feasible for green energy to slowly replace conventional chemical energy sources.</p>

<p>The problem is people are corralled into thinking that a centralized the energy model is best because it&#39;s what we have had in the past. Centralized models are more profitable for business. The truth is decentralization of the energy grid has always been better for end users.</p>

<p>No power huge outages, no huge electric bill, and more energy per dollar spent in the long run. These are the reasons decentralized green energy will inevitably take over.</p>

<p>If centralized energy systems adopt green energy generation methods along with all households and businesses green energy is absolutely viable. This does not happen if people don&#39;t start solving this problem for themselves.</p>

<p>There will always be competition for oil because it makes many other useful things beyond fuel. If we take away the attractiveness of generating electricity from chemical sources we take away a large incentive and excuse to go to war.</p>

<p>What does &quot;responsibility&quot; mean for politicians fines, jail time, or simply just loosing office? The last in the majority of cases. It&#39;s especially not responsibility if politicians then go on to work in the top tier of corporations, making more money than they could in politics, and gaining even further political influence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the teachings of Christ,  humanity is comprised of the spiritually Living and the spiritually Dead. The Dead are products of this world, subject to its rules, obedient to its standards. They sacrifice spiritual priorities for personal and material pursuits. Meanwhile, the Living are in this world but not of it, they contain an inner quality that transcends worldly factors. We become more one or the other depending on where we place our priorities.</p>

<p>The role of Christ is not to unify the World but to bring total division between the Living and the Dead, not to bring peace but initiate total war between the World and the Kingdom.

<p>Ignore nothing; please do not preach tunnel vision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. It also concerns me that you read this as reductionist.</p>

<p>There is a strong encouragement to be connected to the grid. We don&#39;t have to be connected to the grid. There is also no way for them to know you&#39;re off the grid if you&#39;re truly off the grid.</p>

<p>&quot;Tunnel vision,&quot; &quot;ignoring,&quot; hold on. What I&#39;m asking is that we look at the biggest picture possible, environment. It&#39;s the exact opposite of ignoring and tunnel vision. Politics is an unnecessary, however relevant, middle man between us and changing our environment.</p>

<p>What information are people ignoring exactly? Everyone who posts in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> agrees politics are a joke and a distraction, we ultimately have no control over who is &#39;elected.&#39; Do you really think discussing the latest joke out of these puppets mouths is going to better our lives? We know everything is completely backwards.</p>

<p>The most beneficial thing we can discuss is how to fix our food, water and air. Hence our environment.</p>

<p>We can all get distracted, it&#39;s part of the psyop. Spamming of politics in conspiracy forums is a way the greater psyop self perpetuates. Politics is important sure, but it&#39;s not good for us to give it as much attention as we are. It&#39;s ultimately like watching a grand chess game between elitists. It&#39;s entertainment, not something we actually participate in. You&#39;re votes, petitions, FOIA requests, and rants on the internet don&#39;t matter. TPTB will do what they like, they are in it for them selves. This is why we need to fix our sources of food and water, and clean our air. Because &#39;they&#39; won&#39;t, &#39;we&#39; must.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I understand that your core argument is that if we don&#39;t fix things, no one will. That is a great mentality to have, and to share, but we cannot forget that we can&#39;t fix that which we have no control over. </p>

<p>The political system is most definitely broken. But it is still extremely important. In fact, that&#39;s <em>precisely</em> why. It doesn&#39;t matter how much lobbying your city&#39;s new proposed Big Shitty Riverfront Factory does if the citizens are vigilant and well-informed about the public health hazards. If too much red tape is created for them, Big Shitty Riverfront Factory Inc moves on to scout a different city with more malleable public opinion. This happens all the time.</p>

<p>This sort of tangible result does not come about from a few people tying themselves to trees. It comes from a whole buttload of people yelling nonstop at their local government to drop the contract. And yelling in the correct way that government should be yelled at if they are to be expected to do anything about it. </p>

<p>If you have a shitty bicycle, and it is barely functional, it will still probably be faster for you to ride it to work every day than to walk there. After you get a feel for which aspects of the bicycle are faulty, it becomes easier to ride, because you can avoid those hard left turns that invariably lock the brakes and put you into a ditch. You crash way less when you start paying closer attention to it.</p>

<p>The government is like an old shitty unrepairable bicycle. It sucks but it still beats walking; it&#39;s all that you have and you don&#39;t have to like it to get it to take you where you want to go. Make an effort to understand it. </p>

<p>I want to know how you think you can solve something like clean water, or a sustainable food source for a community, without involving the government in some way. That may wrongly come off as hostile, but I am always open to the possibility that someone knows something I don&#39;t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do have control though. There are millions of us, just in the US, and a few thousand of them world wide.</p>

<p>The octopus has many arms but you can make yourself look like a lot less of an attractive lunch.</p>

<p>Effective protests use all available methods. Not just one. With out the &#39;spot light&#39; protesters people don&#39;t pay attention, with out bureaucratic protesters policy practice and law don&#39;t change. This situation is when politics are not a distraction.</p>

<p>Sure, politics isn&#39;t irrelevant. In increasingly many cases were not leaning how it works though, we&#39;re just learning about sensationalism of things politicians say. This is the distraction. Also how it works on paper is very different from practice. In practice it&#39;s nearly 100% corrupt and the law is irrelevant.</p>

<p>If you grow your own food it&#39;s many times better quality than what can be found in supermarkets. If you have water filtration and purification systems then you are safe from water pollution. If you make your own electricity and create green planter spaces your cleaning the air. Once you have these things go out and help others set themselves up with your labor or your resources. Once your community does this, you&#39;re all healthy as can be.</p>

<p>None of that requires government to step in.</p>

<p>At that point it&#39;s even easier to lobby government support because you have created the example of the infrastructure they should be following.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the thing though if your environment is clean you will be healthy. Politics defiantly plays a role in our health, but the largest impact rests on being able to control the cleanliness and health of our environment.</p>

<p>There are also easy ways to circumvent the health care act. The penalty for not having insurance is also cheaper than insurance. So really all they did is raise taxes.</p>

<p>Crummy, but we can have a much larger say in our health by actively keeping the environment clean. By at the very least doing one or more of the following: filtering your water, growing some of your food, produce your own electricity, creating green spaces, commute less or use less electricity we can make ourselves and our environments cleaner and healthier.</p>
