        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have very surprisingly seen almost no posts about this on this subreddit so I feel compelled to add one. He&#39;s literally THE reddit candidate supports all the values redditors generally hold sacred going against basically the anti-christs of reddit and yet the top comments on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> posts are very very often anti-sanders. What do you think is going on? </p>

<p>Edit: 2 very very anti-sanders people commenting here, both with 10 month old accounts who both use arguments completely devoid of logic to attack him constantly(and one of them called the other &quot;apolitical&quot; to defend him which is absolutely insanely ridiculous if you spend a couple minutes reading his comment history). Anyone else notice this correlation?</p>

<p>Edit 2: I 100% believe there is an organized anti-sanders group constantly posting comments and vote brigading, the shit I&#39;m reading and the upvotes/downvotes on certain posts is just to ridiculous for anything else to be true. I suspect they have a much easier time manipulating comment votes than reddit posts since you&#39;l notice the content in most upvoted reddit posts is very very pro-sanders while the top comments in many of them are very very anti-sanders(with many simple non-offensive pro-Sanders comments at -30). </p>

<p>Edit 3: Just look at how many ridiculously illogical anti-Bernie comments have been posted in this thread already, how many upvotes they are getting, how many downvotes posts responding to them are getting, does this seem normal to any of you? Conspiracy happening right here on r/conspiracy!</p>

<p>Edit 4: Apology to the mods since this post is now breaking rule #2 since i&#39;m accusing Hillary supporters of vote brigading but really the reality is it&#39;s not a rule the mods could tell was being broken or even the admins if very basic precautions were taken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet they like Medicare and Social Security for grandma, unemployment and disability for their relatives and themselves, roads that are well paved to drive their safety regulation compliant cars on, clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, fire department on call, police to keep them safe, a strong military to keep them safe, etc.  They are morons that don&#39;t know what socialism is.  </p>

<p>It is the opposite of capitalism, fine.  OOOHHH  Spooky!  Capitalism is <em>privately owned</em> delivery of goods and/or services.  It needs to be profitable, or else it fails, incentivizing efficient operation.  Then the owners of these organizations can use their profits to invest in creating more and new goods and/or services.  It&#39;s a great system, but imperfect.  By its nature it leads toward economic inequality.  We don&#39;t use it for everything, because some things we want don&#39;t work very well or at all if we rely on profit seeking individuals to do them.</p>

<p>Socialism is when we have government deliver goods and/or services.  They don&#39;t have the profit motive to keep them in balance.  They take in tax revenue and/or fees and spend it on the goods and/or services.  This can result in inefficient systems.  So we avoid using this means for most things we want and need.  Yet, we don&#39;t want our police and military to be privately owned mercenaries, because then they become the henchmen of local rich people.  We don&#39;t want our fire protection services to be privately owned, or many people won&#39;t be offered the service, due to an inability to pay for the service or insurance, and then other people&#39;s houses would burn down.  We don&#39;t want to be stopped on every stretch of road and asked to pay tolls for using them.  We don&#39;t want elderly people to go without health care and housing.  We don&#39;t want factory owners to decide which chemicals they can dispose of in the air or water, because it&#39;s profitable to poison the environment.</p>

<p>We have been sold that socialism is our enemy, with authoritarian undertones, because what we really fear is authoritarianism.  Rampant socialism is unacceptable to people, so they resist it, and then governments crack down on them, authoritarianism.  Of course, we don&#39;t want that, authoritarian behavior.  Democracy is the opposite of authoritarianism, and tolerance of dissent and discussion of opposing viewpoints keeps this ridiculous scenario in check.  There is a good reason to worry about out of control government that does not have the consent of the governed, but this fear of socialism is used as a tool.</p>

<p>The group that benefits the most from capitalist arrangements and the least from socialist ones is the rich, the class that owns organizations of production of goods and/or services.  They fear socialism eating into their profits, increasing their taxes, or at worst, confiscating their organizations.  They don&#39;t value protecting the comparatively economically weak with regulations and public services, because they can easily move away from pollution and buy all of the comparatively better services they want with their money.  Some of them even imagine that everyone could do this if they just worked harder.  </p>

<p>So, they have used examples of out of control authoritarian socialist countries to create a fear of all things socialist.  This helps them keep us from uniting to demand universal health care and affordable higher education.  This keeps taxes on the rich low and education of the <del>proletariat</del> working class low.  Educated people can articulate the details and demands of their class&#39; economic self-interests, the working class.  The rich want a working class people to support low taxes on the rich, low regulations, and minimal government activity, for maximum profits for themselves.  This is, was and perhaps always will be the case.  It&#39;s just a conflict of economic self-interests between owners and workers.  We see this conflict of economic self-interests play out between the left and the right in pretty much every country.  Due to being fewer in number, the rich rely on deception to achieve policies that favor them in democracies.  In <em>authoritarian</em> <strong><em>capitalist</em></strong> countries, they just attack political activists using the government, just like the authoritarian socialists did in the countries we were sold are prime examples of socialism.  </p>

<p>European countries are the best examples of democratic socialism to date.  They are not authoritarian hell holes.  They have higher taxes and higher government services.  Getting medical care doesn&#39;t bankrupt them, but they also have less stuff than people in the USA do.  There are trade offs.  Being able to buy a bunch of LCD TV screens does not replace the need for surgery or the benefits of education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While there is truth in your post, you oversimplify things.<br/>
Not all regulations are intended to or function to form monopolies.  Some do and they should be changed.  Regulations against municipal broadband come to mind, but there are others.</p>

<p>Limited democratic socialism works, <em>right now</em>, in Europe.  It&#39;s not pie in the sky.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders is giving the government more money to benefit corrupt special interests by cutting insurance companies out of the market through Medicare for All?  He&#39;s benefiting special interests by offering affordable college?  Which corrupt special interest groups pouring money into DC campaigns gain from these things?  The teacher&#39;s unions?  Please.  This stuff isn&#39;t magical, it&#39;s stuff that European countries and others have been doing for decades.  We&#39;re richer than them, why can&#39;t we do it?  Here&#39;s why..</p>

<p>The answer is to stop thinking in absolutes and start thinking about self-interests.  <em>Everyone</em> has self-interests.  Owners and workers have competing self-interests.  Workers want higher wages, better benefits, social safety nets, good environmental and safety regulations for <del>consumers</del> customers, workers and residents.  Owners want higher profits which are increased by lower wages, poorer benefits, lower taxes through reduced social safety net programs, and more lax environmental and safety regulations for customers, workers and residents.  Some would say that rich people want a clean environment too, and they do, but they can just pollute the environment around their businesses and live in environments that are still clean.  </p>

<p>On any level, these self-interests compete, local, state and federal.  We have to be aware of our self-interests as well as those of our employers and <em>balance</em> them to have the most efficient economy at raising everyone&#39;s quality of life.  As of now there is plenty of effective propaganda protecting the self-interests of owners affecting the American perspective.  We support policies that benefit them as a result while others around the world shake their heads in disbelief.  How could they be so stupid, they think.  This is why.  The best example of this is the advertising blitz that occurs whenever we consider universal health care.  It scares people that there will be long waiting periods, poorer care and fewer choices and it works every time on enough people to derail such efforts.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Bernie Sanders is giving the government more money to benefit corrupt special interests by cutting insurance companies out of the market through Medicare for All? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea of a government run single payer system is a TERRIBLE idea,  which will drastically cut the quality of health care.  Perfect example of this is Canada.  There continues to be record numbers of Canadians who travel abroad to be treated.  In 2014, there were <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/number-of-canadian-patients-travelling-abroad-for-treatment-increased-by-25-study-finds">53,000 Canadians who traveled abroad to receive treatment</a>. If socialized medicine was really such a great thing and worked,  there&#39;d be no reason for these people to travel abroad to receive treatment. </p>

<p>A survey conducted by The Health Council of Canada in 2011 found that only 40% of of the 3,000 patients surveyed were either satisfied,  or very satisfied with the care they received.  </p>

<p>The quality of care (or lack thereof) in socialized medicine isn&#39;t limited to Canada either.  A report released in October by Britain’s health regulator found that a stunning 20 percent of hospitals were failing to provide the minimum standard of care legally required for elderly patients.</p>

<p>As part of the study, inspectors dropped by dozens of hospitals unannounced. They found patients shouting or banging on bedrails desperately trying to get the attention of a nurse. At one hospital, <strong>inspectors identified bed-ridden patients that hadn’t been given water for over 10 hours.</strong></p>

<p>Think about how the Obama administration has weaponized the IRS and gone after his political enemies, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s such a stretch to think that government run Healthcare could be used in the same manner at some point.  </p>

<p>If the government takes over Healthcare completely,  and doctors essentially become government workers who are a paid exactly the same, which will be significantly lower then their current salaries,  the quality (and likely the quantity) of doctors will drastically decrease. </p>

<p>If you want to know how socialized medicine will ultimately end, you don&#39;t need to look any further then Medicare,  which is currently expected to be insolvent by the year 2030. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s benefiting special interests by offering affordable college? Which corrupt special interest groups pouring money into DC campaigns gain from these things? The teacher&#39;s unions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  The teacher&#39;s unions are a significant lobby actually.  If you give college free to everyone,  you&#39;re going to have a massive increase in the number of teachers, and the teachers union, and their lobbyists will also increase significantly as well.  There&#39;s no doubt that college currently as become so expensive,  that many who want to go to college simply can&#39;t, and those who can,  end up with crippling amounts of college debt. But WHY has college become so expensive though?  This is what really angers me about Bernie Sanders&#39;s plan to make college &quot;free&quot; for everyone.  Instead of actually addressing the reason why college has become so unaffordable,  he simply wants to continue with the broken system and expand it further.  </p>

<p>First off,  there&#39;s no such thing as free college.  It&#39;s still going to be just as expensive as it is today,  and most likely even increase in cost. So instead of making college more affordable,  he&#39;s simply going to make the working middle class pay for it instead.  </p>

<p>But I digress. Do you know the what the main reason for college tuition skyrocketing even is?   According to both the liberal <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/the-real-reason-college-tuition-costs-so-much.html?referer=&amp;amp;_r=0">New York Times</a> as well as the conservative outlet <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/pascalemmanuelgobry/2013/05/09/the-reason-why-college-is-so-expensive-is-actually-dead-obvious/#4e953c1b7e2f">Forbes</a> the reason is the increase in federal government subsidies that have caused the problem to begin with!   So again,  Bernie&#39;s only solution is to exasperate the situation even more,  by massively increasing federal subsidies!  </p>

<p>Did you know that US colleges that don’t accept Federal loans have tuition roughly half of their similarly-ranked peers?  In fact some schools have stated they will refuse Federal aid in order to keep costs low.</p>

<p>Just another example of Bernie feeding the beast more, expanding and growing an already broken system which you and I will now have to pay for and expecting different results, instead of addressing the root of the problem.  The answer to healthcare,  and college is to limit the role of government,  not expand it.  Look at Obamacare, as soon as the government got involved,  the problems only intensified with many people (including me) having their premiums double.  Look at the Obamacare website which cost tax payers <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-24/obamacare-website-costs-exceed-2-billion-study-finds">over $2,000,000,000</a> and only recently began to fully work.  Do you realize the type of website the private sector could build for 0.001% that?   Almost everything the government puts their hands on ends up being worse then before.  The only form of government which actually works is local and state governments,  which Bernie wants to marginalize and hand their powers over to the feds. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best example of this is the advertising blitz that occurs whenever we consider universal health care. It scares people that there will be long waiting periods, poorer care and fewer choices </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not propaganda,  that&#39;s absolute fact.  Aside from the study by The Health Council of Canada which I mentioned above that shows a stunning 60% of respondents surveyed being either unsatisfied or very unsatisfied with the level of care they received,  Britain&#39;s NHS is a disaster.  </p>

<p>The United Kingdom is the latest to tighten its belt. The National Health Service (NHS) — the centralized public agency that runs Britain’s government healthcare system — is being forced to shave $31 billion from its budget by 2015</p>

<p>These cuts are leading to a precipitous drop in the quality of care patients receive. The NHS has been living well beyond its means for quite awhile. And now brutal government-enforced cost controls are exacting a heavy human toll.</p>

<p>In order to realize some savings, the NHS is raising the threshold at which patients qualify for treatment and lengthening wait times for surgeries determined “non-lifesaving.” The Service is also cutting more than 20,000 NHS jobs over the next two years and shuttering a number of hospitals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does that statistic actually discount those that happened to be abroad when they needed care or not?  Assuming all care received abroad was sought to avoid relying on Canadian care would be misleading.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/features/medicaltourism/">According to the CDC</a> about 750,000 US residents travel abroad for care.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=population+of+usa&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8">US</a> population is 318.9 million</p>

<p>Life expectancy is 78.74 years ‎(2012)</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=population+of+cananda&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8">Canada</a> population is 35.16 million</p>

<p>Life expectancy is 81.24 years ‎(2012)</p>

<p>So, not only does Canada have a smaller percentage of the population going abroad for medical care, it has a higher life expectancy too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/number-of-canadian-patients-travelling-abroad-for-treatment-increased-by-25-study-finds">From your article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Canada had the second-worst overall ranking among the health care systems of 11 industrialized nations and ranked last in the wait-time category. Only the American health care system ranked worse overall. </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>With medical costs rising and the Medicare tax rate remaining static, of course it cannot fund the care for which it is mandated unless taxes are increased or medical costs decrease.  Also as more people stay alive longer, there will be more elderly as a percentage of the population in the future.  This is not an indictment against the Medicare system, but an expression of basic mathematics.  Insurance rates are climbing too for the same reason.</p>

<hr/>

<p>As state funding (this is not the same channel of money as subsidies of tuition of individual students) of colleges and universities is reduced, tuition must be increased to cover costs.  Where do you think the money goes?  Increased salaries or quantities of administrators over time?  Increased salaries or amounts of teachers over time?  Unnecessary facilities?  Profits?  Even in not for profit ones?  If we&#39;re not going to account for reductions in state funding of colleges and universities (again, not tuition subsidies for individual students) in our analysis of tuition increases, we&#39;re not being honest with ourselves.  We would deceive ourselves.</p>

<p>But the difference is that Americans have to pay for Healthcare regardless, so this is likely people trying to save money and go elsewhere.  Canadians receive FREE Healthcare in Canada and are actually going elsewhere and paying for it,  rather then getting it for free.  </p>

<p>You have to be paying absolutely no attention to anything to come to your conclusion, and just basing everything on his blood. There is absolutely no material (interviews, reports, votes, etc, ANYTHING) out there of any kind that makes sanders more of a zionist than any other human being in consideration for the presidency. Thats the fact. What the flying fuck are you basing your opinion on? Since im guessing you are just a racists, there has been jewish anti-zionist from the start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see why we should be triggering anticommunists like you Putin when we say that we want socialized medicine.  Do you dislike social security?  I don&#39;t.  I like the idea of taking care of old people when they can no longer work and those who lose their hands in machinery, even though since they made minimum wage it was impossible for them to store up a rainy day fund on their own.  I know that people will not save up properly for retirement and I like the idea of paying some taxes to take care of their stupidity.</p>

<p>I do NOT like paying for war in any way.  I also don&#39;t like paying for lies or police or colonialism, or for mass weaponry or mass surveillance. I&#39;d love to opt out of that, because if I could, I could give so much more to old people and disabled people.</p>

<p>I think the only two social programs we really need are social security and social healthcare.  I dont&#39; see why it&#39;s so dirty to imagine a world with a safetynet to assuage the universality of human suffering.  I&#39;d gladly pay some taxes to make sure that you, Putin, are taken care of when you get cancer or arthitis or crohns...(you&#39;re going to get something let me assure you....statistics are not in your favor or mine...).  </p>

<p>But as far as incentivizing laziness, I agree, that has to stop.</p>

<p>You see we already have a communist system in america--it&#39;s called the prison industrial complex.  We have for profit prisons, and we have a drug war we run both sides of in order to incarcerate hippies and blacks so they can make money off them.</p>

<p>But when you take it apart it is: 1) a place to house them without them doing anything, 2) a place to feed them without them doing anything, 3) a place to take care of them medically, 4) some of them do a minimal amount of effort for no real gain.... Sound familiar?  We already have communism.  Its microcommunism-- that is the prison industrial complex and surprisingly--it <em>does in fact work very well, Putin, so I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about</em></p>

People tend to like it.  The nightmares of long waiting periods, poor care and poor choices spun by the rich that want to keep taxes lower and their health insurance stocks fall on deaf ears in places that already have universal health care.

    <div class="md"><p>The world has proven over, and over again that socialism is not a vehicle to communism.  You are welcome to keep quoting Marx all you want, but it doesn&#39;t change reality or history.</p>

<p>And far more importantly, Marxian  socialism involves nationalization of all private industry.  This is nowhere in Sanders&#39; platform.  He&#39;s not even a socialist, let alone a communist.</p>

<p>By all means, disagree with him on policy all you want.  I do on several issues.  But calling him a communist shows ignorance of both the term and his platform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have some quotes from Sanders calling for nationalization of all US industries (that&#39;s what socialism is), or calling for the dilution of the State (that&#39;s what communism is), by all means post them.  I would actually be very interested in seeing those.  Rebutting instead with, &quot;god damn you&#39;re ignorant&quot; and then rage-downvoting all my comments is kind of sad.</p>

I don&#39;t live in the lower states, and it really it doesn&#39;t affect me. Why the fuck would you believe anything I say? Best research it on yourself.

<p>Marx&#39;s theory that socialism naturally becomes communism has not one single example in world history to prove his point.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no example of a successful communist nation because it absolutely can&#39;t work.  The ideal of some utopia where everyone is &quot;equal&quot; is a dream.  </p>

<p>Capitalism has empowered more people across the globe then communism can ever think of.  There&#39;s been no other system in the history of mankind that has empowered and freed more people then capitalism. </p>

<p>Why do you think that so many people in Cuba, Venezuela,  El Salvador,  Nicaragua,  Honduras,  and China are rushing America&#39;s borders right now?  If socialism and communism worked,  wouldn&#39;t these people want to stay put in the utopia? </p>

<p>They&#39;re coming here because they realize,  that the capitalist system is far superior for those who want to work hard and make something out of their lives. </p>

<p>The American dream is real,  ask the millions of immigrants who have come here and made a great life for themselves by working hard, after fleeing the socialist / communist society&#39;s they lived in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you are experiencing with this post is sadly just a microcosm of why Sanders has no chance to win the Democratic nomination. I have some reservations about Bernie, but he is by far the best of the candidates running for the White House.</p>

<p>He is the only candidate who has demonstrated <strong>any humanity</strong> during his life, but that isn&#39;t an asset in this race. Mouth-foaming Trumptards and Clinton shills (she has no real supporters) have left their droppings on your post, just like they are shitting on Bernie&#39;s campaign, and shitting on hope for future of the United States.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernies ONLY solution is to give the already corrupted to the core federal government more power,  and more money.  His only plan is to centralize more power to the federal government.  How anyone can think that the answer to our problems is to feed the beast more,  is beyond me. </p>

<p>He wants to federalize everything from pre-school to college, from total control of healthcare, to local police departments.</p>

<p>Ask yourself if giving the feds more power or less power is the step in the right direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.. I will give you my opinion on why I don&#39;t support Bernie. It took him 40 years to earn a real living, he was terrible at everything he did and relied on unemployment. He was poor, lived in a shack and couldn&#39;t keep his electricity on. People close to him said he was always complaining about how the rich are ripping people off and wrote stories about rape and masturbation for money. Until he met politics... Why would I want someone like that to run the greatest country in the world when he couldn&#39;t support himself without the government&#39;s help? </p>

<p>Now.. Onto his policies.. Kids love Bernie because of his free college plan. I understand that college is super expensive (I have student loans too) but you can&#39;t just put people through for free unless you raise taxes by an incredible amount which he wants to do. He&#39;s a self proclaimed socialist that believes the rich are screwing everyone.. It&#39;s just going to make the rich move their businesses out of the country which would kill our economy. </p>

<p>I could go on but that&#39;s some of the reasons why I don&#39;t support him-- our choice of presidents this time around is terrible.. But I won&#39;t be voting for Bernie. </p>

<p>You say that as though it means fuck all. Pro tip: BOTH PARTIES HAVE VOTERS IN EVERY STATE. And guess what else? VIRTUALLY EVERY STATE GOES ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WITH LESS THAN FIVE POINTS OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM. </p>

<p>Bernie Sanders is giving the government more money to benefit corrupt special interests by cutting insurance companies out of the market through Medicare for All? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea of a government run single payer system is a TERRIBLE idea,  which will drastically cut the quality of health care.  Perfect example of this is Canada.  There continues to be record numbers of Canadians who travel abroad to be treated.  In 2014, there were <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/number-of-canadian-patients-travelling-abroad-for-treatment-increased-by-25-study-finds">53,000 Canadians who traveled abroad to receive treatment</a>. If socialized medicine was really such a great thing and worked,  there&#39;d be no reason for these people to travel abroad to receive treatment. </p>

<p>A survey conducted by The Health Council of Canada in 2011 found that only 40% of of the 3,000 patients surveyed were either satisfied,  or very satisfied with the care they received.  </p>

<p>The quality of care (or lack thereof) in socialized medicine isn&#39;t limited to Canada either.  A report released in October by Britain’s health regulator found that a stunning 20 percent of hospitals were failing to provide the minimum standard of care legally required for elderly patients.</p>

<p>As part of the study, inspectors dropped by dozens of hospitals unannounced. They found patients shouting or banging on bedrails desperately trying to get the attention of a nurse. At one hospital, <strong>inspectors identified bed-ridden patients that hadn’t been given water for over 10 hours.</strong></p>

<p>Think about how the Obama administration has weaponized the IRS and gone after his political enemies, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s such a stretch to think that government run Healthcare could be used in the same manner at some point.  </p>

<p>If the government takes over Healthcare completely,  and doctors essentially become government workers who are a paid exactly the same, which will be significantly lower then their current salaries,  the quality (and likely the quantity) of doctors will drastically decrease. </p>

<p>If you want to know how socialized medicine will ultimately end, you don&#39;t need to look any further then Medicare,  which is currently expected to be insolvent by the year 2030. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s benefiting special interests by offering affordable college? Which corrupt special interest groups pouring money into DC campaigns gain from these things? The teacher&#39;s unions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  The teacher&#39;s unions are a significant lobby actually.  If you give college free to everyone,  you&#39;re going to have a massive increase in the number of teachers, and the teachers union, and their lobbyists will also increase significantly as well.  There&#39;s no doubt that college currently as become so expensive,  that many who want to go to college simply can&#39;t, and those who can,  end up with crippling amounts of college debt. But WHY has college become so expensive though?  This is what really angers me about Bernie Sanders&#39;s plan to make college &quot;free&quot; for everyone.  Instead of actually addressing the reason why college has become so unaffordable,  he simply wants to continue with the broken system and expand it further.  </p>

<p>First off,  there&#39;s no such thing as free college.  It&#39;s still going to be just as expensive as it is today,  and most likely even increase in cost. So instead of making college more affordable,  he&#39;s simply going to make the working middle class pay for it instead.  </p>

<p>But I digress. Do you know the what the main reason for college tuition skyrocketing even is?   According to both the liberal <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/the-real-reason-college-tuition-costs-so-much.html?referer=&amp;amp;_r=0">New York Times</a> as well as the conservative outlet <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/pascalemmanuelgobry/2013/05/09/the-reason-why-college-is-so-expensive-is-actually-dead-obvious/#4e953c1b7e2f">Forbes</a> the reason is the increase in federal government subsidies that have caused the problem to begin with!   So again,  Bernie&#39;s only solution is to exasperate the situation even more,  by massively increasing federal subsidies!  </p>

<p>Did you know that US colleges that don’t accept Federal loans have tuition roughly half of their similarly-ranked peers?  In fact some schools have stated they will refuse Federal aid in order to keep costs low.</p>

<p>Just another example of Bernie feeding the beast more, expanding and growing an already broken system which you and I will now have to pay for and expecting different results, instead of addressing the root of the problem.  The answer to healthcare,  and college is to limit the role of government,  not expand it.  Look at Obamacare, as soon as the government got involved,  the problems only intensified with many people (including me) having their premiums double.  Look at the Obamacare website which cost tax payers <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-24/obamacare-website-costs-exceed-2-billion-study-finds">over $2,000,000,000</a> and only recently began to fully work.  Do you realize the type of website the private sector could build for 0.001% that?   Almost everything the government puts their hands on ends up being worse then before.  The only form of government which actually works is local and state governments,  which Bernie wants to marginalize and hand their powers over to the feds. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best example of this is the advertising blitz that occurs whenever we consider universal health care. It scares people that there will be long waiting periods, poorer care and fewer choices </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not propaganda,  that&#39;s absolute fact.  Aside from the study by The Health Council of Canada which I mentioned above that shows a stunning 60% of respondents surveyed being either unsatisfied or very unsatisfied with the level of care they received,  Britain&#39;s NHS is a disaster.  </p>

<p>The United Kingdom is the latest to tighten its belt. The National Health Service (NHS) — the centralized public agency that runs Britain’s government healthcare system — is being forced to shave $31 billion from its budget by 2015</p>

<p>These cuts are leading to a precipitous drop in the quality of care patients receive. The NHS has been living well beyond its means for quite awhile. And now brutal government-enforced cost controls are exacting a heavy human toll.</p>

<p>In order to realize some savings, the NHS is raising the threshold at which patients qualify for treatment and lengthening wait times for surgeries determined “non-lifesaving.” The Service is also cutting more than 20,000 NHS jobs over the next two years and shuttering a number of hospitals.</p>
