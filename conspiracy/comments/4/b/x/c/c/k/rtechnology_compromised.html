    <div class="md"><p>r/technology is actually one of the most heavily infiltrated sub on reddit. At one point they even had key word filters that would delete any post referencing nsa obama, comcast, surveillance.When this censorship was exposed they pretended it was nothing.
 My guess is the entire sub is moderated by some cointelpro agents. All of reddit is like this, and r/conspiracy is no different. This sub basically is Alex jones bullshit and NASA fanboys who still think the MIC of NASA actually does anything civilian. You really don&#39;t get to see how controlled this sub is unless one of the staged events happens. During the Boston, every post on this sub exposing the fakery was deleted or downvoted to Hell. You saw how the mods stickied that Brussels hoax event like it&#39;s actually worth our time here to believe their bullshit staged terror shit. Don&#39;t believe for a second Reddit is organic or control free. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never believed the old mods. They&#39;re all assholes. I can only speak for how it&#39;s been run for the last year or so.

<p>I&#39;m not saying you should automatically trust people or Reddit, but this you can plainly see what we&#39;re doing for yourself. I can&#39;t speak to any other subs following this example except for <a href="/r/conspriacy">/r/conspriacy</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, once you guys exposed the fuckery, they did plan B, took the whole sub to the fringe status. Now it doesn&#39;t matter who mods it. It doesn&#39;t have the same power  to reach the kind of audience it once did.They win because your expose pulled the whole sub from reaching people. This has been a tactic of Reddit admins when they believe a sub is too powerful and has potential to inform large number of reddit users with information the government or companies don&#39;t want out. We saw them completely censor rpolitics and then remove it from default too. The best thing about Reddit was it had potential to bring alternative media to the front pages and this was the biggest problem for the establishment media and control system.So Reddit admins censored all aternative media from reaching their front pages now
 5 years ago reddit dominated by alternative media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say they win. <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> makes the front of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> daily and we have a bunch of new subs all the time because of it.

And the way it was before all those types of posts were wiped out 100% of the time. So, it&#39;s still a victory but not as big as it could have been. </p>

<p>Perhaps though, they will make it a default once again and they only did so because the old mods truly were idiots (they really were). But only time will tell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t  matter what the majority want. They want to control HOW this majority thinks. The fact that r/technology was default sub with million of subscribers meant it was reaching the Front page often with negative news on comcast, NSA, SOPA etc. The sub was reaching many redditors with very good content about NSA leaks, SOPA almost every hour.It became a problem because it had a majority audience exposed to alternative news exposing governments and rotten industry like comcast. They put filters on, and once exposed they pulled its default status preventing the sub from reaching more Redditors and  front page.
