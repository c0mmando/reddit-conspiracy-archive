       r/technology is actually one of the most heavily infiltrated sub on reddit. At one point they even had key word filters that would delete any post referencing nsa obama, comcast, surveillance.When this censorship was exposed they pretended it was nothing.
 My guess is the entire sub is moderated by some cointelpro agents. All of reddit is like this, and r/conspiracy is no different. This sub basically is Alex jones bullshit and NASA fanboys who still think the MIC of NASA actually does anything civilian. You really don't get to see how controlled this sub is unless one of the staged events happens. During the Boston, every post on this sub exposing the fakery was deleted or downvoted to Hell. You saw how the mods stickied that Brussels hoax event like it's actually worth our time here to believe their bullshit staged terror shit. Don't believe for a second Reddit is organic or control free.

       You just claimed to me that a reddit bug, which was fixed two days ago, was the issue. So right off, you're not being honest to claim, "don't know what OP is going on about", as you claimed to me you understand posts are being deleted by a bug which was fixed two days ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: which would also make it a very selective bug, fixed two days ago, deleting posts of specific content.

       Actually most of everything you've said is wrong. I was the one to exposed the censored keywords, the olds mods were kicked out, and then I was made a mod there. More over OP is wrong the comment was spammed by automod for unknown reason.

       Oh so just cause you got to be mod means the rest of us sheep have to trust Reddit? mods were probably under some pressure and caved to some censorship that blatant looks like it could have been sponsored by government and industry stooges.

       I never believed the old mods. They're all assholes. I can only speak for how it's been run for the last year or so. Since I've been a mod there I've made it my mission to never let it go back to the way it was. And I've succeeded. As you can plainly see, stories of Snowden, the FBI wanting back doors, Comcast, and any other tech story you want to post are welcome there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying you should automatically trust people or Reddit, but this you can plainly see what we're doing for yourself. I can't speak to any other subs following this example except for
       <a href="/r/conspriacy">
        /r/conspriacy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to be a mod of
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       go apply now. If selected you'll be able to see for yourself how we run things.

       Like I said, once you guys exposed the fuckery, they did plan B, took the whole sub to the fringe status. Now it doesn't matter who mods it. It doesn't have the same power  to reach the kind of audience it once did.They win because your expose pulled the whole sub from reaching people. This has been a tactic of Reddit admins when they believe a sub is too powerful and has potential to inform large number of reddit users with information the government or companies don't want out. We saw them completely censor rpolitics and then remove it from default too. The best thing about Reddit was it had potential to bring alternative media to the front pages and this was the biggest problem for the establishment media and control system.So Reddit admins censored all aternative media from reaching their front pages now
 5 years ago reddit dominated by alternative media.

       makes the front of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       daily and we have a bunch of new subs all the time because of it. They can't help that yet anyway. Not without revealing they are completely in the wrong if they truly are in the first place. And the way it was before all those types of posts were wiped out 100% of the time. So, it's still a victory but not as big as it could have been.

      <p>
       Perhaps though, they will make it a default once again and they only did so because the old mods truly were idiots (they really were). But only time will tell.

       Glad you are hopeful but I am just seeing reddit aligning itself with control system players, fashioning its users into a mainstream hole of accepted media. All they need is bots to control and dominant comments and it's done.rworldnews is prime example of that now.

       I guess so. I didn't realize that
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology

       was considered political.

       The spin has even started now. Apparently I'm crazy simply because my post, and others by other users, were deleted.

       I frequent that sub and any comment that is pro surveillance or pro law enforcement gets down voted hard and receives multiple replies explaining how stupid their opinion is.  Sure there might be some fuckery at play sometimes but the majority of people who frequent that sub are very anti surveillance and pro security...at least from my experience when I hang out there...

       It doesn't  matter what the majority want. They want to control HOW this majority thinks. The fact that r/technology was default sub with million of subscribers meant it was reaching the Front page often with negative news on comcast, NSA, SOPA etc. The sub was reaching many redditors with very good content about NSA leaks, SOPA almost every hour.It became a problem because it had a majority audience exposed to alternative news exposing governments and rotten industry like comcast. They put filters on, and once exposed they pulled its default status preventing the sub from reaching more Redditors and  front page. I see very calculated moves to prevent quality content from reaching the greater Reddit audience.

       You may have a point here. Now that we no longer censor I have a strong feeling we will never be reinstated as a default.

       Well, apparently it isn't fixed just yet. Unfortunate, that people all just assume the worst instead of asking us what's going on. When I exposed
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology

       in the first place I came with solid proof that spanned months of abuse. You shouldn't just go off half-cocked.
