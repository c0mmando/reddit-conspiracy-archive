       -Every year, consumers in industrialized countries waste almost as much food as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa (222 million vs. 230 million tons)
-The amount of food lost and wasted every year is equal to more than half of the worldâ€™s annual cereals crops (2.3 billion tons in 2009/10)

       -In the USA, organic waste is the second highest component of landfills, which are the largest source of methane emissions
-In the USA, 30-40% of the food supply is wasted, equaling more than 20 pounds of food per person per month

       My town (which has grown a LOT in 15 years) has been complaining about the smell from the landfill. Instead of doing soemthing like setting up a program to collect organic waste and use it to generate/capture methane AND the compost, the town decided that it needed to build a new river dock. Why? Well people with disabilities apparantly couldn't go boating. Now we have a multi-million dollar dock (that will NEVER even come close to paying for itself)! And I still don't see any more boaters... disabled or otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       It blows my mind. There are million dollar houses going up'to increase tax rev' while the community begs to stop development and fix our now to small infrastructure. The papers talk about expansion being "needed for the sustainable foundation of our future" and how the tax money will "improve the schools". Like a methane digestion plant and the associated jobs and actual methane/compost revenue wouldn't help the community...
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply pointing out that even our waste is wasteful...

       I think about the abundance of food we have every time I go to a Safeway or similar. Think about it... there is more than enough food at multiple grocery locations in any given city. Imagine if these major corporations (Wal-Mart for example) could lessen their greed and allow even just 1% of the food at any location to be available for free instead of throwing away or keeping until it rots or distribute it to places that don't have access.... no one would be dying of hunger and these corporations would make a little less than than 12.8 billion (Wal-Mart 2014 shareholder return)...
      </p>
      <p>
       Starvation is a choice of greed over humanity... we've had more than enough for food for decades.

       Overcrowding =/= overpopulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       An hour long flight looking out the window will show anyone not blind that the earth is not overpopulated. I'm aware an analogy like that seems naive, or trite.. but poor city planning does not mean there are too many people on the earth, which sounds like there isn't enough "stuff" (food?) for everyone.. It's not a resources problem, or a population problem, but a logistics problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Over-population" sounds like a manufactured problem from folks seeking some sort of Malthusian answer but do not realize we aren't living in 18th century England sans technology.

       The people who say the world is over populated would throw a bitch fit if you said that we need to cut off foreign aid to 3rd world nations that can't sustain it's current population while having a exploding population.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to bitch about overpopulation then become a missionary and preach those thoughts to Haiti,or any other overpopulated hole.

       I can't believe people gnash their teeth over suggesting that we ought to sent the Haitians back to Africa. Really what's the point in keeping them there when they have to resort to eating mud pies to get by?

       Why should I care about some people dying on the other side of the globe? That is their own problem.

      <p>
       What I do care about is the chance to get blown up by a fanatic jihadist, because that is an actual thing that can affect people in Europe, me, my children and grandchildren.

       This is true, it's easier to empathise with people you see every day, but I think you would be empathising pretty hard with those third world shitholes if you went there.  I don't think it's silly to expect people to care for other people, and I do think it's silly to expect people to only care for the people they see.  I'm in Canada so it doesn't really matter who i support, but if you're about to say you'd like to see clinton or trump as president I might look at you funny!

       Yes.  If I provide facts showing IQ distributions will that suffice?

       That there are places on Earth that are highly populated does not mean that they or the planet as a whole is overpopulated. Thatâ€™s just nonsense. That there are places where people die from malnutrition is also not evidence of anything.

       30 billion? Maybe with the population density of a large city. Youre right though, its not a fact we are over populated, its just my opinion, but with the rate that the Earth is being plundered and over abused now, with 30 billion people there will surely be widespread quality of life issues, much worse than now.

       Because I can? I do believe that poverty is a desired result. But how can you say that countries like India are not over populated? Sure its possible for all those people to live in one country, but what type of lives do they live? Theres shit, trash, and decaying bodies everywhere. I know that has a lot to do with culture and it might not even change if there were less people, but there are still too many people (in my opinion)

       because theres a difference between being smart and wise. Hitler was smart, but he was not wise. I believe some areas are overpopulated because the technology and resources have not been allocated to provide people with quality lives. To me, a million people crammed into an area (whether by choice or inability to move) where everyones life is low quality is overpopulation. My opinion is based on my morales, not the textbook definition of over population.

       Overpopulation = there are not enough resources to provide the global population with a basic standard of living.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such a statement is abundantly false when you take into consideration the amount of wasted food and water, the amount of natural (i.e. clean/green) energy we are able to utilize (should we set up the facilities, which we have the money and technology to do), and the amount horded by a minority of the global populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overpopulation is a myth perpetuated by those with too much who don't wish to share, so tell those with just enough that those with nothing have nothing because they're lazy/there's nothing left to give.

       No, it isn't, please don't fall into that line of thinking. Overpopulation is as much a threat as a pigeon's fart (difference being, the fart exists).

       It's a word used by those with too much to explain to those with just enough why those who have nothing are in such a situation, instead of admitting that perhaps they do have far too much for one, single person and that providing a basic living standard for
       <em>
        everybody
       </em>
       (with abundance being earned, instead of basic standards being scraped together) is a better alternative to having a 1,000 room house to accommodate a family of 10 (plus the 20 people in their employ).

       Western lives are superior.  They've managed to create civilizations where they are, mostly, able to care of their own food problems.  They are able to feed and care for their own offspring; their children won't starve and their offspring won't starve.  Very simple.

       That's a bit of an exaggeration, but I had the thought this morning that we waste so much fertile land here in America creating concrete hellholes meanwhile much of the rest of the world is trying to scrape by in natural desolation.

       Yes, with America and the UK seeing a drastic rise in child poverty, homelessness, and starvation, Western lives and societies are definitely superior, aren't they?
      </p>
      <p>
       Western society leads to individualism, greed, and ultimately, a big old vacuum cleaner sucking the money up through the banking system, straight out of your pockets.
