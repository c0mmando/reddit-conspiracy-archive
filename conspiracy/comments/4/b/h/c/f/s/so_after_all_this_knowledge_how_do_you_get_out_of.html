    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit. </p>

<p>So I was familiar w Maslow&#39;s HoN, but not the peak experience.  I believe I was having one, and my friends all flipped out and had an intervention that led to hospitalization. Everyone was telling me I was manic, when it was the clearest my mind had ever been, in relation to how I viewed myself and society as a whole. </p>

<p>This is gonna sound crazy, but in that state, I could see TRUTH and deception. I could see people&#39;s true motivations and how our energy reacted to each other. I couldn&#39;t control anything, but I could see how things were happening and that &quot;they&quot; couldn&#39;t hurt me. Then I was medicated against my will and it changed. They then offered me a med that caused a istilldontknow (if it was a dream, a guided experience, a delusion, a timewarp, I can&#39;t even really explain it, I don&#39;t know if I was in a room with people and heard them, or if it was a spiritual revelation of bits of my personality as shown through other people that were in the hospital. I mean, I do not know if I took a pill and fell asleep, or if I went to a group meeting in the sensory room and actually heard the conversations.) and after that, the sense of awareness faded. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been reluctant to speak about it, because most people will just dismiss it as mental illness. But it was the first time in my life that I actually was fully capable of looking at childhood trauma. I felt like I was shedding a weight that I have been carrying for 3 decades and that I was &quot;stopped&quot;.   I&#39;m not expressing myself well. I&#39;ve actually been too spooked to sit on my netbook and type up the whole thing. But a handwritten recollection looks like a mentally ill manifesto!  </p>

<p>I&#39;m fucking special. Like legally. I don&#39;t talk about it online because I still haven&#39;t decided the best way to handle it. I&#39;m being vague for a reason, but I will say that at any point, I could approach the media, file my own complaint or write a book that would be a best-seller. That&#39;s not delusions of granduer. People would be very, very interested in my life experience. </p>

<p>I dunno, my buddy calls it the Big Bang. That he had a moment of truth and freedom and, while the sensation doesn&#39;t last, the memory of it is crystal clear and it changes how you feel. I don&#39;t think I moved through the experience, I think I personally retreated into my own comfort of depression and anxiety. Crap, I am not expressing myself to my satisfaction. The fact that I&#39;m being guarded feels like a betrayal to that experience. Because in that moment, I knew I had the power to love love love intensely and I have stopped being kind to even myself. I had briefly returned to the Catholic Church and as soon as I took a full Communion, all my faith disappeared. </p>

<p>Fuck, this is word vomit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A mix of things. 
1 part hitting 35 and thinking, wait, am I really happy with my life and how I want to work with others? 
1 part losing weight, diet changes (organic food, coconut oil, herbal remedies like FireCider, etc)
1 part spiritual journey and trying to figure out how deeply ingrained Catholicism effected my &quot;morals&quot;
1 part the Super blood moon and change of seasons. I have SAD, so basically two times a year (when the leaves are budding or falling off the trees, when the light changes), I have an insomnia episode. I will admit I was sleep-deprived, but not to an extreme. What was crazy is I have arthritis and nerve damage and I just kept feeling better physically, despite stress and fatigue. I was lighter. On the night of the Super Blood moon lunar eclipse, I was literally jumping 3 feet in the air, I had no physical pain or weakness and my mind was not only clear, but idk how to even describe it. My neighbors and I were running around, acting a fool. We all kept laughing at all these little things that were happening. I kept telling my friends <em>ask me anything!</em> and whatever they asked, I knew the answer to. (Not facts, but like personal questions. Like should I stay w my boyfriend? What&#39;s my spiritual role? Am I a healer, empath, etc. ) My friends kept saying <em>your face looks different</em> and I joked, <em>why, cuz I&#39;m actually really happy?</em> </p>

<p>I had a peak experience lasting about two weeks - quit smoking, even weed.   Lots of very cool stuff happened to me, and the funniest was that I went into a church of scientology and took their personality test.      The guy came back with my results, and didn&#39;t know what to say - it was all across the board maxxed out, and he went on to ask me how I felt about controlling other people.   I said no thanks, and they never contacted me since.   Cool to hear your story.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I forgot I had quit smoking weed at that time, too! Went from heavy daily user to totally clean. So that&#39;s interesting as fuck to me that you had a similar experience coming off weed. </p>

<p>I had myself drug tested at that time, too, because there were rumors that dealers were spiking weed with heroin or PCP. Everything came back negative, including weed. It was a blood test 3 days after I stopped smoking. In fact, I&#39;ve never peed or blown dirty on a UA or Breathalyzer, despite totally deserving to fail, my entire life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I personally feel that freedom/the goal of our existence in this life on this plane can be found via meditation (right now I am thinking through Raja Yoga), astral projection, activating the pineal gland through either use of DMT externally, or through monoatomic gold (made yourself). But, how to get DMT? I&#39;m not a chemist, let alone an alchemist (in the laboratory experimental sense). Seriously. I&#39;m in N Y C. If anybody has info on anything going on in that capacity in the N Y C, let me know.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been reading a ton of books over the years, varying from basic corruption to esoteric corruption to philosophical enlightenment to metaphysical awakening, and I think that the truly awakened individuals are probably the Tibetan and Indian monks/yogis, aboriginal shamans in Central and South America, African tribal elders and maybe high order Druids (still). </p>

<p>To truly be free I think you&#39;d have to live in and with nature. Basically a complete abandonment of this material existence. I don&#39;t know how other than just doing it. It probably isn&#39;t something you really need to plan for, aside from knowing certain survival skills (making a fire from scratch, finding shelter routinely, knowing which vegetation is edible, knowing how to skin and dress animals before eating the meat, etc). </p>

<p>No mention of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXGsYFblCqQ">Australian Aborigine</a>?</p>

<p>If you watch that little series til the end, it goes into potential of Egyptians coming to Australia to consult with them on matters of spirituality. </p>

<p>The Tibetans are still another system of hierarchy and control. They&#39;re the relics of the priest class from Atlantis, filtered down through the Vedics of Sumeria. The Dali Lama line was disrupted with the Chinese invasion of Tibet. </p>

<p>If you look into Tantra, it was actually the vagrants who left the hierarchical system , to wander the lands and interact with the folk that achieved the most spiritually. There&#39;s interesting ideas that Christ was a Kundalini Yogi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, do you take anything tangible away from the experience? I think that&#39;s what redditeditard was getting at. On drugs you sometimes get a brief glimpse at something that (you believe) is fantastic and the next day it doesn&#39;t seem that amazing -- an insight into something that has no real meaning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never done a psychedelic drug, so I can&#39;t explain the feeling. DMT experimentation might be one of the only avenues that are left to at least give us a chance to expand our consciousness. It&#39;s illegal here in the States and doesn&#39;t seem to be obtained too easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DMT is a hardcore way to start. Maybe smoke some good weed to begin with... then drop acid. (Something lighter, like blotter.) It&#39;s a mind-opening experience. As you get more familiar with psychedelics you can try stronger varieties. Before you explore the outside world, you should try to explore the inner one. You&#39;ll have great insights on drugs but, they don&#39;t always have deep meaning. It&#39;s all about the journey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically claiming sovereignty, a court case of your natural self (the real you) vs the corporate fiction (STRAWMAN).
You claim your natural rights and follow natural law, however you mustn&#39;t be in any contracts under your government name such as a drivers license a phone bill a house payment, anything with your strawmans name on it. Which is hard on purpose, that&#39;s why there are so many CONtracts so you can&#39;t destroy your strawman. But when you are out of all contracts you can start your case, however you will have to give up all govt privileges such as police ambulance hospitals fire dept etc. If it feels like its impossible, its because they set it  up that way, a lot of research in law, etymology, and natural rights will help you. <a href="https://realitybloger.wordpress.com/2010/02/26/killing-your-strawman-the-path-to-freedom/.">This is a great place to start</a></p>

It basically all started in 1492 before Columbus came to america the Vatican created the pappal bulls saying that they own all the money, property, people, and souls in the world, with no one to challenge them, it became reality.  Then conveniently came to america to establish the new england parliment and put it into act. Anyone born in a hospital with a birth certificate is in the system.</p>
