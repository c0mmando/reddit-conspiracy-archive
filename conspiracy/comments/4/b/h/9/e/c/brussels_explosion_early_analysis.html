        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is just a fact based post, using what data we have currently. As such, what is listed here is prone to possible change. My personal analysis will come after the break. (IE -----)</p>

<p>Around 8 AM, an explosion occurred at Brussels airport.  First reported to be at the American Airlines ticket counter, since dismissed. Actual explosion happened at two separate check in locations, prior to the gate inspection area.</p>

<p>A second explosion occurred moments later. (same location)</p>

<p>An hour later, approximately 9 AM , confirmed explosion at metro station Maalbeek. Metro explosion happened inside a train.  <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CeJLNfBUYAAB3HX.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CeJLNfBUYAAB3HX.jpg</a> (ref photo) <em>The Maalbeek station is also near a number of important EU buildings such as Berlaymont building, which houses the EU Commission and the Council of the European Union. Metro station 20 confirmed deaths, 106 injured</em></p>

<p>Other explosions rumoured at Kunst-Wet, Schuman. Found to be a false report, possibly intentional to distract responding units.</p>

<p>Metro stations have been cleared.</p>

<p>Train stations are being cleared.</p>

<p>Students at Brussels Universities are advised to stay inside.</p>

<p>Cellphone networks are congested.</p>

<p>Multiple suspicious packages reported, Bomb disposal units are heading to each one.</p>

<p>CONFIRMED CASUALTIES: 13 at the airport REVISED TO 10, 35 wounded. 15 at Metro Station Maalbeek, 55 wounded.</p>

<p>Parliament is being cleared. At Aprox. 11:15 GMT+1 Parliament has been closed.</p>

<p>Belgium/French border is completely closed, then downgraded from closed to increased security.</p>

<p>Federal Prosector has confirmed that at least one of the airport attacks was a suicide bombing.</p>

<p>Montgomery tunnel in brussels is closed off by police.</p>

<p>All Brussels EU Building are on Lockdown, no word on evacuation yet.</p>

<p>Facebook has activated the &quot;mark as safe&quot; feature.</p>

<p>Palace evacuated. Mixed reports here.  Most News agencies reported the Palace was evacuated, and then quickly changed to say it was not. (Standard security procedure. You don&#39;t want whoever is doing the attack knowing that possible targets are on the move.)</p>

<p>Citizens being encouraged to help others evacuate using a hastag on twitter or uber called #ikwilhelpen to offer up free spots in their vehicles to help people evacuate.</p>

<p>All rail traffic has stopped, with many trains coming to rest where they are. No orders on when movement will be possible.  The Paris-Brussels has begun reversing trains, while London-Paris is still operating under guarded  (means slower speed) restrictions.</p>

<p>Citizens are being told to stay where they are, with metro trains and all public transit halted.  Many passengers are trapped on trains and not being allowed to leave.</p>

<p>Bomb Squads have started destroying packages, producing more explosions.  Reports are sketchy, but at least ten other explosive packages or suspected explosives have been found.</p>

<p>One non exploded suicide belt discovered at the airport, with police demolitions squad on site for disarming. It&#39;s believed the bomb failed to detonate due to an error.</p>

<p>No particular group is claiming responsibility for the attack.</p>

<p>At least one vehicle/car bomb has been demolished through the use of a controlled explosion.</p>

<p>Belgian army has fully mobilized to respond to the bombings, assisting the police force (which has been stretched thin) with bomb disposals.  A second car bomb found at the airport.  Army units are under orders to simply destroy the explosives in situ, as opposed to attempting to disarm them.  (This actually makes sense, as trying to disarm every single one would make it hard to track them all down, and chance further explosions.)</p>

<p>France has mobilized medical aid, both in the form of military units, and ambulances and doctors to send to Belgium to assist in the crisis.</p>

<p>Planes en route to Belguim are being routed into neighboring countries, primarily France, but also the Netherlands and Germany.</p>

<p>Belgian authorities have provided a number for persons outside of the country to contact and find out status of loved ones. However they request people try social media first, to help alleviate some of the congestion on both land and cell lines.</p>

<p><strong>Syria</strong> has expressed a severe condemnation of the attacks, and sent its condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims.  The condemnation did not come without a barb, with the Syrian official stating quote &quot;inevitable result of wrong policies and a tolerance for terrorism&quot;.  (never would have expected Syria to condemn it....)</p>

<p>Tihange nuclear power plant in the Belgian province of Liege has been evacuated. At the moment there is NO evidence suggesting this has anything to do with the situation in Brussel. It is being reported as a standard crisis/attack response.  Order to evacuate was rescinded, as reported by an operator present at the power plant. All plants nation wide are running on a &quot;weekend&quot; schedule, meaning a majority of workers were sent home, with a skeleton crew remaining on duty.</p>

<p>Proximus (a belgian telecom company) has unlocked their service and is encouraging users to use it free of charge (through wifi primarily) to contact loved ones both in Belgium and abroad.</p>

<p>Train stations are expected to be open in the coming hours. (This means rail transit. Metro will take longer due to damage to the system.)</p>

<p>Unconfirmed reports of gunfire. Some sources claim this may be due to weapons in one or more of the destroyed vehicles.</p>

<p>Berlaymont building is getting evacuated, it&#39;s the building where the European Commission is located.  Building previously was on lockdown.</p>

<p>Police have raided a number of locations. No details on where the information is sourced to point to these locations. (Possibly tied to owners of the vehicles)</p>

<p>Turkey has offered their condolences, saying “Turkey is truly sorry” to hear about the Brussels terror attacks and expressed “condolences to the Belgian people.”</p>

<p>The Belgian Justice department is warning journalists, including foreign journalists, not to report on ongoing police investigations which could put the lives of the public or police officers at risk. Newspaper Le Soir says it will comply.</p>

<p>The Flemish-speaking Free University of Brussels (VUB) has said it has received a “specific threat” to its Etterbeek campus in the city and has advised students and staff to remain indoors or return to university buildings immediately.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has condemned what he called “barbaric acts” in Brussels, Russian news agency Interfax reports, quoting his press secretary Dmitry Peskov. “The president resolutely condemned these barbaric acts, expressed his condolences to the Belgian people and assured King Philippe of absolute solidarity with the Belgians in these difficult hours,”</p>

<p>Chairman of the Duma’s foreign policy committee Alexei Pushkov tweets: “While (Nato chief Jens) Stoltenberg, is busy fighting the imaginary ‘Russian threat’ and putting troops in Latvia, under his nose in Brussels people are blown up.”</p>

<p><strong>ISIS</strong> has claimed responsibility for the attack, and threatens further attacks in nations which oppose the Islamic State.</p>

<p>Photos of the two suicide bombers have been released by Brussels authorities in the hopes they are recognized and identified.</p>

<p>One photo, believed to be the suicide bomber who&#39;s belt failed, has been released. Police officials are searching for the man. Curiously, the man in the photo seems to be wearing a disguise of some manner.</p>

<p>Three American civilians are reported as injured. They are identified as Mason Wells, 19, Richard Norby, 66, and Joseph Empey, 20.  The three are reported to be in serious but stable condition.  They were apparently some Mormon missionaries, with Empey and Wells being abroad for their Mission trip. <em>US media reports said that in a dark twist of fate, Wells had a similarly close call three years ago while in Boston accompanying his mother who was running the marathon.</em></p>

<p>The US air force earlier said one of its service members from Joint Force Command Brunssum (a Nato command), the Netherlands, along with several of his relatives were also injured but their names and details of their conditions have not been released.</p>

<p>Muslim leaders in Belgium unilaterally condemned the attacks in Brussels on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Belgian papers are reporting that it is believed the attack is a result of an ongoing investigation on the part of Belgian police.  Officials had been concentrating on a particular Brussels neighborhood in an investigation of an Islamic State recruitment network.  Brussels has a high proportion of citizens who travel to Iraq, insular Muslim communities believed to have helped shield jihadists, and security services that have had problems with their counterterrorism operations.</p>

<p>(I WILL update this as it develops.)</p>

<p>Nov 13, 2015: Paris Attacks:</p>

<p>Abdelhamid Abaaoud hides in St. Denis and Salah Abdeslam escapes to Belgium (even being pulled over by police but distracting them by smoking pot...).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks</a></p>

<p>Nov 18, 2015: Saint Denis Raid. Abaaooud suicide bombs himself in police raid.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Saint-Denis_raid">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Saint-Denis_raid</a></p>

<p>March 15th: Police in Brussels raid house rented by under a false name. Two suspects escape via rooftop. Four officers injured in shootout. One suspect- Mohamed Belkaid, a 35-year-old Algerian citizen is killed shooting at police with an automatic rifle and shotgun. Scene linked to Salah Abdeslam by a fingerprint on a glass. Two brothers and Abdeslam now on the run.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Brussels_police_raids">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Brussels_police_raids</a></p>

<p>Khalid and Ibrahim El Bakraoui, both already known from Brussels gangster environment. So the 17-year-old Khalid El Bakraoui was sentenced in 2011 to five years in prison for a series of carjackings. Ibrahim was again involved in a violent robbery of a currency exchange in Brussels and thereby opened fire on the police in January 2010. For those offenses he was sentenced to nine years in prison.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/32616/Terreurdreiging-in-Belgie/article/detail/2649642/2016/03/17/Federaal-parket-bevestigt-betrokkenheid-broers-El-Bakraoui-niet.dhtml">http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/32616/Terreurdreiging-in-Belgie/article/detail/2649642/2016/03/17/Federaal-parket-bevestigt-betrokkenheid-broers-El-Bakraoui-niet.dhtml</a></p>

<p>Khalid el-Bakraoui used a false name to rent a flat in Rue De Dries where police killed a gunman in a shootout on 15 March, according to RTBF. A fingerprint of Salah Abdeslam, the main suspect in the Paris terror attacks, was found during the raid</p>

<p>This article claims on March 16th that the 2 brothers were detained after fleeing the raided home:
<a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/652985/Paris-attacks-terrorist-suspects-arrested-Brussels-police-raid">http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/652985/Paris-attacks-terrorist-suspects-arrested-Brussels-police-raid</a>
March 18th: Police raid house due to a large pizza order... Abdeslam shot in leg and taken into custody along with several others.</p>

<p>In addition to the brothers, police announce that they are searching for Najim Laachraoui, 24, a Belgian citizen, and Mohamed Abrini, 31, who was recorded by a surveillance video camera with Mr. Abdeslam two days before the Paris attacks. Laachraoui is connected via photographs and DNA with Abdeslam.</p>

<p>The authorities found Mr. Laachraoui’s DNA at the house in Auvelais and also at a house on Rue Henri Bergé, in the Schaerbeek section of Brussels, that was searched on Dec. 10. In the property on Rue Henri Bergé, investigators found traces of TATP, which has become the signature explosive for Islamic State operations in Europe. TATP can be made with common household products and was an ingredient in the suicide vests used in the Paris assaults. Mr. Abdeslam’s fingerprints were also found at the house.</p>

If this guy is the &quot;Chief bombmaker&quot;, why is he at the scene of the most recent attack?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brussels-attacks-live-updates-airport-suspect-is-isis-chief-bomb-maker-a6947476.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brussels-attacks-live-updates-airport-suspect-is-isis-chief-bomb-maker-a6947476.html</a></p>

<p>In the Charleroi hideout, police had found DNA traces of Paris attacks ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud as well as Chakib Akrouh, both of whom were killed north of the French capital days after the Paris attacks under a hail of police bullets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/12194789/Brussels-police-shot-at-during-raid-linked-to-Paris-attacks.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/12194789/Brussels-police-shot-at-during-raid-linked-to-Paris-attacks.html</a></p>

<p>SO now all of these guys (some of whom have been dead since november) have DNA in this apartment.</p>

<p>And there&#39;s one more loose end- Laachraoui</p>

<p>Some are claiming he was arrested...</p>

<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/brussels-airport-suspect-najim-laachraoui-arrested-belgian-media-104400309.html">http://news.yahoo.com/brussels-airport-suspect-najim-laachraoui-arrested-belgian-media-104400309.html</a>
Some are claiming he was killed... Saying that he was one of the two who died at the airport- the other brother being the one at the train station. The third &quot;unidentified&quot; person from the airport is still being sought.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brussels-attacks/suspected-paris-bomb-maker-najim-laachraoui-died-brussels-airport-attack-n544511">http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brussels-attacks/suspected-paris-bomb-maker-najim-laachraoui-died-brussels-airport-attack-n544511</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ktvq.com/story/31524145/manhunt-launched-for-newly-identified-paris-attacks-suspect-najim-laachraoui">http://www.ktvq.com/story/31524145/manhunt-launched-for-newly-identified-paris-attacks-suspect-najim-laachraoui</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that all of these guys were known and being publicly investigated for their connection with the Paris attacks. The brothers who were supposedly the suicide bombers were known criminals and would have been watched closely by the justice system and intelligence services.
edit:</p>

<p>according to this report, one of the brothers was deported from Turkey to the Netherlands, and Turkey claims that they warned Belgium that he was a suspected foreign fighter.
the article also claims:</p>

<p>They – along with Khalid el-Bakraoui, who bombed the Maelbeek metro station – were being sought by police in connection with the terror attacks in Paris, and in particular were thought to be linked to Salah Abdeslam, one of the Paris attackers, who was arrested in Brussels this week.
A fourth man was also part of that police search: Mohamed Abrini, 31, a Belgian of Moroccan origin, who allegedly played a key role in planning the assault on Paris.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/mar/23/brussels-attacks-police-search-airport-bomb-suspect-live">http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/mar/23/brussels-attacks-police-search-airport-bomb-suspect-live</a>
A fifth suspect appears to be &quot;Soufiane Kayal&quot;, who was traveling with Abdeslam (arrested on the 18th) and Mohamed Belkaïd (killed on the 15th raid on the brother&#39;s apartment).</p>

<hr/>

<p>So, my thoughts?  First of it&#39;s one HELL of a co-ordinated attack. You&#39;re looking at something that took a lot of planning.  The first two explosions are textbook, when it comes to terrorist attacks.  You detonate one bomb, creating havoc and injuries.  Then as first responders, police, and fire arrive, you detonate a second one to kill as many of those responding.  The IRA was known for doing this, and made something of a science of it.  The bombing at the metro station is also textbook. The city is on high alert at that point, meaning that citizens will be trying to leave the areas affected. They&#39;ll naturally concentrate in two places. First being the streets, and second being public transit.  Thus, to get the highest kill count, it only makes sense to detonate a bomb in the public transit system.  In a way, it means that the first two blasts are effectively warning shots.  Not really intended to kill as many people as they are to cause the expected &quot;flight&quot; response.  It&#39;s the second blast that wreaks the most damage.  Scattering packages around to other targets also makes sense from a terrorist point of view, as you quickly cause the responding units (police, fire, etc) to have to stretch themselves thin.  Of those hidden packages, you don&#39;t really need to have them actually have explosives, since you&#39;re really just trying to stretch things out to a point that the responding units will have a hard time tracking everything down.  Meaning it makes it easier for the terrorists to either detonate further explosives (most likely) or easily escape the city.</p>

<p>this is UNDER the rubble.   fires burned for months.   are you saying these guys saw molten aluminum..  they say steel.  specifically steel, like you were in a foundry.  </p>

<p>and you didn&#39;t even mention how eutectic steel is formed . how do you think the meteorite was formed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I read it. I don&#39;t consider that analysis. Or at least not a critical analysis. You&#39;re taking everything they&#39;re reporting at face value and going from there. And the conclusions you reach on that basis are faulty. You talk about the two-bomb strategy to attract rescue workers. But in that case the bombs go off minutes apart; here it was reportedly 10 seconds apart. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I appreciate the exhaustive reporting you pulled together and linked for us. But as for your analysis? I found it lacking in the extreme. </p>

<p>This sounds funny because it&#39;s both an oversimplification and overgeneralization. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not all the students at Yale, nor is it only the students at Yale. It&#39;s some people from an elite and historically significant university who joined an elite, secretive society within that university. They are possibly part of a larger group that does nefarious things behind the scenes.</p>

<p>They&#39;re also not, allegedly, the terrorists themselves. Certain members of the secret society, in theory, would be running operations that employ terrorist type people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t thought about it enough to tell you why they&#39;d do it in this manner, but supposedly putting sort of subconscious clues is a fairly regular &#39;TPTB&#39; strategy.</p>

<p>It can get really deep into occult stuff and the nature of reality or whatever, but basically if you put the idea that something will happen into the collective consciousness, that will actually <em>cause</em> the event (or whatever) to manifest itself in reality.  Law of Attraction I think they call it.</p>

<p>Have you watched &#39;The Secret&#39;?  Pretty good intro to this thought process IMO, even if you think its nonsense.  You still have to actively work towards your goals, but the act of visualizing it facilitates its appearance in reality or somesuch.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting at is that its not so much of a calling card, as it is a &#39;coincidental&#39; result of these peoples work.  They work hard and put a lot of mental energy into something, and it synchronizes itself with other things that they put a lot of mental energy into (like the number 322).  Maybe they didn&#39;t plan the bomb to explode at 9:11, but the fact that 9/11 has become such a significant event worldwide has left a huge impression in the collective unconscious (if you go for that) that it causes events like this to synchronize &#39;coincidentally&#39;.</p>

<p>As long as the terrorist incident takes place after the game, and is a result of the terrorists being supporters of the team that lost the match, people probably won&#39;t mind so much.  I had been under the impression that an after-game riot was more or less considered traditional for a soccer match anyway.  You riot if your team lost, and the other supporters riot if theirs did.</p>

<p>Could there be inspiration behind these correlations? Of course, and my first speculation would be the members of S&amp;B at the higher levels of defense and military industry across the world; this would undeniably be an important date to members.

    <div class="md"><p>Pick a number between one and ten.  Chances are, you&#39;ll pick 7.</p>

<p>Numerology and ritual magic are very real- even though they sound crazy.</p>

<p>Watch the video from the managing director of the IMF, where she compresses everything into the MAGIC NUMBER 7:  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYmViPTndxw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYmViPTndxw</a> </p>

<p>also note that 3/22 (3+2+2) compresses to 7, as does the year: (16= 1+6-&gt;7). Today is the 81st day of the year (8-1=7) The 25th is GOOD friday (2+5=7, 3[2+5]-&gt;777)- the day jesus was crucified on Calvary/ Golgotha (known in almost all religious texts other than the King James as THE SKULL). 777 in christianity represents the triune god- the antithesis of 666.  This good friday is a significant date.  I suspect there will be a raid on the 25th resulting in the capture/ death of the remaining terror suspect(s) (Either that or late next thursday 3/31).</p>

<p>You can make anything look like a pattern- sure.  But as humans we are prone to recognizing patterns.  7 and 3 are lucky primes.  You can call it apophenia, but psychology and magic recognize that people can be manipulated with patterns.  Perhaps it&#39;s not just a mechanism our brains have divised to make sense of information- perhaps the universe is mathematical in a way science can&#39;t yet measure.  The occult attempts to recreate natural patterns to manage the inherent chaos.  </p>

<p>There being numerological significance in a date doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s a manipulated event, but it IS a ritualistic event whether or not it&#39;s manipulated.</p>

<p>First, excellent fact post. Kudos.</p>

<p>Second, you are correct, we shouldn&#39;t jump to conclusions - but there IS a question that can and SHOULD be asked by everyone:</p>

<p><strong>WHO STANDS TO BENEFIT</strong>, and how? </p>

<p>Obviously, most people will immediately assume that the attacks were coordinated by  ISIS or other Jihadist Muslim groups - but to what end? What are they hoping to achieve by doing this?</p>

<p>Like 9-11 and the Paris attacks, the reaction and response from Europe and &quot;The West&quot; - emotional, political, social and military - is fairly predictable - RAIN HELL ON ISIS and Evil Mooselimbs!!! </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that Muslims worldwide are jumping for joy at the prospect. /s</p>

<p>Of course people will say that <em>&quot;Muslims are stupid and irrational, and don&#39;t think things through&quot;</em>, but <strong><em>really?</em></strong></p>

<p>So, are there other parties/political entities that might gain political or other advantages thanks to the VERY predictable reaction and response to these attacks? There have been in the past.</p>

<p><strong>Cui Bono?</strong></p>

<p>Those facts, the Parliament meeting and significance of the day, could have meaning to somebody with means to coordinate - doesn&#39;t necessarily mean false flag - lest we forget that terrorism&#39;s number one goal is often political momentum (and fear).</p>

<p>The sad truth, in response to your comment, is that while more facts and more information are needed to truly dissect this event -- the longer we wait, the more &quot;sludge&quot; clogs up the information pipeline, and often times pertinent facts are lost and buried beneath speculation and narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True and I appreciate the fact post. The thing that bothers me about this, France, 911, etc is that in these sophisticated attacks, there&#39;s only one attack. </p>

<p>The point of terrorism, and we see this in the void left in Iraq or the war the US/EU started in Syria by arming/training ISIL/ISIS, is that you keep going. Attack after attack after attack. But we don&#39;t see that. Here they conveniently find these other explosives. </p>

<p>I feel like the powers that be might justify these types of events as killing a small amount of people to bring about a better whole. A group wanting to make a meaningful impact via an attack like this, would want to keep going and going, until they run out of people or the security situation changes to prevent future attacks. </p>

<li><p>It might be that humans have a natural, usually constant level of hate they need to maintain. In that model, more hate against Muslims would mean less Jew hatred. What of it? Even if you showed correlation, which you haven&#39;t, it would not imply that one is caused by the other.</p></li>
<li><p>The political parties that rise because of Muslim hatred in Europe are mostly nationalists. This has <em>never</em> been good for the Jews. Perhaps now the nationalists are busy hating Muslims; I think it&#39;s likely that it&#39;s only a matter of time before they remember that Jews are hate-worthy. If indeed the Elders of Zion planned to destabilize the West to reduce antisemitism, then they are very very stupid, because this is a very stupid, dangerous and ineffective plan that would likely backfire, had it existed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;d like to hear more about the logistics of this. How does it work? Do Belgium and France not notice that the people attacking them are Mossad agents? No one notices except for people who look for minor differences in different news reports and invariably decide it&#39;s the Global Zionist Cabal&#39;s fault? Or maybe Belgium does know it&#39;s attacked by the Jews but can&#39;t do anything about it? Do tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing right there. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a thing as The Muslims that attempt to work for the Greater Good of the Global Muslim Conspiracy, because I recognize that people are individuals who form complex relationships with each other and work each on their own motives. I don&#39;t try to divide the world into The Jews, The Muslims, The Satanic Elite etc the way other people do. This lets me, in my humble opinion, hold a less coarse, more fine-grained model of the world in my head. I don&#39;t need to decide whether it&#39;s The Jews or The Muslims. I don&#39;t need a group of a dozen Muslim terrorists to work for the greater good of The Muslims. It might be that several Muslims hold different views about what constitutes a benefit and what doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>What drives terrorism - that&#39;s a difficult question to answer. I can&#39;t give you an answer right now. An answer to that question will be <em>complex</em>. There is obviously more than one type of terrorism, and likely more than one type of terrorist, and quite possibly more than one type of Islamic terrorist, working for possibly different agenda. I&#39;m sure books have been written on the subject; Google shows up several interviews with current and ex- Muslim terrorists. If I had unlimited time, I&#39;d listen to them and try to form an opinion as to what they think they&#39;d be getting out of their actions.</p>

<p>Of course, they might not be getting what they think they&#39;d be getting. I think people pretty often act irrationally. I&#39;m sure you&#39;d agree here. If they think they&#39;re in for 72 virgins and furthering the coming of the Mahdi, then of course I personally disagree but it might still be what they&#39;re working towards. And I don&#39;t need The Muslims need to agree with them about that; it doesn&#39;t require many people to perform terror attacks. </p>

<p>tl;dr? I don&#39;t have an answer. But to show that Islamic Terrorism doesn&#39;t exist you&#39;d have to show that no Muslims think terrorism is a good idea. Is that your line of attack?</p>

<p>The logical place for <em>who</em> to do it?</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the suicide bombers were Jihadist morons (who else would put on a suicide vest?), but those that planned and coordinated the attacks were not necessarily Jihadists - though I&#39;m sure that the suicide bombers <em>thought</em> they were.</p>

<p>The reaction to these kinds of attacks is VERY predictable. What do those that planned the attacks hope to gain politically?</p>

<p>Agreed, that&#39;s why I&#39;m having trouble envisioning ISIS (or any similar Muslim group) as the &quot;planning party&quot; here, as the predictable reactions will all be negative for Muslims in general and Jihadists in particular. </p>

The sheer number of unexploded devices does make me think that they rushed out what they had, and only a few of the explosives managed to actually detonate. If we say, conservatively speaking, half of the bombs managed to detonate (as opposed to the 3 known now), then it&#39;s reasonable to say that it would have brought Belgium, and much of the EU to its knees. The presence of an unexploded suicide belt at the airport does point to some part of a cell being out there still alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All you people do on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is take any attack, whatever attack it is, doesn&#39;t matter, and you sit there and you pick apart the story before ANYONE has all the answers and call it a hoax. You think that because a reporter got a piece of information wrong, it means that someone is hiding something and its a hoax. Give me a break, if you have ACTUAL evidence behind why you think something is a conspiracy by all means, post it and I&#39;ll probably agree with you if its convincing enough. But its VERY sad at this point that people like that &quot;daddie_o&quot; person are taken seriously with such weak ass &quot;evidence&quot; and tries to pass it off like its irrefutable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no such thing as coincidence when it comes to malevolent things like this, its all planed by secret societies to push their agenda and it will only get worse it seems... if clues in movies, tv show, ads or anywhere to be honest that are hidden in the plain sight are to be take serious then in April there might be another plan in motion, i bet it will have something to do with Syria peace talks or economy.</p>

<p>The World is going down hill fast but we must find REAL solution for REAL problem and not fall for these indoctrinating, fear driven, divide and conquer tactics ! I mean we all live on this beautiful planet, why waste it and our time on it with such petty things when we can aim for a much, MUCH more Magnificent Objectives. Some say nothing will change and nobody will do anything to make this World a better place, not until it directly affects them or some MAJOR event happens... i think its much simpler then that, all it will take is for an individual to realize and come to an understanding that this is not the World they want to live in but to create a better future for them selves and their children, deep down &quot;almost&quot; (some are just hardwired for evil i guess but it goes both ways, balance is everything) every single person on this planet knows what the Right thing is... the problem here is majority simply makes a choice not to or they are simply being manipulated.</p>

<p>Nobody can really say what tomorrow brings with certainty, all of this can change over night for better or worse, those that have real power &quot;the People&quot; can make this all go away if only they would do one simple thing... do good, be good and the World will follow.</p>

<p>Love, balance, knowledge and understanding to all.</p>

<p>March 22</p>

<p>```
Country of origin labelling for certain foods: Environment and Public Health Committee Members are likely to reiterate their demand for binding EU rules on country of origin labelling of meat, processed meat, and milk. A 2013 Eurobarometer survey showed that consumers favour such labelling of milk and meat.</p>

<p>Palestine: Palestine&#39;s Foreign Affairs Minister Riad Al-Malki will join Foreign Affairs Committee Members to debate the political situation there, including the inter-Palestinian reconciliation talks, the economic and humanitarian situation in occupied Palestinian territories, initiatives for re-launching Middle East peace process, and the regional situation.
```</p>

<p>An interesting correlation.. BDS labelling of goods followed directly by a debate on the topic of palestine..... hmmmmmm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello, my first Reddit post ever, literally made this account so I could post! </p>

<p>Now before I go for the conspiracy side; I&#39;m gonna take it at face value. </p>

<p>We (The west and the US) have been bombing the middle east for the best part of twenty years. </p>

<p>Look at how people have reacted to the terrorist attacks in Paris, false flag or not, riled up people&#39;s reactions against Islam and Muslim people. Now, we could see why groups of people Mujahadeen, Al-kahida, IS/ISIS/ISIL, whatever they call themselves now; would bother to attack the West, they may be run by different people, they may be funded in different ways. We&#39;re bombing the shit out of their homes, and their lives, their shops and streets and schools and hospitals.</p>

<p>So. Actually. ALTHOUGH I DON&#39;T CONDONE OR ADVOCATE VIOLENCE I completely understand why they&#39;d want to be RETALIATING attacking Europe / UK / US / Russia. </p>

<p>The question I&#39;d be asking has been asked already in this thread. - With all the mass surveillance, data trawling, encryption breaking, captured leaders. </p>

<p>How did security services not catch this? Maybe the government and security services did. They just chose to do nothing about it. Maybe the terrorist cell; when they realised that their leader was caught and talking; moved up the timetable to get ahead of the security services. Another person on the thread had also commented a number of american politicians had passed through the airport that morning; perhaps the terrorists were just hoping to get lucky?</p>

<p>So for the conspiracy side. </p>

<p>Brussels today; Palestine peace talks; Brussels is THE heart of the European Union; if I was a terrorist and I wanted to make a propaganda coup; regardless of my sponsors; that&#39;s what I&#39;d do, Paris, Brussels, even so far back as 7/7, London. Capital cities the hearts of most countries cultures and some of the most densely populated cities on earth, disrupting peace talks....makes sense for whatever government around the world is supporting ISIS.</p>

<p>It also leads into a number of other arguments; there is the encryption argument which is sure to be linked. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160322/11200133982/before-we-even-know-details-politicians-rush-to-blame-encryption-brussels-attacks.shtml">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160322/11200133982/before-we-even-know-details-politicians-rush-to-blame-encryption-brussels-attacks.shtml</a></p>

<p>Stripping of the right to privacy and higher levels of the police state; cameras; increased militarization of the police services and increased military presences. Ensuring that the UK doesn&#39;t leave the EU; &quot;Strength Through Unity; Unity through faith.&quot; Making sure that the UK stays in to push through TTP? (Or whichever variant is for the EU and the UK) so that the corporatocracy is extended as much as possible across all states? </p>

<p>Anyway, I could talk more but I&#39;d not like to bore you all too much; </p>

<p>Thanks for reading! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First thing I do when I hear news about a terrorist attack or suspicious disaster is check the date. Is there any sort of occult numerology behind the numbers in the date?</p>

<p>Hmmmm 3/22...is that not the number directly below the Skull &amp; Bones logo?</p>

<p>By golly, it is. It didn&#39;t take long for me to realize that Friday, November 13th was a significant date either. Regardless of whether or not it&#39;s a hoax, a false flag, or a completely real ISIS attack, since ISIS is more or less a proxy army of western forces, it&#39;s still technically a false flag. The world is just crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surprised this is the first mention of it being staged I&#39;ve found here, it certainly seems to be to me based on past events.  Every real bombing I know of even with smaller numbers of victims was verifiable straight away by both the explosion and injuries that can&#39;t be faked with a little bit of blood. I have only seen about 5 injured so far and there is meant to be over 200.   People think it&#39;s the media censoring the gory stuff but everyone carries cameras these days so we should have seen something that seemed legit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>3 confirmed Mormons (seriously injured), about 200 (rough estimate) injured, most at the train station.* and 30 total dead.</p>

<p>*The majority at the train station is sensible, due to the fact that the bomb was detonated inside a closed train car.  The bombs are reported as being shrapnel/nail bombs, and not pure explosives.  The reason I make note of the mormons is due to their religion being very conspiracy belief heavy.  Their bible and church requires them to be &#39;preppers&#39; to use a term.</p>

<p>Nov 13, 2015:  Paris Attacks:</p>

<p>Abdelhamid Abaaoud hides in St. Denis and Salah Abdeslam escapes to Belgium (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/12060524/Pot-smoking-friends-saved-Paris-attacks-suspect-Salah-Abdeslam.html">even being pulled over by police but distracting them by smoking pot...</a>).</p>

<p>Nov 18, 2015:  Saint Denis Raid.  Abaaooud suicide bombs himself in police raid.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Saint-Denis_raid">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Saint-Denis_raid</a></p>

<p>March 15th:  Police in Brussels raid house rented by under a false name.  Two suspects escape via rooftop.  Four officers injured in shootout. One suspect- Mohamed Belkaid, a 35-year-old Algerian citizen is killed shooting at police with an automatic rifle and shotgun.  Scene linked to Salah Abdeslam by a fingerprint on a glass.  Two brothers and Abdeslam now on the run.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Khalid and Ibrahim El Bakraoui, both already known from Brussels gangster environment. So the 17-year-old Khalid El Bakraoui was sentenced in 2011 to five years in prison for a series of carjackings. Ibrahim was again involved in a violent robbery of a currency exchange in Brussels and thereby opened fire on the police in January 2010. For those offenses he was sentenced to nine years in prison.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Khalid el-Bakraoui used a false name to rent a flat in Rue De Dries where police killed a gunman in a shootout on 15 March, according to RTBF. A fingerprint of Salah Abdeslam, the main suspect in the Paris terror attacks, was found during the raid</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This article claims on March 16th that the 2 brothers were detained after fleeing the raided home:</p>

<p>March 18th:  Police raid house due to a large pizza order... Abdeslam shot in leg and taken into custody along with several others.</p>

<p>In addition to the brothers, police announce that they are searching for Najim Laachraoui, 24, a Belgian citizen, and Mohamed Abrini, 31, who was recorded by a surveillance video camera with Mr. Abdeslam two days before the Paris attacks.  Laachraoui is connected via photographs and DNA with Abdeslam.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The authorities found Mr. Laachraoui’s DNA at the house in Auvelais and also at a house on Rue Henri Bergé, in the Schaerbeek section of Brussels, that was searched on Dec. 10. In the property on Rue Henri Bergé, investigators found traces of TATP, which has become the signature explosive for Islamic State operations in Europe. TATP can be made with common household products and was an ingredient in the suicide vests used in the Paris assaults. Mr. Abdeslam’s fingerprints were also found at the house.</p>

<p>If this guy is the &quot;Chief bombmaker&quot;, why is he at the scene of the most recent attack?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brussels-attacks-live-updates-airport-suspect-is-isis-chief-bomb-maker-a6947476.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brussels-attacks-live-updates-airport-suspect-is-isis-chief-bomb-maker-a6947476.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the Charleroi hideout, police had found DNA traces of Paris attacks ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud as well as Chakib Akrouh, both of whom were killed north of the French capital days after the Paris attacks under a hail of police bullets.</p>

<p>SO now all of these guys (some of whom have been dead since november) have DNA in this apartment.</p>

<p>And there&#39;s one more loose end- Laachraoui </p>

<p>Some are claiming he was arrested...</p>

<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/brussels-airport-suspect-najim-laachraoui-arrested-belgian-media-104400309.html">http://news.yahoo.com/brussels-airport-suspect-najim-laachraoui-arrested-belgian-media-104400309.html</a></p>

<p>Some are claiming he was killed...  Saying that he was one of the two who died at the airport- the other brother being the one at the train station.  The third &quot;unidentified&quot; person from the airport is still being sought.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brussels-attacks/suspected-paris-bomb-maker-najim-laachraoui-died-brussels-airport-attack-n544511">http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brussels-attacks/suspected-paris-bomb-maker-najim-laachraoui-died-brussels-airport-attack-n544511</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ktvq.com/story/31524145/manhunt-launched-for-newly-identified-paris-attacks-suspect-najim-laachraoui">http://www.ktvq.com/story/31524145/manhunt-launched-for-newly-identified-paris-attacks-suspect-najim-laachraoui</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that all of these guys were known and being publicly investigated for their connection with the Paris attacks.  The brothers who were supposedly the suicide bombers were known criminals and would have been watched closely by the justice system and intelligence services.  </p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>according to this report, one of the brothers was deported from Turkey to the Netherlands, and Turkey claims that they warned Belgium that he was a suspected foreign fighter.</p>

<p>the article also claims:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They – along with Khalid el-Bakraoui, who bombed the Maelbeek metro station – were being sought by police in connection with the terror attacks in Paris, and in particular were thought to be linked to Salah Abdeslam, one of the Paris attackers, who was arrested in Brussels this week.</p>

<p>A fourth man was also part of that police search: Mohamed Abrini, 31, a Belgian of Moroccan origin, who allegedly played a key role in planning the assault on Paris.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/mar/23/brussels-attacks-police-search-airport-bomb-suspect-live">http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/mar/23/brussels-attacks-police-search-airport-bomb-suspect-live</a></p>

<p>A fifth suspect appears to be &quot;Soufiane Kayal&quot;, who was traveling with Abdeslam (arrested on the 18th) and Mohamed Belkaïd (killed on the 15th raid on the brother&#39;s apartment).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but I&#39;ve been stuck in Utah for some time, and I can honestly say that the prepper thing is a bit weird, but when I was saying &#39;forward thinkers&#39; I meant more that they wouldn&#39;t be likely to take part in something like that unless it stood to help the church itself. (Which that type of situation wouldn&#39;t do.)  They are very insular and tend not to act too far outside church interests.  In his case, I&#39;d say it&#39;s just a case of him being at the wrong place at the wrong time, twice in a row.</p>

<p>Edit:  To explain.  The prepper thing is weird, because apparently the Mormon bible instructs them to prepare for the end of days.  They take it literally.  It&#39;s thought to originate back from the founding of their church where the US government effectively drove them out of Illinois.  They seem to expect that it&#39;ll happen again sometime in the future.  There is something of a rather nice side to it though.  Every year or so they rotate their stockpiles.  So everything that they&#39;ve held onto is donated to the homeless.</p>

<p>You are the minority, not muslims. They make up 23.41% of the world. Your world view is not more important than theirs, it is equal. Christians conquered the earth during the crusades massacring countless people. Does that mean a 10 year old white girl is a racist murderer? </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be enemies to prove a point, there is such a thing as being a neutral country with other countries because you don&#39;t believe in their ethics/laws/beliefs/ect.

<p>The issue with calling Sharia Law barbaric is that United States is equally as guilty of human rights violations.</p>

<p>It is barbaric to have more people imprisoned than anywhere else on earth.</p>

<p>It is, I agree, barbaric to issue the death penalty. But guess what, in America capital punishment is still legal.</p>

<p>Many of the things Western society accuses the Middle East of, we are far more guilty of ourselves.</p>

<p>Sharia Law is barbaric. Meanwhile America is bombing Doctors Without Borders hospitals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, after reading it (not the whole thing because I don&#39;t have time), I&#39;m not going to dispute the results the survey provides. Obviously, they spent a lot of time on it.
Having said that, it is just a survey of 38 people for every 1.62 million. For that, you cannot just show the results as a percentage of all Muslims worldwide. This is why I don&#39;t like these surveys. It is impossible to get a worldwide view when only 0.0000023% have been surveyed. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t believe in surveys. They could have surveyed a different 38000 people and got completely different results.
Let&#39;s get onto this &quot;jihadi terrorism&quot;, which I assuming you mean support for suicide bombing. The results show that in Malaysia, 18% support suicide bombing. However, 92% in Malaysia believe that the very act of suicide is morally wrong in all circumstances (otherwise, 10% of them would have ticked the &quot;depends on the situation&quot; box) - this shows either a flaw in statistics, or some people just don&#39;t know what they believe.
Another one is the Sharia Law stuff and the &quot;law of the land&quot;. Yes, all those people believe that that Sharia Law should be the law of the land. But hang on a minute; they are in their own land. They are not living in another land. They would more probably think differently if they were living in a Western country, but the questions do not relate to that, so the argument to me is invalid. Which means the Islam by stealth &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; is invalid. You see, when you start asking US or in my case AUS citizens who are also Muslims the very same question. I can guarantee you will get different results. They will say that their first obligation is to abide by the law of the land. Meaning the current law system in place. I hardly see anyone trying to change that.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Look up al-taqyia (spelling).  It is the encouragement to lie to infidels for furthering any goals of Islam.  This is something they do not talk about but it is a well-held belief amongst nearly all Muslims.  I wish I could remember where I saw some articles and quite a few videos exposing their leaders in the act.</p>

<p>As far as your suggestion that they would follow the law of tge land?  They will do so as far as avoiding going to jail but they almost never assimilate.  I could give many instances but you&#39;re likely to call them anecdotal, which they might be, in a way.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not looking long term in terms of law of the land, either.  They outbreed current citizens in the west by literally 6-7 to one.  This is factual.  What do you think will happen in one to two generations when they have a significant voting block?  Sharia law will indeed be increasing imposed upon the masses step by step.  All efforts toward racial equality, sexual equality, LGBT rights will become undone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believes what by 96%? That&#39;s not a counter. You didn&#39;t even make sense. Cherry picking? Of course I picked it out. It stood out like a sore thumb!
So now you&#39;re saying that the results are completely flawed because they are all lying to us anyway to further their goals of ruling the world. I googled it - only came up with Islamophobic websites - didn&#39;t bother going any further.
Almost never assimilate? Where do you actually get this info from? More Far right-wing websites?
Look, honestly please don&#39;t bother to reply because you&#39;ve just been found out. You are a far right-wing Islamophob that is so worried about losing his whiteness, it&#39;s starting to become extreme. Just watch out that you don&#39;t kill/hurt someone with that paranoia of yours. We have another form of extremism on our hands now, and it worries me. Another divide and conquer tactic perhaps. More division, easier for TPTB to manage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually a rather interesting feature. Facebook started it a couple years back after the Virginia Tech shooting.  (Or as a result of it I suppose). Basically, it&#39;s a status update. So, if a person is in a safe location, say out of the city, they can log into facebook and quickly tick that status.  That way their family can quickly check facebook and see the &quot;Safe&quot; mark on their page.  It&#39;s an easy way to see if someone is in no danger, without having to clog phone lines and trying to contact them.</p>
