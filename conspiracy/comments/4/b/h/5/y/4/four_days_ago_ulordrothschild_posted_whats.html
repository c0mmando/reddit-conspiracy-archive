<p>Here is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/world/europe/brussels-airport-explosions.html?hp&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0&amp;module=Endslate&amp;region=SlideShowTopBar&amp;version=EndSlate&amp;action=Click&amp;contentCollection=World&amp;slideshowTitle=Brussels%20on%20Edge%20After%20Blasts%20at%20Airport%20and%20Subway%20Station&amp;currentSlide=Endslate&amp;entrySlide=1&amp;pgtype=imageslideshow">a NYT article on the bombing</a>.  </p>

<p>Casualty counts listed as 13 dead at airport, 15 at subway, 30 wounded. A bit suspicious. But no mention yet of a drill planned around the same time. Still for now I&#39;m going with my new default assumption, which is hoax, but am open to having my mind changed.   </p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;m trying to find pictures/videos. So far not much besides smoke and people running/standing around. The metro scene seems bloodier, but it also reminds me of the Boston Marathon... if anyone finds good links to pics/videos of the events, please share. </p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4bn4op/here_is_what_actual_analysis_of_brussels_bombing/">Here is a follow-up post with a preliminary analysis of the airport bombing pics.</a></p>

<p>Real events have real family members that want real investigations. If you hoax something outright there isn&#39;t any real calls for an investigation from family members, friends...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Real victims means real families wondering what really happened to their loved ones. The 9/11 aftermath was a nightmare for the establishment since so many families wouldn&#39;t believe the official story. When you can establish a bunch of identities and then report them as deaths, there will be a lot fewer people digging for real answers.</p>

<p>Of course, I don&#39;t know if this is a hoax, I&#39;ve barely looked into it at all. But it will take some good footage to prove anything to me. The lack of civilian footage in recent attacks definitively proving casualties, particularly Paris, seems to be an impossible anomaly in this day considering the ubiquitous presence of HD cameras in almost everyone&#39;s pocket.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, this Brussels deal is every bit the Hamlet Boston was. 200 people hurt, limbs blown everywhere, but all we see is more bright-red blood and not a single flesh wound? People receiving oxygen while casually texting on their phones? Nope. I&#39;d bet no one even really got hurt. No one looks terrified, nobody&#39;s screaming, many people just seem to be happy to be hanging out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct.  OP is advancing a strategy that is beloved by military intelligence for dividing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> into two factions:  serious researchers, and those who are here for a laugh and are reading <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for tabloid paranoia entertainment.</p>

<p>If &quot;everything is a hoax&quot; (not false flags, but completely artificial with zero deaths) then &quot;the conspirators are not murderers&quot;, and &quot;there are no crimes to prosecute&quot;, and &quot;nothing is real so why research criminal conspiracy or organized crime?&quot;</p>

<p>Consider OP&#39;s comment history.  90% of OP&#39;s comments are promoting the website of Miles Mathis (who proposes that everything is a hoax, including every celebrity death, every news item from the last 50 years, and even basic science &amp; physics):  &quot;Flat Earth&quot; on steroids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter.  Assume people were killed.  Assume it was an actual terror cell of islamists.  Assume connections with ISIS can and will be drawn.  Assume there will be a manhunt and that this will justify disruption and tough talk and enhanced &quot;security&quot; measures.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t even really need to be staged any more. You can almost guarantee that intelligence services are closely tracking the extremists that have come out of their training camps in yemen and syria and iraq.  SOMEONE was making these weapons available in France and Belgium.  Gun control is tight.  But there are plenty of potential extremists who have been driven out of their countries.  They&#39;ve managed to create a very real threat at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I <em>wish</em> I could go back to believing in fairy tales. Your fantasy world of &#39;chaotic chaos&#39; is actually easier to deal with psychologically than the realization that most of the chaos and death (both real and faked) is planned and used to manipulate us... But once you pull the curtains aside, you can never go back to believing that the Wizard of Oz is real. You can always see the men behind the curtain. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what&#39;s so topsy-turvy here: you are the one living in a fantasy by believing faked events are real, whereas I&#39;m living in reality by recognizing that many events which seem real to you are actually faked. Quite the mind fuck. Well, nobody said they weren&#39;t good at what they do. </p>

<p>Because nobody could <strong>REALLY</strong> hate the West and want to take revenge on it, after we have spent the past fifteen years bombing large chunks of the Middle East into oblivion. They all love us over there! It can only be De Ebil Gubment! </p>

<p>And I guess all the suicide bombers and IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistant must be &quot;false flags&quot; as well. Or if that isn&#39;t, explain why that terrorism can&#39;t be exported to the West, along with the millions of refugees? It&#39;s also funny how &quot;they&quot; are so willing to kill hundreds of thousands of people there, but according to Daddie_O, utterly balk at actually killing anyone in Paris or Boston. </p>

<p>Like so much of the &quot;false flag&quot; idiocy, it makes absolutely no sense at all. Bad people exist in the world, willing to die and kill for their cause. And they aren&#39;t the CIA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh please. Your argument is so weak you can&#39;t even address any of the evidence I&#39;ve linked to directly. Instead you&#39;re confusing the issue and putting words into my mouth. </p>

<p>Did I say nobody could really hate the West? No. </p>

<p>Did I say or imply that IEDs must be false flags? No. You are the one comparing an alleged terrorist attack in Belgium to guerilla warfare in Iraq. </p>

<p>Did I say they love us over there? No. </p>

<p>Did I say terrorism can&#39;t be exported? No. But you have to look and think critically who is behind it and who is behind the exportation of refugees, which is something you refuse to do. </p>

<p>And yes, I agree that bad people exist in the world and are willing to die and kill for their cause. Which makes the CIA&#39;s job of recruiting into these organizations (through proxies) all that much easier. </p>

<p>Nor did I say they balk at killing anyone in Paris or Boston. I simply said they didn&#39;t kill anyone. I&#39;m quite sure they have no qualms against it -- it&#39;s just a lot easier to get away with a false flag when you don&#39;t have actual victims trying to get answers and seek justice. They learned that lesson after 9/11. </p>

<p>It&#39;s stunning the intellectual gymnastics you have to go through to justify your position. What you describe would be utterly impossible. Show me one example in the past, oh, 70 years of anyone faking the deaths of over 130 people in a public location, as you claim happened in Paris. </p>

<p>Actually, the grounds that I&#39;m rejecting it on are on the basis of my previous knowledge that those other attacks are also false flags. Again, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a hoax or not. But I know it&#39;s a false flag. </p>

<p>Well, it happened in Paris. So there&#39;s an example. But let&#39;s say it&#39;s not a hoax and people actually died in Paris. Are you going to say there&#39;s no example of the CIA killing innocent Europeans in false flag attacks? Then you obviously haven&#39;t heard of Operation Gladio.</p>

<p>Your obfuscation of the rhetoric used is telling of either misunderstanding or intent to mislead.</p>

<p>edit: after reading these comments. Man you folks who do not understand rhetoric and the meaning of words really need to go and learn about rhetoric and the definition of words because if you were more knowledgeable on rhetoric you may just be aware that HOAX does NOT connote that an entire event is faked or staged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they all have support groups -- that&#39;s the fucking point. Of course, go beyond that &quot;modest&quot; amount of research and you might just find that these charities and support groups are little more than political theatre. To take your guns? Taking your guns does align with the globalist agenda, but I think it goes way beyond your guns. I think they do it as a sort of occult ritual sacrifice, they offer such poor evidence and shady circumstances to flaunt it in our faces, such that even if you&#39;re eyes are half opened to the agenda, it&#39;s like breaking the fourth wall of reality. It&#39;s like an actor winking directly at the camera in the middle of a movie, acknowledging that you are watching a film and breaking the immersion. They always hide their signature, because they must. They are, after all, psychopaths who cannot help but to leave a hint, they always leave a hint. I&#39;m sure if they wanted to they could pull one off that didn&#39;t have all of these awfully strange coincidences, but if they did then we couldn&#39;t figure it out and they wouldn&#39;t get that strange psychopathic high they get off fucking others over. </p>

<p>Nope. It actually isn&#39;t. And it will take more than an &quot;evidence thread&quot; with such &quot;proof&quot; as Obama mangling his words and an UTTERLY discredited story (from a ludicrous source and with no supporting evidence) about an Israeli colonel being captured, to show otherwise. Frankly, you&#39;re giving the CIA <strong>way</strong> too much credit. At worst, ISIS is unintended consequences of the campaign to unseat Qadaffi in Libya - just as Al Qaeda were unintended consequences of the campaign against the Soviets in Afghanistan. </p>

<p>There are plenty of people who hate the West, and will happily attack us, even if they have to die to do it. You don&#39;t need to false flag anything: the last 15 years in Afghanistan and Iraq proves that beyond all doubt - and certainly beyond a few shitty Youtube videos. With, literally, millions of &quot;refugees&quot; now flooding into Western Europe, there is absolutely no reason why some of those won&#39;t be bringing that violent hate with them. THAT is what we are seeing in Paris and Brussels. </p>

And how could you have possible watched 75 minutes of well-sourced youtube videos in just a few minutes and concluded that they&#39;re &#39;shitty?&#39; Shouldn&#39;t you actually watch them before you make up your mind? I guess you &#39;just know&#39; they&#39;re shitty because they disagree with your viewpoint. </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ll just tiptoe away here. Wouldn&#39;t want to disturb your blissful slumber. Sweet dreams. Don&#39;t let the bed bugs bite. </p>

<p>[EDIT: I used to believe that things like Al Qaeda were unintentional CIA &#39;blowback.&#39; Until I learned that I wasn&#39;t giving the CIA nearly enough credit. They <em>seem</em> to be causing blowback at every turn. Makes for a good covery story. But eventually I woke up and realized it wasn&#39;t blowback at all. It was intended and controlled.]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Nice link, but don&#39;t worry I get it. These people are transparent. I honestly don&#39;t know why they bother. Kind of sad, actually. I do hope they&#39;re getting paid well, not that they&#39;ve really earned it. But since calling people &#39;shills&#39; is verboten in this subreddit, I like to point out the idiocy in case there are people who don&#39;t immediately see through their act.</p>

<p>The fact that you think that all the refugees flowing into Europe right now come from Syria already shows how ill informed you are about current events. Even mainstream news sources will tell you that many or even most are not even from Syria.  </p>

<p>Let me guess, you&#39;re going to respond in less than 10 minutes with some pathetic response trying to discredit all of this evidence through a straw man. Go ahead, it&#39;s fine.

    <div class="md"><p>It didn&#39;t even take 10 minutes., I started reading the Storm Clouds Gathering article (picked at random), and it rapidly demonstrated such a woeful ignorance of the way the world actually works, e.g. conflating all anti-Assad forces in Syria as if they were a single homogeneous army, that I simply couldn&#39;t continue. These are not people looking at the facts and analyzing them to come to conclusions. These are people cherry-picking and distorting facts, in order to come to a conclusion they&#39;ve already decided is the truth. And you do exactly the same:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I didn&#39;t say ANYTHING about where the refugees come from. I didn&#39;t even mention Syria. <strong>You are flat-out lying</strong>. That ISIS=CIA/MOSSAD proponents such as you simply have to make stuff up - also like the &quot;captured Israeli colonel&quot; story - demonstrates exactly how feeble the evidence actually is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>30+ <em>reported</em> casualties is not the same as <em>real</em> casualties. They can make up whatever numbers they want, or do you still believe what you see on the TV news and read in newspapers? </p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson knew what was up back in his day, and what he wrote is as true then as it is now: &quot;Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper.... The real extent of this state of misinformation is known only to those who are in situations to confront facts within their knowledge with the lies of the day. I really look with commiseration over the great body of my fellow citizens, who, reading newspapers, live &amp; die in the belief, that they have known something of what has been passing in the world in their time; whereas the accounts they have read in newspapers are just as true a history of any other period of the world as of the present, except that the real names of the day are affixed to their fables. General facts may indeed be collected from them, such as that Europe is now at war, that Bonaparte has been a successful warrior, that he has subjected a great portion of Europe to his will, &amp;c., &amp;c.; but no details can be relied on. I will add, that the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods &amp; errors. He who reads nothing will still learn the great facts, and the details are all false.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>False flag = doing something while pretending to be someone else so they get blamed.</p>

<p>So you KNOW who did this? There is NO WAY it could have been someone pretending to be someone else?</p>

<p>Cui bono?</p>

<p>Terrorists would do this to make sure EU lets in more migrants right? That is total nonsense. Why would you attack the place you are clearly slowly taking over via slow migration? This would only make migrants look bad to the EU.</p>

<p>The terrorists would do this to make the EU and migrants MORE CONFILCTED? </p>

<p>Why would terrorists do this, it makes no sense to me. They have nothing to gain and everyhting to lose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because their goal isn&#39;t a slow takeover by migration. The migrants are actually fleeing from a warzone, they aren&#39;t some invasion wave seeking to Islamize Europe, they&#39;re actual refugees. The goal of ISIS is to get the rest of the world to close their borders to the refugees.</p>

<p>If the refugees have no other option than to stay in the warzone, ISIS benefits in two ways. 1. It lets them continue to make life a living hell for the Muslims who won&#39;t join them, increasing the pressure on these Muslims to join up and 2. it allows them to generate their own narrative where the Western World have turned their back on the plight of the Middle East, that Westerners are afraid of and hateful towards Muslims, and that it really comes down to us vs. them. The Islamic State vs. the Western World. The goal of ISIS is to create a caliphate to wage a holy war with the Western World, this is basically in their mission statement. In order to make that happen, they need to build an army large enough and strong enough to put up a fight, and they need to whip anti-Islamic sentiment in the West into such a frenzy that they can convincingly say that there is a war between the two.</p>

<p>You&#39;re stuck in your own perception of what is going on, and its blinding you to other possibilities. From your perspective, they have nothing to gain and everything to lose. From my perspective, its the opposite. One does not necessarily invalidate the other.</p>

If so why is her stomach completely unaffected? It looks like her jacket is also completely incinerated up to her underarms on the left side but the sleeve is fine and her hand completely clean. Just someone... Help me... My brain can&#39;t accept this picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Nice link, but don&#39;t worry I get it. These people are transparent. I honestly don&#39;t know why they bother. Kind of sad, actually. I do hope they&#39;re getting paid well, not that they&#39;ve really earned it. But since calling people &#39;shills&#39; is verboten in this subreddit, I like to point out the idiocy in case there are people who don&#39;t immediately see through their act.</p>
