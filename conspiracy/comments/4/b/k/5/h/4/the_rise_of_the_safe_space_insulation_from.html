       The internet is great, but as was pointed out in the Aaron Swartz video that was going around yesterday, it has the ability to create safe-havens for people of a similar mindset and with similar interests. The positive is that people can learn from people who are trying to learn the same things they are. The negative is that it creates echo-chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXQkXXBqj_U">
        "safe space"
       </a>
       is key to the polarization we see on a societal scale. The historically new communication method of the internet has changed the way we interact with other people. Physical distance becomes much less important, and "information distance" becomes much
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       important. If you spend a lot of time with one community, like r/conspiracy, this biases how you think about the world because there is a lot of positive reinforcement on this sub, just like every sub. Everyone generally agrees with each other, or else you leave to find a different website that does accept you. Everyone is doing this, we are self-sorting in a way, but by ideologies instead of geographical location.
      </p>
      <p>
       So everyone gets sucked in to their little niche communities, and the hivemind guides the discourse of the community. Opposing opinions are deemed as upsetting/annoying nuisances to be shut out, to avoid getting super pissed off, rather than food for thought. When polarized about a certain concept (like being super liberal, or being super right-wing) the opposing polarization not only looks incorrect, but it looks nonsensical! It looks instantly foolish, to the point where you wonder how the other side can take itself seriously. You then see these people as idiots, because they clearly cannot think logically at all. The trick is though, they see you the exact same way. And it's because you're not seeing each other clearly, not seeing the real person and the real beliefs, you're seeing strawman examples of the other side, presented in your echo chamber as the truth. You see the worst of them, and the best of your side. And they see their best, and your worst. So then both sides think they are the best, and that the other side is the worst. This is the dictionary definition of social polarization.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter what we are polarized on, be it important like politics or religion or unimportant like what beer you like or what computer brand is best. The other side seems dumb, if you are seriously emotionally devoted to your side. This is why vehemently taking sides
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       leads to clouded and lazy thinking. When you affiliate with a "side" you literally give your thoughts away to the ideology of that particular groupthink. It is an out-sourcing of thinking from your own brain, which is extremely convenient, which is why so many people do it constantly despite it clouding the truth. It's
       <em>
        so comfortable
       </em>
       to be able to feel confident in your ideology, that the answers belong to it and therefore you are freed from the need to cognate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easier, so people do it. They put their faith in that ideology until holding on to it becomes more difficult than letting go. You get fooled enough times, you learn to stop being fooled. If you're never made to look foolish, you may never find the need to let go. Buying in to ideologies is a fool's game, used to control our destinies en masse instead of us controlling them ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet has changed that game, with a massive explosion of information availability. Now begins the age of the safe space. This is our culture now. The internet is our culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure how we are going to adapt to this sweeping change in human behavior, but at least we can take a moment to stop and think about where we currently stand.

       I think it's time to re-read "The Machine Stops" by E.M. Forster (a book published in 1909).  Good fictional reminder of how this might end up.

       It's especially bad with young liberals. Where to even mention you support someone else besides Sanders or especially a none Democrat gets you the angry stare. And if you support Trump then they think your a real life Nazi, and go ballistic. I don't really see a way to deal with the issue though. Humans naturally group up to people of like mind if they can, and the Internet makes that easy. You see young people on their phone 24/7. So their group is their world, and the local people around them are ignored.

       It's causing this intense polarization, which when combined with the economic failures of the last 30 years for the middle class, has left people getting more desperate and emotional by the day. I honestly fear deep civil divides that might result in war. People need to get better at tolerating opposing opinions, and school is letting young people down in this regard. It generally teaches obedience to authority, instead of free thinking, which is what is needed. People are scared to openly question authority because they've never really done it before. That's not a problem the French have, for example. They protest freely, it is almost a national past-time. And as a result they have pretty good labor laws and a beefy middle class. In the USA we do not protest, because we are afraid of having our lives ruined or being killed or something extreme. We are out of practice in being able to stand up for ourselves, and now it's coming home to roost. Americans are overly domesticated. We had things too good for too long, and we forgot what it means to have to earnestly stand up for the prosperity of the middle class, even against resistance.

       I do not see that we are overdomesticated.  We are too fractured among ourselves from too long ago, so that we do not protect each other, leading to really bad consequences for the people who DO stand up.  In France, they have a strong, unified culture with few subcultures, so that protesting is a common ideal.  In the USA, if one group protests, another group will knock them down.  A protestor grabs a microphone from a presidential candidate, one group sees that as a valuable move toward awareness, other people see it as rude by the protestor and weak by the politician.  From the time the Puritans invaded, America has been a country of warring subcultures.  It's not like listening only to your point of view is new around here.  At least now we only send mean tweets, instead of stringing people up in a tree.
