    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that was definitely one of the aspects that made me wonder so much. It looks just like something off of 4chan or twitch plays Pokemon. If someone were to come forward and say it was all an elaborate troll I wouldn&#39;t be surprised, but all signs point to it being genuine.. And after using Reddit for a few years now it appears to starkly contrast to the content that usually rises to the front page. So either there really are that many disenfranchised silent majority redditors upset with reddit&#39;s largely leftist bend who are becoming the loudest voice in the room or they&#39;re coming to Reddit from elsewhere.. It&#39;s interesting regardless </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the progressive left is actually a pretty small group and most Americans - Republicans and Democrats - are &quot;conservative&quot; when compared to Bernie-bros and the progressives.</p>

<p>Sometimes people don&#39;t realize this, since the Corporate Media, the Fortune 500, and the &quot;establishment&quot; are left-wing. The &quot;progressive&quot; left are nothing but footsoldiers for the corporate elite, but are too dim to realize that they support everything the wealthy Corporate Elite do.</p>

<p>Except every survey shows this not to be true.</p>

<p><em>Polling shows that the public is much closer to the progressive view. The latest survey of the National Election Studies (NES) shows, for example, a preference for a vigorous government role in a complex world. Sixty-seven percent said we need a strong government to handle complex economic problems. Nearly 58 percent said government should be doing more, not less; and 59 percent agreed that government has grown because the country&#39;s problems have grown.</em></p>

<p>You are simply defining &quot;progressive&quot; in the way you want.</p>

<p>None of those issues polled are &quot;progressive&quot; in the sense as the term is usually used: for mass immigration, against &quot;white privilege,&quot; spreading &quot;democracy and human rights&quot; via wars.</p>
