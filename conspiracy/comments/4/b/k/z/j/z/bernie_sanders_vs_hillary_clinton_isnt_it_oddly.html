They reported 800,000 voters to 60 polling places, yet the votes are currently 1% accounted for and HC has 194,453 to Bernie&#39;s 118,842 and apparently Clinton already won... You have Illinois where people were turned away just like here in Arizona and they are currently allowing late voting in lieu. The current count in Illinois is 1,017,006 to Bernies 982,017... (as far as i know that&#39;s the count still from Tuesday)  Am I crazy, or is this how rigged the presidential campaign trail is? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would you still wait in line if the candidate you were voting for had already &#39;lost&#39;? Shit that&#39;s a neat way to rig it. Just broadcast on CNN that Sanders lost, his voters go home, he actually loses. If they had stayed, who knows? </p>

<p>But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure if something like that was happening we would know about it, right? Surely somebody would make sure that doesn&#39;t happen, right? I&#39;ll just go watch Dancing With The Stars because I&#39;m sure somebody is making sure I&#39;m safe and that no bad things can happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blah, blah, blah. This is the same tired theory I&#39;ve heard so many times. She fucked up as Sec of State. Hilary is a Clinton, and no where near as powerful as a Kennedy. Look at JFK. You people are really looking too shallow. Sigh.....</p>
