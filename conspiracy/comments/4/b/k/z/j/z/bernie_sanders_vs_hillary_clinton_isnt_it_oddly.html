       Less than 2 hours and Google and major news are reporting winners while we still have people in line. They reported 800,000 voters to 60 polling places, yet the votes are currently 1% accounted for and HC has 194,453 to Bernie's 118,842 and apparently Clinton already won... You have Illinois where people were turned away just like here in Arizona and they are currently allowing late voting in lieu. The current count in Illinois is 1,017,006 to Bernies 982,017... (as far as i know that's the count still from Tuesday)  Am I crazy, or is this how rigged the presidential campaign trail is?

       Would you still wait in line if the candidate you were voting for had already 'lost'? Shit that's a neat way to rig it. Just broadcast on CNN that Sanders lost, his voters go home, he actually loses. If they had stayed, who knows?
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't worry, I'm sure if something like that was happening we would know about it, right? Surely somebody would make sure that doesn't happen, right? I'll just go watch Dancing With The Stars because I'm sure somebody is making sure I'm safe and that no bad things can happen.

       Other than the default inclination of
       <em>
        paranoid
       </em>
       conspiracy theorists leaning on inadequate coincidental details, there is no convincing evidence that Bernie Sanders is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  His history paints a very different picture, not requiring imaginary lines to connect ambiguous dots.

       No, because there’s no way that Hillary wasn’t handed the 2016 nomination in exchange for stepping down in 2008. She hasn’t had to worry about anything she has done since then. She’s absolutely golden save for rogue elements in government. And even then Obama will just pardon her.

       Blah, blah, blah. This is the same tired theory I've heard so many times. She fucked up as Sec of State. Hilary is a Clinton, and no where near as powerful as a Kennedy. Look at JFK. You people are really looking too shallow. Sigh.....

       It is mathematically impossible for Gutman to win the nomination. It’s just not going to happen. Because it was never going to happen. He has been put up to give the illusion of choice.

       Oh, fun fact. When he loses, all his money goes to Hillary. So all these Berniebots are directly funding her campaign!

       Arizona held a primary with early voting. Idaho and Utah held one day caucuses. Of course Arizona is going to be reporting early totals -- it's because they have the results of early voting.

       Arizona has an early ballot where they mail out ballots and people return them before the actual polling day. A lot of people vote like this and this is why a lot of results are back so early.

       What I find more interesting is that with the 2+ hour long lines in Maricopa county, the most liberal and populous part of AZ which had 60% of Democratic voters, Shillary's win in AZ was reported while there were extremely long voting lines shown on live TV.
