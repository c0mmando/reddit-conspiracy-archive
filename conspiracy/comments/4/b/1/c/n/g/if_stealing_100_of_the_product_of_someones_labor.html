       <em>
        Slavery deprives the slave of the right of private property in his own person, as well as the right to sell his labor in a  free marketplace. In effect, it is taxation at the rate of 100%. America’s Founders objected to British rule in part because they thought “taxation without representation” was a form of slavery, but British taxes on the colonies then were nowhere near as high as taxes in America today. Is there a point below 100% where taxes could be high enough to say that taxpayers are effectively enslaved?
       </em>
       Cited for the following post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the claim that “taxation is slavery” is pretty much a commonplace among libertarians. What is most important about this particular passage(cited above) is the way in which it drew out that common idea to its logical conclusion. If (partial) taxation is (partial) slavery, then 100% taxation ought to be 100% slavery. In other words, 100% taxation would be morally or “effectively” identical to slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except that it isn’t. It just clearly isn’t. Even with a rate of taxation of 100%, no one would be forcing you to labor, they would merely (“merely”) be forcibly extracting 100% of the proceeds of your labor. If you chose not to work at all (and why wouldn’t you choose this?), no one would be stopping you. A taxation rate of 100% does not give anyone else the right to physically beat you just because you aren’t working hard enough, or because they didn’t like the tone in your voice, or because you looked at a white woman the wrong way. A taxation rate of 100% doesn’t give anybody the right to forcibly separate you from your family. It doesn’t give anyone the right to buy you or sell you, or tell you where you have to live, or prevent you from learning how to read or from speaking your mind, etc., etc., etc…
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is to say, obviously, that taxing people at a rate of 100% wouldn’t be a gross moral wrong. I wouldn’t even deny that it would be wrong for many of the same reasons that slavery is wrong. But it’s not the same thing. And it’s not anywhere close to the same magnitude of wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Libertarians have a genuinely valuable insight, I think, when they claim that the power to tax the proceeds of another person’s labor gives the holder of that right a partial property right in the other person. But a property right is a bundle. And even a right to tax all of the proceeds of another person’s labor still falls well short of the kind of property right that masters had in their slaves in the context of the African salve trade.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this is obvious to most people. Even if taxation and slavery are both bad, and both bad for many of the same reasons, there are obviously morally significant differences between them. And so when libertarians act like those differences aren’t there, or that they don’t matter, other people don’t think – “Wow, what a principled and radical idea!” They just think the people saying it are kind of thick, or very stupid.

       From the headline, for some reason I thought you were talking about burgers, cars, websites like amazon...and not the government.   To that I would say it's slavery due to working is by the following formula:
      </p>
      <p>
       ((Business' annual profit / num_employees) / employee income) * 10
      </p>
      <p>
       Government slavery == amount of income tax they take + property tax + sales tax - 22%
      </p>
      <p>
       The 22% is what you actually get out of the government.

       If you are stealing ANY of someone's labor and they have no viable alternative but to let you continue to steal it, it's slavery. If you are stealing ALL of someone's labor yet they can leave your employ for a better situation at any time without negative consequence, it's not slavery. The best situation is when you are adding value to someone's labor and they are voluntarily giving you some percentage of that added value.
