       WOW I just found my new favorite subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't help but compare those posts to the kind of stuff that goes on Facebook. I think one of the consequences of mass surveillance is we are afraid to have these conversations openly. Reddit's level of anonymity provides us that, even though our identities are buried in metadata and easily accessible by law enforcement and hackers. Imagine the impact if we could have this level of conversations within our communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a sign of good things to come. I think the fringe is no longer so fringe. "Woke" is being used by the left and the right.

       is better, though we're still seeing quite a bit of Trump discussion over there, little lighter on the Hillary. The discussion does tend to view it terms of the larger picture though, less focussing on specific instances and more on how the actual players may or may not be influencing certain actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       In some ways, it's almost unavoidable, and I don't necessarily think talking about the elections is bad, per se. Realizing the corruption of our political system may be the introduction to the broader conspiracies that many people need at this point.

       This is definitely something to keep in mind. Whenever there's a highly political event this sub is inundated with folks from all sides pushing their own personal agendas.
      </p>

       When shit calms down the sub will somewhat normalize and content will be more visible as long as we do our jobs in the new queue.

      <p>
       I had a look at Godlike Productions, and it's full of "Trump is anti establishment, please vote for Trump" posts. So that place is as bad as this one.

       Tavistock are a CIA media manufacturing front. Whenever anyone posted anything on glp to suggest that Tavistock were using glp to disseminate disinformation and misinformation, they were censored and banned. There might be some interesting bits of info on there but it's also heavily manipulated.

         If you search the internet for 9-11 related material, you are much more likely to find scientifically inaccurate material, deliberate misleading material or material planted by the US Intelligence Community, than you are finding useful material for further study. This is especially true if you are unfamiliar with the subject at hand, you most likely end up with a "The Arabs did it in corporation with Evil Alien Reptilians" style material, which of cause will scare away any sane person. Sometimes you can observe how the Reddit moderator team blatantly censor new 9-11 articles by rigging the votes, only to allow a wave of misleading articles and posts to flood the r/conspiracy forum.

       3) A belief that "enemies of the people" can be identified by their expression of such POVs alone

       4) And a belief that such POVs should be suppressed by any means necessary.

       It's not necessary an attack as much as it is a criticism.

       <p>
        If someone shows up and points out the shitty sourcing, the flawed reasoning, and the misstatements of facts, several commenters attack the interloper as a shill, while completely ignoring their arguments and/or documentation that the source article is wrong. If the interloper is stubborn, the discussion goes on for hundreds of comments, but ultimately most get bored with this quickly and the discussion dies.

       You're right! Al dente pasta is pasta that is undercooked slightly; it's firmer, and it takes a little longer to digest. Because it takes a little longer to digest, the conversion of carbohydrate to blood sugar is slower; this also slows the release of insulin. This is a way to make the pasta lower on the glucose index; adding some butter, fat or oil to the pasta will lower the GI further.
      </p>

       Reducing blood sugar spikes reduces the likelihood of diabetes; North America is currently experiencing an epidemic of diabetes. We want al dente,

       Well, the trick is that pasta has never really been served as a main in European culture. It's always been a side. American culture popularized the idea of serving a giant bowl as the featured course.

       From what I've seen, the most active conspiracy-related forums are all mostly about the JFK assassination. You can learn a lot by just lurking them.

       I don't know if this will be removed as a violation of Rule 10, but here is my honest opinion:
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if it was always like this, but r/conspiracy is kinda boring, and needs some new approaches to liven it up.  The process here seems to look a lot like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Someone finds an article that supports their favorite conspiracy or political viewpoint in some way and posts it without regard for whether it is in any way credible.   Hillary engaged in secret discussions with Jewish bankers, Monsanto seeking approval for new pesticide known to cause sterility in 90% of those exposed to picogram amounts, Pharmaceutical companies secretly developing drugs to treat coming wave of vaccine-induced illness, whatever.  It doesn't matter what the accusation is or what if any evidence supports it if it slams the right bad guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) At this point it forks.
      </p>
      <p>
       2a)If someone shows up and points out the shitty sourcing, the flawed reasoning, and the misstatements of facts, several commenters attack the interloper as a shill, while completely ignoring their arguments and/or documentation that the source article is wrong.  If the interloper is stubborn, the discussion goes on for hundreds of comments, but ultimately most get bored with this quickly and the discussion dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       2b) If no one is willing to show up and be the object lesson in enforcing r/conspiracy orthodoxy, the conversations runs for a half a dozen or so comments of mutual agreement and then dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could really be an interesting subreddit.  But the discussion really doesn't ever get that interesting except as a brawl, because it either consists of people agreeing with each other or engaging in personal attacks on those who don't agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disagreement here is seen as some sort of crime. Its not, its an opportunity to learn.

      <p>
       Of course there are going to be links about Hillary on a conspiracy subreddit! She is probably the most compromised Presidential nominee/candidate in American history, and the conspiracy is multi-faceted 1) how has she managed to stay out of the clutches of law enforcement all this time? 2) how is it that the mainstream media is rooting for Hillary so hard and either ignoring her opponents (Sanders) or villifying them (Trump, who it should be acknowledge is giving them plenty of material to do so)?
      </p>
      <p>
       There IS a massive overarching conspiracy, and it goes the heart of how the United States (mal)functions today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politics is dominating the subreddit at the moment because we're in an election year, but nobody is obliging you to read posts you don't like.

       ATS has become such a unproductive place. Just a bunch of skeptics arguing with other skeptics, some sort of dick measuring contest to see who is more skeptical. Nothing creative or interesting pops up there anymore. Alternative theories of events are shut out because it's considered edgy to agree with the official stance on everything and everyone on there wants to be the edgiest skeptic they can be.

       You are definitely correct, harder to get good info, are good sources and sites invite only? I like to learn and don't find it too hard to weed through the shit but I don't contribute and I don't know anyone personally who can point me in the right directions. Maybe wading through the chans for a bit can turn something up? Corbett is always good, but here and voat are useless now for quality info...

       Indeed They are, bought out or opted out by shill corps or news media broadcasters. Data control, data manipulation. 
It's all based on the transfer, delivery, and intake of data. Controlling the patterns that don't comply or conform are figurus out and disloved through bs headlines from other bs news sites. It's all bs most everywhere on the net.
A random glimmer comes through but it's just bs mainly.
Don't forget, just like a rebel movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger, take out the communication and the whole grid of control is exposed.

       Most of the conspiracy movement has been taken over by the ultra-right wing. Ever since Fox News and AM talk radio and the GOP plunged headfirst into using conspiracy theories to advance their political ends ("they're coming for our guns!" "global warming is a hoax!" "Agenda 21!"), the conspiracy movement has been all but taken over by the far-right.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah. Between now and the election, you can count on 50% or more of all posts to this forum to be lies about and bashing of Hillary. There have been many days in the past few months when probably 75% or 80% of the front page of the sub is lies about Hillary.

       True, there are a few. But this sub is probably at least 80% far right. I imagine it's mostly two groups: (1) far right conservative who voted for Bush and Cheney and rode the anti Clinton bandwagon in the 1990s, and (2) their children, people who grew up listening to Rush Limbaugh on dad's radio.
