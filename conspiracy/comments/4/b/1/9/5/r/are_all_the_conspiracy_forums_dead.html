    <div class="md"><p>WOW I just found my new favorite subreddit.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but compare those posts to the kind of stuff that goes on Facebook. I think one of the consequences of mass surveillance is we are afraid to have these conversations openly. Reddit&#39;s level of anonymity provides us that, even though our identities are buried in metadata and easily accessible by law enforcement and hackers. Imagine the impact if we could have this level of conversations within our communities.</p>

<p>This is a sign of good things to come. I think the fringe is no longer so fringe. &quot;Woke&quot; is being used by the left and the right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a> is better, though we&#39;re still seeing quite a bit of Trump discussion over there, little lighter on the Hillary. The discussion does tend to view it terms of the larger picture though, less focussing on specific instances and more on how the actual players may or may not be influencing certain actors.</p>

<p>In some ways, it&#39;s almost unavoidable, and I don&#39;t necessarily think talking about the elections is bad, per se. Realizing the corruption of our political system may be the introduction to the broader conspiracies that many people need at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Censorship</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Reddit, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Google</em></strong> are all actively rigging the access to &quot;controversial&quot; issues in relation to the 9-11 Attack, US Intelligence Community, Military Industrial Complex, US Warfare, Financial Sector, Mega Corporations, Key Figureheads and Politics. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1 Example:</em></strong> Some of the articles and research written and published just few years ago, after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Mr. Snowden</a> made his startling revelations about the US Intelligence Community blatantly illegally spying on all US citizens and the methods they use, has either gone completely missing or has been buried under mountains of government/corporate friendly data and lies. The search algorithms, offered to costumers by certain private companies, has been modified to &quot;disappear&quot; the &quot;controversial&quot; data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2 Example:</em></strong> If you search the internet for 9-11 related material, you are much more likely to find scientifically inaccurate material, deliberate misleading material or material planted by the US Intelligence Community, than you are finding useful material for further study. This is especially true if you are unfamiliar with the subject at hand, you most likely end up with a &quot;The Arabs did it in corporation with Evil Alien Reptilians&quot; style material, which of cause will scare away any sane person. Sometimes you can observe how the Reddit moderator team blatantly censor new 9-11 articles by rigging the votes, only to allow a wave of misleading articles and posts to flood the r/conspiracy forum.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3 Example:</em></strong> If you post anything on Reddit about the crushing economic inequality, corporate crimes, financial crimes, financial rigging (LIBOR, FOREX, gold, silver, interest rates) your comments section will be crushed by waves of paid government Sh!lls &amp; Pund!ts (or smart computer algorithms). If your post made it to the front page, they will immediately remove it. Most &quot;controversial&quot; posts will die a silent death due to rigging of the voting mechanics (their favorite method).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Reddit, owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publications</a>, are serving their evil overlords well, this is just another brick in the great wall of lies and disinformation, created by the corporate owned mass media in tandem with the US intelligence community. </p>

<p>So people showed up at that post and voiced opinions you did not agree with.  How exactly is that a problem?  </p>

<p>This constant search for &quot;shills&quot; and &quot;misinfos&quot; is extremely reminiscent of the search for &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; in Stalinist Russia, East Germany under the Stasi, and the Cultural Revolution for those old enough to remember.

<p>1) A belief that certain POVs are immoral </p>

<p>2) These unacceptable POVs are defined as any that are to the right of one&#39;s own</p>

<p>3) A belief that &quot;enemies of the people&quot; can be identified by their expression of such POVs alone</p>

<p>4) And a belief that such POVs should be suppressed by any means necessary. </p>

<p>The culmination of this type of thinking was Pol Pot and the Killing Fields of Cambodia.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right! Al dente pasta is pasta that is undercooked slightly; it&#39;s firmer, and it takes a little longer to digest. Because it takes a little longer to digest, the conversion of carbohydrate to blood sugar is slower; this also slows the release of insulin. This is a way to make the pasta lower on the glucose index; adding some butter, fat or oil to the pasta will lower the GI further.</p>

<p>Reducing blood sugar spikes reduces the likelihood of diabetes; North America is currently experiencing an epidemic of diabetes. We want al dente,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the trick is that pasta has never really been served as a main in European culture. It&#39;s always been a side. American culture popularized the idea of serving a giant bowl as the featured course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if this will be removed as a violation of Rule 10, but here is my honest opinion:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it was always like this, but r/conspiracy is kinda boring, and needs some new approaches to liven it up.  The process here seems to look a lot like this.</p>

<p>1) Someone finds an article that supports their favorite conspiracy or political viewpoint in some way and posts it without regard for whether it is in any way credible.   Hillary engaged in secret discussions with Jewish bankers, Monsanto seeking approval for new pesticide known to cause sterility in 90% of those exposed to picogram amounts, Pharmaceutical companies secretly developing drugs to treat coming wave of vaccine-induced illness, whatever.  It doesn&#39;t matter what the accusation is or what if any evidence supports it if it slams the right bad guys.</p>

<p>2) At this point it forks.  </p>

<p>2a)If someone shows up and points out the shitty sourcing, the flawed reasoning, and the misstatements of facts, several commenters attack the interloper as a shill, while completely ignoring their arguments and/or documentation that the source article is wrong.  If the interloper is stubborn, the discussion goes on for hundreds of comments, but ultimately most get bored with this quickly and the discussion dies.</p>

<p>2b) If no one is willing to show up and be the object lesson in enforcing r/conspiracy orthodoxy, the conversations runs for a half a dozen or so comments of mutual agreement and then dies. </p>

<p>This could really be an interesting subreddit.  But the discussion really doesn&#39;t ever get that interesting except as a brawl, because it either consists of people agreeing with each other or engaging in personal attacks on those who don&#39;t agree.  </p>

<p>Disagreement here is seen as some sort of crime. Its not, its an opportunity to learn. </p>

<p>This sub is riddled with stupid links about Hilary</p>

<p>Of course there are going to be links about Hillary on a conspiracy subreddit! She is probably the most compromised Presidential nominee/candidate in American history, and the conspiracy is multi-faceted 1) how has she managed to stay out of the clutches of law enforcement all this time? 2) how is it that the mainstream media is rooting for Hillary so hard and either ignoring her opponents (Sanders) or villifying them (Trump, who it should be acknowledge is giving them plenty of material to do so)? </p>

<p>There IS a massive overarching conspiracy, and it goes the heart of how the United States (mal)functions today.</p>

<p>Politics is dominating the subreddit at the moment because we&#39;re in an election year, but nobody is obliging you to read posts you don&#39;t like.</p>

Ever since Fox News and AM talk radio and the GOP plunged headfirst into using conspiracy theories to advance their political ends (&quot;they&#39;re coming for our guns!&quot; &quot;global warming is a hoax!&quot; &quot;Agenda 21!&quot;), the conspiracy movement has been all but taken over by the far-right.</p>

<p>So, yeah. Between now and the election, you can count on 50% or more of all posts to this forum to be lies about and bashing of Hillary. There have been many days in the past few months when probably 75% or 80% of the front page of the sub is lies about Hillary.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will be an extension of the Trump campaign and the GOP and Fox News from now until the end of the year.</p>
