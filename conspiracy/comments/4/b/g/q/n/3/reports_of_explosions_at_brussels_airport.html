       The first link is from 4 days ago. The next three all are from 3 years ago when there was some buzz. The final link you've listed says nothing about a terror attack.

       Looks like there was a flurry of posts
       <em>
        one year

       about 3 years ago and then the recent prediction 4 days ago.

       If you had properly fitted your hat down to your eyebrows AND fastened the chinstrap...you might have spent your research efforts on connecting the dots between S&amp;B and today's terror event.

       It's a very basic point. For years people have been saying "OMG OCCULT DATE 3/22 SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN!".
      </p>
      <p>
       For years nothing has happened. When nothing has happened, everybody ignores that they were completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually somebody's bound to get it right just because of the sheer number of predictions made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Give a million monkeys typewriters and something meaningful'll come out after a few years just by chance.

      <p>
       Nevermind that in Brussels, just like in the majority of the word, the date is formatted dd/mm/yyyy, not mm/dd/yyyy, so it's 22/3, which -even if you assume these moronic predictions have any truth behind them- is meaningless.

       Firstly, the edit button exists. No need to reply three times.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... your argument is that over the space of ~600 years, a few sacrifice-like events happened on the same day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alright. Let's play a game, I'll pick a random date using a random date picker online.
      </p>
      <p>
       It picked February 14th. So, on Feb 14th:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         748 – Abbasid
         <strong>
          Revolution
         </strong>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         1502 – Spanish Inquisition: The Catholic Monarchs issue a decree
         <strong>
          forcing
         </strong>
         Muslims in Granada to convert to Catholicism
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         1349 – Several hundred Jews are
         <strong>
          burned
         </strong>
         to
         <strong>
          death
         </strong>
         by mobs
        </p>
       </li>

       No. It's just that over the space of, say, 2000 years of decently-recorded history you're bound to have events happen on the same day since we
       <strong>
        only have 365 days in one year

       You need some sort of actual evidence. You can't just say whatever you want and then defend it with "Well it's a conspiracy, of course there's no evidence" since such a low standard of proof means you can say
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       anything, and make random leaps of logic to justify your view.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4bgqn3/reports_of_explosions_at_brussels_airport/d1911jj">
        this post of events on the 14th of Feb
       </a>
       . So, to pick on the conspiracy favourite of Jews, in 1349 there was a Jewish massacre where several hundred were
       <strong>
        burned
       </strong>
       to death by mobs, then on the
       <strong>
        same day
       </strong>
       centuries alter there was an uprising against the Ottomans, coincidence? I think not, obviously it was Jewish orchestrated revenge, put on the same date to hint at that fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then later in 1981 a
       <strong>
        fire
       </strong>
       kills 48 in Dublin, since this happened on the
       <strong>
        same date
       </strong>
       as hundreds of Jews being
       <strong>
        burned to death
       </strong>
       then that obviously means that the nighclub was actually some sort of
       <strong>
        meeting place for anti-semites
       </strong>
       , and Zionists set the fire specifically on the 14th of Feb as a reminder.
      </p>
      <p>
       1998 - massive oil spill, what does oil do?
       <strong>
        Catch fire
       </strong>
       , what else caught fire? The
       <strong>
        Jews
       </strong>
       in 1349. It's obvious that this oil tanker was part of a trade made to fund
       <strong>
        anti-semites
       </strong>
       , and was sabotaged by the Zionists, again on this date to commemorate the death of hundreds of Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       2004 - water park collapse.
       <strong>
        Water puts out fire
       </strong>
       , there's an obvious link here to hundreds of Jews being burnt alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       So by your standards me performing random leaps of logic on events on a random date is sufficient proof that all of these events are linked together and part of a Zionist conspiracy to get revenge for hundreds of deaths in 1349?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it's a conspiracy, obviously there won't be actual evidence, we have to connect the dots ourselves(!)

       Every single thought a human has , has a major effect on reality. This effect is extreme and barley known. The secret is we are keeping the planet at a low vibration and we lack connection to the source. This lets nature run wild and our egos left uncontrolled. Letting the ether be polluted with negativity.

       The point is..it is a coincidence. Capture a Paris terror mastermind on Friday in Brussels, his idiot friends retaliate on Tuesday. This is the likely scenario..no special dates..just terror.

       OH WAIT, tell me more about how I should put on a tinfoil hat because you live in a reductionist mindset and nothing that happens means anything. Yea it's just a real terror attack committed by ISIS and their Agency handlers by proxy. It's funny that you think things like this just happen by chance.

       Why the fuck are you looking at me for answers? ISIS already took responsibility and anybody that actually understands what is happening in the world realizes that they are a Proxy terrorist organization funded and trained by American intelligence agencies. Whether or not this was Skull and Bones doesn't matter, this is still our fault.

       When you open the borders to violent Islamists, this is the natural outcome. There's still a globalist conspiracy at work (to make the Muslim invasion possible via open borders and the destabilization of Syria), but it didn't have to be Jews wearing Arab-looking latex masks and doing the suicide-bombing themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm really tired of the "Muslims dindu nuffin!" narrative. We know the Jewish elites are the enemy. That doesn't mean they are the only enemies.

       No. It's just that over the space of, say, 2000 years of decently-recorded history you're bound to have events happen on the same day since we
       <strong>
        only have 365 days in one year

       If death is what they want, I could sit down and think of ways to create the conditions for a mudslide, or at the minimum orchestrate this catastrophe in a location already conducive.  I'd go with the latter and so would they.  Best yet, we'd have people like you not thinking twice about "uncontrollable" "Mother Nature" being the cause of death, rather than a messy massacare with guns and explosions.  Just people buried beneath a slowly drying mud, their bodies preserved ever so closer to a metaphorical hell.  They'd probably get a kick out of that symbolism.  Who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, are you retarded, or do I have to spell out how this could be done?  Perhaps I do, since you probably still think that humans have no control over storms/weather.

       Use low orbit satellites and airplanes to gather intel on every square mile of earth (and the atmosphere, which is a more difficult real-time problem, but solvable)
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon sensing two conditions:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 -  atmospheric conditions conducive to heavy downpour
       <br/>
       2  - sloped ground conditions (close to cities/villages) conducive to mudslides (damp, non-dry, recently rained upon, changing slope/erosion in recent history etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       One then uses modern technology (cloud seeding, HAARP type radiation) to entice that heavy downpour in the desired location to cause sliding mud.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you understand me, I don't think mudslides can be created anywhere, or at any time at a particular place in the world.  This requires sufficient initial conditions, like most problems. And of course they can happen by mother nature alone.  But I'm merely exploring how human death/sacrifice can be expedited/accelerated by black technology.

       I'd (or we'd) have to look for clues pointing towards geo-engineering.  One would probably have had to been recording data during that 1.5 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason geo-engineering is so effective as a tool, is that people (the public,) for the most part aren't aware or don't buy into it's existence yet, so weather, naturally(haha,) doesn't fall under the same suspicion/scrutiny as other massacares/false flags, but it certainly affects economies, people's beliefs, actions etc.

       We'll have trouble coming across something online which depicts infrared radiation over America or any location over some period of time.  If it existed, they wouldn't want us to have access to it (I'm continuing to look.)  There's some youtube-ers that apparently have some radiation maps but I've yet to verify their source(s) so I won't lead you that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, infrared is usually used to detect moisture in the air and get cloud maps etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is the reason why I said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One would probably have had to been recording data during that 1.5 months.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Recording radiation data that is, say, in Oregon, as you pointed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to find cloud/humidity maps, which as the wiki article points out, such humidity might either be caused, amplified or affected by a number of "proposed"* geo-engineering tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       * I quote "proposed" because that article takes the position that all of this is merely theory, when ample amount of evidence suggests otherwise, and that it is being practiced (Wikipedia is certified poor for anything conspiratorial in nature, and it's more of a gatekeeper for these types of topics)

       False flag.

       It was all faked.

       But I guarantee there will be a new accusation this time - George Soros did it.

       What's bullshit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time a major atrocity happens there's a stampede in this sub to see who can be the first to say it's a false flag, it was planned by the authorities, it's a distraction or it was fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's just the first wave of predictable, regurgitated threads. They get posted the second the event happens, before people even watch or read the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then comes the second wave of threads. And they are just as predictable. Wave 2 comes as people actually watch the news. The people interviewed on TV were too calm, or the cellphone footage wasn't good enough, or the damage didn't look real.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then over the next day or so comes Wave 3. Wave 3 is the crisis actor photographs. The police arriving too quickly. There were security personnel nearby. The evidence that's found was planted.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I guarantee the same predictable threads in the same predictable order will happen this time.

       You're still not addressing the fact that every time there is one, we get the same type 1 comments with bullshit from "skeptics" or science fan boys like yourself, coming in to accuse all conspiracy theorists of operating in the same fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you feel the need to come here and make such comments? Were you one of the dickheads to come in here and talk the same shit for San Bernadino or Lavoy Fincum's shooting by the FBI? Both those events have been pretty well established as having occurred vastly different to the official narrative.

       1st day of a full moon, being that many religions are based on the lunar cycles it can be fairly easy to predict religous groups might do something like this on these days, its also a lunar eclipse tomorrow, so i expect this is probably not over either.

       It's a very basic point. For years people have been saying "OMG OCCULT DATE 3/22 SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN!".
      </p>
      <p>
       For years nothing has happened. When nothing has happened, everybody ignores that they were completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually somebody's bound to get it right just because of the sheer number of predictions made.

       Seriously man, burden of proof. The onus is on you to prove your claims, not make claims and wait for other people to prove it for you.

       You need some sort of actual evidence. You can't just say whatever you want and then defend it with "Well it's a conspiracy, of course there's no evidence" since such a low standard of proof means you can say
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       anything, and make random leaps of logic to justify your view.
      </p>

       I made
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4bgqn3/reports_of_explosions_at_brussels_airport/d1911jj">
        this post of events on the 14th of Feb
       </a>
       . So, to pick on the conspiracy favourite of Jews, in 1349 there was a Jewish massacre where several hundred were
       <strong>
        burned
       </strong>
       to death by mobs, then on the
       <strong>
        same day
       </strong>
       centuries alter there was an uprising against the Ottomans, coincidence? I think not, obviously it was Jewish orchestrated revenge, put on the same date to hint at that fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then later in 1981 a
       <strong>
        fire
       </strong>
       kills 48 in Dublin, since this happened on the
       <strong>
        same date
       </strong>
       as hundreds of Jews being
       <strong>
        burned to death
       </strong>
       then that obviously means that the nighclub was actually some sort of
       <strong>
        meeting place for anti-semites
       </strong>
       , and Zionists set the fire specifically on the 14th of Feb as a reminder.
      </p>
      <p>
       1998 - massive oil spill, what does oil do?
       <strong>
        Catch fire
       </strong>
       , what else caught fire? The
       <strong>
        Jews
       </strong>
       in 1349. It's obvious that this oil tanker was part of a trade made to fund
       <strong>
        anti-semites
       </strong>
       , and was sabotaged by the Zionists, again on this date to commemorate the death of hundreds of Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       2004 - water park collapse.
       <strong>
        Water puts out fire
       </strong>
       , there's an obvious link here to hundreds of Jews being burnt alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       So by your standards me performing random leaps of logic on events on a random date is sufficient proof that all of these events are linked together and part of a Zionist conspiracy to get revenge for hundreds of deaths in 1349?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it's a conspiracy, obviously there won't be actual evidence, we have to connect the dots ourselves(!)
