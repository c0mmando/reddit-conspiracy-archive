    <div class="md"><p>I live in France where there&#39;s &quot; l&#39;Ã©tat d&#39;urgence&quot;, this law that authorizes police forces to search your house and force you to house arrest without a judge&#39;s involvement is the direct consequence of Paris&#39; attacks. It has been used against arab-looking people who are often French citizens, gun enthousiasts and ecologists. Yes, the last one is real. If you&#39;re some greenpeace activist you&#39;re more likely to be targeted, it&#39;s retarded but what do you want.</p>

<p>Belgium is next. The citizens will ALL ACCEPT this state of emergency, because they&#39;ll believe anything they see on tv. People are stupid and think some 20 yr old Arab who&#39;s a low level pothead criminal managed to get his hands on some explosive devices and full auto rifles, planned exit strategies, simultaneous attacks, all of this with money he doesn&#39;t have. LOL</p>

<p>Why does it happen??? Massive unemployment, social unrest, political muppets have been lying for too long. The EU is a mess. I&#39;m not talking about the refugees (which are also the consequence of those political clowns.) But the system in itself has been used by all European politicians to get paid massively while screwing their own citizens.</p>

<p>People in France have been arrested and put on house arrest for tweets or facebook posts. Welcome to 1984.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s so crazy about the rabbit hole is that many of the things you discover and come to realize are truths are things you would not have ever considered to be possibly false or fabricated. When you get into alternative media, you&#39;re expecting to read things about the 9/11 cover-up, various false flags, moon landing hoax claims, JFK stories, etc.</p>

<p>But wait...the &quot;United States&quot; is a <em>corporation</em> that resulted from America becoming insolvent over 80 years ago? Our inability to repay the Federal Reserve caused an English banker takeover in which America offered its own citizens as collateral?! And to this day, our birth registries are being traded on a market and can be used as a declaration of ownership?! <strong>WHAT?!</strong></p>

<p>And that&#39;s part of the issue - this is a concept I couldn&#39;t even fathom prior to learning so much as I age. If someone as open-minded and (hopefully) discerning as myself is learning things that even I couldn&#39;t have even comprehended, what does that say for the rest of us? How many people are really willing to set aside their comforts and possessions (which are technically not ours anyway) in order to stand up against this false terror garbage?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;many of the things you discover and come to realize are truths are things you would not have ever considered to be possibly false or fabricated.&quot; </p>

<p>That statement is so true. The problem is that it takes a certain level of ego functioning to be able to acknowledge that something you once believed is in fact not true, otherwise you succumb to cognitive dissonance. It&#39;s interesting how we come to believe the things we believe that we never question. I recently read a book that gave me a completely different perspective on Timothy Leary.  He actually had some really great ideas about how psychotherapy could be used on a macro level to impact society and possibly &#39;social evolution&#39;. Yet I had grown up thinking he was this drugged out hippy crack pot. Why did I believe that? I never bothered to learn anything else except &quot;drugs are bad and people who use them are bad.&quot;  Now you start to see research about the potential benefits of psilocybin in treating addiction and depression. Hmm, imagine that. An experience that causes you to reevaluate your place in the world and universe might have some lasting impact on your wellness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s cool. To me, some such drugs are without debate, unequivocally, helpful to your being. The day after I first took MDMA 11 years ago, I was a different person than I was the prior day. I didn&#39;t have quite the experience from LSD or psilocybin, but both were still beneficial.</p>

<p>Problem is, enough people keep chasing the purple dragon for the rest of us to look bad. I haven&#39;t taken any of the above drugs in many years, yet I carry those experiences and enlightenments to this very day and have no doubt I would still be &quot;trapped&quot; in my temporal being. If everyone had similar experiences, there would of course be more understanding and happiness today. But that&#39;s part of the point of the drug war...to not only control the money that inevitably gets spent on drugs, but to help ensure people don&#39;t have the awakening experiences some of the drugs provide that may help them snap out of their fear bubble. Even THC does this on a smaller, but effective, level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took medical ketamine because I was on the verge of suicide, 2 yrs ago.  It induced an afterglow of psychedelic reality that inspired me into a worldview in which I actually did have power to change and the world had power to change along with me.  This perspective shift cured the chronic depression--it deleted it.  I&#39;ve been as happy as I&#39;ve ever been in life, and I&#39;d never consider it ever again.</p>

<p>Another postive side effect is that it cured my hearing loss in my right ear.  I was about 40% deaf in my right ear from a severe infection in my 20s and surgery on that ear, a wakeboarding accident, a nearby explosion and a christian rock concert in childhood.  Ketamine did something to this ear and now I can hear all ranges as well as I can with the other ear, but I can also hear infrasound below the threshold of the &#39;good&#39; ear.  It also seems to have reversed a problem with stumbling and random dropping things from my right hand (a kind of tic), which was from a medicine-caused stroke I had about 4 yrs ago</p>

<p>This made me do research into it.  Turns out psychedelics are on-the-whole good, not bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ano1418 this is also a spiritual war, and I&#39;m not talking about Religion or Christianity. As you&#39;ve said we live in a giant matrix of deception. Those who seek, speak, and live the truth will be targeted, period. Because those people are real threats to TPTB. Consider yourself under attack. You must defend yourself. They in particular are attacking your mind and spirit. The plan is to break you, spiritually specifically. But it is from our spirits that our strength and resolve resides. Stand up within. Defend yourself. Do no use negative pejorative terms to describe yourself, or explain how others might. You have seen deeply, and it&#39;s a troubling, distressing sight. I can 100% relate. You are actually incredibly sane. And it&#39;s not that others are insane, but that they are, as you have said, deeply lost within the Matrix. Blind, mesmerized, spellbound. Irrational animals.</p>

<p>But we all must resist. It is not hopeless. We each have immense potential within us. TBTP know this, and this is why they keep us spiritually starved, sick, and/or broken... which is one of the primary roles of Religion. We are all in a war, that we&#39;ve been born into to. A war for the absolute control of humanity. A war that has existed since before written history. A war of the few controlling the many, the few enslaving the many.</p>

<p>You&#39;re already in the war. The decision to make is; are you going to pretend it doesn&#39;t exist, run away, become another innocent victim, or stand up and defend yourself?</p>

<p>ano1418 you DO NOT want to commit suicide. YOU know this. Reject the voices whispering these dark thoughts. They are not your own. Fight back. Your life, my life, our lives are worth fighting for. We were not created to be enslaved to other people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree to keep an open mind and doubt things, but you just called Noam Chomsky a guru dissident who is deluding us. It is possible, as everything is, but I highly doubt the validity of such a claim, yet you speak with such conviction which is a contradiction of your own claims. There was no &quot;maybe&quot; on your part, nor no &quot;maybes&quot; throughout your entire post. You believe what you think is real, but belief puts a constraint on your intelligence and leads to dogma. As long as you have beliefs then by logic you don&#39;t actually have an open mind. You&#39;ve gone a little too far down the rabbit hole, creating a paranoia that is no good for your mental health. My advice would to be to stop presuming everyone is an enemy, out to get you and stop taking life so seriously and you might feel happier and better able to connect with people.</p>

<p>But you really should get really clear with what you know and own it and speak your truth.  There is a space for more than one truth</p>

<p>ALso, regarding the &#39;matrix of ideas&#39; I believe the OP was talking about the Spectacle.  Which is a sad reality of our time:</p>

Also if you think any true &quot;elite&quot; has ties of allegiance or sentiment toward any one country you&#39;re just being daft. Don&#39;t be stupid. There&#39;s a bunch of ways the elite benefit by destabilizing Europe. I&#39;ll name a couple huge ones.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Justify more surveillance and draconian &quot;anti-terror laws&quot; therefore increasing the power, budget, and authority of intelligence/police forces that they control.</p></li>
<li><p>Cheaper labor, more profit, higher housing demand, which means higher costs of rent, and more taxable income in general. More money in their pockets.</p></li>

<p>I didn&#39;t want to jump on that thread yesterday, but it&#39;s fairly obvious that there are cells in belgium and france and germany that will be activated over the spring season.  I suspect that several people will be &quot;caught in the act&quot; by stings and used to justify extraordinary security measures.  Also, remember that national ID is on the table in the US, and nobody has been talking about that lately.  I suspect that these attacks being blamed on immigrants will help push that narrative.</p>

<p>This attack also seems to justify the security theatre at airports, while at the same time calling its efficacy into question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to point out that occult simply means hidden and the only thing that connects occult organisations throughout history is their firm belief that people on average are stupid, don&#39;t want to understand anything, have no higher goals in life and thus should not be trusted with knowledge and should be steered by those who have that drive and are intelligent enough. Of course a lot of times things didn&#39;t work out, but generally I have to agree, there&#39;s no point in telling people the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;many of the things you discover and come to realize are truths are things you would not have ever considered to be possibly false or fabricated.&quot; </p>

<p>That statement is so true. The problem is that it takes a certain level of ego functioning to be able to acknowledge that something you once believed is in fact not true, otherwise you succumb to cognitive dissonance. It&#39;s interesting how we come to believe the things we believe that we never question. I recently read a book that gave me a completely different perspective on Timothy Leary.  He actually had some really great ideas about how psychotherapy could be used on a macro level to impact society and possibly &#39;social evolution&#39;. Yet I had grown up thinking he was this drugged out hippy crack pot. Why did I believe that? I never bothered to learn anything else except &quot;drugs are bad and people who use them are bad.&quot;  Now you start to see research about the potential benefits of psilocybin in treating addiction and depression. Hmm, imagine that. An experience that causes you to reevaluate your place in the world and universe might have some lasting impact on your wellness.</p>
