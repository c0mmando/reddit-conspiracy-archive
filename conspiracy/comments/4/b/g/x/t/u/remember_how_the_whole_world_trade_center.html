<p>If you don&#39;t know a  computer guy mentioned how the whole world trade center buildings were shut down for the first time ..all power... All  security... All computer servers...   Before 9/11   .  It had never happened I  their history before then.</p>

<p>Many speculated that could have been the time bombs were planted if they were planted.</p>

<p>So when Laura ingram mentioned on her radio show the other day how she was weirded out that the same thing happened to the DC SUBWAY  during a whole day all at once just to check for electrical braking issues which could have been done one station at a time.... The hairs on the back of my neck wentup.  She even said she didn&#39;t want to sound like a conspiracy person (why not? Conspiracies are proved!) But completely shutting down something that serves millions of commuters for a whole day for such a shoddy excuse didn&#39;t seem right.</p>

<p>Archive this post because if something happens later in DC  we will know Laura Ingram at least was paying attention.</p>

<p>And if anyone has any inside info or anecdotes about the DC SUBWAY shutdown please mention them now.  Becuas eyou know if something ever does happen they will classifiy and seize all that info faster than a camera looking towards the pentagon on 9/11</p>

I grabbed the box and went through multiple securities and xray machines. Not until I opened the box to grab my material did I see the box of ammo. Yes that isn&#39;t a bomb but this is just one example I feel comfortable telling.

<p>From: &quot;Scott ***<strong><em>&quot; &lt;</em></strong>**<strong><em>@hotmail.com&gt;

Subject: Official Verison of 9/11 - new info
Date: Mon, 19 Apr 2004 12:35:12 +0000</p>

<p>To John *****,</p>

<p>I was pleased to read your article &quot;The Official Version of 9/11 is a Hoax&quot;... Please note some other facts. My name is Scott Forbes and I still work for Fiduciary Trust. In 2001 we occupied floors 90 and 94-97 of the South Tower and lost 87 employees plus many contractors.</p>

<p>On the weekend of 9/8,9/9 there was a &#39;power down&#39; condition in WTC tower 2, the south tower. This power down condition meant there was no electrical supply for approx 36hrs from floor 50 up. I am aware of this situation since I work in IT and had to work with many others that weekend to ensure that all systems were cleanly shutdown beforehand ... and then brough back up afterwards. The reason given by the WTC for the power down was that cabling in the tower was being upgraded ... Of course without power there were no security cameras, no security locks on doors and many, many &#39;engineers&#39; coming in and out of the tower. I was at home on the morning of 9/11 on the shore of Jersey City, right opposite the Towers, and watching events unfold I was convinced immediately that something was happening related to the weekend work ...</p>

<p>I have mailed this information to many people and bodies, including the 9/11 Commission but no-one seems to be taking and registering these facts. Whats to hide? Can you help publicise them?</p>

<p>Please feel free to mail me.</p>

<p>Scott ******</p>

<p>So... WTC2, from floor 50 up, was supposedly powered down. Not the the entirety of both WTC towers.</p>

<p>You have an interesting point, but don&#39;t let the excitement of discovering something blind you and make you less critical.</p>

<p>And even that <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/wtc_power_down.html">appears pretty questionable</a></p>

<p>There doesn&#39;t appear much significant evidence the power-down affected more than the handful of floors belonging to Fiduciary Trust. </p>

<p>This <em>was</em> a coverup, but not to plant bombs...  it was to <em>find</em> a bomb.  They were carrying radiation detectors, so whatever they were searching for was hot (thus the secrecy, not to panic everyone).</p>

<p>It was also a way to blackmail the area for more money.  &quot;See, we screw up your commute without us!  We need more money!&quot;.  More money they can just piss away.</p>

<p>A person died last year, and the same problem happened a few days ago. Everyone bitches about track delays, trains being out of service, etc. I think this was also kind of public relations stunt on the part of Metro, so they can go, &quot;Hey, look! We&#39;re working so hard on inspecting these tracks that we have to close the whole system for a day!&quot;</p>

<p>DC metro sucks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an understatement. It&#39;s worse if you&#39;re handicapped. One instance an elevator was broken at a stop. I didn&#39;t have the time to take a car back <em>two stops</em> and then take a bus back so I dragged my wheelchair up the steps. Security was yelling at me to stop, I told them to suck it, they said they had announcements saying the elevator was out. I told them I couldn&#39;t understand a word said over the speakers and the only digital sign I had seen was at Lenfant Plaza which half didn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>On a separate trip I had to take the orange/blue lines to Arlington Cemetery. Courthouse has <em>three</em> elevators labeled as handicap access to metro. Two of them took me down to the same level... at the top of a set of escalators... The third one, which took me to the bottom of those escalators, wasn&#39;t even on the same side of the street as the other two... it was a fucking joke...</p>

<p>One thing that I have thought very odd this year though, is all of the celebrity deaths we have been seeing.  I cannot recall a year in my life where so many celebrities just started dropping like flies, and we are only three months into the year.  Albeit, some of them were very sick, it just seems strange.</p>

Demolition charge firing systems do not get tied into any buildings electrical systems. The risk of transient voltages setting off the charges prematurely is to great of a risk to take. This is especially so for false flag operations such as Sept 11.  </p>

According to the employee, about five minutes before the attack the entire Deutsche Bank computer system had been taken over by something external that no one in the office recognized and every file was downloaded at lightning speed to an unknown location.
