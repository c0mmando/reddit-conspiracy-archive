       You all know what I'm talking about; one mention of Hollywood Zionism or the federal reserve, and your Thanksgiving is in the can. Any talk of current events that doesn't parallel mainstream media is instantly shut down and considered "crazy talk". I've come so close to making a break through with a couple family members, but I lose them right at the tipping point with them losing interest, or just connecting my words with what they heard on the news earlier that week. Its frustrating! My immediate family is very interested in politics, but this means nothing when all I ever hear about is what dumbass Hilary did or moron Trump said. Its very important that my family has a proper perspective of the world (if you want to make a change, start at home). I want to be able to have actual discussions with family members about ACTUAL issues. But as stated, the information I try to provide falls flat and is greeted with a scoff or no response at all. Help please? D:

       I keep it to emails. I make damn sure what I send is real news.  I try to focus on what I think corporate media would 'censor' or not report. My mother responded well to PNAC and General Clark saying that we had a neocon policy coup. I don't bring it up much when we visit, though she does from time to time.  Most Americans have no idea that a former NATO supreme commander and one of our top generals tried to warn us that our democracy had been taken from us by fucking psychopathic killers.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we are visiting I just enjoy the family time because it's not worth it.

       My father and siblings are very open to conspiracies, the whole family is pro-Palestine and believes in an Israel/USA conspiracy, believes a drug-war conspiracy and boycotting the election most likely. They're also on board with aliens.

       My family is from NJ they will never ever believe 9/11 was an inside job. Our whole extended family was in the area that day.

       One of my aunts friends is a firefighter who was at the towers that day, she is super messed up ever since 9/11 I'd bet on my life she knows.

       I don't bother proslytizing. There is no tangible benefit for them coming over to my point of view, and a lot of negative that comes from me fighting them over it, so why bother.

       Be creative, but informed and ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say the target topic is pointing out that the sky is blue, you don't just say: "Hey idiots, have you noticed the sky is blue today?", but instead maybe something like: "That car parked there really reflects that strong blue sky".
      </p>
      <p>
       And in practice:
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of "voting has no effect on anything",
       <br/>
       try "Crazy how people wait in line for hours to vote in a primary  where their votes have zero actual power, isn't it?"
But you better be ready to explain how that is factually truth using mainstream sources.

       Oh god SC is the worst for system justifiers.  Closet hypocrites, Two faced people, religious dogmatists and evangelicals, authoritarians.  I'm not sure what it is about SC, maybe overfluoride, but it's a problem.  They are all under mind control.  I'm also an escapee from the capital city.  All but one of my friends fled to far away also.

       Hell, I tried pointing out that our dollar is no longer 100% backed by gold (not even a conspiracy theory, but a fact), and I'm looked at like I'm crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The counter argument was "Well it's backed by other metals too", yeah, and our mortgages and loans and stock market etc. as well, but people seem to forget that, and want to remember the glory days.

       You're not going to fix the older ones. Don't pester them about shit but if they try to start a political convo with you, always stand your ground and tell them what you really think. Give the younger ones links to interesting shit and books and videos. They're the ones who are still figuring things out. Every one of your relatives over 40 thinks they already have everything figured out. Won't change not matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are seriously worried about something happening though, you should just talk to your family and make sure they're on the same page about emergency preparedness. They don't have to believe in the NWO to agree that having some storable food, water, cash, guns and bullets is important.

       I use earthquake preparedness as my excuse.  But it can be used for any disaster.  Act of God, act of banker or act of muslim.
       <br/>
       Being prepared for the worst is the easiest thing to convince them to do.
Knowing the truth about what and who causes the disaster will not help to prevent it anyways.  It's coming.

       It's tough. Especially when it's family, the last people you want to start looking at you like there's something wrong with you. My father and I just had a conversation about how politics are just a wwe-style drama. That's all the population wants to see, the drama of the situation, and not focus on actual issues. Luckily my father is a bit conspiracy minded, as am I. We both see the way things are in reality, and are able to have reasonable discussions about it. We talk about things that are facts, as well as things that are speculation. I would suggest researching and showing your family facts that support your arguments. If they don't listen to facts, they are being willfully ignorant.

       My family is very cool and understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best friend and roommate of 6 years only started listening to me this year when I found a lot of information on mind control.  Even now he sometimes doesn't understand.  He always asks "What is the goal?  Do they realise they're future is also going to shut if they destroy the planet?". Then he gets all hopeless.  I try to encourage him to read thoroughly, and to do things that don't depend on the system when possible.  He wants to have a nice long life though, in the system.  So it's hard for him to think of it any other way.  He described finding the truth to losing religion.

       My boyfriend however is, very unaware.  He's very smart, and open minded but doesn't really play with the theories I present to him.  I tried talking about propaganda and how easy it would be to manipulate the shared consciousness the way the system is set up.  His response was "Maybe, but there's no proof of it.  Like 0%.". So I dropped it (for the time being).

       good question. i just
       <em>
        don't go there
       </em>
       . in conversation with family members i'm not very close to, i may offer info in an ongoing conversation, i never jumpstart the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       i still deal with "why don't you have a fb page?" my answer: i really don't have the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: what i have issue with; if someone
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       interested, just giving them a bit of info sometimes isn't always 'enough'. i think if they don't have any point of reference -- they've never heard of something &amp; have no intention in learning more about it (they don't want to read anything), i feel like it's a waste of time. i know i don't know everything, but if i'm talking to someone &amp; i relate it to (for example) MK-ULTRA, if the person doesn't know wtf i'm talking about, i don't feel i'm required to "educate" them. yes, i'll offer info, what to read, etc, but if the person thinks they can learn all they need to know in a few 'sound bytes', i tell them the info is available &amp; if they're interested they can get it.

       I think this is the best advice.  I've tried to convince my family and only one family member really is onboard with some of these things.  I' believe I've convinced him 9/11 was a massive coverup but I'll probably never convince him that it was an inside job.  That's ok.

       I think with boomers they are so smugly self-justifying and cognitively dissonant that they will actually never wake up.  They are going to take that shit to the grave, so let them.

       be aware of cognitive dissonance...walk away from people who don't love and support you no matter what you believe, and forgive them, many won't wake up because they want to continue in duality.  it's been prophesized that the earth will divide into 2 timelines like a cell dividing, one heading into the golden age where art and mathematics and harmony with nature are nurtured and the other will continue in duality...some want to keep coming back to duality to gain more soul experience...you can't wake them up, so love them for wanting to learn the hard way...

       I have given up.
       <br/>
       Your family and friends can be used to control you.  So it's best you give up too.
They will continue to be shills for TBTB and MSM and nothing you can say will change their views until either they are on the receiving end of a bullet from a corrupt cop, or have lost everything after being screwed by bankers or the government.
The only thing I'm trying to do is get people to prepare for an economic collapse and the riots that follow by telling them to set up a good supply of food and water and lead and TP in case of an "earthquake".  The "earthquake" or "tornado" supply can be used for riding out the inevitable riots and bank runs or power grid failure that will the the likely end result of this worldwide Ponzi scheme.
       <br/>
       And the benefit for me is I won't have to take care of them.
I have written off my fellow Christians.  They just refuse to believe that such evil exists in the world and that God will take care of them.  They are soft Christian boys and will not be able to protect or take care of their families once the SHTF.
       <br/>
       A few are listening.  We are on an island near a gigantic city and I can easily explain to them that if a catastrophic event occurs all help will go to the big city and we could be left to rot on our island for months while the millions on the mainland are taken care of.  So it is believable.  The lead is for deer I tell them.  But the rioters are the big threat.

       My mom wasn't very receptive, but when I mentioned JFK she immediately did a 180. I guess just try to find something close to their interests or era.

       Shit, you've never been to Oklahoma. Our governor Mary Fallon, is a corporate whore. Our state is a poster child for the movie 'Idiocracy'. All the traits you mentioned are even worse in our politicians.
