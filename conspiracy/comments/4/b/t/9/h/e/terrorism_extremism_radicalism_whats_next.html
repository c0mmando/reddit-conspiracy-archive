    <div class="md"><p>Depends on when it happens. We are only at the beginning of the robotic age. 25-50 years from now you&#39;re right. Which is why things are so desperate now. If the revolution is to happen it must happen before the end of the robotic age.</p>

<p>And they will need people to code robots and work on robots in some way. If not there&#39;s almost 100% chance that an AI would simply kill all humans. The elites know this, this is why we have until the end of the robotic age. At the end the puppet masters will have literal robotic puppets and will rule the world.</p>

<p>There&#39;s over 8 billion of us and maybe 1000 of them. The numbers are on our side. Only the most desperate and evil would kill everyone, knowing they would then be emperor of a dead world. Their desire for absolute power will cause them to turn on each other if we were to rebel.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to all agree on everything and love each other. All we have to do is agree when this party is gonna start. The only catch is BYOB. Bring your own body, because as the song goes, &quot;The revolution will be live.&quot;</p>

<p>This could happen any day. If the end is increasingly near, so is a new beginning. The beginning can happen before or after the end. It is up to us to at least try for before the end.</p>

<p>This actually is literally true from my understanding.  Germany was never offered (and has never signed) any sort of peace treaty at any point from the end of the war up to the present day.  Technically then, <em>legally</em>, the war against Germany never ended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really a peace treaty though, nor is it a formal renunciation of the war.  Making Germany sovereign isn&#39;t the same as declaring the end of the war.  Germany was sovereign during the war so obviously sovereignty alone doesn&#39;t put an end to the war.</p>

<p>For an example of what I&#39;m talking about, check out the &quot;Paris Peace Conference&quot; - which was an official peace treaty.  This only applied to the minor Axis powers though, not Germany.</p>

<p>And even if that is an official peace treaty, kinda weird that it took until 1991 before it was signed no?  Why the 40 year delay?  That in itself is interesting enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Instrument_of_Surrender">German Instrument of Surrender</a> was signed in Berlin on 08May1945. The Allies jointly assumed &quot;supreme authority&quot; over German territory by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Declaration_%281945%29">Berlin Declaration</a> of defeat signed on 05Jun1945. Subsequently, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam_Conference">Potsdam Agreement</a> of 02Aug1945 confirmed the establishment of British, American and French zones of occupation. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_Control_Council">Allied Control Council</a> was established on 30Aug1945 to execute the governmental power in Allied-occupied Germany. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_statute">Occupation Statute of Germany</a> of 10Apr1949 specified the roles and responsibilities of the newly created German government and the Allied High Commission in West Germany. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petersberg_Agreement">Petersberg Agreement</a> is <strong>an international treaty</strong> signed on 22Nov1949 that extended the rights of the Federal Republic of (West) Germany vis-a-vis the occupying forces, and is viewed as the first major step towards German sovereignty. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Treaty">General TREATY</a> is <strong>a treaty of international law</strong> which was signed on 26May1952. It ended formally Germany&#39;s status as an occupied territory and gives it the rights of a sovereign state, with certain restrictions that remained in place until German reunification. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn%E2%80%93Paris_conventions">TREATIES of Bonn-Paris</a> were signed on 23Oct1954 and came into force after ratification on 05May1955 and put an end to the Allied occupation of West Germany.

    <div class="md"><p>No, what I&#39;m saying is that none of them are formal <strong>peace</strong> treaties.  At no point has a peace treaty been signed between Germany and the Allies despite all of the peace treaties that have been signed between the allies and the other Axis powers.  A treaty giving Germany sovereignty is not the same as a peace treaty and is not a formal end to the &quot;war&quot; that was declared in 1941.  I haven&#39;t ignored your links, I&#39;ve read most of these treaties before.  If there has been a peace treaty signed between Germany and the allies then let&#39;s see it.  I&#39;ve never read one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, your&#39;re right. But if the leader is dead, or deep in hiding living in a magical vat that keeps him alive, the war ended practically speaking. Interesting point you brought up though.</p>

<p>I meant it more in the sense that the world is, and has been since WWII, at war with pretty much anyone who deviated from western European hegemony and ideology. Colonialism 2.0. When a world government is installed that&#39;ll be colonialism 3.0.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the main thing I was trying to highlight is that those who have power in this world <em>generally</em>, and technically, follow the law as it&#39;s been written (by them of course) as much as they can.  They do this to give themselves legal loopholes and to gain our complicity (i.e. if we don&#39;t agree with how things are happening, we should just change the laws).  The point is that &quot;war&quot; has a legal definition, it must have a legal declaration and then a legal renunciation.  You&#39;ll notice that Japan and the other axis powers <em>did</em> sign peace treaties after the war ended, it&#39;s only Germany that didn&#39;t.  Interesting little tidbit I would say, and one that most people have never heard mentioned before.</p>

<p>Edit: this could also explain all of the illegal invasions and wars that the US has started in the decades since WWII.  By most international treaties and laws, these invasions would be not just unethical but illegal.  In wartime though, these laws don&#39;t apply.  If we&#39;re at war already then we can&#39;t be &quot;starting new wars&quot;, and thus invading Africa or South America or the Middle East is <em>technically</em> legal - because we&#39;re already in a war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they follow the law at all, the law follows them. They do something illegal, then make it a law after the fact. If they get caught, so what. They&#39;re the government, who&#39;s gonna actually stop them. Not us apparently. We like trading our freedom for B.S. creature comforts. We continue to trade our freedom to our governments so we can be &#39;safe.&#39;</p>

<p>I respect the logic you are following, and logically you are absolutely right, but in practice that&#39;s not how things are done anymore. Surly you recognize this as some one familiar with law. Rules are made to be broken, by those who make them.</p>

<p>The illegal invasions are justified by combating &#39;communism&#39; or &#39;terrorism.&#39; We&#39;re not legally, or more precisely publicly, over throwing a government or a nation, just its supposed &#39;thugs.&#39;</p>

<p>This is how they&#39;re sold to the public for sure, but what I&#39;m suggesting is that they also are &quot;legal&quot; technically.  Of course, &quot;the law&quot; is just a bunch of words written by rich men to benefit themselves.  Even things as blatantly unconstitutional as the NSA&#39;s spying are technically &quot;legal&quot; according to the secretive kangaroo courts that allowed them to be created.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Point received. Almost no one understands the law to its fullest extent. Even if some one had every character of the laws of all nations memorized it wouldn&#39;t matter. Unless they can also enforce the law.</p>

<p>The power of law comes from the ability to enforce it, not from the letter of the law. The pen is only mightier than the sword if you also have a sword.</p>

<p>Since the &#39;end of the cold war&#39; america has been fighting &#39;terrorists&#39; illegally via the CIA and similar agencies. 9/11 made it possible to have the fight, legally, out in the open.</p>

<p>There are three laws of civilization. Don&#39;t kill. Don&#39;t rape. Don&#39;t steal. And one law of nature. Keep balance. The governments of the world break all those laws every day. We now are left to enforce those laws on our illegal governments or corporations which have subjugated us for many millenia. That&#39;s all people need to know about the law.</p>

Its hard to extinguish an emeny that is based on belief that is fueled through its own destruction as justification for its continued fighting with the West.  I think it will end up with the only end game for the Islamic groups is that the West is their antithesis and we must be eradicated for their own preservation and vice versa.</p>
