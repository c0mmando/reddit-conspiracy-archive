Although I would posit that humanity has been lead astray, by certain negative higher powers, that has tipped the scales in favour of those in control(politicians/elite), who are privately worshippers of Lucifer (aka khazarian controlled elites/politicians/corpos).  Is life worth living?  Absolutely my friend!  You chose to be here, in fact you likely begged to be incarnated at this time, and have some things to do while you are here!  While our souls are everlasting, our bodies are temporary.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m more spiritual so that is the angle I&#39;m coming from. Basically we are universal spirits/beings, and each experience (life) is a test.

    <div class="md"><p>The phrase look inwards to me means to connect with the heart space and realize you actually know many things you don&#39;t <em>think</em> you know. The game is to get out of your head. </p>

<p>As putin says, get out in nature and sit and just be. Don&#39;t think, but if you do think, don&#39;t worry that you&#39;re thinking, but rather just observe your thoughts. Take some nice slow deep breaths and see if you can find a point for your awareness. At first you&#39;ll find it localised in your mind, and it will be filled with chatter. As you take the deep breaths and just focus on breathing, see too if you can lower that focal point from inside your head, down a column of energy to inside your chest. Relax, and as your awareness connects with your heart space and slows down to get in cadence with its electromagnetic artifact, let that calmness wash over your body and outwards down your limbs. </p>

<p>As you get better at this, you&#39;ll find you can employ this technique when you feel your anxiety level rising and it can abate it. If you have a problem you&#39;re worrying about, try this technique and then when you&#39;re nice and calm, try to analyze the problem again. You&#39;ll find you may now be able to approach it calmer and gain insight into why it affected you so much in the first place. </p>

<p>As you do this work, you&#39;ll find you can start to shed your fears and programs that have been brainwashed into you. As you start to shed these fears and anxieties, you&#39;ll then come into your power more and more and this will result in your creating a positive reality around you rather than a negative one. </p>

<p>To me, it is worth living. It is limitless. We get stuck, but it is limitless. And as Putin said above, I believe we have our purpose. </p>

<p>And it gets a little complicated if there are people in your life who love you, too. There are in mine. So if I chose not to live, would they understand? Probably not. So in my view it would be an evil deed itself; creating lasting suffering for others.</p>

<p>No.  It&#39;s not naturally evil.

Just, again, underdeveloped.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you think it is worth living?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure the physical manifestation has much of a choice in the matter.  Seems we manifested in physical form on this planet at the behest of a greater force than ourselves, and there is a lot of documentation indicating that, similar to a prison sentence, if we try to &quot;escape&quot; this prison by, for example, killing ourselves, we&#39;ll just get sent right back with added time tacked on our sentenced for &quot;bad behavior&quot; (i.e. trying to escape).</p>

<p>That said, although life on this planet <em>can</em> indeed be likened to a prison sentence, it can also be looked upon as (and likely is more similar to) a grade in school that one has to go through before one graduates to the next level of education.</p>

<p>So is it worth living?  Well, to say it&#39;s &quot;worth it&quot; or not is, perhaps, not really accurate.  Regardless of whether it&#39;s &quot;worth it&quot; or not, life here seems to be more of a process of, again, spiritual evolution that&#39;s decided upon before we even get here, and it&#39;s decided upon by, perhaps, our greater self and possibly other identities - not our current, limited physical one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Different Christians have different views as to whether evil is needed to balance out good. I do think that evil is here for good, as all humans do bad things and, on a more natural level, there will always be things like entropy preventing perfection in this universe. </p>

<p>The bible tells us, however, that in the end God is going to make &quot;a new heaven and a new earth&quot; and evil <em>(bible says the devil)</em> will be cast in to the &quot;Lake of Fire&quot;. (I don&#39;t believe in a literal fire lake, but rather an existence devoid of anything good/kind/wholesome. I assume something like that would become extremely painful.)  That&#39;s in Revelation 21, if you want to read the passage for yourself.</p>

<p>So yes, while I do think both good and evil will always exist, I do not think they will always interact with each other as much as they do in this age.</p>

<p>When I said defeated, I did not mean evil was wiped-out, but overcome. I hope I&#39;ll explain that a little more here as I write about what I mean by saved.</p>

<p>In my first comment, I said mankind is evil by nature. We all live our lives from a mental place of selfishness and imperfection. (It&#39;s why, for example, it took me so long to actually sit down and respond to your questions. <em>Thank you for the reminder, by the way.</em>)</p>

<p>Evil desires and actions are something we cannot escape. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. - Paul, Romans 7:21</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the whole point of Jesus (fully God, fully man, completely without evil, the primary distinction between Christianity and Islam, and another topic entirely) dying as a sacrifice was so that we don&#39;t have to take the spiritual punishment for our evilness.</p>

<p>In the short term, that spiritual punishment might perhaps manifest in such things as constant, ungodly ;-) levels of anger or sorrow. In the long term, however, that spiritual punishment is the aforementioned Lake of Fire.</p>

<p>I guess if I were to put it briefly, I meant saved from the end result of evil: the lack of good.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if this was all over the place and/or hard to follow. I&#39;m very sorry if you still don&#39;t understand. I&#39;m not used to writing/talking about my theological beliefs. </p>

<p>Disclaimer: Some details of what I said may be heretical and not what good, sound Christianity believes. If I did, it&#39;s probably because of a lack of research. The overall message, however, is truth.</p>

<p>Recommended Reading: Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John; Romans</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t get around to this sooner. Have a happy Easter!</p>

<p>(Jesus coming back to life is important because it shows that He really is/was God. The resurrection is basically the linchpin of Christianity. Without it, everything is meaningless. We would be stuck at &quot;We are so evil, we even had God killed, so what&#39;s the point.&quot;  Ultimately, the point of it all is that Good is more powerful and overall better than Evil.)</p>

<p>Thanks for the wonderful reply but I still don&#39;t understand this part. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But why would you want this? Won&#39;t it be better to partake in the vices forever? (as evil would always exist as well?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the point of it all is that Good is more powerful and overall better than Evil</p>

<p>How do you arrive at this conclusion?</p>
