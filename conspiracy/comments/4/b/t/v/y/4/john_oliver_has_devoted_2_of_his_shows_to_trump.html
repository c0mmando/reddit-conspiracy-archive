Why attack Trump and his campaign promises and fully skip over Hilary and all of the illegal crap that she has actually done?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, would you expect anything else from a prime time comedy station? Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert did the same thing in clear-left-leaning fashion. Why are you surprised? I don&#39;t understand why this is surprising and shocking to people - they should expect that channels like comedy central and HBO have and will always present themselves this way. Also, Trump does a lot of things and says a lot of things, and thus fuels the media in good and bad ways. Again, why is this a shocking realization? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said to someone else about Harvard, I&#39;m pretty sure what this means is that employees of UC have given a collective 600k.  Also, when they say University of California, they are referring to the entire UC system, not just Berkeley (UCLA, Santa Barbara, San Diego, Davis, etc.).  UC employs nearly 200,000 faculty and staff so that amount only averages $3 per employee.  Since university faculty skew toward democrats (as does California in general) and they are far and away the largest employer in California (I think Disney is next at around 25,000), their numbers are just going to add up.  I do not think Janet Napolitano could get away with cutting Hillary a check for $600k.</p>

<p>Edit: the State of California employees around 300,000 with about 100,000 of those in the California State University system.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trumps est net worth, 3 billion. </p>

<p>﻿As plucky a background story as Drumpf has conjured up, the young brash upstart bucking the odds, he didn’t start from nothing. In fact, he started from plenty. His late father Fred was one of the premier housing developers of the postwar outer boroughs of New York, building thousands upon thousands of unremarkable but functional multifamily dwellings in Brooklyn and Queens. Fred Drumpf died in 1999 with a fortune estimated at around $400 million. He also financed Donald’s first real estate deal, in which he bid on a rundown government-owned housing development in Cincinnati and hired his 25-year-old Wharton graduate son to turn it into something habitable. The two succeeded, each Drumpf&#39;s deserved share of the credit becoming less important with time, and upon the development’s sale enjoyed a million-dollar profit.

<p>So Trump had butlers to pull up his boot straps. I&#39;m inspired!</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t bother to read the assessment that most of what is considered wealth is his name. He has invested in making his name an international controversy since he bought the Generals in the early 80&#39;s.</p>

<p>Dude, were you alive then? Every hillbilly and his dog was making money off stuff in the early 80&#39;s, aka &quot;The Great Deregulatory Rape&quot;.</p>

<p>OTOH, we have Sanders, a person who has been on the right side of issues even when it was not convenient? A public servant vs a TV Reality star. Do you complain about the millionaires in Congress? HE IS NOT ONE.</p>

<p>Or are you arguing only rich people should be president because God smiles upon them more?</p>

<p>Your choice, between a servant of the people and a billionaire who only hires servants, doing chores they are too lazy or entitled to do for themselves?</p>

<p>Is there REALLY a choice? You support Trump because he reinforces the fear and hate you have for anyone not you. He tells you the things he knows you want to hear, without giving anything specific beyond &quot;I&#39;ll change the laws to strip the 1st Amendment!!&quot;.</p>

<p>You are probably right. Common sense is in the minority of thought today.</p>

<p>Did I give that impression? It&#39;s just I&#39;ve never seen such hostility towards a candidate.

It isn&#39;t like politicians haven&#39;t been running on building walls and locking down illegal immigration for over a decade now.  Where was the outrage? As I see it, the lobbyists are terrified of Trump and are spending billions to make people think Trump&#39;s the cause, rather than the symptom. There is a lot of misplace anger going towards Trump and his supporters. Trump haters are being played like a fiddle by the MSM. It&#39;s embarrassing for the left. </p>

I mean, it&#39;s not like he is a actor or a folk singer or something. His skills do seem applicable to the job. Not to mention his public speaking skills (reality TV star boss). This is the stuff his supporters like and why no matter how many times he says something stupid, it doesn&#39;t stick. He&#39;s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd-o_kLONVI">big boss man</a>. That is what people are voting for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your missing the part that the reason John Oliver stated the joke about Trumps name was due to the fact that Trump in the past has criticized John Stewart for changing his name, saying that it shows a lack of respect for your family history. It was in part to point out the hypocrisy of Trump who&#39;s family also changed their name to a more anglicized version. It was also a way to separate the true candidate from a brand and show Trump as an actual person rather then the baggage and apparent prestige that comes with the Trump brand. He explained all this in the bit..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true, and that&#39;s exactly what has happened. Stewart changed his name to have a catchier name for TV. Not a uncommon thing but it is ignoring your heritage, and it tells people with very traditional Jewish names that their family names aren&#39;t as good as more american names. I doesn&#39;t make Jon a bad guy but it&#39;s perfectly valid for someone like Trump (who has been attacked by Jon many times in the past and present) to call him out on. The Drumpf thing is about as stupid as blaming someone for being a slave owner because their great-great grandparents were plantation owners. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1600&#39;s ??...they weren&#39;t on the Mayflower. The name change occurred in the late 1800&#39;s. </p>

<p>The whole thing was just to illustrate the fact that Trump called out Sanders (Or Jon Stewart, I can&#39;t rewatch the clip now but he called somebody out for a name change )because his father changed their name. So JO was showing how this was not unheard of and after some digging found that somebody in the Trump family did the exact same thing.  </p>

<p>edit: Trump called out either Sanders or Jon Stewart, I forget now and cant look it up at the moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there seems to be a discrepancy over when they actually changed their names. I apologize, I hadn&#39;t seen the source for being changed in the 1600&#39;s. Numerous reports are stating that the change happened in 1885 or later and some indicate that the name change may never had been official. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The IBT article reads like an opinion piece. Where are the sources? Immigration logs, signatures, anything of the sort? As it is presented, the writer has nothing to back up their claims. </p>

<p>And as for the bustle article, I&#39;m gonna go with a gut intuition that the journalist writing a book about three generations of the family spent more time researching them than an article that ends with </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In case a name has the power to break a spell, let&#39;s join John Oliver in making Donald Drumpf again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because that seems less like journalism and more like &quot;teehee John Oliver made me giggle and I don&#39;t like Donald Trump&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know which one is true. Did the family&#39;s name change in the 1600s as the journalist doing the book on the family claims? Or did Donald&#39;s grandfather change it when he arrived here? Until someone can show some immigration logs or something of the sort, I&#39;ll lean towards the journalist that wrote the book. </p>

<p><em>Anonymous</em> is not a group.  <em>Anonymous</em> is a self-applied label.  If a group of people work together and call themselves <em>Anonymous</em>, it&#39;s merely individuals that have chosen to call themselves that while working together.  That&#39;s the whole point of being <em>Anonymous</em>.  No one speaks for the group because there is no group, no hierarchy, no command structure, no leaders, and arguably, no goals.</p>

<p>Actually I think It&#39;s the exact opposite.  Donald Trump created Donald Trump,  and whereas the media typically does create most politicians,  like Barack Obama,  they actually didn&#39;t create Trump,  which means they can&#39;t take him out either. </p>

<p>I had never heard of Obama before he ran for president, had you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, yes. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWynt87PaJ0">In 2004 he was the keynote speaker at the DNC</a> - this speech is when, like you said, the media really productized him.  This was the moment everyone in the media was saying, &quot;wow, look how presidential he sounds.&quot;  It was during his Senate run, years before the presidential run.   Your point still stands, the media and political establishment absolutely created Obama, and as we can see, everything action he takes is that of a puppet, not someone with power himself - he&#39;s just the face of the establishment.  I just wanted to add some clarification as to when his mainstream popularity actually began.</p>

Last night was just a barrage of &quot;Donald Trump hates women&quot;, &quot;Donald Trump has a women problem&quot; for like an hour. It&#39;s the same with fox. No one is trying to make him famous, they&#39;re simply trying to create a cloud of controversy around him, and it is working. The plan seems to be to create a ceiling of people who like controversy for him, and dissuade anyone who does not like to be different from their acquaintances from voting for him, to keep the feeling that to support Trump is and should be embarrassing. It has worked quite well.</p>

<p>Yes that&#39;s what I meant, the media has given him tons of exposure, so when he says something stupid like &quot;mark all muslims and ban them&quot;, a large portion of xenophobic Americans will see it and vote for him. Trump knows this, he&#39;s written about it and how any exposure helps. </p>

<p>Except, it&#39;s only now that the media is pointing out how factually incorrect many of his claims are. I think it will stay sway voters to vote for Trump but it will also sway a lot more people to vote Democrat.</p>

<p>Except he&#39;s never said anything about &quot;marking&quot; Muslims.  He simply said that we should pause immigration from from Muslim majority counties until we can figure out how to properly vet them. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is an unreasonable idea,  especially when you look what&#39;s going on in the country&#39;s that have accepted these &quot;refugees&quot; who are raping women in mass, and committing terror attacks.  He never once has said anything about marking Muslims already here, or deporting those who are here in the country legally.  Look at Poland, Romania,  the Czech Republic,  and Hungary.  They&#39;ve all essentially put the same exact policies in effect in their countries that Donald Trump is suggesting here.  </p>

<p>Please, let&#39;s not argue about things we know little about, I encourage you to look up the influence he&#39;s had on laws and bills passed. The man is a progressive through and through, if you don&#39;t find his accomplishments that impressive, blame our Conservative government, not him. Take the crime bill for example, he fought it and only gave in when it included money for good things, like a fund for investigations into home violence etc. He has accomplished a lot more than other Senators who just vote for their own self interests. </p>

<p>What kind of accomplishments do you expect from a guy who is constantly criticizing the system he works in? He is at odds with oligarchs seated in the senate.

Still think he can&#39;t get stuff done because he is not capable? He was a mayor for 8 years. Why do you think Hillary was <strong>non-viable</strong> in Vermont primary?</p>

<p>Well I definitely disagree with you that these things are positive things that will help our country in the long run.  Besides taxing corporate America,  making college free and socializing Healthcare would be absolutely detrimental to the middle class and working class.  There&#39;s no such thing as free anything.  His plan is simply to give the already corrupt federal government more power,  and more money, like somehow this will magically fix all of our problems.  Do you really think the answer to this country&#39;s problems is just give more power and more money to the corrupt federal government?  He wants to federalize everything from pre-school (got to start the state indoctrination add soon as possible! ) to health care,  college,  and local police departments. </p>

<p>He wants to increase the federal governments power and control ten-fold. This is absolutely the worst possible plan you could have.  The system is broken and needs to be dismantled completely and started over from scratch,  not grown bigger.  </p>

<p>Honestly, what is your argument here? You say he&#39;s planning to give the government more power, but there&#39;s nothing about him that suggests that. Right, nothing is truly free.

<p>This is wishful economics at best,  and wouldn&#39;t work here in the States due to our demographics.  The population here is older,  with the birth rate declining, which means we&#39;ll have more people using socialized Healthcare,  and less people putting paying into the system.  </p>

<p>For younger people like myself,  who are healthy,  and don&#39;t currently have health insurance,  it will not free up anything,  but instead end up costing us.  The fact that we have so many baby boomers who are retiring soon,  or already retired, that won&#39;t be contributing anything,  means that the younger people who typically are healthy and don&#39;t need Healthcare,  will be the ones paying for the baby boomers to get their Healthcare.  </p>

<p>So no,  it certainly won&#39;t free up anyone&#39;s money except for the baby boomers and retirees,  who will be the only ones enjoying life&#39;s luxuries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are talking like all that power is currently in the hand of the people and he&#39;s taking it away. You&#39;re free to <em>buy</em> your own healthcare and education. You are talking about freedom of the rich and incorporated. America is a shining example of what free markets and capitalism brings to society - a brave new world, where the rich are free to buy stuff they want, and the poor are also free to <em>not buy</em> stuff they need, like good education and healthcare.</p>

<p>A different perspective is like this: socializing the government means transferring not just power, but <em>obligation</em>. Suddenly, state is obligated to provide healthcare and education to everybody, and these two areas are now treated as basic rights. A present from society. Free market <em>has no obligation</em>. And don&#39;t think Sanders wants to <em>force</em> this down your throat. You will still be able to buy your own healthcare and education if you want. But you won&#39;t be forced to <em>not buy it</em> if you&#39;re poor.</p>

<p>There are valid concerns, like corruption. But that&#39;s just something that is more legal in free capitalistic system. Indoctrination? That&#39;s just paranoid prejudice. Sounds like <em>you</em> have already been indoctrinated, probably by the <em>free</em> press of US. There is no &#39;pledge to my country AND god&#39; in schools of socialistic democracies of Europe. There <em>is</em> one in the free capitalist USA. Socialistic democracy is a bit of a different animal than Russian socialism of old cold war era. It&#39;s the middle road, and like Europeans will tell you, not entirely a bad one.</p>

You don&#39;t study history.Check.</p>

<p>Now, you speak for all Britons and have declared they can&#39;t wait to ditch their free healthcare and embrace private insurance and hospitals. You are a bit off in the head. Check.</p>

<p>You think that actual Sanders Supporters care about Drumpf! That they would even go to a rally and HELP him get MORE attention with the INSINUATION that Sanders supporters are The Red Menace! Horrors. Pearls must be clutched!It could NEVER be <em>agents provocateurs!</em> SANDERS COMMIE SANDERS BAD BAD.</p>

<p>Comparing high schools to colleges is retarded. It&#39;s not like they will be &quot;free&quot; colleges anyway because Bernard Sandles is going to raise tax. Nothing is for free. Stop making retard comparisons.</p>

<p>Saying that Sanders reminds me of <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/List_of_communist_Jews">Communist Jews</a> isn&#39;t at all like what you&#39;re strawmanning me with. You accuse me of being a shill and then use the same shill tactics yourself, how much of a retarded cunt are you?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I never said all Britons. Again you shove words in my mouth like the rat you are. It&#39;s a fact that the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottatlas/2013/07/05/happy-birthday-to-great-britains-increasingly-scandalous-national-health-service/#7bbf035364c7">British healthcare system isn&#39;t as perfect as retards like you make it out to be.</a> Fuck off you pretentious, passive aggressive cunt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think that actual Sanders Supporters care about Drumpf!</p>

<p>You realize Drumpf is an insult popularized by John Oliver right, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Stewart">the same guy who had his boss change his name to be less Jewish?</a> The hypocrisy is real you smarmy assrag. The fact you&#39;re using insults like this shows much of a little bitch cultist you are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It could NEVER be agents provocateurs! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Easy to go to a rally, shove and assault Trump supporters and then say &quot;IT WASNT US IT WAS &lt;insert scapegoat&gt;&quot;. But what if I told you that Sanders defended his supporters who did that shit? The great, utopian mastermind himself? Oh wait, he did do that nevermind. Guess you weren&#39;t paying attention you passive aggressive weasel. So in the end even if they were &quot;agents&quot; Sanders is defending them. Look in the mirror.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Son, you are not really very good at your job. Your handlers are going to be disappointed in you.</p>

<p>Fuck off you smug piece of shit. If you want to call me a liar don&#39;t hide behind this pretentious bullshit. Fuck you. Go back to <a href="/r/SandersForPresident">/r/SandersForPresident</a> and squander your life savings on a cuckold. Or better yet go back to Tumblr you weak spined coward.</p>

<p>What are these other options you speak of?  Socialism?  Giving Washington DC more power,  and more money by federalizing pre-school through college so the state can indoctrinate my kids from 4-23 years of age like Bernie Sanders is proposing?   Or giving over complete control of my health care to an already corrupted to the core federal government that has already weaponized agencies like the IRS to go after political opponents?  Nah,  I&#39;m good.  You can have these other options. </p>

John O has showed his true colors. Bonus: John Oliver did a whole segment on the prime minister of New Zealand getting hit in the face with a dildo because off the TPP but hasn&#39;t talked about it once or why someone might be so mad about to throw it in the first place.

<p>There are those who feel like the past is littered with mistakes. 40 years of &#39;trickle down&#39; is like &#39;2000 years of Any Day Now!! from Christians. We don&#39;t buy it. I&#39;d rather try something new and unproved than something that only supports the status quo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny you keep whining about the &quot;status quo&quot; when Donald Trump is regularly censored and bashed by new sites like CNN, Yahoo News, Fox News, etc. Sorry, we don&#39;t want Muslims to bomb the US like Bernie Panders and Shillary Clinton want to do.</p>

<p>In 2050 history books in school will read about the Muslim takeover of Europe, the Western reclamation of Europe, and how it all started with us <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/">memeing Trump into the Oval Office.</a></p>

<p>We&#39;re helping to shitpost a president into office. And history will forget the rare Pepe&#39;s lost in the conflict....</p>

<p>The problem, and aching beauty, of a rare Pepe&#39;s strength... Is that to unleash it is to destroy it. Like one thousand stings relies on a carpet of sacrificial bees. For a Pepe to become common is its most noble act.</p>

<p>Once this victory is historic it will be natural to forget the rare Pepes - but it would be ungrateful to disrespect the common Pepes who meme among us.</p>

Now they are just liberal ploys. Watching Trevor Noah hurts my head, he is so freakin&#39; racist and liberal it makes me sick. Like all he does is target Trump and white people. Its sickening, to say the least. And did anyone see few weeks ago where Jon Steward whwn onto JO and Daily Show to talk shit about Trump? He was wearing a scruffy ass beard and looked homeless, like he was all drugged out and was talking mad shit about Conservatives and everything. It was so ridicolous, I make sure I change comedy central before 8oclock so I cant even hear these latenight liberal schill shows. Its just ridiculous now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be honest, I am late to the game and have been meaning to get into GoT and binge watch to catch up but haven&#39;t had the time yet.  The last show I Binged was Making a Murderer and my issue is that once I start I cannot stop.  I would lay in bed telling myself ok, one more episode and I got myself in trouble by staying up until like 3 or 4 in the morning!  I was dead the following day, I just can&#39;t turn them off when it is a good show.<br/>
But you make a great point, I do need to get into that show.  Many years ago I used to love HBO For Bill Maher but got sick of his crap a while ago and only now fast forward the show to hear his new rules or listen to a guest I like.<br/>
Anyway, I should not blame HBO because I do not like JO&#39;s views, HBO is awesome in letting their actors say anything they like with any interference and I am including comedy shows they have, HBO is awesome at not censoring and allowing all views, unless someone is going to post a link here showing me otherwise..........</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, I was referring to the comments rather than the title itself or anything you&#39;re trying to say with it. You&#39;re right, he hasn&#39;t done anything about Hillary, although, with Trump&#39;s presence, I don&#39;t think there needs to be. I&#39;m saying this as a person who doesn&#39;t support Hillary at all. To many Americans, Donald Trump is currently the biggest threat to American security, and I&#39;d argue you don&#39;t need to be fulfilling some larger agenda, as some have suggested about Oliver, to believe that. Trump&#39;s plans are often half-baked, his credentials are shoddy at best, and his motives are completely unknowable. That being said, his character, whether authentic or not, is absolutely brilliant. I think he&#39;s potentially the most effective political candidate in recent memory. 
While I question his authority on other matters, he clearly communicates very well with those of us who respond strongly to authoritarian governing styles. I really appreciate the mirror that he&#39;s held up to the Republican party as I think it might force some members to self-examine their positions and behaviors and move closer to a centrist line of thinking, independent of party lines. I think the Democrats really need something similar as well, but they won&#39;t get it this election cycle. </p>

<p>Oliver himself is a fairly reasonable liberal, and often rejects some of the more regressive positions taken by other liberals, such as the recent trigger word movement and college safe spaces. That being said, of course, he&#39;s going to target more conservative candidates. As much as I&#39;m sure he would like to be objective and remove himself from a given situation to see it clearly, it&#39;s impossible for a person to do so, and a person&#39;s politics is always going to taint how they view any given situation. To say he&#39;s a little one-sided, I think, is a little more accurate than saying he&#39;s a corporate media whore doing the bidding of those giving him his paycheck. </p>

<p>I always argue that there&#39;s far more ignorance and laziness in this world than there is actual evil, and I think this illustrates that notion well.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Oliver probably agrees more with Hillary than Trump, so of course he&#39;s going to cover Trump. Also, Trump is far more coverable. You don&#39;t need a conspiracy to explain that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary and Trump are both terrible.</p>

<p>John Oliver and others should really start cracking down on Hillary.  She&#39;s had so many scandals bubble up during this election:  classified emails, voter fraud and suppression across all key election states, assassination of Honduran activists, feuds with Black Lives Matter, complete flip-flop on issues, etc.  The media keeps ignoring it all, hoping that people will just roll over and accept another Clinton presidency.  It&#39;s such a joke.  A criminal heir is the media favorite for president of the United States.</p>

<p>For having 60+% of the Democratic &quot;vote,&quot; I have yet to see her support in real life.  I&#39;ve struggled to meet real-life Hillary supporters - I&#39;ve only met two so far.  I see very few bumper stickers or yard signs for Hillary.  I haven&#39;t seen tens of thousands of people attend her rallies.  In my state, she swept 65% of the vote.  But where are her voters?  I have yet to see them.  Pure fraud.</p>

<p>And the alternative is supposed to be Trump, who is re-enacting Hitler&#39;s playbook?  God this country is so fucked.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders needs to stand up and take real action on the massive voter fraud in Arizona, or else he is completely done for.  Meaning we are all completely done for.</p>

<p>This is another false narrative being put out there by the liberal mainstream media,  and the likes of John Oliver and Saturday night live that just isn&#39;t true.  How exactly is DT, re-enacting Hitler&#39;s playbook?  He was against the Iraq war,  against the Libyan war,  and has said numerous times that we&#39;d be better off if Assad in Syria stayed in power.  Please explain how Trump resembles Hitler or his policies in any way. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have been saying the exact same thing.  Until Bernie himself is willing to protest the results, which he wasn&#39;t willing to do in Iowa, Nevada, Massachusetts,  and now Arizona,  where there&#39;s been obvious voter fraud occurring,  nothing will come of it. If Bernie is willing to get fucked in the ass time and time again by the Democratic party, and not challenge any of these results publicly, it&#39;s enough proof for me that he is not in it to win it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anything, mainstream media is advertising the hell out of Trump.  He&#39;s had way more airtime than all other candidates, probably combined.  Even bad press seems to be good press for him, because the media has completely abdicated their journalistic duty to exploit the spectacle that Trump has made of himself.</p>

<p>How is he Hitler?  Take any statement that Trump makes about Muslims or Mexicans, and replace Muslim/Mexican with the word Jew.  Now he sounds like Hitler.  &quot;Jews are rapists, drug dealers, etc.  And some I assume are good people.&quot;  &quot;Donald J Trump is calling for the complete and total ban on Jewish immigrants.&quot;  It&#39;s all fear and xenophobia designed to stir visceral reactions from people.</p>

<p>Not to mention, his ex-wife said that Trump kept the book &quot;My New Order&quot; (aka &quot;New World Order&quot;) by his bedside - <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trumps-ex-wife-once-said-he-kept-a-book-of-hitlers-speeches-by-his-bed-2015-8">link</a></p>

<p>Trump hedges his bets on getting endorsements from David Duke, and retweets white supremacists.</p>

<p>Trump also has fanatical rallies, where he encourages his attendees to beat up dissidents, and has black people removed/arrested for nothing at all.  This has happened at multiple rallies.</p>

<p>Trump also owes billions of dollars in debt to multi-national Rothschild banks, including JP Morgan Chase, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, and others.  That&#39;s definitely something he has in common with Hitler.</p>

<p>Not to mention Trump&#39;s latest cock-gobbling of Israel&#39;s bloody dick at the latest AIPAC conference.  Israel is the most twisted, corrupt, and hateful government on the planet (outside of Saudi Arabia possibly), and Trump has no qualms with sucking them off for campaign money.</p>

<p>I agree with you about Bernie.  He&#39;s been far too soft in an attempt to run a &quot;clean&quot; campaign.  He is letting the DNC completely steam-roll him.  As a Bernie supporter, I&#39;m very disappointed by his lack of action to address voter fraud and suppression.  He make speak strongly against it, but he hasn&#39;t really done anything either.  It&#39;s making an even bigger mockery of our election process.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all,  Hitler persecuted Jews who were already legally living in Germany.  Donald Trump has never once advocated banning or deporting Muslims or Mexicans who are legally in this country already.  He&#39;s simply stating that those people who broke our immigration laws and are here illegally will be sent back to their ccounty, and be allowed to return legally,  the right way.  In terms of Muslim immigrants,  again he&#39;s never once said we should ban or deport Muslims living here legally,  he only said that we should put a pause on bringing new immigrants from Muslim majority country&#39;s until we can figure out what&#39;s going on, and until we can vet them properly.  This is not a racist policy,  but one of common sense,  especially after what&#39;s happened in Paris and Brussels.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Come on, you know that&#39;s not true,  this is a mainstream media talking point.  He&#39;s disavowed Duke on numerous occasions.  Aside from that,  have you ever listened to David Duke before?  He&#39;s not a racist.  He is one of the very few people who actually tell the truth about Jewish supremacy,  and how it&#39;s permeated this country.  He views the Jews as the biggest threat to our country,  and backs it up with facts.  Donald Trump has denounced him numerous times, but I personally agree with a lot of what Duke says,  and I&#39;m surprised after your comments about Israel that you don&#39;t agree with him either. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well I certainly do agree with you about Israel, and the dick sucking that Donald Trump,  and every other candidate did recently at AIPAC. I actually respect Bernie Sanders quite a bit for refusing to show up at the Israeli circle jerk. This actually was very impressive to me that he didn&#39;t show up. </p>

<p>I will refute however that Donald Trump is even remotely interested in the Jewish lobbyists money.

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is definitely the low hanging comedic fruit. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just tired of seeing his name everywhere when he&#39;s such a poor candidate. The media talks about how they <em>hate him so much,</em> but if that were true, they wouldn&#39;t even mention is name. It&#39;s really stupid because they love it. They&#39;re getting the best ratings ever and it&#39;s all over the stupid outrage over Trump&#39;s &quot;anti-pc&quot; rhetoric, and as usual nothing to do with policies or the real problems plaguing our society. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>A half hour slot contains... what? 15 minutes of actual content, subtracting ads? It&#39;s difficult to derive humor from Hillary&#39;s nonsense for the average viewer to comprehend in that time span. Think about it everyone: when you hear a joke, do you want immediate gratification with a ready punchline, or hours of buildup? It&#39;s difficult to derive humor out of Hillary&#39;s fuck ups, whereas with Trump, it&#39;s easy - &quot;you hear this guy wants to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it?!&quot; Bam, done. So yeah, I&#39;m in agreement.</p>

<p>The more redditors go out of their way to &#39;convince&#39; then &#39;attack&#39; me for my political position, the more viscous and shrill the ad hominems come, I am even more resolute to go to the DNC in Philly and go through the useless, but necessary motions of delegating for Mr. Sanders.</p>

<p>If Sanders does not make the nomination, I&#39;ll consider either Trump, or Gary Johnson. But never ever Cruiz or Clinton. </p>

<p>But what you angry and fearful voters forget that Donald Trump, and Trump&amp;trade; the Candidate are different things. One is a human. The other is a brand. You are a consumer of politics, being sold a brand. As long as you understand and accept that reality, feel free (nothing&#39;s Free!)  to support your brand.</p>

<p>If only the Trump apologists would take a rational approach and discuss their concerns, I can take the candidate more serious. But name calling, damp memes and child-talk is not a good reflection upon your candidate.</p>

<p>&quot;Hillary Clinton had a big night, picking up victories in seven states. While speaking in Miami last night Hillary said, &#39;I believe what we need in America today is more love and kindness.&#39; Then she added, &#39;And I will crush anyone who won&#39;t let me do it.&#39;&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;Analysts say Hillary Clinton&#39;s plan to defeat Donald Trump involves painting Trump as &#39;dangerous and bigoted.&#39; She plans on doing this by quoting Trump accurately.&quot; –Conan O&#39;Brien</p>

<p>&quot;Hillary is facing criticism for declaring victory in Iowa prematurely.</p>

<p>The final results weren&#39;t actually announced till around 1 p.m. on Tuesday, but she declared victory back in April of last year.&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;This Sunday is Super Bowl 50, between the Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers. Of course it&#39;ll be weird when they do the coin toss before the big game, and the winner is still somehow Hillary Clinton.&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton were named the winners of Monday&#39;s Iowa caucuses.  Cruz celebrated by giving a speech to his supporters, and Hillary celebrated by moving her stuff into the White House.&quot; –Seth Meyers</p>

<p>&quot;At a town hall in Iowa, a voter asked Hillary Clinton how her views align with the Ten Commandments, and she said that &#39;in many areas judgment should be left to God.&#39; Then God was like, &#39;OK. You really shouldn&#39;t have deleted all those emails.&#39;&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;A new poll shows that in the last month, Hillary Clinton&#39;s lead in Iowa has shrunk from 9 percent to 2 percent. Meanwhile, her fake smile has grown 200 percent.&quot; –Seth Meyers</p>

<p>&quot;New polls found that Bernie Sanders is now ahead of Hillary Clinton among Democrats in both Iowa and New Hampshire. And even Hillary&#39;s lead in national polls is dwindling.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to say Hillary is upset, but this morning she was spotted shouting into a volcano, &#39;You said we had a deal!&#39;&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;The Associated Press just announced that they are no longer including Hillary Clinton&#39;s maiden name &#39;Rodham&#39; in articles about her, nor will they call her &#39;Mrs. Clinton&#39; anymore.</p>

<p>While Republicans have announced that they will no longer call Hillary by the name &#39;Lady Voldemort.&#39;&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;At last night&#39;s CNN town hall debate for the Democrats, Hillary Clinton said that during her time in the White House, she would actually put on a baseball cap and sunglasses so she could walk around Washington, D.C., unnoticed. The only time it went wrong was when Bill pulled up and said, &#39;Hey baby, do you — oh, never mind.&#39;&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;Happy birthday to Hillary Clinton, who turned 68 today. When asked what her favorite gift was, she said, &#39;Donald Trump.&#39;&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;I read that Hillary&#39;s staff is starting to worry that her campaign still doesn&#39;t have an official theme. Then Hillary said, &#39;Yes it does – revenge.&#39;&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;Hillary Clinton said this weekend that the record turnout for Bernie Sanders&#39; rallies is great for the Democratic Party. And it wasn&#39;t easy for her to say that, because at the time, she was biting a cinder block in half.&quot; –Seth Meyers</p>

<p>&quot;CNN will break new ground by live streaming the next primary debate in virtual reality. With the help of a virtual reality headset, users can actually watch the debates from the perspective of an audience member. It&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re seeing Hillary Clinton right in front of you, but she&#39;s not actually there — just like the real Hillary Clinton!&quot; –Stephen Colbert</p>

<p>&quot;Last week, the firefighters&#39; union announced that it was no longer supporting Hillary for president. You know your campaign&#39;s in trouble when firefighters are like, &#39;Even WE can&#39;t put out that many fires.&#39;&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;Hillary Clinton went on &#39;Meet the Press&#39; yesterday, and I saw that Chuck Todd actually showed her a video of all the times she&#39;s flip-flopped on issues. At first Hillary said she felt bad about it, but now she says she feels OK about it.&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;According to a New York Times report, Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign is trying to put the whole email scandal behind her. They say they want to start bringing humor and spontaneity to her campaign. And nothing says spontaneity like announcing you&#39;re about to be spontaneous. “Here comes the spontaneity in 3, 2, 1...Boo!&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;The State Department just released another batch of Hillary’s e-mails from when she was Secretary of State. In the e-mails, Hillary asked an aide what time &#39;The Good Wife&#39; was on, how to charge her iPad, and how to get wi-fi. Hillary sounds less like the Secretary of State and more like my mom at a hotel.&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;According to a new poll, Hillary Clinton has lost a third of her supporters in Iowa since May. There&#39;s still debate as to whether she lost them or just deleted them from her database.&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;In a recent interview, Hillary Clinton said that one of the jobs that prepared her to be president was sliming fish in Alaska. As opposed to Bill, who learned by catching crabs in Cancun.&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;Hillary Clinton is headed to L.A. this month to attend a fundraiser hosted by &#39;Spider-Man&#39; star Tobey Maguire. Hillary is a big fan of Spider-Man because he proves that Americans still love sequels.&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;According to a new poll, the number of Americans who trust Hillary is dropping. Specifically into a hole that Hillary covered with leaves.&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;Hillary Clinton has temporarily changed her campaign logo to rainbow colors in support of marriage equality. Of course, her idea of marriage equality is both of you should get to be president.&quot; –Seth Meyers</p>

<p>&quot;Ben of Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s is coming out with an ice cream for Bernie Sanders called &#39;Bernie&#39;s Yearning.&#39; It&#39;s selling a lot better than Jerry&#39;s ice cream for Hillary, &#39;Pantsuit Email Crunch.&#39;&quot; –Conan O&#39;Brien</p>

<p>&quot;Hillary Clinton is now in Iowa. She&#39;s spending every waking minute of her day meeting ordinary people, and it&#39;s to prepare her for a job in which she will never again meet an ordinary person.&quot; –David Letterman</p>

<p>&quot;Hillary Clinton announced she&#39;s running for president. Yesterday in Ohio, Hillary popped into a Chipotle and she ordered a burrito bowl with chips and salsa. And on her way out she said, &#39;That locks down the Hispanic vote.&#39;&quot; –Conan O&#39;Brien</p>

<p>&quot;Yesterday Hillary Clinton made the big announcement we all knew was coming. She&#39;s going to join the all-female cast of &#39;Ghost Busters.&#39;&quot; –Conan O&#39;Brien</p>

<p>&quot;Hillary Clinton is now driving from New York to Iowa. It&#39;s been called the least-exciting spring break trip in history.&quot; –Conan O&#39;Brien</p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;re talking about putting a woman on the $20 bill. And Hillary said, &#39;I&#39;m available.&#39;&quot; –David Letterman</p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s some kind of a thing where when she was Secretary of State she was using her own e-mail instead of the State Department, and I thought finally, a Clinton scandal the entire family can enjoy.&quot; –David Letterman</p>

<p>&quot;Another scandal for Hillary Clinton — they&#39;re saying she used a private email address when she was secretary of state, which means the government couldn&#39;t archive and preserve her emails. Then Obama said, &#39;Don&#39;t worry, we saw them. We see everyone&#39;s emails.&#39;&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;Hillary Clinton used a private email account to conduct official state business. Experts say that if this violates any federal rules, then she . . . will still be president.&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

<p>&quot;The RNC released its first presidential debate schedule, which includes at least nine debates in different states across the country. As opposed to the Democratic debates, which will just be Hillary staring at her opponents until they burst into flames.&quot; –Jimmy Fallon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very few of those are topical, which is Oliver&#39;s focus. Most of them are personal attacks on Hillary&#39;s awkwardness, how many people don&#39;t like her, and her presumption of victory etc.. Only a few are about the emails. I&#39;m not saying it couldn&#39;t be done, but if I were a writer picking a target to ridicule, Trump is the far easier target.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For starters, tetefather said &quot;presidency,&quot; not &quot;candidacy,&quot; (+[-1] for reading comprehension) and the reason it would be a sad day for humanity is that, for however gratifying it might feel to have a candidate willing to point out every shitty thing Shillary has done over the course of her career as a &quot;public servant&quot; (insert crazy-sad cackles of laughter) he really is just about the closest thing we&#39;ve seen to Adolf Hitler in American politics, and that, my friend, is quite sad. Hitler would&#39;ve talked all kind of shit about Hillary. Doesn&#39;t make him a good presidential candidate. If you don&#39;t understand why 90%(+) of what Donald says ought to disqualify him from the presidency, you must be voting for him. He&#39;d make a terrible president. He&#39;s got no discernible policy or political philosophy and is basically running on a platform which consists of thinly-veiled racism and misogyny, which apparently appeals to a lot of Americans. Understandably, I suppose, but it&#39;s sad for the rest of us who don&#39;t dig the whole angry redneckbeard vibe. </p>

<p>Oh please.  What exactly has he said that you consider to be racist?  This is a just a talking point being propagated by the mainstream media in an attempt to try and get weak minded people to associate Donald Trump with racism. </p>

<p>Dont get me wrong Im a Bernie supporter I dont like Hillary I dont like the idea of presidental dynasties preached the same during Obamas race and during Bushs reign.

<p>the reason for it is that trump was slated to play the role of &quot;distract everyone from reality and give half the mob someone to focus on&quot;(people who are both &#39;for&#39; and &#39;against&#39;) - so that&#39;s exactly the role that he&#39;s playing, and the inform and influence operations run on everyone(known collectively as &quot;the media&quot;) is pumping that out every day, because that&#39;s the role they play in the corporate fascist soft-authoritarian dictatorship.</p>

<p>Actually I think It&#39;s the exact opposite.  Donald Trump created Donald Trump,  and whereas the media typically does create most politicians,  like Barack Obama,  they actually didn&#39;t create Trump,  which means they can&#39;t take him out either. </p>

<p>The media really has no control over Trump, which is why when they attack him,  it ends up helping him rather then hurting him.</p>
