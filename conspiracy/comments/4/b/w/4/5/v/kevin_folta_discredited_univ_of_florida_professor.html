    <div class="md"><p>That entire <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> thread is worth a read. Amazingly illustrative how the usual suspects refused to answer basic questions and insulted and downvote-brigaded everyone.</p>

<p>My questions there still haven&#39;t been answered (esp. re:RNA gene expression in rice and why these &quot;researchers&quot; <em>don&#39;t</em> want more federal funding for R&amp;D and QA).</p>

<p>I guess we got our answers - they are working for companies that don&#39;t want further testing done, our past shoddy track record and future generations be damned. But I wish these tools woke up and gained a little integrity, the whole thing is depressing...that people can be bought so cheaply.</p>

<p>Please stop lying. Here&#39;s an article I found by typing &quot;kevin folta 25000 monsanto money&quot; into a search engine.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Folta â€” Poster Boy for Industry-Funded Third-Party Experts</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most recent conflict-of-interest scandals involving Monsanto and University of Florida professor Kevin Folta, a vocal advocate of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), was recently highlighted by Nature2 and The New York Times.3,4</p>

<p>Folta, who has vehemently denied ever receiving any money from Monsanto, was caught having been less than forthright about his connections to the company when his email correspondence was released in response to a freedom of information (FOIA) request by US Right to Know.5</p>

<p>In August of last year, Folta did in fact receive a $25,000 unrestricted grant from Monsanto, and Folta wrote back to a Monsanto executive saying: &quot;I am grateful for this opportunity and promise a solid return on the investment.&quot;</p>

<p>However, despite a rare flurry of media attention, <strong>none of the mainstream media outlets have addressed the most flagrant piece of evidence against Folta, showing that not only did he solicit these funds from Monsanto, he appeared to do so with intent to hide the financial connection between them.</strong></p>

<p>Still waiting for you to <strong>cite me a GMO study on humans that has been conducted for over 2 months. Then we can talk about the &#39;safety&#39; of an unproven modification.</strong></p>

<p>Why are you denying proven facts? An FOIA request already proved Kevin Folta is a Monsanto shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was wrong, you were right. I actually went through what was on document cloud and it appears much more legitimate than I thought. In addition, what GMOs are we talking about? Which ones do you want a study for? Either way, IMO, even if Folta is full of shit (it appears he is) it just means Monsanto has a cheerleader, not that GMOs will give you cancer and make you shit out your intestines.</p>

<p>Erase your initial lies if you want to continue this conversation.</p>

<p>There are no long term human GMO consumption studies available, therefore anything you&#39;re asking is irrelevant to the conversation. </p>

<p><strong>GMO is not proven as safe for human consumption based on there being no human studies. Period.</strong></p>
