        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Check out sites like this: <a href="http://www.redditsecrets.com/buy-reddit-upvotes">http://www.redditsecrets.com/buy-reddit-upvotes</a></p>

<p>and this: <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/gigs/reddit/#page=1">https://www.fiverr.com/gigs/reddit/#page=1</a></p>

<p>and this: <a href="http://www.buyredditvotes.us/buy-reddit-votes">http://www.buyredditvotes.us/buy-reddit-votes</a></p>

<p>And then realize why certain posts have such a disproportionate amount of upvotes, and why <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3qfa0k/this_sub_is_fully_compromised/">others have a disproporationate amount of downvotes and get brigaded</a>. </p>

<p>Reddit is Mainstream Media. Votes, and even comments and comment votes, can be bought from PR agencies. If you&#39;re a big company, you just hire them to do all the work for you, it&#39;s much cheaper than traditional advertising. They call it &quot;native advertising&quot;, where they rig comment threads to promote a certain product or narrative. It can also be used by the government and by other groups interested in influencing public discourse in an inexpensive manner. This needs to be common knowledge. </p>

<p>Also, realize that means every vote you make has an information value of around 80 cents. That&#39;s actually kind of a big deal, if you think about it. You generate 80 cents of advertising/viewership value in just a single vote. </p>

Hail corporate became a common comment in posts about jokes on pizza box lids and shit. </p>

<p>It&#39;s weird because reddit ostensibly likes authenticity and transparency but posts often make it to the top of <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> that are clearly karma farming bots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They had them for 7 years, working just fine on RES, then they pulled it with no warning, saying they were going to replace it with a &quot;heat cross&quot; that got redder the more controversial a comment was, but then they got rid of that literally within the day if I remember correctly. </p>

<p>That means they did <em>extra</em> work to make them vanish, they went and messed with 7 year old code to get it to change, and pissed off everyone, so there <em>must</em> have been a huge financial incentive to do so or else they wouldn&#39;t have expended the man-hours.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just shameful, is what it is. Trying to hide from the users how fake and manufactured the environment really is, so they can retain viewers and thus keep investors interested. You know reddit is headquartered in the new WTC 1 building, right? You know who their biggest investors are, right? </p>

<p>They are bought and sold, but it was so gradual that a lot of people didn&#39;t notice. I&#39;ve been around 8 years so I saw the whole slide down. Now not even this subreddit looks like the front page of reddit used to look. Everything is so BS and propaganda and advertisements instead of deeply revealing corporate, political, and tech news. It&#39;s so frustrating to see a public forum go bad because it got bought out, especially when they spend so much effort hiding it from everyone who uses the website. They learned from the mass digg exoduses, and they&#39;re avoiding making a lot of the same mistakes. </p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of speculation about who the biggest investors are, but they likely have to do with information gathering, and they likely have tons of money. All you have to do is look at the front page. I see a lot of military stuff. I see a lot of advertising. Pick your pony. It&#39;ll probably be years before we know the actual truth, but my money is on a three-letter government agency, that is known for intense media relations and for having a huge secret black budget.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been saying for a while that PR firms are the true evil. They&#39;ve gotten so huge and are so intertwined with social media. You can&#39;t really blame companies for trying to make more money, or organizations trying to improve their public image. Sure, they can employ bad business practices and irresponsible money making schemes, but mostly only within the realm of what the public will put up with. </p>

<p>The PR firms are designed to literally control the flow of information, in every form that it takes. It has grown far from performing image consulting services like &quot;make your brand more kid-friendly&quot; or &quot;sponsor some school&#39;s science programs&quot;. If given enough money they can almost completely control all forms of communication about your brand. Even when it&#39;s straight up lying, or posing as real people. You know all the obvious sponsored content you see on reddit now? Picture galleries of particularly funny quotes from tv shows that everyone loves? That&#39;s them.</p>

<p>Check out the website of <a href="http://edelman.com/">Edelman</a>. One of the giants. Look at just how many industries they are involved with, from foreign countries to defense contractors to pharmaceuticals, almost every major industry, all over the world. They openly brag about how they can do this kind of thing, like they&#39;re proud that social media has allowed them a new way to do continue doing business on the cutting edge. But it has such far-reaching control and is disgustingly dishonest to the public. They got a nice little internal alert just now that I mentioned them. They can respond by doing whatever they think is best in this situation: to crush it or leave it alone and watch how it plays out.</p>

<p>Places like those are the ones who allow these companies and agencies to get so completely out of control. Take them out, and you take out almost all of the propaganda we see flying around. It would be cutting it off at the head. </p>

<p><em>Edit: be prepared. The first time I went to the Edelman site I spent hours there. My mind was kind of blown about how many things they have their fingers in. Openly bragging about it, so controversial companies see that they truly have no limits on who they&#39;ll represent or the ways in which they&#39;ll do so.</em></p>

<p>A vote for what a schill wants is worth &quot;80 cents&quot;. A random unsolicited vote is not.</p>

<p>My shoes are worth $2000. Your shoes are not.</p>

<p>My shoes are crafted with fine imported italian leather. Your shoes are not.</p>

<p>My shoes are custom crafted to perfectly fit my feet. Your shoes are not.</p>

<p>My comment/vote is precisely where and what and when the schill wanted it to be. Your comment/vote is not.</p>

<p>You understand why our shoes have different values.</p>

<p>Newsflash! Your unsolicited votes aren&#39;t worth 80 cents. </p>

<p>People pay for articles/books/movies/propaganda to be created too. That doesn&#39;t make your book report or home movie worth a penny. It doesn&#39;t serve the same purpose for a would-be purchaser.</p>

An upvote scheme will increase the visibility of your Reddit post, but the engagement will be lower than a post that is authentically upvoted by the community. In other words, fake upvotes are not going to make the content you are promoting more valuable. Creating valuable content takes time and will generate upvotes on its own merit.</p>
