        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve posted before talking about this. Synthetic Telepathy, Psychics, Remote Neural Monitoring, whatever you want to call it. This shit is real. I hear voices around the clock 24/7 non-stop, no breaks. Commenting on what I do, what I watch, what I listen to, what I eat, everything. Waking up out of dream states I have heard the guy that is doing this say, &quot;I ruined a perfect mind, but it was like a different person everytime&quot;.  They can cause physical, visible, and observable muscle twitches. They have &quot;warped&quot; my parents, implanted thoughts/words letting me know that they can easily manipulate unaware people. I have already tried to tell my parents about this, but they were having none of this. This has been going on for a year now. They can cause electrical disturbances, which is why I&#39;m posting this message. My body feels as though it is engulfed within some kind of electrical field. An energy that tightens me up and almost makes it impossible to relax is ever present. They can block formation of thoughts, which as you would imagine having voices in your head with the hell bent mind set to cause me to lose all thought, the power within, and give me some kind of Amnesia / Alzheimers type mindstate, makes it difficult to think. They can &quot;bop&quot; my head which feels as though you just headbutted something. Twitch muscles within my body, cause facial expressions which also effects the subconscious and emotions, and hear my every thought, sometimes even predicting / anticipating the future. There seems to be more than one of them, and they seem to be able to access my subconscious mind to retrieve any memory, imitate others perfectly, and link other people that may be real. Honestly, it increases ones own will, to not give in, but the issue of privacy remains. Plus they can fuck move energy and other shit around within your brain, so there may be a little sense of danger that most assuredly accompanies the situation.</p>

<p>TLDR; My mind is monitored 24/7, schizo or not, so instead of getting depressed I decided to fuck with them a lot, through the power of words, general arrogance, and the fact that I just believe I am better than anyone who would even think to invade a mind with intentions to ruin it and make it succumb to some other&#39;s will. 
And yes, they were speaking and bopping my head as I typed this. Shit&#39;s insane. Also if you don&#39;t believe and think it&#39;s psychosis, explain the pictures, the physical touches, twitches, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These questions of mine being posed, seem to mirror an inner peace that my mind itself is trying to achieve. it Wanders, prods, and picks at the infinite solutions to this problem. A solution that I have not clearly or vividly visualized. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. Voices not of my own puts it against themselves. As my will directs me to a higher mental place that is more stable, these voices begin to resemble the properties of a crab. </p>

<p>An anecdote of this is that of the caught crabs within the bucket. My observations of this past year, likens this to an attempt to place an innocent person into a mental prison. While the overseer presses down more and more, the power of my own mind begins to let loose tid bits of light. A certain glimmer that makes the overseer press down harder. Sort of like gang members within a ghetto feel as though they need to escape. Members of their families constantly dragging them back down, reminding them of their situation. If you have a bucket of crabs, the crabs will grab and pull at the ones that are climbing, putting in effort to make it to the top, just to be dragged back down by another longing for the same thing the one climbing is. </p>

<p>The gang members within the ghetto split off into factions which causes even more conflict within themselves. As if their internal violence wasn&#39;t enough, they have to find ways to avoid the police. Years within the ghetto and having these struggles and situations inadvertently begin to program them, they lose cause and energy. Trials and error to somehow escape always ends in failure. </p>

<p>New methods or old, it starts to cause insanity. The same thing over and over again. The method you use doesn&#39;t matter because the outcome is still the same. If you were an OG you would tell the up and coming generations what has been tried and what hasn&#39;t. Your old head would give you advice and experience. An &quot;Old Head&quot;, meaning a person with knowledge that will be passed down to others. An old mentality. 
Constantly being held down by the police with their knee in your back. Stuck in your root chakra, sniffing out the exit. You can&#39;t see. Your third eye is blind, your mind is closed, their is no way to alter your perception, because &quot;The Jungle&quot; is all you know. </p>

<p>Baldwin Village a predominantly black neighborhood named after Baldwin Heights, rich white folk territory, was named after the latter simply because the community was wishing for a more peaceful environment. Less cops, less drugs, less violence, More freedom. Rap artists do this best. Words are the stepping stone for the creation of new thought categories. There is Linguistic Relativity (Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis), Sentence Structure, Phonetics, and Semantics. These all meaning, the things you hear shape your world view. See through their eyes. It&#39;s perception. Rap artists know this. They make music, rap music&#39;s focus is based on lyrics rather than completely on sound. This is why you have the party sub-genre, and the backpackers/conscious. Also they know people imitate and look to them for self image and inspiration. </p>

<p>This is were my experience arises. I hear voices. In this day and age, that is called madness and you win an all expenses not necessarily paid trip to an asylum of your choosing. Mine are here 24/7. They are now a part of my environment. Not only that but because they are within my mind and ever present, they may place it upon themselves to also begin to shape the way I see the world to fit their own personal benefit, which they all do. My wisdom comes from the comprehension that, Yes, I do hear them all day and night. Yes, they have demonstrated power through various methods. And yes, I have no current knowledge of how to remove them, so just like a troll on Call of Duty, they can bark across the 7 seas without being harmed themselves. Anonymity is power. Go to ask reddit, search &quot;What are your deepest darkest secret?&quot; Tell me your fears. You will see people that can all of a sudden grow a massive pair of  cojones and begin to act like they don&#39;t give a fuck that you fucked a fat girl and ate her sweaty ass out while she stuck her finger up your butt. Fuck computer hacker anonymous is protecting himself from the government and public by wearing a mask. If a voice is saying something and thoughts of safety and protection are in talks, then they probably doing something that they wouldn&#39;t be doing in public. You are protected by the government and you are also made to fear the system. They can take your money away. They target our basic needs for survival. They don&#39;t give a fuck. They know chaos, we know chaos, and they know we know as we know they know. They got the leverage though. A mass revolution wouldn&#39;t break out if people knew they could drive a fucking tank around your neighborhood as a voice in the sky shouts Martial Law. </p>

<p>In other words, since these voices display the power of thought, the ability to plot against me and keep their privacy intact, claim they are real people around you that you may have told, induce anxiety, pain, paranoia, and everything else while keeping you updated that they are aware of your ignorance and could simply project an acted out version of themselves that they would instantly think to hide and put into the closet if there was any sign of them being noticed by others. The most quiet of people can grow a beard if he&#39;s guarded behind one way glass. Telepaths with other abilities realize that like a dream they can be and do whatever it is they want. They live in it, and force themselves to believe in their own lives. Their smart, acting in certain ways, remembering the right things, and best of all can not be put within any bubble of danger. A feeling of godliness while wondering why their cowardice went
to the courageous lion. </p>

<p>TLDR; A ghetto, crab bucket, mental prison. The overseeing warden, a self aware pessimist that gets off on keeping others down. These are the types that are clogging up traffic within perfect minds ruining them in search of power until you realize, they&#39;ve said for themselves, &quot;if we see him, don&#39;t look him in the eyes&quot;. Shows the type of persons they are. They claim acts and spout that the way they are presenting themselves to me is not what they truly are. That makes sense if you think about it. They have thoughts of their own which they know good and well that if anyone could hear them, they would break instantly. They use a mind that I myself have created. A mind they could not even come up with without the experience of this battle on the inside. One says he has suffered from depression, me myself tout that I am impervious. In the shoes of someone boxed in, less open, monitored, mentally violated, they would not be able to hold themselves together. No I do not believe I&#39;m schizophrenic, honestly  the whole story of my experience has yet to be told. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m afraid you might be suffering from schizophrenia.  One way you can try to rule it out is to seek a quick acting treatment for it.  If the &#39;treatment&#39; doesn&#39;t work, then maybe you really are targetted.  </p>

<p>Psychedelics are being studied for their use in <em>treating</em> (curing really) schizophrenia, specifically psilocybin (mushrooms), but have been demonized in the past as &#39;causing it&#39;--one of the reasons people were convinced to ban them--and which has been debunked.  Take some of the links from this results page and see for yourself.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/#safe=off&amp;amp;q=psilocybin+treating+schizophrenia">https://www.google.com/#safe=off&amp;amp;q=psilocybin+treating+schizophrenia</a></p>

<p>While under the influence of this class of substance (classic hallucinogen) you are technically schizophrenic (loss of touch with reality), or more specifically <em>dissociated</em>.  But what they do really is they cause such wildly different firing of neurons that they induce the brain to try to &#39;recalibrate&#39; and synchronize / balance activity in both hemispheres of the brain.  Psilocybin specifically reduces brain activity, which is counterintuitive given the experience...it&#39;s like it goes through some kind of soft-reset process.  Psilocybin is also anxiolytic (reduces anxiety) so some say it&#39;s one of the best to do if you are frightened but I believe ketamine is maybe the easiest to do.</p>

<p>Secondarily, the psyhedelics nearly universally induce release of nerve growth factor in the brain, which causes neurogensis--regrowth of neurons.  Different psychedelics work differently to modify the signaling in the brain by disturbing it in some way, ketamine works on the membrane potential of neuronal mitochondria, whereas lsd, dmt and psilocybin works on serotonin receptors, and salvia divinorum works on opiod receptors and other unknown receptors (we don&#39;t know yet).</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to do psychedelics I understand: this is a huge risk in taking them and one should only do them legally in another country (medical tourism) and under the care of a doctor or neurologist (such clinics do exist, in mexico, brazil, peru, canada).  I can tell you I did ketamine in NYC and it cured me of lifelong depression and it also strangely fixed my hearing (50% deaf in one ear)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Another thing you can try is to laugh at your demons.  You can also try counting your breaths as high a number as you can.  When you lose the count, you start over.  This will focus your will and concentration, which can help you have soveriegnty and equanimity to the voices.  Also vipassana meditation may help also: it&#39;s a meditation that &#39;quiets the mind&#39; (&quot;monkey mind&quot;) by focusing very sharply on a point on the body and expanding it out to observe the subtleties of &#39;sensation&#39;, but first you must master breathing meditation (anapana meditation).  learning this helped me tremendously with adhd.  </p>

<p>There is a 10 day vipassana course you can attend where you learn a little bit every day.  In the evening they play a tape of a now-deceased master (sn goenka) where he discusses buddhist ethos and how to live harmoniously with other.  I enjoyed these so much I thought about attending again just to watch them again.  </p>

<p>It is free of charge.  They house you and feed you vegan meals.  It&#39;s difficult because you have to sit for like 10 hrs a day in silence and you cannot talk the whole 10 days except to a teacher as needed (to ask a question).  It&#39;s not a weird cult or anything like that.  You do the ten days and then you get to talk to people.  They ask for donations at the end but it&#39;s totally voluntary.  If you want to pay it forward you can at any time in the future.  I honestly thought doing this course was one of the kindest things I&#39;ve done in my life.  I went back there as a volunteer and cooked, cleaned with a crew then meditated with them and the students when we were done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How aware are others of things such as this? I mean, what can get you involved, and who would pull the strings. How common is it to have knowledge of these things? Do most people have it all tuned out, can they be linked and brought back into it? Do you just ignore it and it goes away? Are shrooms really a gateway. How would you explain the retrieval of subconscious memories? It&#39;s not like thinking back to the event, it is the event. At this point I&#39;ma just make fun of them and make games out of this. How would you proceed if you were in my shoes? Can the people closest to you be unaware of this and are being manipulated in order to mess with me further? Or are their voices purely imitations? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love your attitude.  The only rules are the printed laws.  They wont be following them.  You should stay grounded in reality as much as possible, because they will tell lie after lie attempting to make you and your brain weird, and appear weird to others.  What worked for me is to: Interrogate them over and over.  Criticize every statement for truth.  Find out who they are and what they want.  (then tell them to F$%k Off.)  Think critically and stay grounded in fact.</p>

<p>Take some vitamins and rule out any deficiencies, specifically b12 and iron, magnesium (deficiencies can cause schizophrenia), don&#39;t take too much iodine (iodine poisoning is another).</p>

<p>I had a bout of psychosis 2 yrs ago from anemia, b12 and iron supplementation cleared it up. There is some kind of nazi tonic at walmart in the vitamine section.  Oh yes it&#39;s SSS tonic</p>

<p>As for the subtitles, that is a separate part of the NTSC signal, called &quot;line 23&quot; or something like that.   Most subtitles (but not all - some are made ahead of time) are auto-generated from the audio track at the cable head-end (office) or from the network, so are prone to mis-interpretation.</p>

<p>Baldwin Village a predominantly black neighborhood named after Baldwin Heights, rich white folk territory, was named after the latter simply because the community was wishing for a more peaceful environment.

<p>This is were my experience arises. I hear voices. In this day and age, that is called madness and you win an all expenses not necessarily paid trip to an asylum of your choosing.

My wisdom comes from the comprehension that, Yes, I do hear them all day and night. Yes, they have demonstrated power through various methods. And yes, I have no current knowledge of how to remove them, so just like a troll on Call of Duty, they can bark across the 7 seas without being harmed themselves. Anonymity is power.

<p>In other words, since these voices display the power of thought, the ability to plot against me and keep their privacy intact, claim they are real people around you that you may have told, induce anxiety, pain, paranoia, and everything else while keeping you updated that they are aware of your ignorance and could simply project an acted out version of themselves that they would instantly think to hide and put into the closet if there was any sign of them being noticed by others. The most quiet of people can grow a beard if he&#39;s guarded behind one way glass. Telepaths with other abilities realize that like a dream they can be and do whatever it is they want.

    <div class="md"><p>These questions of mine being posed, seem to mirror an inner peace that my mind itself is trying to achieve. it Wanders, prods, and picks at the infinite solutions to this problem. A solution that I have not clearly or vividly visualized. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. Voices not of my own puts it against themselves. As my will directs me to a higher mental place that is more stable, these voices begin to resemble the properties of a crab. </p>

<p>An anecdote of this is that of the caught crabs within the bucket. My observations of this past year, likens this to an attempt to place an innocent person into a mental prison. While the overseer presses down more and more, the power of my own mind begins to let loose tid bits of light. A certain glimmer that makes the overseer press down harder. Sort of like gang members within a ghetto feel as though they need to escape. Members of their families constantly dragging them back down, reminding them of their situation. If you have a bucket of crabs, the crabs will grab and pull at the ones that are climbing, putting in effort to make it to the top, just to be dragged back down by another longing for the same thing the one climbing is. </p>

<p>The gang members within the ghetto split off into factions which causes even more conflict within themselves. As if their internal violence wasn&#39;t enough, they have to find ways to avoid the police. Years within the ghetto and having these struggles and situations inadvertently begin to program them, they lose cause and energy. Trials and error to somehow escape always ends in failure. </p>

<p>New methods or old, it starts to cause insanity. The same thing over and over again. The method you use doesn&#39;t matter because the outcome is still the same.

    <div class="md"><p>Psychics are being used by our government for covert mind control, outside of the court system, without regard to law.  Psychic ability is a deeply held secret.  People who have lower level psychic abilities are being targetted in order to silence them.  Anti-psychotic medication is a lobotomy and an amputation of psychic ability.  We are being used for target practice.  The goal of each mind control tactic is to cause insanity.  The next step is medication,  a lifetime of medication that will never end the mind control.  Because they want you to be insane, discredited, and mentally weakened for the rest of your life.  Because they want you to stay on expensive medication forever.  You should continue to complain publicly, but dont let it ruin your real life personal relationships.  Fight as hard and as professionally as possible in these early years, this schizo thing ill ruin your life and take all your money.  Your behavior now shapes your future.  I dont recommend medication.  Complain to your representatives by mail.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an expert, but I&#39;d venture to say ignoring is probably better than provoking. That being said, I&#39;m open minded about many things, but it sounds like you need some therapy or spiritual guidance, mate (if you are being honest). Peace and love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignoring doesn&#39;t work, they stay, they eavesdrop. This is the most honest I can be. Been this way for a year. I have yet to meet a therapist with the ability to read my mind and hold mental conversations. Me saying things like &quot;general arrogance&quot; are what get me the pictures and videos in the first place. My last picture I uploaded, Sportscenter broadcasters turned blue. I set them off in my mind and they tried to intimidate me by doing this. You can only ignore for so long, then it&#39;s on you to begin to battle for your mind. There is no reason to doubt me when I say this is real. A visit to a psychiatrist isn&#39;t advice to me. Brainstorming, debating, research, experiences, those are what works. A year in with seemingly supernatural voices isn&#39;t going to dissipate just because I ignored them. Mental defenses, meditation are only good for strengthening my will. Pills and  doubt aren&#39;t gonna do me no good. Yeah, I can make it through my days without complaining, but that doesn&#39;t solve the issue of privacy, never being alone, and having someone out there that can hear and implant thoughts, as you knowingly observe them trying to program your subconscious mind. My goal in posting here is to remove the doubt from others. Me uploading these videos are not proof enough simply cause others have not yet experienced what I have. 2 years ago, I woulda thought you were batshit if you started telling me about how you hear voices. I woulda said you belong on a bus with your nuts hanging saying you getting your rocks off in public so the talking crabs in your asshole don&#39;t penetrate what little mental integrity you got left. If you disbelieve then, ask me questions. I got answers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Replying to my own post....</p>

<p>I&#39;m told (repeatedly by the voices): &quot;you are a prisoner&quot;, &quot;you&#39;re in prison&quot;, &quot;feel miserable&quot;, &quot;why won&#39;t you be miserable?&quot;, &quot;you&#39;ll never have a job again&quot;, &quot;move out of california&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>They says tons more than that, and I wondered if they actually are humans, in that if I throw out a strange word they&#39;ll ask &quot;what is [word]?&quot;</p>

<p>Ask them what they eat.  Ask them what they spend money on --- you won&#39;t get any answers.   Ever heard them talk about eating?    Er, okay, once I pressed one of the male voices what he spent money on, and I got a pressured, exasperated &quot;New shoes!&quot; answer.... Like it wasn&#39;t true, just fed to them by something.</p>

<p>One more thing I noticed early on that I&#39;ve only recently tuned into... when you hear the voices, you will notice you won&#39;t hear all of them at once.   One of the voices, which I think of as someone older, will sometimes speak, but most of the time is in the background -- less noticeable when the others are talking.   Try what you can to tune into this one obscured voice.    I&#39;m now able to do this fairly easily through practice.</p>

<p>When I do, and that voice is usually talking to another, and saying things outside of what the others are saying, but still about me.  </p>

<p>The foreground voices won&#39;t notice at first, but eventually your own thoughts will give you away.... then I&#39;ll hear one of the foreground voices say &quot;he&#39;s listening to you&quot;, as if to interrupt/notify them.</p>

<p>All very interesting shit.    Practice meditation / extinguishing thought.   Things which strengthen your brain (in my case, Piracetam and Ginseng) will help you resist a little bit better.</p>

<p>Lots of luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man, this is sad.</p>

<p>The pills are there to help. From the sound of your post, you are schizophrenic, and un-medicated. The reason you think there are voices talking about the things you&#39;re watching and doing, is because you&#39;ve lost the ability to tell your own internal monologue apart from foreign voices. Those are <em>your own thoughts</em> you&#39;re hearing, but you&#39;ve lost the ability to perceive them as such, so they sound like someone else speaking. That&#39;s how &quot;they&quot; can access your subconscious. &quot;They&quot; already live there.</p>

<p>Think about what you&#39;re saying. You think there&#39;s an office full of people somewhere out there, whose job it is to hit you with mind-control rays that make you twitch? There aren&#39;t any psychics making your TV glitch out, everyone&#39;s TV does that when there&#39;s bad weather. Those twitches you&#39;re experiencing are a result of your misfiring central nervous system. The medication you&#39;ve been prescribed will help. It&#39;s quite possible you&#39;re twitching because you&#39;re in withdrawal from having stopped taking your meds.</p>

<p>Get better, dude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>61 degrees, partly cloudy, nah I don&#39;t think weather is the problem here. I don&#39;t think a voice that you are misperceiving as someone else&#39;s and not your own, begins to get angry and annoyed then proceeds to channel nature&#39;s power with perfect timing according to their own will&#39;s to cause these electrical disturbances. I would claim it was the weather also. Any sane logical person would instantly deny spooks too. But as a formerly sane person myself, schizophrenia doesn&#39;t cause TV&#39;s to pixelate. How sunshine and clouds alone could cause it, I have no idea. If this was the first time this happened, which it&#39;s not, cause I can remember still the first time this had happened, I would be swayed by your comment. Yeah, I would call shenanigans. But after experiencing this for a year, I kinda got to say that nature and coinky-dinks are not the culprit. Same thing, happening in different places, different televisions, I don&#39;t think my brand new Apex television and a split mind would cause this to happen. They can fizz out a tv, My neurons are misfiring causing twitches, They are probably sending signals to those neurons cause them to fire. As we speak, in real time (9:50 p.m.), they are listening, forming their own thoughts, &quot;bopping my head&quot;, and causing an uncomfortable pressure in there. What sounds to be an electrical hum has now appeared disappeared with some kind of vibrational frequency. &quot;Look what I&#39;ve done to you&quot;, while one releases the pressure on my head, while projecting a stare right at me as some kind of power move. They speak over sounds. Have sent hallucinations such as smells. They have even became aware of a burning rubber smell before me. Fuck I had to ask what the fuck he was talking about, until 7 seconds later I whiffed it. </p>

<p>TLDR; If you don&#39;t believe me, keep questioning, I will provide answers. They have left completely for a day or two and have came back. Yeah, it seems as though they are here for their own purposes. How I could persuade you without sounding completely insane I don&#39;t know, but this is a real physical experience happening as of now (9:56 pm)</p>

<p>The gang members within the ghetto split off into factions which causes even more conflict within themselves. As if their internal violence wasn&#39;t enough, they have to find ways to avoid the police. Years within the ghetto and having these struggles and situations inadvertently begin to program them, they lose cause and energy. Trials and error to somehow escape always ends in failure. </p>

<p>New methods or old, it starts to cause insanity. The same thing over and over again. The method you use doesn&#39;t matter because the outcome is still the same. If you were an OG you would tell the up and coming generations what has been tried and what hasn&#39;t. Your old head would give you advice and experience. An &quot;Old Head&quot;, meaning a person with knowledge that will be passed down to others. An old mentality. 
Constantly being held down by the police with their knee in your back. Stuck in your root chakra, sniffing out the exit. You can&#39;t see. Your third eye is blind, your mind is closed, their is no way to alter your perception, because &quot;The Jungle&quot; is all you know. </p>

<p>Baldwin Village a predominantly black neighborhood named after Baldwin Heights, rich white folk territory, was named after the latter simply because the community was wishing for a more peaceful environment. Less cops, less drugs, less violence, More freedom. Rap artists do this best. Words are the stepping stone for the creation of new thought categories. There is Linguistic Relativity (Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis), Sentence Structure, Phonetics, and Semantics. These all meaning, the things you hear shape your world view. See through their eyes. It&#39;s perception. Rap artists know this. They make music, rap music&#39;s focus is based on lyrics rather than completely on sound. This is why you have the party sub-genre, and the backpackers/conscious. Also they know people imitate and look to them for self image and inspiration. </p>

<p>This is were my experience arises. I hear voices. In this day and age, that is called madness and you win an all expenses not necessarily paid trip to an asylum of your choosing. Mine are here 24/7. They are now a part of my environment. Not only that but because they are within my mind and ever present, they may place it upon themselves to also begin to shape the way I see the world to fit their own personal benefit, which they all do. My wisdom comes from the comprehension that, Yes, I do hear them all day and night. Yes, they have demonstrated power through various methods. And yes, I have no current knowledge of how to remove them, so just like a troll on Call of Duty, they can bark across the 7 seas without being harmed themselves. Anonymity is power. Go to ask reddit, search &quot;What are your deepest darkest secret?&quot; Tell me your fears. You will see people that can all of a sudden grow a massive pair of  cojones and begin to act like they don&#39;t give a fuck that you fucked a fat girl and ate her sweaty ass out while she stuck her finger up your butt. Fuck computer hacker anonymous is protecting himself from the government and public by wearing a mask. If a voice is saying something and thoughts of safety and protection are in talks, then they probably doing something that they wouldn&#39;t be doing in public. You are protected by the government and you are also made to fear the system. They can take your money away. They target our basic needs for survival. They don&#39;t give a fuck. They know chaos, we know chaos, and they know we know as we know they know. They got the leverage though. A mass revolution wouldn&#39;t break out if people knew they could drive a fucking tank around your neighborhood as a voice in the sky shouts Martial Law. </p>

<p>In other words, since these voices display the power of thought, the ability to plot against me and keep their privacy intact, claim they are real people around you that you may have told, induce anxiety, pain, paranoia, and everything else while keeping you updated that they are aware of your ignorance and could simply project an acted out version of themselves that they would instantly think to hide and put into the closet if there was any sign of them being noticed by others. The most quiet of people can grow a beard if he&#39;s guarded behind one way glass. Telepaths with other abilities realize that like a dream they can be and do whatever it is they want. They live in it, and force themselves to believe in their own lives. Their smart, acting in certain ways, remembering the right things, and best of all can not be put within any bubble of danger. A feeling of godliness while wondering why their cowardice went
to the courageous lion. </p>

<p>TLDR; A ghetto, crab bucket, mental prison. The overseeing warden, a self aware pessimist that gets off on keeping others down. These are the types that are clogging up traffic within perfect minds ruining them in search of power until you realize, they&#39;ve said for themselves, &quot;if we see him, don&#39;t look him in the eyes&quot;. Shows the type of persons they are. They claim acts and spout that the way they are presenting themselves to me is not what they truly are. That makes sense if you think about it. They have thoughts of their own which they know good and well that if anyone could hear them, they would break instantly. They use a mind that I myself have created. A mind they could not even come up with without the experience of this battle on the inside. One says he has suffered from depression, me myself tout that I am impervious. In the shoes of someone boxed in, less open, monitored, mentally violated, they would not be able to hold themselves together. No I do not believe I&#39;m schizophrenic, honestly  the whole story of my experience has yet to be told. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These questions of mine being posed, seem to mirror an inner peace that my mind itself is trying to achieve. it Wanders, prods, and picks at the infinite solutions to this problem. A solution that I have not clearly or vividly visualized. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. Voices not of my own puts it against themselves. As my will directs me to a higher mental place that is more stable, these voices begin to resemble the properties of a crab. </p>

<p>An anecdote of this is that of the caught crabs within the bucket. My observations of this past year, likens this to an attempt to place an innocent person into a mental prison. While the overseer presses down more and more, the power of my own mind begins to let loose tid bits of light. A certain glimmer that makes the overseer press down harder.

    <div class="md"><p>Pixelation from shitty digital TV signal.   I&#39;ve worked in the cable industry, actually making software and hardware to decode mpeg streams, etc, and I&#39;ve seen it myself... but so have others -- it&#39;s common.</p>

<p>As for the subtitles, that is a separate part of the NTSC signal, called &quot;line 23&quot; or something like that.   Most subtitles (but not all - some are made ahead of time) are auto-generated from the audio track at the cable head-end (office) or from the network, so are prone to mis-interpretation.</p>
