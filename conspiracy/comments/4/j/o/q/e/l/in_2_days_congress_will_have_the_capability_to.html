       The International Trade Commission will present its findings to congress in 2 days, with the ITC presenting the idea that the TPP will have a positive economic impact and thus recommends congress to vote yes on it:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This means in 2 days, congress will be able to vote pass the TPP for the first time. Now that it has gotten the rubber seal from the committee that oversees and gives expert recommendations on international economic issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Congress and the President could move it quickly like the PATRIOT Act, which passed in 4 days, spending one day each in committee, senate, house, and with the president. Very fast. Ready to go, just over a month after 9/11. Especially now that the election is becoming more and more locked down, if it's Hillary vs Trump that ensures a Hillary win and thus a win for the existing establishment. If they know they have Hillary in the pocket because of the design of our two-party system, they can start doing things that anger the public again without fear of losing their positions of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        latest
       </em>
       this can be passed is 1 year 9 months from now. If it is delayed longer than that, for whatever reason, then the whole TPP is considered null and void and the whole thing goes back to the drawing board. Not only in the US, but in all 12 nations participating. This is only true in the US that it will void it for all the other countries, so it's extra-important to delay it at one or many of the 4 stages of US passage in to law if possible. Obama isn't going to veto the TPP, and Hillary likely won't either. So it's got to be at the congress level this has to be delayed or stopped. If anyone has any good ideas, let's hear them now, because the window for TPP passage is opening in 2 days.

       Really all you can do is contact your representatives, and to tell as many people as possible to do the same. In the end, though, if tptb want it then it will pass, no matter how much the US citizens say they don't want it. The PATRIOT act, NDAA, CISA, etc. all received as much negative attention as TPP, and nothing stopped them. Congress is already bought and paid for. So whatever tptb actually want, they'll get Congress to sign it into law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately nothing short of mass revolt will actually stop these things from occurring. A vast majority of people are too comfortable with how their lives are to attempt such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is obviously a very cynical thought, but I still have hope. More and more people are waking up everyday, and technology is almost outpacing government. There have been significant advances in self-sufficient tech (hydroponics, 3d printers, cryptocurrencies, etc.) So hopefully there will be a massive shift of consciousness in 30-40 years that will end up undoing what the leviathan has created. I just don't see it happening in the "near" future. Hopefully tptb don't round us up for the culling before then...

       I think there are ways of making it happen that are nonviolent, we just need to study revolutions like the velvet revolution or the "pots and pans" revolution of Iceland. People need better techniques to get the precise changes they want, because if things go the violence route... well the US government's military and police system is one of the biggest and best in the world, I'll just put it that way.

       Oh, for sure, I always prefer non-violent approaches. It's just that for these types of revolts to occur requires a scale of cooperation that is virtually impossible to achieve with the level of spying that occurs today. You would have to convince everyone that you plan with to not have their mobiles on their person during "meetings", and to not share
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       over the internet regarding your plans. If any info were to leak to the spies, your "group" would be infiltrated the moment that it became large enough to actually matter.

       Then people must learn techniques to detect this infiltration and avoid the problems that come with it, and out it to everyone so that it doesn't derail any momentum toward the direction of change. There's no way to maintain secrecy for any sizable group, it would just have to be all out in the open perhaps.

       Do you think you could convince people outside of your group that there are nefarious actors infiltrating your secret group? Most people get their info from MSM which would shit on you hardcore.

      <p>
       If you try to organize any kind of revolt in the open, even if it is non-violent, again the MSM will shit on you. Sure, you'll get media attention, but every time people hear about someone revolting against government most of them figure they're just crazies. The Waco siege was a good example of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to say that revolution is impossible, or that you're stupid for thinking we can achieve one. It's just that people in "developed" countries are very pacified due to how convenient life has become. People fear that if they revolt against their governments, even if it is non-violent, that everything will return to the stone age. They fear they will lose their McDonald's, gas stations, movie theaters, etc. That fear keeps them happy with shrugging things like the TPP off, because it's "just another law".

       Well, that's why I said to let everyone you know to call their representatives. If they ask you why then you can explain why the TPP is bad, and maybe push in other topics you find important. It's really easy to discuss this stuff on the internet, but having face-to-face conversations with your friends/family is far more helpful. Sure, it's not easy, especially if they have different political opinions. However, the more you share this with them face-to-face the more they will look into it on their own, because they'll see that it is actually important to you who is their friend or family member.

       Perhaps, but that makes me sigh and wonder if I'm then complicit in all this in a way if I start making money from it.  I also think there's a possibility it could be delayed for more than 21 months, if enough people speak out.

       more likely they will wait for some other big spectacle to draw attention away and theyll try to sneak it through.
      </p>
      <p>
       my bet is it will be announced (quietly) on a friday  when hardly anyone is following or cares about the news, and just before/after some big new story that will draw away focus.

       They may wait for the stock market to crash (or directly cause it to crash, if you believe that level of coordination is possible) then go "Oh no, we desperately need TPP, let's pass it quickly!" and then rush it through, spun in the media to the public as a financial/market recovery bill. That would reduce the pushback to the TPP, and get people focused on the market crashing instead of the TPP passing. I could see it being on a Friday too.

       sounds feasible, theyve been planting a lot of this sort of non-sense since jan so it could be. i sort of expect there will be an event they can try to blame said crash on.
      </p>
      <p>
       given the rhetoric probably something to do with it being russias or chinas fault for some event they couldnt control that they can try to blame the stock crash on then sneak tpp through like you said.

       I think you're right and I think the cover event will be russian, chinese, or ISIS computer hackers. But in reality it will be a few of the biggest banks and trading companies pulling the plugs on their algorithmic trading machines. I could see a 20% drop in one day, easy. If it was a Friday, and then they passed TPP on Saturday and Sunday, it'd be a done deal by the time it reached the presidents office on Monday. Probably won't happen that quick, but it's possible.

       the problem with anonymous is that its an open mic, it could be literally anyone releasing those vids or conducting the Ops.

      <p>
       they could be state sponsored, hell they could be a controlled opposition you honestly can not know. so really its a crap shoot as to what their goals even are.
