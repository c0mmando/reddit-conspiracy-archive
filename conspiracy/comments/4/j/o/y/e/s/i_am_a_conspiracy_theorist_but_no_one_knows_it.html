       I've only considered myself part of this community for a few months, so I don't know all the jargon for what we call ourselves (I prefer "truth activist"), but I'm still what some might call a "truther" or "conspiracy theorist". However, before today, I only off-handedly mentioned with other "awake" friends/coworkers. This is because most people I know, including my family, think anybody who believes any conspiracy theory is completely stupid or even traitorous. Today, I made a comment on a Facebook post from a page I had liked. Not long after, I got a message from a "friend" telling me I was "fucking stupid" and an "anti-Semite" (The post and comment were related to Zionism). I don't know why I'm making this post, but I guess this is the first time I've put my beliefs out there, and gotten such a virulent response from someone I only sort of knew (Thank God no one else saw it, or I'd never hear the end of it). I'll just conclude the post by saying I live in a small town where everybody knows everybody and rumors spread fast (and can even lose you a job), and by thanking this subreddit for staying strong and active despite the animosity it's faced. So, let's wear those tinfoil hats with pride, keep thinking critically, and hope that somebody will listen when we try to inform them of what's really going on.

       Never be afraid to stand up. I embrace the word crazy or a "conspiracy theorist". I've lost friends and family along the way. I've also helped many people. It's a battle for sure, but never back down. This is more about you than others. Peace and love.

       Yep...one night about ten years ago now I was visiting my parents there was quite a few people at the table for dinner and a lot of wine was drunk. I got into a discussion about 9/11 with my 25 year US Navy veteran dad. When I told him that the towers were rigged and came down because of controlled demolition...he just stared at me speechless...you could hear a pin drop...then it happened. His face got red. He became visibly angry and called me a "Nut Bag" in front of everyone. I held frame. He continued to say I probably think the moon landing is a hoax too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I been called all kinds of names from all different kinds of people. But they do that because they don't have anything to say when you give them the facts they get angry/embarrassed or actually scared of the implications that the truth may hold. Some of these people have come back and have joined our community and have thanked me for planting the seed of truth in their minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you've jumped into the rabbit hole, you're there for life. Buckle up...it's a hell of a ride.

       My go-to schism-inducing fact is the engine from 9/11 that landed in Murray Street.  It's not even an engine from the type of planes that hit the towers.

       Simply presenting an idea that requires someone to re-examine something that they think they already know can often bring unpleasant reactions. Most people are lazy and prideful; thinking requires effort and re-examination implies imperfection.

       I woke up seven years ago and have recently had two people (who had mocked me for my beliefs years ago) come around to the truth about 9/11 and our controlled media.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gratitude I got from them, now that they know I'm right, was negligible in comparison to the original mockery.

       Moral of story:  we should all make a point of acknowledging those who knew the truth before we did, and were willing to endure our scorn to wake us up.

       All joking aside, you have a lot of courage for putting your beliefs out there on FB. Your friend's response is typical in that he went straight for ad hominem. I always view that a good sign. Anyways, be safe and good luck!!

       I use Facebook to communicate with two people.  I have a lot more contacts, but most of those are from a much earlier period when I was foolishly persevering with forcing myself to appreciate Facebook.  I have since recognised it for the scourge that it is, however, and no longer use it except for communicating with said two people, which I do maybe once a week, most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are willing to, I would encourage you to get rid of Facebook entirely.  The worst fear that most of us have is the fear of not belonging to a group, and because of this fear, most of you never consciously realise that most of the people you associate with, are not worth your company.

       The official story of 9/11 is a conspiracy of 19 hijackers. Literally a conspiracy theory. If you want to talk about these things with others, just have a good grasp on the particular subject before engaging in conversation and be ready to back up your claims with official documents or high-quality videos that use such documents. Many people are more open than you might assume, but they are just scared to be viewed as fringe, incompetent or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "conspiracy theorist" was coined in the 60's by CIA to discredit anyone who disagreed with the findings of the Warren Commission. People lose rationality when discussing conspiracies, and go as far as claiming the word doesn't even mean what it means; That a "conspiracy theory" is really always about intergalactic lizard-eating nazi-hamsters. "Conspiracy" means the specific definition.   That is another CIA tactic called "poisoning the well". They take the most ludicrous theory they can find (or invent) that almost nobody actually believes and then say it is typical of "conspiracy theorists".
      </p>
      <p>
       To cut through this doublespeak we need to be using the denotative definition of words. This is English, not NewSpeak.

       I don't think you need to label yourself as an "anything". You are just a human being who knows some things. The instant you adorn yourself with that label, you drive a wedge between yourself and "regular people". It's a label invented by the CIA, there is no need to wear it if you think it applies to you.

       There have been conspiracies throughout history, and there probably are conspiracies today. It makes sense to theorize about them to understand power structures. The fact you believe this doesn't make you a "conspiracy theorist", it just makes you an aware observer. A person who avoids thought-terminating cliches. It is not an identity, it is just some facts about the world that you understand now.

       Think about it like this, in North Korea, it would be exactly the same. You'd be in the same situation and treated the same way by the idiotic majority for "believing in conspiracy
       <em>
        theories
       </em>
       " about dear leader and about the people passing the highest offices and appointments back and forth between each other, their sons, their wives, their family friends (as is happening here) while they get fat and rich on the backs of everyone else and maintain power with violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       the majority of people in every place want to fit in and believe in all the good things they're told to believe in about their dear leaders and "their country", they have beliefs, not opinions or conclusions reached by examining facts and data. You question their belief, especially one that's part of their self-identity (ingrained from age 5-18 in state obedience training centers). They want to believe "they're better than everyone else and they live in a good place doing good things", just like North Koreans.
      </p>
      <p>
       They all want to believe in the wonderful "
       <em>
        Democratic People's Republic
       </em>
       of Korea", they don't want to deal with the fact they are currently ruled badly by anti-democratic forces (as we are) that pass the highest offices down from father to son (sound familiar?) while they are lied into pointless conflicts simply used to control the poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious to anyone who looks into it that our country has been heavily infiltrated by anti-democratic forces and foreign intelligence agency personnel (looking at you Saudi Arabia and Israel), very occasionally spies from AIPAC are even arrested by parts of the FBI that have not yet been infiltrated and subverted by the anti-democratic forces in America. People don't like to deal with things like that though, they like to maintain beliefs and ideas that make them
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       good, about themselves and about anything they identify with like "their country".
      </p>
      <p>
       you've taken a different tact, one centered around "feeling good by becoming informed and trying to know the truth about things", they haven't gotten there yet, eventually you'd think it would become so apparent that it would be impossible for people to be tricked by these ongoing scams any longer, but looking at North Korea as an example, I think that will never happen. People are always willing to be tricked by propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd suggest to you that you just stay away from issues like "zionism" because it's so thoroughly ingrained in people to react badly to any mention of it that you won't get anywhere. Stick with facts, "millions of americans go homeless while the people in charge send billions of dollars, arms, and military taining to violent muslim extremists in Saudi Arabia and to Israel", never focus solely on ONE of the two middle eastern client states that are vying for power in America. There are more than enough
       <em>
        unquestionable facts
       </em>
       to focus on that no one can even argue with, but that most people never hear mentioned - like the fact that we have 2 families passing the highest offices back and forth between each other, their sons, their wives, and their campaign donors and family friends (which surprise! is what Trump is to Clinton and Bush both). They lie us into massive wars that weaken the American military and then maintain their family power by corrupting our national, state, and federal political processes. They destroy the lives of American troops in needless wars and then pretend to be "working for America", when in reality it appears that some anti-american criminal subversives have infiltrated the government and are currently working to undermine actual American interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pick an issue other than "zionism". You won't get anywhere talking about zionism. Leave protest of zionism to actual jewish people or you'll just get ignored by the idiots and you won't get anywhere anyway. It's not a good idea to focus on polarizing terms or issues like that. If you're going to make facebook posts about reality, you should pick basic unarguable facts to focus on that will make anyone who reads it think "huh, shit, that's really true, I never realized it and no one on TV has ever said that even though it's the most obvious thing in the world". You're not allowed to talk about jews or Israel because they are america's favorite violent middle-eastern religious militants. Leave that to people like Norman Finklestein.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe a post every now and then about the USS Liberty documentary or something if you're desperate to mention it. or the Banksy "discover a new destination this year" short-film about Palestinians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pick a bigger issue than "zionism" or "israel", like the public education system in the US that trains kids to become what they are, look at the work of John Taylor Gatto. Anyway, most people won't ever get to where you are for as long as they have food and basic necessities. who cares about the rest of the world when they've got their new truck and easy credit and a house and electricity and medicine, etc.

       I've been a conspiracy theorist for about 13 years now. It all started with 9-11 for me. I'd like to think I'm the more rational variety. I believe conspiracies happen but that doesn't mean I assume the world is controlled by Reptilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said, your post reminded me of an exchange I had with a high school acquaintance not too long ago about Bernie. I've been doing my best to support Sanders on social media since he announced his candidacy. It felt good to finally have a politician that actually represents my views. This acquaintance would chime in &amp; comment every once in a while on stuff I would post. He's now a lawyer &amp; seems to be fairly intelligent so I didn't mind as I'm for free speech &amp; all. He never made his political preferences known, only letting me know when a meme or statement I shared from a Pro-Sanders Facebook group contained slightly exaggerated or incorrect information. That's fine as I prefer facts move our movement forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward to Bernie's recent string of victories, where it was reported Hillary had sent out an email to supporters warning that Bernie's campaign is practically winning the White House for Trump by staying in the race. I shared a meme photo that shared the opposite sentiment saying Hillary is the one that can't beat him. This acquaintance of mine comments back with a whole new tone, saying us "fucking Bernie supporters" are giving Trump the win.
      </p>

       I know it's completely different topic, but I think the underlying experience is the same. You can only choose to see it from their POV to understand that they legitimately believe what they believe so of course your ideas are offensive to them. They have already made up their mind on these topics, so when you bring up an opposing viewpoint, to them, it's like suggesting that perhaps they have been fools this whole time &amp; they are just too dumb to see it. Even if that's not the tone your using when you deliver what ever information you're delivering, for a second they feel that way so they respond offensively. It's really kind of sad because this usually comes from a desire to fit in with the "right group" &amp; to be able to say "I told you so" rather than expand on communication &amp; understanding. All you can do is expect this behavior each &amp; every time you share your opinion on something controversial. Learn to counter it with facts &amp; not emotion &amp; you should be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR There will always be people angry with you for sharing what you think about controversial issues. Learn from it.

       Isn't that telling?  You're afraid to publicly voice your opinion.  Not because it's offensive or illegal or uninformed, but because it's controversial (because it's critical of powerful interests) and could have a very real impact on your life.

       Being a "conspiracy theorist" only makes sense from an intelligent point of view. Questioning why and how things take place, looking into the details behind situations and historical events, and trying to deduce possibilities for how current situations will play out into the future are all parts of critical thinking.
      </p>

       There seems to be in inherent behavior of settling into collective thought bubbles of your peers. You want to believe and agree on things with those around you, it's only natural. Sadly, a lot of people believe a lot of bullshit. We are advertised towards constantly, propaganda, media, everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ponder everything, but decide on things with your own mind. Be willing to change your view, but only if it meets the criteria you have to change your view. Ignorance and stubbornness are two of the largest obstacles people face in beneficial progression.

       I try not to even bring up the word "conspiracy" or "conspiracy theorist" and try to bring conversations into calm discussions. Some people just want to argue and be right. If someone is not willing to discuss why they disagree and what specifically they disagree on, or why you are wrong, they are not worth the time to try. And if people in my life react so poorly to my opinions, they will not be on my "friends list" so to speak.

       It comes down to the
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/4ji71x/captain_america_civil_war_is_twofold_social/">
        debate between iron man and captain america in the civil war movie
       </a>
       about trusting the government and letting them do
       <em>
        whatever
       </em>
       (pro-authoritarianism / ultranationalism / "superpatriotism" --- wrt
       <em>
        fascism
       </em>
       ) or listening to the will of the people and abiding by the laws they collectively create (democracy/republicanism).
      </p>
      <p>
       People who obstinately refuse to believe conspiracy theories are denying facts and history because of some deep seated bending to authority and trust, without which their world is scarier and less predictable, creating deep anxiety for them.  If anything we should love, empathsize with our fellow cowards and intellectual inferiors, doing what we can to break the bad news of their surrogate daddy's daily betrayals slowly and without emotion

       It's tough dude! Same here, there are a very select few willing to hear anything out of the ordinary. Anybody else, like you said, will either think you are crazy, or worse. The raw, sad truth is that until a time comes when a critical mass of people are aware of the truth of what is happening in this world, people like us will have to keep our true opinions in the shadows. Good luck to you.

       I'd love to see an honest poll (I know asking a lot these days) of people who believe in some "conspiracy" or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       My bet: The percentage is much larger than most might guess. In fact, obfuscation of facts and labels (including conspiracy theorist) make people who might actually share opinions from speaking out.  Kind of 21st century version of banning freedom of association. This is a control tactic and if you continue to speak out, I bet you'll find others even in your small town.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would snowball and we'd see more limited hangouts (like the 28 page Saudi papers) because power structures need to distract when they see some critical mass forming.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they call you a conspiracy theorist you retort and call them a goddamn coincidence-theorist!  (Got that from some awesome reddittor a few months ago but don't remember who).

       Don't start anonymous. You're safer being public. If you're afraid of being hit, no one's going to know who you are and what you stood for if you're hitting. Even with tor, they know who you are. They control the majority of exit nodes and have bugged tons of routers.
