<p>So who <em>really</em> organized all this? Is it the people who decided to have Building 7 equipped to be demolished, or their bosses? Were those people in some way in contact with the Saudis who committed this act, or their bosses? </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem like the Saudis wired Building 7, I doubt they ever would&#39;ve had access. 
The Saudis are the next-level 9/11 fall-guys, now that the Iraq-9/11 ties narrative has expired because it didn&#39;t make any sense in the first place.  </p>

<p>If &quot;The Saudis did 9/11&quot; then explain Building 7 being pre-rigged to be demolished. </p>

<p>Correct, is was <strong>LESS</strong> than 7 seconds.</p>

<p>WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. <strong>The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds.</strong> Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;The building was fully involved in fire.&quot; – Photographer Steve Spak</p></li>
<li><p>We walked over by number Seven World Trade Center as it was burning and saw this 40-plus story building with fire on nearly all floors. –FDNY Lieutenant Robert Larocco</p></li>
<li><p>Just when you thought it was over, you&#39;re walking by this building and you&#39;re hearing this building creak and fully involved in flames. It&#39;s like, is it coming down next? Sure enough, about a half an hour later it came down. –FDNY Lieutenant James McGlynn</p></li>
<li><p>I walked out and I got to Vesey and West, where I reported to Frank [Cruthers]. He said, we’re moving the command post over this way, that building’s coming down. At this point, the fire was going virtually on every floor, heavy fire and smoke that really wasn’t bothering us when we were searching because it was being pushed southeast and we were a little bit west of that - FDNY Deputy Chief Nick Visconti </p></li>
<li><p>When the building came down it was completely involved in fire, all forty-seven stories. –FDNY Assistant Chief Harry Myers</p></li>
<li><p>Then we had to move because the Duane Reade, they said, wasn&#39;t safe because building 7 was really roaring. –FDNY Chief Medical Officer Kerry Kelly</p></li>
<li><p>At this point Seven World Trade was going heavy, and they weren&#39;t letting anybody get too close. Everybody was expecting that to come down. –Firefighter Vincent Massa</p></li>
<li><p>Building #7 was still actively burning and at that time we were advised by a NYFD Chief that building #7 was burning out of control and imminent collapse was probable. –PAPD P.O. Edward McQuade</p></li>
<li><p>Because it really got going, that building Seven, saw it late in the day and like the first Seven floors were on fire. It looked like heavy fire on seven floors. It was fully engulfed, that whole building. There were pieces of tower two [sic: he probably means tower one] in building Seven and the corners of the building missing and what-not. But just looking up at it from ground level however many stories -- it was 40 some odd -- you could see the flames going straight through from one side of the building to the other, that’s an entire block. –Firefighter Tiernach Cassidy</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;There&#39;s number Seven World Trade. That&#39;s the OEM bunker.&quot; We had a snicker about that. We looked over, and it&#39;s engulfed in flames and starting to collapse...I remember it was bad and I&#39;m going to get to a point where we came back that way on the way up. We couldn&#39;t even go that way, that&#39;s how bad the fire was, but by the time I was coming back it was rolling, more than a couple of floors, just fully involved, rolling. - Paramedic Louis Cook</p></li>
<li><p>The whole south side of Seven World Trade had been hit by the collapse of the second Tower, and there was fire on every floor.&quot; – Fire Captain Brenda Berkman</p></li>
<li><p>At that point, Seven World Trade had 12 stories of fire in it. They were afraid it was going to collapse on us, so they pulled everybody out. We couldn&#39;t do anything. – Firefighter Maureen McArdle-Schulman</p></li>
<li><p>The 7 World Trade Center was roaring...When I got out and onto a clear pile, I see that 7 World Trade Center and the customs house have serious fire. Almost every window has fire. It is an amazing site. –Captain Jay Jonas, Ladder 6</p></li>
<li><p>The other building, #7, was fully involved, and he was worried about the next collapse - Firefighter TJ Mundy</p></li>
<li><p>7 World Trade was burning from the ground to the ceiling fully involved. It was unbelievable. –Firefighter Steve Modica</p></li>
<li><p>So I attempted to get in through the Barkley Street ramp which is on Barkley (sic) and West Broadway, but I was being held back by the fire department, because 7 World Trade, which is above the ramp, was now fully engulfed. –PAPD K-9 Sergeant David Lim</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>None of the three videos show any massive fires in WTC7.</p>

<p>For example <a href="https://imgur.com/a/w5iuG">these are known modern skyscrapers actually being massively on fire,</a>  none of these collapsed. </p>

<p>Here is a challenge for you, post the one picture that shows what you think is the best example of WTC7 being massively on fire so i can compare it to these.</p>

<p>Fires do not collapse steel framed buildings, that is a fact.</p>

<p>I also like how you use firefighter witness testimony for the argument that fires were rampant throughout WTC7, but when it comes to the firefighters going on record that they saw vast amounts of molten metal, you dismiss their claims.</p>

<p>The fact that there are two peer reviewed scientific papers that prove nano-thermte was at all three demolition sites, is consistent with what every firefighter saw and reported that day, this is also ignoring the fact WTC7 looked exactly like a controlled demolition, the fact this building went in to literal freefall and the fact the NIST report that was supposed to explain this first time ever phenomenon of fire collapsing a steel framed skyscraper, is a proven beyond any doubt, scientifically fraudulent worthless piece of garbage, a literal cover-up.</p>

<p>There are not good enough for me though, because none of them show raging office fires, it is commonly accepted that flames were visible on 3-4 floors of the building, i don&#39;t dispute that.</p>

<p>It seems like you are trying to avoid posting a picture because it would make you look a bit silly.</p>

<p>But sporadic office fires do not explain the symmetrical downward trajectory of the collapse (controlled demolition does) or WTC7 going into literal freefall (controlled demolition does) or the molten metal at the demolition site (thermite does, as confirmed by two peer reviewed scientific papers)</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t think they would be, so no surprise there.</p>

<p>The videos combined with the statements of dozens of FDNY officers paint a pretty clear picture of a building with multiple massive fires on several floors. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t think of a single reason why you would doubt the word of so many trained firefighters in combination with that footage. If this was a generic news story about a generic building burning in some other city, would you seriously look at that footage and read those statements and conclude that it was just a few small fires?

<p><strong>Testimony from Firefighters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQyIN6OTMyY">New York Fire Department Captain Philip Ruvolo said: “You’d get down below and you’d see molten steel, molten steel, running down the channel rails, like you’re in a foundry, like lava.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fallenbrothers.com/community/showthread.php?2062-Recovery-worker-reflects-on-months-spent-at-Ground-Zero&amp;amp;p=2948">Joe O’Toole, a Bronx firefighter who worked on the rescue and cleanup efforts, reported that one beam lifted from deep below the surface months later, in February 2002, “was dripping from the molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_G21B2qiQM">New York firefighters recalled in the documentary film Collateral Damages, “heat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are hundreds of these in the firefighters oral histories, how many more do you want me to post?</p>

<p>What about...</p>

<p><strong>Testimony from Other Professionals:</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmHqES_lto&amp;amp;t=40s">Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after the attack: “When we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, ‘I think you’d be interested in this,’ and they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060909104247/http://www.seau.org/SEAUNews-2001-10.pdf">Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground Zero September 12, 2001, said: “Feeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helen’s and the thousands who fled that disaster.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/Publications/Special/Welch.htm">In late fall 2001, Dr. Alison Geyh of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported: “Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130730103131/http://911encyclopedia.com/wiki/index.php/Publication:20121014014812">Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: “It’s just too hot for rescuers to get into [some] areas. So we do not know yet what’s in those areas, other than very hot, molten material.”</a></li>
<li>Dr. Keith Eaton reported in Structural Engineer: “They showed us many fascinating slides . . . ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.”</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060818074723/http:/pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nydailynews/87451160.html?did=87451160&amp;amp;FMT=ABS&amp;amp;FMTS=FT&amp;amp;date=Nov+1,+2001&amp;amp;author=GREG+GITTRICH+DAILY+NEWS+STAFF+WRITER&amp;amp;pub=New+York+Daily+News&amp;amp;desc=FIRE+MAY+SMOLDER+FOR+MONTHS">Don Carson, a hazardous materials expert from the National Operating Engineers Union, said six weeks after 9/11: “There are pieces of steel being pulled out from as far as six stories underground that are still cherry red.”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m not disputing any of that. I&#39;m sure there were explosions and I&#39;m sure there was molten metal in the rubble pile. I have no reason to suspect FDNY personnel lied about it, just like I have no reason to suspect they lied when describing the fire as a raging inferno.</p>

<p>Because the videos are not specific to WTC7 first of all, WTC2,3,4 are also shown to have small fires in the videos, second, in the videos you posted, at no time did they show WTC7 to have massive fires.</p>

<p>What does melt steel? thermite and there are two peer reviewed scientific papers that 100% prove this.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t corroborate anything, there is no visual evidence of large office fires in WTC7, these firefighters had no reason to lie, but they were mistaken, they were very likely witnessing thermite reactions.</p>

<p>There are also <strong>hundreds</strong> of firefighters on record stating that they witnessed explosions...</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ed Cachia -- Firefighter (F.D.N.Y.) [Engine 53]</strong>
It actually gave at a lower floor, not the floor where the plane hit, because we originally had thought there was like an internal detonation explosives because it went in succession, boom, boom, boom, boom, and then the tower came down.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Craig Carlsen -- Firefighter (F.D.N.Y.) [Ladder 8]</strong>
I guess about three minutes later you just heard explosions coming from building two, the south tower. It seemed like it took forever, but there were about ten explosions</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Frank Cruthers -- Chief (F.D.N.Y.) [Citywide Tour Commander]</strong>
And while I was still in that immediate area, the south tower, 2 World Trade Center, there was what appeared to be at first an explosion. It appeared at the very top, simultaneously from all four sides, materials shot out horizontally. And then there seemed to be a momentary delay before you could see the beginning of the collapse</p>

<p>Smoke is an indicator of fire.</p>

<p>FDNY personnel back that up.</p>

<p>No evidence at all that the smoke in that video is evidence of thermite reactions.</p>

<p>They do show massive office fires. FDNY personnel corroborate that assessment, they were on the ground in direct contact with that building.</p>

<p>Like it or not, the videos I provided show exactly what massive office fires look like.</p>

<p>You can claim to know better than they do, but you have no experience fighting fires and are basing your impressions solely on YouTube videos. Thanks for your input, but I&#39;ll stick with the guys that were actually there and have experience in this area.

<blockquote>

<p>Office fires melt other metals, which were in abundance in the 1.7 million tons of rubble. Wiring, electrical conduit, ducting, computer equipment, office furniture, all of them contain metals with melting points lower than steel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are also hundreds of firefighters on record stating that they witnessed explosions</p>

<p>There were raging infernos in 3 separate office buildings that day. I&#39;d be shocked if there weren&#39;t explosions.</p>

<p>Yes it is, the only time in history that a steel framed building has been demolished all the way to the ground, is due to controlled demolition, yet you want me to believe that for the first and only time in human history, small office fires completely collapsed WTC7, straight through itself, in what looked exactly like a controlled demolition, because <em>fire</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That response was intended for someone else. My apologies.</p>

<p>the lobby design is what put so much strain on columns 79, 81, &amp; 82 if I recall correctly. You can go check that for me if you like. the point is that WTC didn&#39;t have a uniform web of columns like so many other structures, and so when these centrally located columns expanded and became disjointed an internal collapse began. The building only appeared to collapse in your &quot;7 seconds&quot; because you&#39;re not counting the unseen damage that was happening well before you start counting. Plus your 7 seconds only counts how much time before  the top line of the building becomes obscured by the building in front of it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to post pictures. There are already videos of the fires linked elsewhere in this thread.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no evidence for this claim, this is also disregarding that  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/realestate/commercial-property-salomon-solution-building-within-building-cost-200-million.html">WTC7 was significantly reinforced in the 1980s</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: The Salomon Solution; A Building Within a Building, at a Cost of $200 Million By MARK McCAIN Published: February 19, 1989</p>

<p>BEFORE it moves into a new office tower in downtown Manhattan, Salomon Brothers, the brokerage firm, intends to spend nearly two years and more than $200 million cutting out floors, adding elevators, reinforcing steel girders, upgrading power supplies and making other improvements in its million square feet of space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This building was one of the most secure and reinforced buildings on the planet, this probably explains why they built an emergency bunker in it, which further reinforced the building.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>an internal collapse began</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No evidence for this claim, this explanation does not pass scrutiny,  for a number reasons:</p>

<p>*There is video footage showing both the north and west faces of the building. Both of these faces, along with the corners connecting to the south and east faces of the building, appear to remain stable and intact until the sudden onset of free fall.</p>

<p>*The West Penthouse, and therefore the interior structure that supported it, did not fail until about a second before the onset of freefall. Therefore the interior of the building got no more than about half a story head start.</p>

<p>*Even though the smaller collapse of the East Penthouse brought about a brief period of window breakage, no further windows were broken until the onset of freefall, so it is not believable that total internal collapse was occurring.</p>

<p>*The roiling clouds of debris that raced down the street, often likened to pyroclastic flow, did not occur until the visible collapse of the building. If the interior of the building had collapsed earlier, we would expect the flow of debris to have started earlier</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The building only appeared to collapse in your &quot;7 seconds&quot; because you&#39;re not counting the unseen damage that was happening well before you start counting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The less than 7 seconds is counted from WTC7 main roof line, this is not up for dispute else go speak to NIST, it appears you disagree with them.</p>

<p>How do you explain freefall again? Don&#39;t try quote NIST because as evidenced in this thread, you don&#39;t agree with them on a number of things and they have no answer anyway</p>

<p>The unseen damage you mention is consistent with controlled demolition, it is called pre-weakening the structure, fires don&#39;t cause a uniform collapse, that looks <strong>exactly</strong> like a controlled demolition, that is absurd.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to post pictures</p>

<p>Why are you scared of doing that? i Don&#39;t want a video, I want the best picture you got of these massive fires in WTC7, I don&#39;t care what someone else has posted, this debate is between me and you.</p>

<p>Remember, you also have to leave enough unignited thermite to burn for months in the rubble pile and melt all that steel. There also has to be enough to leave significant amounts in the dust for brave truther scientists to find (something like 0.02 percent of the total weight of the towers was their estimate). At 1.7 million tons of weight, that means 34 thousand tons of unignited thermite. </p>

<p>If 34 thousand tons was left unignited after the collapse, how much was in there to begin with? </p>

<p>So many questions. </p>

<p>A lot? Fire doesn&#39;t cut beams, so if you are trying to argue from that position, then you have lost the argument.  </p>

<p>Considering we now know for an empirically verifiable scientific proven fact that WTC1,2&amp;7 were part of a controlled demolition on 9/11, we know that two peer reviewed scientific papers prove that nano-thermite was present at all three demolition sites and we also know that the agency tasked with investigation these three <em>collapses,</em> produced a report that was unscientific and fraudulent, literally a coverup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because how can the Zionists get the land for Israel in the post-WW2 courts, unless they are clearly victims who deserve it? </p>

<p>Only a tiny fraction of Jews are Zionist. Zionists like to get people to blame &quot;the jews&quot; for things, like in germany, it&#39;s their favorite scapegoat to redirect the public from away from the very few real culprits.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s like when billionaires export all the jobs, and then make the public think its the fault of immigrants that there are no jobs. It kind of is, but that&#39;s not really the root cause. Same with zionism letting people blame all jews, it works for them. It is a shield Zionists hide behind, classic misdirection.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evidence you present is so empty and suggestive and the claims you make around them so blown up. If you apply the slightest bit of skepticism it quickly falls apart.</p>

<p>First of all, you show a video where the image shakes, and you claim it&#39;s the floor shaking. For all we know, it was a bird that flew against a tripod, maybe someone fell next to it, maybe it was a door slam, all we really know is that a camera shook, not the floor, a camera. If it had any merit, we could&#39;ve used it as an argument for explosives, but it doesn&#39;t, because there&#39;s no way to tell what causes the shaking.</p>

<p>Second, your &quot;long&quot; list of witnesses. I hope people actually read it for themselves. The vast majority doesn&#39;t say anything about shaking before the collapse.</p>

<p>Oh and then that video of the underground detonation. That&#39;s pretty impressive, but there is zero resemblance with what happened to the towers. The towers don&#39;t sink in, not even slightly. Somehow this mega detonation under one tower is able to make one building disappear without as much as tilting the one beside it. And for some reason this underground detonation made the top floor of the building start to collapse.</p>

<p>This theory of yours is hardly worth countering, especially because you&#39;ll probably jump at the opportunity to post a new set of &quot;evidence&quot; for us to contemplate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They blew out floor by floor from the top down. <em>That</em> is how they collapsed. To suggest that they fell down after an underground explosion is unsubstantiated. Obviously something exploded in the basement, there is no evidence that this was a nuke, nor that this was the reason for collapse.</p>

<p>What really irks me is that proponents of this theory don&#39;t care how this is working against the truth movement. Some are seemingly in a sort of high that requires them to always dig out the rabbit hole just to have the impression that they&#39;re pioneering something, like some sort of ego boost from having something figured out that others haven&#39;t. </p>

<p>Figure it out on your own if you must, but as soon as you start promoting these theories that are both outlandish <em>and</em> irrelevant to the story, you have the exact impact as disinformation would.

    <div class="md"><p>biggest difference i see is that the sedan nuclear test was buried in what appears to be <del>sand or sandstone</del> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvium">alluvium</a> (loose soil). the wtc complex was built on granite/schist - very hard rock (which, of course it would be to support two of the largest buildings on the planet)</p>

<p>edit: if this &#39;debunk&#39; source doesn&#39;t acknowledge the difference between a nuclear blast in loose sand/soil and in one in granite, well, ya might wanna consider another source. and you might question the motives of this one. and then question why they&#39;re trying to bury this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not what we see when we watch the videos in slow motion.  The walls of the building are blown outward, and as they fall, they leave trails of dust upward behind them.

<p>It starts at the top, not at the bottom.

    <div class="md"><p>The ground did not collapse. The building did. If the ground collapsed into a sinkhole of sorts, we would have seen other surrounding buildings also fall into the same hole. But that did not happen.</p>

<p>A nuclear explosion would have caused an upward mushroom cloud. Instead we got falling pyroclastic clouds. Also a nuclear explosion would have caused the building itself to shoot upward. Instead it fell downward, at free fall speed.</p>

<p>A nuclear explosion would have caused huge radiation issues at ground zero after the fact, but there were none. There were many issues with asbestos and air carcinogens, but not nuclear radiation. That would have been easily detectable, if it existed, but it did not.</p>

<p>The evidence clearly does not exist to support any nuclear explosion. Anyone with even a basic understanding of gravity could prove a underground explosion impossible, for the sole reason that the building fell down, and did not explode up. Nuclear explosion is a red herring / misinformation campaign to distract people from controlled demolition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scientific evidence is no laughing matter.</p>

<p>The reason why 9/11 workers got cancer is because of massive amount of asbestos in the rubble, and from smoke/dust inhalation.  Even despite the massive problems with air quality, government officials tried to cover up the story.</p>

<p>I still stand by the statement, &quot;A nuclear explosion would have caused the building itself to shoot upward.&quot;  A bomb beneath the building would explode upwards.  You can&#39;t have a bomb blast from the ground up, to cause the building to fall downwards.  That violates all logical sense and laws of physics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly mate, it&#39;s the only thing that explains it. Those buildings turned to dust. (nano)Thermite cannot do that, and your fire ball comment just goes to show you never looked into the theory. It&#39;s seems to of been a subterranean detonation. Which is very different than an atmospheric. Look up the difference. This explains the core burning for months after the attacks, the cancer in FF&#39;s, and what we saw on that day. Compare these pictures:</p>

<p>Also look into the definition of  &quot;ground zero&quot; prior to 9/11:</p>

<p>Simple Definition of ground zero</p>

<pre><code>: the point on the earth&#39;s surface directly above, below, or at which an explosion (especially a nuclear explosion) occurs

: the central point in an area of fast change or intense activity

: the beginning state or starting point

It would be interesting to test the debris, but that was all shipped off to China hours after the event. Could possibly radiation be looming?

<p>I keep an open mind to all possibilities simply because we don&#39;t know what we don&#39;t know.  Doing a quick Google search, I came up with this site.  Note the part referring to fission and the byproducts of it found at the WTC site:  <a href="http://www.nucleardemolition.com/">http://www.nucleardemolition.com/</a></p>

<p>If those claims are true, then I&#39;m sure we can both admit that&#39;s a substantial piece of information we need to fit into this jigsaw puzzle.  However, and the difficult part for us, is determining what makes information credible, or who.  Not to mention, how can this information be tampered with, and what is disinformation put out there by seemingly credible sources.  We certainly carry the burden of assembling this story back into objective data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that will get me down voted even more. I have my theories, which are not popular here and I suspect many do not want information like this being looked at. That being said, it was a Tri-Sovereign State plan for Western hegemony in the Holy lands/ME. There are many cover groups, PNAC/AIPAC/CFR/etc etc, but they are working via the Tri-Sovereign States. Think of what this meant for the West and think about who is the Power behind the &quot;West&quot;. No, it&#39;s not Israel, they are players. This is something far more sinister, and there is a purpose for it. I welcome my down votes.... Even though, I&#39;m actually trying to help and educate.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly mate, I don&#39;t know. All I can do is go by history. I do not have answers, I just have questions. From what I can tell about history is that the Rothschild are &quot;Red Shield&quot; bankers which is homage to the Knights Templar (Swiss-Romans). Zionism is more Roman than Jewish, and the Jews running Israel are fake Jews (Khazars) who converted only to have safe passage/lives from the Christians and Muslims. They only did it to save their kingdom/people (don&#39;t blame them). They&#39;ve worked with the Romans, since moving into the Holy lands and probably prior to that. Opportunists. That is why true Jews (Hebrews) are against Israel. It goes against their religion. Khazars are not religious, but fake and opportunists working with Rome as they have always been. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tri-Sovereign States is the diversification of the Holy Roman Empire. We all &quot;know&quot; via history that the Roman Empire fell. However, this may not have been the case. The theory is that the Roman Empire consolidated it&#39;s Empire under three entities (trinity: The Father, Son, Holy Spirit). Most theories say this was done under the Piso-Flavian dynasty. The Holy See (all seeing eye), the City of London (Banking- Roman sovereign land), and the District of Columbia (military). That is the theory. BIS is the central bank for central banks. It&#39;s run by Swiss-Romans. I&#39;ve made countless posts about this. Just check it out. I&#39;m not claiming to have the answers, this is just my thoughts on researching various topics:</p>

<p>First link has some good reading and watching. The second is the full doc in my first post, the third is a run down of the Black Nobility (Papal/Roman banker families you wont here anything really about).</p>

<p>Much of this dates back to Egypt, and what the Jew (Egyptian) stole from the other Egyptian and what the Roman&#39;s found. </p>

<p>Look into who attends the Bilderberg meetings and who created it. You&#39;ll find some answers there.</p>

<p>BIS is under the control of Swiss-Roman bankers, who work for the Vatican and have since the Knights Templars were created, for this purpose. Why do you think the Pope&#39;s private security are the Swiss Guard? Swiss mercenaries, since day one. Many scholars think the Templars are at odds with The Vatican, I think otherwise based on research....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What your thinking of is a Geiger device, and yes it would show some what. It would be interesting to test the debris, but that was all shipped off to China hours after the event. Could possibly radiation be looming? I don&#39;t live anywhere near NY, but if you do and have a device check it out? I mainly say what I say is because of the dust and most importantly the core burning for months after 9/11. Thermite does not explain that. Like I said I want (and we deserve) to know the full truth. </p>

<p>the lobby design is what put so much strain on columns 79, 81, &amp; 82 if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no evidence for this claim, this is also disregarding that  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/realestate/commercial-property-salomon-solution-building-within-building-cost-200-million.html">WTC7 was significantly reinforced in the 1980s</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: The Salomon Solution; A Building Within a Building, at a Cost of $200 Million By MARK McCAIN Published: February 19, 1989</p>

<p>BEFORE it moves into a new office tower in downtown Manhattan, Salomon Brothers, the brokerage firm, intends to spend nearly two years and more than $200 million cutting out floors, adding elevators, reinforcing steel girders, upgrading power supplies and making other improvements in its million square feet of space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This building was one of the most secure and reinforced buildings on the planet, this probably explains why they built an emergency bunker in it, which further reinforced the building.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>an internal collapse began</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No evidence for this claim, this explanation does not pass scrutiny,  for a number reasons:</p>

<p>*There is video footage showing both the north and west faces of the building. Both of these faces, along with the corners connecting to the south and east faces of the building, appear to remain stable and intact until the sudden onset of free fall.</p>

<p>*The West Penthouse, and therefore the interior structure that supported it, did not fail until about a second before the onset of freefall. Therefore the interior of the building got no more than about half a story head start.</p>

<p>*Even though the smaller collapse of the East Penthouse brought about a brief period of window breakage, no further windows were broken until the onset of freefall, so it is not believable that total internal collapse was occurring.</p>

<p>*The roiling clouds of debris that raced down the street, often likened to pyroclastic flow, did not occur until the visible collapse of the building. If the interior of the building had collapsed earlier, we would expect the flow of debris to have started earlier</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The building only appeared to collapse in your &quot;7 seconds&quot; because you&#39;re not counting the unseen damage that was happening well before you start counting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The less than 7 seconds is counted from WTC7 main roof line, this is not up for dispute else go speak to NIST, it appears you disagree with them.</p>

<p>How do you explain freefall again? Don&#39;t try quote NIST because as evidenced in this thread, you don&#39;t agree with them on a number of things and they have no answer anyway</p>

<p>The unseen damage you mention is consistent with controlled demolition, it is called pre-weakening the structure, fires don&#39;t cause a uniform collapse, that looks <strong>exactly</strong> like a controlled demolition, that is absurd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not going to post pictures</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are you scared of doing that? i Don&#39;t want a video, I want the best picture you got of these massive fires in WTC7, I don&#39;t care what someone else has posted, this debate is between me and you.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t think they would be, so no surprise there.</p>

<p>It seems my standard of evidence is much higher than yours, you are scared to post a single picture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The videos...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which also do not show massive office fires in WTC7 else screen grab the exact moment in any of the three videos you posted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>combined with the statements of dozens of FDNY officers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The very same people who reported explosions and molten metal at all three demolition sites, their statements are consistent with the evidence and supported by two peer reviewed scientific papers that categorically prove that nano-thermite was used in some capacity to collapse WTC1,2&amp;7</p>

<p>Actually I&#39;m saying the exact opposite.</p>

<p>really?</p>

<p><strong>Testimony from Firefighters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQyIN6OTMyY">New York Fire Department Captain Philip Ruvolo said: “You’d get down below and you’d see molten steel, molten steel, running down the channel rails, like you’re in a foundry, like lava.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fallenbrothers.com/community/showthread.php?2062-Recovery-worker-reflects-on-months-spent-at-Ground-Zero&amp;amp;p=2948">Joe O’Toole, a Bronx firefighter who worked on the rescue and cleanup efforts, reported that one beam lifted from deep below the surface months later, in February 2002, “was dripping from the molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_G21B2qiQM">New York firefighters recalled in the documentary film Collateral Damages, “heat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are hundreds of these in the firefighters oral histories, how many more do you want me to post?</p>

<p>What about...</p>

<p><strong>Testimony from Other Professionals:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmHqES_lto&amp;amp;t=40s">Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after the attack: “When we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, ‘I think you’d be interested in this,’ and they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060909104247/http://www.seau.org/SEAUNews-2001-10.pdf">Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground Zero September 12, 2001, said: “Feeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helen’s and the thousands who fled that disaster.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/Publications/Special/Welch.htm">In late fall 2001, Dr. Alison Geyh of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported: “Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130730103131/http://911encyclopedia.com/wiki/index.php/Publication:20121014014812">Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: “It’s just too hot for rescuers to get into [some] areas. So we do not know yet what’s in those areas, other than very hot, molten material.”</a></li>
<li>Dr. Keith Eaton reported in Structural Engineer: “They showed us many fascinating slides . . . ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.”</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060818074723/http:/pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nydailynews/87451160.html?did=87451160&amp;amp;FMT=ABS&amp;amp;FMTS=FT&amp;amp;date=Nov+1,+2001&amp;amp;author=GREG+GITTRICH+DAILY+NEWS+STAFF+WRITER&amp;amp;pub=New+York+Daily+News&amp;amp;desc=FIRE+MAY+SMOLDER+FOR+MONTHS">Don Carson, a hazardous materials expert from the National Operating Engineers Union, said six weeks after 9/11: “There are pieces of steel being pulled out from as far as six stories underground that are still cherry red.”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is also ignoring the vast amounts of physical evidence.</p>
