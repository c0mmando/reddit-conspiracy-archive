I&#39;m saying 9/11 is an inside job; they mind controlled everyone around us (but not us); and it was the skull and bones.  Thanks for thinking of me.  I don&#39;t take offense that you temporarily confused me with illuminati.  There&#39;s lots of distrust and confusion. I&#39;m just someone who hates what our government has done, is doing, will do and I&#39;m trying to raise awareness.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a &#39;a premier member, his appellation,&#39;.  That is funny.  </p>

<p>I did not confuse you with the Illuminati, that would be a misinterpretation. As I see it, your moniker simply draws attention to your interest here by highlighting a significant event. In truth, I think you are amazing. And I&#39;m not a young person. It takes much ado to impress an old fuddy duddy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, u/monarch, u/911 must be inclined to expect attacks, he said he got dumped from here once. I was interpreting his moniker as a sort of code. The body snatchers were the perpetrators of the Sep. 11 attacks, and they spout BS. Jolly Roger and 322 point to Skull &amp; Bones. Our mate here is pointing to them, and dedicated his name to the task. Thanks for the support.</p>

If you are aware of the scandal at the presidio, the finders and such....well I definitely had inappropriate pictures taken as a child, and  was also molested by a third party, which is where the oddities start. I have made peace with certain ideas, but think we are still missing things...like maybe Italy didn&#39;t have the only gladio program. It is all tawdry filthy and ugly. Just looking for answers.
