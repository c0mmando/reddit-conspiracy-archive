       Are you trying to say something about

        me
       </em>
       ?  I've already explained what 322 is about.  I'm saying 9/11 is an inside job; they mind controlled everyone around us (but not us); and it was the skull and bones.  Thanks for thinking of me.  I don't take offense that you temporarily confused me with illuminati.  There's lots of distrust and confusion. I'm just someone who hates what our government has done, is doing, will do and I'm trying to raise awareness.

       I did not confuse you with the Illuminati, that would be a misinterpretation. As I see it, your moniker simply draws attention to your interest here by highlighting a significant event. In truth, I think you are amazing. And I'm not a young person. It takes much ado to impress an old fuddy duddy.

       The poem is nice:-) and bodysnatchers is the list makingest go to ever. I hope this stays. Also nice how it became immediately unconfrontational nay agreat example of not sticking to a conclusion one could quickly jump to without knowing the intent of the writer. Rock on.

       Yeah, u/monarch, u/911 must be inclined to expect attacks, he said he got dumped from here once. I was interpreting his moniker as a sort of code. The body snatchers were the perpetrators of the Sep. 11 attacks, and they spout BS. Jolly Roger and 322 point to Skull &amp; Bones. Our mate here is pointing to them, and dedicated his name to the task. Thanks for the support.

       I am still working on things....sofar we know for sure that dad volunteered at Edgewood ... If you are aware of the scandal at the presidio, the finders and such....well I definitely had inappropriate pictures taken as a child, and  was also molested by a third party, which is where the oddities start. I have made peace with certain ideas, but think we are still missing things...like maybe Italy didn't have the only gladio program. It is all tawdry filthy and ugly. Just looking for answers. Because then I know I will be OK. Meanwhile 
I just love me some unclesam and trust him unconditionally. Or something like that.... ;-)

       Yeah, insomnia's rough. I've been waking up around 4 from vivid nightmares. What can you do. Glad your week's going good. Having a pretty good one myself, an old love has re-entered my life. Fingers crossed! I'll try to make some time for the movie.

       Yes, I found the cypher blogging post. Digesting. One of my first posts here was about possible cracks in programming....everyone thought I was smoking crack....this is the kind thing where I can just say, it is a time of awakening...and they did similar during ww2 with radiofree europe. I too have over the years seen about GCA. I want to believe....

       I think you mean GCR (Global Currency Reset)? Got to be careful of syntax errors.

       Radio Free Europe; it is in reverse now. Here we have the Deep State Curtain and we get mostly lies, but also there is RT (Russia Today) which looks to me like mostly the truth.

       Global currency accounts...I thought...details matter immensely  even when my phone sux and now has the new feature of  razorblading my poor fingers. Rt was good for a while, so was press TV and Al-Jazeera...if you want to know anything about the rest of the world you damn sure won't get it on the USBluesnews....you are right on the lower case, many things come from autofuckingincorrect on dis peesa shyyyyt....but I did finally train it to write autofuckingincorrect....at least that part was easy

       u/jam; yesterday I saw a 2 hr. video that attempts to explain about the purposes of chemtrails dust. Surprise: it's high tech, and may be intended for population mind control. See "geoengineering morphs into genetic engineering via chemtrails, rebuilding for Matrix AI and social engineering 130 min. (warning: technical, and mystical)"
