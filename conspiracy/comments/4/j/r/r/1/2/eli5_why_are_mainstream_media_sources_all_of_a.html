       For 15 years if you questioned the mainstream narrative you were dismissed as a conspiracy theorist, but now seemingly overnight it's national news? I just don't get it. I know that Saudi involvement is not on par with saying the US government was responsible for 9/11, but any questioning of the mainstream narrative was automatically labeled craziness.

       And this is why the Saudi link should be fully explored.  When a group of criminals starts turning on each other is when you finally crack the case wide open.

       The Saudis unquestionably know who they work for.  I'm afraid it only works as you describe with the Felons on Cops.  Not the transnational scum who rule from the shadows.

       Shit changes quick if you get a new administration without ties to the globalist club.  Maybe Sanders. Maybe Trump.  None of the other admins would do it.

       By it I mean really change the rules of the game when dealing with the USA.  Old alliances mean nothing, new alliances add entropy to the balance.

       It's called more and more people are waking up. They see how corrupt the election is, and to recognise that, you must also recognize the highly visible corruption and control of our shadow rulers.  Those we cannot criticize.  9/11 truth is a one way street.  Once you're on it, there's no going back to sleep.

       I remember when Reddit lynched me for saying that ousting ghadaffi would be remembered as one of the biggest mistakes we ever made.  Not only did we oust him, we let radical islamists sharia law his ass with an ak47 in the butt and God only knows what other tortures before they executed him without a trial or international oversight.

       Now his only surviving son is tortured daily.

       Have you seen the fake rabbit that rides on a rail around the inside of a greyhound track? The dogs think the rabbit is real and they try to outrun the other dogs to be the first to get the "rabbit". The "secret" pages in the, largely bullshit lies report on the causes of 911, is the rabbit for those who aren't sure if we (neocons and aipac) asked and paid the mossad to take weeks to preload explosives in the towers, blow them up, prepare scripts for "reporters", and create a back story, as well as pepper the internet with hundreds of dead ends. Complicit with Norad, the US Air Force, and the CIA, the COG under Dick Cheney and the Pentagon under Rumsfeld, all,
       <em>
        conspired
       </em>
       to create the "New Pearl Harbor" that the military industrial complex needed to push forward plans to enact the Plan for a Greater Israel leading to the chaotic disruption of the middle east we see today. Investments were in place, stock in defense firms were done, contracts to enact "The Patriot Act" were securely, in advanced, prepared and held by Joseph Biden, and an entire "Homeland Security" apparatus was assembled by complicit parties. These parties have now created a mystery "rabbit" for you to chase around and around until you are exhausted or until they release the NEXT 911 to keep you from marching on Washington and ripping their faces off.

       my hypothesis:
      </p>
      <p>
       saudi arabia is being thrown under the bus in preparation for an overt u.s. invasion. 28 pages, 28 pages, 28 pages. there is also a meme
       <del>
        spreading
       </del>
       being spread about s.a. threatening to crash the u.s. economy if their role in 9/11 is revealed.
      </p>
      <p>

        http://thefreethoughtproject.com/saudi-arabia-threatens-crash-dollar-congress-passes-911-bill-exposing-saudi-role-attacks/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       news flash: the u.s. economy (and more generally, the usd) is crashing anyhow. but if the american public blames saudi arabia for it, that may generate the public will to openly invade s.a.
      </p>
      <p>
       this would position u.s. military well for an invasion of problem child syria, enabling the turkish stream pipeline (and economically attacking russia) and setting them up for a subsequent invasion of iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       but now consider the influx of muslim immigrants over the past years into u.s. and the e.u. They pray to mecca 5 times per day. mecca is in saudi arabia. how do you think they'll handle it when 'the great satan' invades mecca, especially spurred on by provocateurs?

       Petrodollar is ending; Saudi Arabia will soon have outlived its usefulness, and something is going to have to be done about them.

       The middle-east is basically sandwiched between the west and the east.
      </p>
      <p>
       The saudis can really switch alliances if they want to, they really can. 9/11 was basically blackmailing the saudis to follow up with the plan to fuck up the middle-east. Why would the saudis tolerate so much instability in the region? blackmail.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russians and the Chinese are basically married to the region while the US has a gazillion bases. China built its new silk road and is looking for more alliances/partnership while the declining west is destroying everything to keep the Russians and the chinese from growing further.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at all the interventions in the region, its all constant war, no real progress. They can call it foreign policy fail, but thats what they want in the end, more chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will keep making up new enemies as they go along the way, whether it is the saudis, russians or chinese, it wont stop.

       That was their plan the entire time.  As shit gets hot for them, just like they do with the Jesuits...."It was them!  Seriously, guys.  Would we
