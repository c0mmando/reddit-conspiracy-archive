    <div class="md"><p>Just FYI I think you guys are silly 99% of the time and this is one of those times. Your posts are doomed from gaining traction from the start. As soon as it hits the masses it will be mostly downvoted. Then some people will be curious and come into the commments and downvote anything they don&#39;t like. Thats why 4chans conspiracy threads usually gain more traction. Just my 2 cents for you.</p>

The bad ones aren&#39;t breaking any rules so there&#39;s no reason they won&#39;t get removed. </p>

<p>Two: there&#39;s pretty good evidence people are on this sub mass down voting. If you do hang around /new a lot you&#39;ll see it happen, even if it is a post that will garner a lot of quality discussion. When a post is downvoted it disappears and you will need to know exactly what you are looking for to find it. </p>

Anyhow, what&#39;s suspicious is how popular 9/11 related posts get (thousands of comments) and yet disappear quickly from the main page.. to be replaced by some cat content. I dunno, if Reddit was really what the people wanted, wouldn&#39;t those discussion be pinned? On the other hand, Reddit is technically owned by Conde Nast so who am I kidding..</p>

<p>I agree it shouldn&#39;t be used to disregard an opinion (oh you believe x, so I don&#39;t care about your opinion on y), but it is useful in trying to decipher if a person is real or has ulterior motives for posting.</p>

Also in weather balloon videos it&#39;ll show being flat at 120,000 feet and people say you need to be higher.

    <div class="md"><p>Forget actual earth curvature and lens-induced curvature.  Both are prone to errors in perception, measurement and (obviously) lens distortions.</p>

<p>How well does Newtonian physics jive with flat-earth?  How do the orbital mechanics of satellites work in a flat earth model?  Why do radio signals fall off past the &quot;horizon&quot;?  What is the horizon in a flat earth model?  What is happening at night?  What is blocking the sunlight?</p>

<p>There is a live video feed of earth from the space station - is that a live 3D render of the earth with updated weather showing?  I can download an app that tells me when satellites will flash reflected sunlight at me - what is actually flashing at me if its not orbiting satellites?  My GPS works around the globe.  To do that without satellites would be impressive.  It would require a massive network of radio towers everywhere, including the oceans.  Well, maybe not.  If the earth was really flat we could just use a couple of big towers because the signal wouldn&#39;t attenuate at the horizon, I guess.  When I look through a telescope at other planets that are obviously globe shaped and rotating, why should I infer that the earth is flat?</p>

<p>All of this (and tons more) would need a &quot;fake&quot; public-facing front end that somehow jives with the accepted universe perfectly and at the same time works in the &quot;real&quot; flat earth model.</p>

<p>This means everyone in NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, ISRO, JAXA, etc, are all in on it.  Any company that deals with large distances would have to lead a double life.</p>

<p>On a flat earth, distances between continents would beyond the flight range of our airliners.  They would need to be flying ridiculously fast to make up for the distance.  Every map would be so wrong as to be useless for navigation.  Every person who has ever used a map for any intercontinental trip would be aware of the issues.  Every airline pilot, every ship captain, even just intrepid world travelers.  That&#39;s a big conspiracy that would have included my stepfather and about 8 other people in my life.</p>

<p>Even ancient societies predicted with basic math the size and shape of the earth with remarkable precision.  These experiments can be replicated easily and requires no more than measuring shadows at two locations.  Basic trigonometry will dictate you are on a sphere of a specific size.</p>

And that same force is also holding the moon in orbit? That is quite the magikal force ya got there. In reality it&#39;s just density. Things that are less dense than air will rise and float and more dense with fall and sink.  Believe whatever you want and I&#39;ll believe what I want :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easy. Water can curve around a ball for the same reason people in Mexico and China can both jump up and down and accelerate back to the ground at the same rate. The force of gravity (9.81 m/s<sup>s)</sup> gently pulls from the center of the earth, so from any point on a sphere the force of gravity is the same. So water in Australia is being pulled downwards towards the center just as water from Maine is. If at any random point, the force acting on water is the same, it can be concluded that water can move from point A of a sphere (Earth) to point B of the same sphere and the force binding it to the planet&#39;s surface will remain the same. So water essentially hugs the crust. </p>

<p>Like, from a physics standpoint that makes so much sense. Knowing the acceleration of gravity solve hundreds of physics mysteries. The force of gravity is also why airplanes can seemingly fly straight. As an airplane flies straight it also loses height due to gravity pulling it downward. So it adjusts and flys slightly upwards. The plane&#39;s upwards thrust complained with gravity&#39;s downward acceleration will lead to a plane staying equal distance to the earth&#39;s center (if the plane just wanted to go forwards). That is why planes don&#39;t just magically fly into space when flying forwards for long periods of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does that even mean - prove it&#39;s real? Prove that it exists? Drop a baseball and a bowling ball off of a tall building. Record the velocity of both objects, as well as the time it takes to reach the ground. Knowing that A=V/t, you can divide the velocity by the times, and for both cases A will equal 9.81 m/s<sup>2.</sup> That is called the gravitational constant. It works for any and all objects. How else can two objects in free fall always have the same acceleration without some sort of gravitational constant? Literally nothing else works. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still 95% sure you&#39;re trolling, but in case you really did drop out of school in 3rd grade...</p>

<p>I could discuss specific points all day (I do math and physics tutoring from elementary to college level), but if you&#39;ve made it this far in life, you&#39;re probably deliberately shielded yourself from the overwhelming multitude of specific proofs.</p>

<p>The mainstream physics you are doubting, is like 0.01% of the body of knowledge based on it that has created every piece of technology you use in your life. It&#39;s the concrete foundation of a skyscraper, and you&#39;re suggesting it just isn&#39;t even there, when you&#39;ve lived in the skyscraper your whole life. </p>

<p>There are many people who have this view of the people who create all the technology like they&#39;re magicians with completely unknowable methods. But any curious diy-er can build primitive versions of all the shit mankind has come up with - just by learning the physics, learning how to apply it in designing something, and seeing it work.</p>

<p>Like for gravity, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment">Cavendish experiment</a> is totally an at-home setup which was used by a curious little 18th century scientist to observe that gravity is a force exhibited by all masses on all other masses and that the strength was always inversely proportional to the square of distance. You can test hundreds of materials, sizes, and distances and see the pattern for yourself. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just one of thousands of examples of how you can find the experiment that proves or verifies every law that plays into mainstream physics. They just don&#39;t allow anything in without that up front.</p>

<p>Those equations predict the distance and speed of the planets from the sun, the moons from their planets, the tidal effects of the moon on the oceans, the effects of the earth and moon on space craft and satellite trajectories.</p>

<p>If you want to be skeptical of NASA, be skeptical about the right things, like the fact that they were a cover to invest in developing intercontinental ballistic missile technology. They still have to master a lot of legitimate aerospace physics for that end. Now spacex and virgin are doing their own space flights and they all are just like a diy-er (except with many orders of magnitude more money) taking the established principles of physics and applying them.</p>

<p>And when combined with knowledge from geological studies about structural properties of rocks and minerals we can even accurately predict what shapes and sizes of asteroids, moons, planets etcetera are stable and won&#39;t crumble inward under their own gravity into more symmetric (rounder) shapes and which are too weak and will just float apart into space debris.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The gist is you hang an handlebar from a string, put some masses next to the ends of the bar, and observe over time how far it twists the string. You can measure the torsion constant of the string by applying known forces, and then compare to the force of gravity from the masses. String twisting because it&#39;s sensitive to super tiny forces. If you&#39;re testing with 6Kg masses in the neighborhood of 6cm distance, then you&#39;re talking about measuring gravities 100 million times weaker than earth&#39;s gravity.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I give my whole point about diy-ers. You don&#39;t have to sit around and be told things (that may well be lies) when you can just go access the truth directly. Experiment are the quintessential part of the scientific method: you have direct access to all the truths of physics in your living room. And you can short cut the process by learning how to spot credible sources (hint: they always give a blueprint to reproduce their results) and they&#39;re involved in networks that boot their ass if they did something debunkable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Reddit</em></strong></p>

<p>Here we go, me attempting to tiptoe around the hot potato! I have had my fair share of warnings...</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1)</em></strong> All the major Reddit subs are being censored extensively. It happens from behind the scene, a block box contraptions by design, to control the flow of information, if you post articles that reveal crimes or lay out criticism about: The US Military, US Intelligence Community, T.B.T.F. Financial Institutions, Mega Corporations, US Politics, US Economic Data, Inequality and Social Unrest, Corporate Owned Mass Media or well connected individuals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2)</em></strong> Their favorite methods: 1) Word detection algorithms. 2) Subtle vote rigging. 3) Manual removal of posts. 4) Intimidation. 5) Banning of accounts. 6) Allowing trolling by Shills &amp; Pundits. 7) Algorithms that automatically detect undesirable media outlets. 8) The AutoModerator Death Kneel post! It is a very smooth and professional operation. No need to pretend otherwise. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3)</em></strong> Reddit is a black box, if they don&#39;t want you to see what is going on, you won&#39;t see it. We can&#39;t fully observe the process nor can we tell the entities apart. We can make patient observations. We can take notes. Patterns emerges. We are not allowed to talk about our observations or criticize &quot;them&quot;, that would be a violation of rule #2 #5 #10. Catch 22!</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>4)</em></strong> Reddit has been censoring users and independent media sources for years with an increasing zeal, they are censoring them because they are compromising the narratives of the Corporate Owned Mass Media. They punch holes in the official scenery of propaganda, fear, polarization and lies. <em>The recipe for destroying the corporate propaganda is straight forward: Data and fact driven journalism with a high degree of integrity.</em> Reddit is owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publication Inc</a> a de facto Corporate Owned Mass Media outlet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>5) (As an Example)</em></strong> There is a lot of racist postings on the front page of r/conspiracy, thinly disguised as &quot;conspiracy anti-Israel posts&quot;. They constantly make up 10-20% of the front page volume. There is a lot of wedge issues, pitching various groups against each other, thinly disguised as conspiracies. On top of that you can add irrelevant trivia, sports and celebrity worship, designed to distract and entertain. What you have left is maybe 5% of relevant content. This is how &quot;they&quot; are dumbing down the conspiracy forum and Reddit in general, a mere shadow if its former glory, an echo valley for idiots, scratching each other behind the ears. It it by deliberate design, not accident!</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>There are still plenty of ways to spread truth on Reddit. If they remove your material, figure out a way around it. I&#39;ve had my fair share of censored material, and there is always another way to get the truth out. <a href="http://imgur.com/aowCRsS">Here&#39;s a recent one that was censored.</a> The <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> mods didn&#39;t respond to my questions. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4im9bd/rhillaryforprison_is_now_reaching_rall_that_is/">Here&#39;s another one</a>. They appear to resort to removals mostly when the thread is either front page or likely going to be there shortly. The entire thread could be removed as well in order to censor a comment within it. </p>

<p>However, you should still be spreading truth outside of Reddit. Youtube comments, 4chan, comments on news articles, your bathroom at work... If you are censored, let that motivate you even more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t the solution to start new subreddits that pride themselves on no censorship and have mods that stand by that proposal? Granted r/conspiracy isn&#39;t the most heavily populated sub, but it is pretty transparent when it comes to posting content and user replies (as long as they fit in the subs rules (no spamming name calling etc). The average redditor doesn&#39;t want to admit they view this sub, but when a major sub censors information; this is the hub people go to make it known, or find out what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Do you think the mods of r/conspiracy are part of the plot to censor information? I&#39;ve heard some folksmake this claim, but very rarely is it backed up with facts to prove it, which leads me to believe it a psy-op so people lose faith in this sub. The whole of reddit isnt compromised, and one can hope that after mounting evidence of censorship in the main subs, people will seek more transparent outlets for their information. </p>

<p>Great right up though man. Thanks for the information.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t help but think why no one is wondering WHY someone working on Wall Street for 30 years would want to do this with this much urgency and what does he know that we don&#39;t?

<li>It is a narrow path to walk. I am not accusing you of anything. But if people are ignorant, uneducated and lack mannerisms they might quickly fall into the category of racism. Racism, vulgarity and hatred are such blunt tools, wielded by the dim witted, in their hapless effort of impress and bedazzle their surroundings.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, there&#39;s nothing &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; about it. The CIA, together with friendly corporations, change regimes and install puppet governments all the time. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change?wprov=sfla1">They&#39;re really good at it - the best in the world.</a> Well, them and the British. Wow, you live a sheltered life. I thought this was common knowledge everywhere?</p>

<p>Edit: sorry, was condescending. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coups_d%27%C3%A9tat_and_coup_attempts?wprov=sfla1">The history of coups d&#39;etat is pretty interesting</a>.</p>

<p>A conspiracy is a real thing. It is when a group conspire together to shop something that they want, against the wishes of others. </p>

<p>There are kooks out there who wear tin foil hats; but they&#39;re kooks; not conspiracy theorists - and remember that a fact is only proven after it&#39;s theorised; you could call anyone in the justice system a conspiracy theorist then; because they are all pursuing the facts to prove a theory. </p>

<p>In the case of organised crime, like Hillary and Bill, you are seeking to prove a criminal conspiracy. In this case it&#39;s a crime that has subverted the first and second most powerful offices in the land. </p>

<p>This undermines deeply the office of the Presidency, ironically making it harder for foreigners to believe you in the future when you say you&#39;re exporting&quot; Democracy&quot; somewhere new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When those subs leaked over constantly, there was an issue. They&#39;re fine being toxic in their isolated areas (their subs), but when they leak everywhere, it ruins it for those who would rather have legitimate discussion. There were good subs that got fucked over by the purge, and it shouldn&#39;t have happened, but FPH was posting everywhere and actively harassing people all over Reddit. There comes a point where the right to speak is not defendable. Freedom of speech does not protect libel, slander, nor harassment, nor is it a right guaranteed by an online service, which by its ToS can delete your account at will.</p>

Even the admitted truth is a lie according to the most fervent believers in the good character of the state. Or they might be paid to make everyone look the other way.</p>

<p>Are you saying people shouldn&#39;t verify information?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, where did I say that? Wouldn&#39;t I have just said that if I meant that? Verified information is great, but that doesn&#39;t make unverified information completely worthless. Likewise, and this is the one reddit seems to have a problem with, one source does not a truth make, nor are all sources as equal as each other. </p>

<p>Of course, this presents a big problem when trying to set blanket rules for subreddits which deal with a massive variety of different info from wildly differing users.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Isn&#39;t a conspiracy subreddit the exact place where people would want to examine the sources and interpret the information themselves? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably, but my post wasn&#39;t about this particular subreddit. FTR, I don&#39;t believe this place needs a massive amount of sources, but obviously any sources, citations, references and further reading are always a big plus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how would a historian know how someone felt during a certain time period?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. It&#39;s 50 years in the future and I am asked the question &#39;How did the general public see the Olympic Games in London in 2012&#39;. I can answer &#39;it was the most joyous of times for the whole country, heres a BBC article as my source&#39;. Or I can answer &#39;Anybody uninterested in sport or from outside London thought it was a scam they paid for, heres a Guardian article as my source&#39;. Finding an article that says it was a completely mixed reaction is a lot lot harder, but a lot closer to the truth. One source does not the truth make.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They would be speculating, which spreads false information</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except using sources in order to speculate is fine, and done all the time, in fact it&#39;s the basis of most academic work. Speculation has spread a lot of info over the years, much of it has been found out to be correct, much incorrect. To ban it in academia would be, for want of a better term, fucking stupid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, ask historians doesn&#39;t deal with your second question as it is hypothetical. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Supposedly not, but structure the question correctly and it&#39;s almost always let go. &#39;How much did the US assist the USSR during WW2&#39; is how to ask &#39;Would the allies have got to Berlin first if they hadn&#39;t helped the Soviets with lend/lease&#39;, for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s for a moment give the TIL mods the benefit of the doubt, that they removed this not because the fact of the CIA coup itself was unverifiable, but that the source itself, <a href="http://www.mohammadmossadegh.com/">http://www.mohammadmossadegh.com/</a>, did not adequately source its claims. I can see that a sub of its size not having the resources to look beyond the original link to see if the claim itself is true, and err on the side of deleting posts that do not in themselves support the claim. </p>

<p>Given that this is their MO, at least when people report the links, I do wonder whether these unsourced claims are released after a well sourced claim, such as the wiki link, are posted. Then the well-sourced claim is downvoted while the unsourced one is upvoted by bot accounts, and after it gets popular, it&#39;s removed. Just a thought.</p>

I have more issues with them deleting under the &quot;recent politics&quot; rule, but generally just don&#39;t care anymore. </p>

<p>I did propose my own conspiracy theory, that unsourced articles are posted after well-sourced ones to siphon votes, after which it get&#39;s removed. I&#39;m not saying this is the case, but I wouldn&#39;t put it past the groups we know try to manipulate social media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK... after talking with the Mod, it looks like the real problem with the posting is the &#39;secular&#39; wording (meh), and the fact that it is a mossadegh domain.  Apparently, if the link was to a CNN or RT article (referenced in the Wikipedia entry), or a link to the declassified docs, themselves... it would (I guess) seem more credible and less &#39;left to interpretation&#39;.</p>

<p>Not saying I <em>agree</em> with the Mods, but I can see (kinda) where they came from on that.</p>

<p>VACCINES!!!  DUN DUN DUUUNNNNN!  lots of talk about it on this sub.  a whoooole lot.  why are these posts not censored like other are?  </p>

<p>here is why i bring this up.  im a nurse.  i have been for several years now.  i know a thing or 2 about vaccinations.  im pro most vaccinations (except the flu vaccine, its only 50/50 at best).  no matter how reasonably i try to lay out my arguments, how much i empathize with others, no matter how i try to come across, i get downvoted like i just kicked a puppy.  why?  i understand antivax sentiment is high on here, and i can see why.  but the fact that the antivax posts are not censored (at least not like anti israel and anti govt posts are) should tell you something.  couple that with the fact that anything even remotely provax, even provax with limitations, is shit on like the great satan himself.  </p>

<p>what does this tell you?  who benefits?  and how?  someone out there wants antivax sentiments to be high.  i dont know why.  but nobody else seems to be able to see it.  maybe my view is dilluted because im one of the few that are ok with vaccines and i see all the negativity in a different light.  but if you could see it from my end, you would undertand.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have no critical thinking skills. This is easy to take down. I&#39;ll respond to those six &quot;myths&quot; off the top of my head.</p>

<p>&quot;Misconception #1: The United States wanted Iran’s oil&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, I know. It was England that wanted Iran&#39;s oil. Oh, look: the article even mentioned that. And? You do realize that we are used as the NWO&#39;s military, right? That these corporations are multi-national and we do the military bidding for them.</p>

<p>&quot;Misconception #2: Mohammad Mossadegh was a democratically elected Prime Minister&quot;</p>

<p>What kind of point is that to make? They even clarify themselves: &quot;This is not to say Mossadegh’s position was not legitimate. He was chosen by his constituency to be a Majles deputy, this is indisputable.&quot;</p>

<p>Again: what point is being made? I see this a lot. Saying &quot;Here, I&#39;m going to debunk this&quot; and then not actually debunk anything. Throw a little bit of question here and there, attack the most minor non point there, paint a straw man over here... but not actually debunk anything</p>

<p>&quot;Misconception #3: The Eisenhower Administration was determined to remove Mossadegh from power from Day 1&quot;</p>

<p>This is literally never said. I&#39;ve never seen it. Let alone it wouldn&#39;t matter. Did the CIA orchestrate the overthrow of a lawfully-elected Prime Minister? Yes. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the whole story.</p>

<p>&quot;Misconception #4: The CIA coup was successful&quot; Oh? News to me. It &quot;failed&quot; on the 15th/16th, but succeeded on the 19th? Again: what point are you making? And then he says &quot;some Iranians were involved!&quot; Obviously. You need some inside men. It&#39;s not like all politicians are without enemies. Much the opposite. What point is being made here? You&#39;re not adding to any debunking whatsoever. Even if Iranians finished the overthrow in the 19th - let&#39;s say without help - we kicked it off and it wouldn&#39;t have succeeded without our involvement, which is not denied. Coups fail all the time, but that doesn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t happen or weren&#39;t attempted.</p>

<p>&quot;Misconception #5: CIA documents corroborate each other&quot; again: who says this? So they give an example. An example that does not disprove or debunk anything. It shows minor contextual errors that are both probably innocent and inconsequential to the fact that the CIA overthrew Iran&#39;s prime minister. End of story.</p>

<p>&quot;Misconception #6: Westerners and Royalists were the only ones who wished to remove Mossadegh from power&quot; NOBODY SAYS THIS!!! Your idea is &quot;maybe someone else didn&#39;t like him&quot; does not, in any way, somehow disprove that the CIA overthrew Iran&#39;s prime minister.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t notice any of these because you didn&#39;t read it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is that a &quot;take down&quot;? Even on #1 all you did was repeat the same assertion that is debunked. Maybe a bit louder. </p>

<p>On #2, you&#39;re just ignoring the point being made. Almost every time I hear this story it starts with the breathlessly stated &quot;fact&quot; that he was democratically elected. You don&#39;t even seem to deny it, which is the point. That &quot;fact&quot; is false, and it makes it a terrible thing to say at the onset of the story.</p>

<p>On the rest, you just say you&#39;ve never heard anyone say these  things. That&#39;s not my fault. They must have come from sources that didn&#39;t confirm your bias, so you&#39;ve never seen them.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all, saying something is &quot;debunked&quot; is merely an assertion as well. But the other poster did not repeat the same assertion (an assertion he had not made at all); he correctly pointed out that even your article claims the UK had an oil interest in Iran. Do you deny that the US and UK often work in tandem for foreign policy, especially where it concerns the interests of their multi-national corporations? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On #2, you&#39;re just ignoring the point being made. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you seem to be focused on smaller details while ignoring the larger picture. Does one sovereign nation have the right to depose the legitimate leader of another? That&#39;s a point we might debate, yet the fact that Iran was not as democratic as the US or other western countries does not mean we can just assume a coup against him is somehow okay.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What is your point in making your original comment? That some people posit or spread misinformation concerning the coup? I don&#39;t think anyone would deny that. Yet even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mosaddegh">wikipedia</a> says he:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>was the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran from 1951 until 1953, when his government was overthrown in a coup d&#39;état orchestrated by the American Central Intelligence Agency and the British Secret Intelligence Service.</p>
