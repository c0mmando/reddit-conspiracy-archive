    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking the plane that hit Camp David was one of the four, and that we are being lied to about the Pentagon. Here&#39;s an example:</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2001-09-11 10:57:39 Metrocall [002468283] C ALPHA From: Joyce Howard Subj: pentagon It was a small commuter plane that crashed into the Pentagon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Initial reports say that there were explosions at the Pentagon. Then they were saying a small plane hit. But something doesn&#39;t add up because later on in the official report, they said flight 77 (a Boeing 757) was the one that hit the pentagon. The Boeing 757 was the manufacturer&#39;s largest single-aisle passenger aircraft..</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>So maybe the plane that &quot;crashed in a field in PA&quot; was really the one that hit Camp David. But I seriously doubt a plane that big crashed into the side of the pentagon. I feel crazy knowing that very few people question this shit. </p>

<p>The authors of the above paper, some of the best in the 9/11 truth community, refute Honegger&#39;s hypothesis ( no plane impacted the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, and that pre-planted explosives caused all the deaths and damage) and show that the physical, eyewitness, radar, and FDR data, plus other data, all support impact by a large silver plane, a Boeing 757, and most probably American Airlines Flight 77.</p>

<p>The authors of this paper are some of the best in the 9/11 truth community </p>

<p>The no planes at the Pentagon, the missile theory etc were probably concocted by the government themselves.</p>
