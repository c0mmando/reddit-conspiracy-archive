       I'm thinking the plane that hit Camp David was one of the four, and that we are being lied to about the Pentagon. Here's an example:
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        2001-09-11 10:57:39 Metrocall [002468283] C ALPHA From: Joyce Howard Subj: pentagon It was a small commuter plane that crashed into the Pentagon.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       Initial reports say that there were explosions at the Pentagon. Then they were saying a small plane hit. But something doesn't add up because later on in the official report, they said flight 77 (a Boeing 757) was the one that hit the pentagon. The Boeing 757 was the manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft..
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe the plane that "crashed in a field in PA" was really the one that hit Camp David. But I seriously doubt a plane that big crashed into the side of the pentagon. I feel crazy knowing that very few people question this shit.

       The authors of the above paper, some of the best in the 9/11 truth community, refute Honegger's hypothesis ( no plane impacted the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, and that pre-planted explosives caused all the deaths and damage) and show that the physical, eyewitness, radar, and FDR data, plus other data, all support impact by a large silver plane, a Boeing 757, and most probably American Airlines Flight 77.

       I hear what you're saying, but why has no security footage been released if a plane did indeed crash? The only thing I've seen is pictures with little to no airplane debris. And all of the security tapes have been classified. Regardless, I will look into the link you sent.

       The no planes at the Pentagon, the missile theory etc were probably concocted by the government themselves.
