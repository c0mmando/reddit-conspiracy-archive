    <div class="md"><p>We painted Hitler as a monster, a devil. And that&#39;s why we could not move away from that portrayal after the war. We had mobilized the masses against the devil incarnate. And so we were forced to continue in this satanic scenario after the war. We could not possibly have explained to our people that the war had actually been only a preventative economic measure.
<strong>– James Addison Baker</strong>, Secretary of State, Der Spiegel, issue 13/1992</p>

<p>Within a few years, Hitler will emerge from the hatred that surrounds him now as one of the most significant figures who ever lived. He had in him the stuff of which legends are made.
<strong>– President John F. Kennedy</strong>, 1945, <em>Prelude to Leadership: The Post-War diary of John F. Kennedy</em>, p. 73-4</p>

<p>What thrust us into war were not Hitler&#39;s political teachings: the cause, this time, was his successful attempt to establish a new economy. The causes of the war were: envy, greed, and fear.</p>

<p><strong>– John Frederick Charles Fuller</strong>, British general and historian, Joachim Nolywaika’s <em>Die Sieger im Schatten ihrer Schuld</em>, p. 35</p>

<p>What Herr Hitler is required to do is to merge Germany into the league of monopolist states. The peace-loving nations are more heavily armed than you are, Herr Hitler, and have unlimited resources at their disposal, and they will unquestionably make war on you if you do not submit to their will and if you persist in going on with this Sovereign State stuff.
<strong>– Wyndham Lewis</strong>, English novelist, painter, &amp; critic, Robert Driscoll’s <em>The New World Order and the Throne of the anti-Christ</em>, p. 231</p>

<p>Atrocity propaganda is how we won the war. And we&#39;re only really beginning with it now! We will continue this atrocity propaganda, we will escalate it until nobody will accept even a good word from the Germans, until all the sympathy they may still have abroad will have been destroyed and they themselves will be so confused that they will no longer know what they are doing. Once that has been achieved, once they begin to run down their own country and their own people, not reluctantly but with eagerness to please the victors, only then will our victory be complete. It will never be final. Reeducation needs careful tending, like an English lawn. Even one moment of negligence and the weeds crop up again–those indestructible weeds of historical truth.
<strong>– Sefton Delmer</strong>, British chief of `black propaganda’, 1945, in a conversation with German professor of international law Dr. Friedrich Grimm</p>

<p>German racialism has been deliberately distorted. It never was an anti-“other race” racialism. It was a pro-German racialism. It was concerned with making the German race strong and healthy in every way. Hitler was not interested in having millions of degenerates if it was in his power not to have them. Today, one finds rampant alcohol and drug addiction everywhere. Hitler cared that the German families be healthy–cared that they raise healthy children for the renewal of a healthy nation. German racialism meant rediscovering the creative values of their own race, rediscovering their culture. It was a search for excellence–a noble idea. National Socialist racialism was not against the other races; it was for its own race. It aimed at defending and improving its race, and wished that all other races did the same for themselves.
<strong>– Leon Degrelle</strong>, SS Standartenführer</p>

<p>In the fifteen years that have followed this resolve he has succeeded in restoring Germany to the most powerful position in Europe, and not only has he restored the position of his country, but he has even, to a very large extent, reversed the results of the Great War… [Now] the vanquished are in process of becoming the victors, and the victors the vanquished. When Hitler began, Germany lay prostrate at the feet of the Allies. He may yet see the day when what is left of Europe will be prostrate at the feet of Germany. Whatever else may be thought about these exploits, they are certainly among the most remarkable in the whole history of the world.</p>

<p>Germany is becoming too strong. We must crush her.</p>

<p>To General Robert E. Wood, November 1938, Peter H. Nicoll’s <em>Englands Krieg gegen Deutschland</em>, p. 82</p>

<p>Germany’s unforgivable crime before the Second World War was her attempt to extricate her economic power from the world&#39;s trading system and to create her own exchange mechanism which would deny world finance its opportunity to profit.</p>

<p>To Lord Robert Boothby, Sidney Rogerson’s Propaganda in the Next War, 1938, foreword 2nd edition, 2001</p>

<p>You must understand that this war is not against Hitler or National Socialism, but against the strength of the German people, which is to be smashed once and for all, regardless of whether it is in the hands of Hitler or a Jesuit priest.
<strong>– Winston Churchill</strong>, <em>Winston Churchill: His Career in War &amp; Peace</em>, p. 145</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if it is truly worth typing this but....</p>

<p>I really doubt there are more than two real Fascist sympathizers here besides the PR trolls. The definition of fascism has been changed over the years to distort knowledge of what it truly is. My 1960s dictionary simply defines it as a system that puts the rights of the state before the rights of the individual and calls it a form of collectivism.. Basic statism like communism and socialism. </p>

<p>Just because Nazis were racist doesn&#39;t mean Fascism = racism by definition, or racism = fascism. </p>

<p>Hiltler&#39;s invasions were nothing more than empire building similar to the US conquering, by invasion or subversion, at least a dozen nations in the last decade or a little more.  </p>

<p>Many here are just skeptics of official history.  Many despise the atrocities being committed by Israel .  And then there are some looking for the hidden hand behind the grand conspiracy and see Jews/zionism in prominent positions therefore focus on them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jewish Cabal Bankers are the real killers. General Patton admitted in his diary that the US helped the wrong side in the war. It was Nationalism vs Globalism, and globalism won. And now we are all fucked.</p>

<p>Yeah Hitler did some fucked up shit (a lot of it blown way out of proportion, like anybody even remotely awake knows with the holocaust). But at the end of the day, there would likely be less evil in the world today had Germany won. Certainly less people would have been killed as the USSR would not have existed. Neither would the Vietnam war. Korea wouldn&#39;t have split up. There would be no Israel as Jews would be living in Madagascar... Etc.</p>

And then when some Redditors complained, they got banned?  If Putin is correct that the Internet is a CIA project, then perhaps Reddit likewise is a CIA/Pentagon mini-project.  Those descendants of Operation Paperclip couldn&#39;t have invented a better way to create the perception that Nazism is popular:  fake accounts, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4cyda2/something_fishy_going_on_with_flytape_and/">brigading mods who play &quot;April Fools Jokes&quot; to legitimize sockpuppets</a>, discrediting serious conspiracy researchers with 400 shitposts per day ...

    <div class="md"><p>Can you give us a list of nations the English empire invaded? </p>

<p>Why are the Germans worse than the English?</p>

<p>Are the English blood thirsty murderous maniacs? </p>

<p>Do you think the treaty of Versailles was fair? Why were there so many Germans starving to death? </p>

<p>What is unbearable is people thy cannot see in shades of grey but black and white </p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;Naturally the common people don&#39;t want war: Neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, IT IS THE LEADERS of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is TELL THEM THEY ARE BEING ATTACKED, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. IT WORKS THE SAME IN ANY COUNTRY.&quot;</p>

<p>SS Main Office of Economic Administration 
Service Group D Concentration Camp 
D III/Az.: 14 n (KL) 12.42 Lg/Wy </p>

<p>Oranienburg 
28 December 1942 </p>

Mor., Herzog., Mau., </p>

<p>Copy to Camp Commandants </p>

<p>In the inclosed a compilation of the current arrivals and departures in all the concentration camps is sent to you for your information. It discloses that out of the 136,000 arrivals about 70,000 died. With such a high rate of death the number of the prisoners can never be brought up to the figure as has been ordered by the Reichsfuehrer of the SS. The 1. <strong>camp doctors must use all means at their disposal to reduce essentially this death rate in the various camps</strong>. The best doctor in a concentration camp is not the one, who believes that he must stand out for uncalled severity , but the one who by his supervision and exchange keeps the working capacity at the various labor commands at the highest possible level. The camp doctors must supervise more often than in the past the food of the prisoners and, with approval of the administration, submit improvement proposals to the camp commandants. These, however, must not only appear on paper, but must be controlled regularly by the camp doctors. Furthermore, <strong>the camp doctors are to see to it that the working conditions at the the various labor places are improved as much as possible.</strong> To this purpose it will be necessary that the camp doctors inspect the labor places on the ground and convince themselves about the conditions of work. </p>

<p><strong>The SS Reichsfuehrer has ordered that <em>the death rate absolutely must be reduced</em>.</strong> For this reason the aforementioned has been ordered and a monthly report on this matter is to be submitted to the Chief of the Department D III. The first report to be submitted on 1 February 1943. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh really? So you said that the Nazis wanted to deport the Poles? That&#39;s a new one.</p>

<p>Anyway, you showed beyond any doubt that at some point the death rate at slave labor camps was so high that they couldn&#39;t even use their slaves for labor. Clearly that showed that the Nazis didn&#39;t intend to enslave and eradicate the Poles, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder where you&#39;ve read these things. I disagree with the things you&#39;ve QUOTED VERY LOUDLY and certainly didn&#39;t write them. It&#39;s extremely good to be critical of all sources. You always have a preconception of whether a thing is true or false, but you must know that it may be wrong. Things are either true or false, truth is not &quot;relative&quot; or dependent on circumstances.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why when I read a history book about the Nazis, which I&#39;ve provided a link to on Amazon ($10 for an ebook if you can&#39;t piracy), I&#39;ve gone through the exhaustive and extensive sources list, in the same way I did for you here, until I was convinced that the book is legit. And you can do it yourself. You just won&#39;t, because you&#39;ve already decided what the truth is and there is nothing that can convince you otherwise.</p>

<p>There is one among us who takes someone else&#39;s opinion without checking it and ignores the other person&#39;s arguments, and it&#39;s not me. I&#39;ve explained that your quote (&quot;Hey guys, half the people in the concentration camp died, please kill less of them because we need labor force, love Heinrich&quot;) doesn&#39;t exactly show that the Nazis weren&#39;t monsters, and provided links to documents, also from the Nuremberg trails, that show that I&#39;m right. Instead of verifying my claims you just decided I&#39;m an Agent of the World Zionist Child-Eating Conspiracy to take over the world.</p>

<p>That list is correct and confronting they did kill lots of civilians. </p>

<p>Hitler, the Nazis and Germany were to fight against the USSR for the industrialists, bankers and royalists, capture government and civilian gold as well as other belongings, and oil wells.
