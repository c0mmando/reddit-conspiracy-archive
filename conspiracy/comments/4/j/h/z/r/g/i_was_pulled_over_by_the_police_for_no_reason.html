       Hi r/conspiracy. I must tell someone this because I am baffled at the moment. Just two days ago I was running some errands with my siblings and a few friends around town. We saw a police car driving the opposite direction I was driving, and we all looked at the officer that was driving, and he was staring straight back at us. It was as if we had committed some sort of crime. So he makes a U-turn, and he follows me as I'm driving. My sister tells me to pull into a store parking lot so it looks like we're going inside the store to get something, and as I am parking the officer pulls up behind me and turns on his lights. Oh shit, here we go. He comes to my window and tell me I have a broken tail light and ask the usual license and registration, but he ask for my insurance? That's something I've never heard before. I provide him my license, but I recently just got the car that has been used before and I haven't got the registration just yet. His partner comes near the passenger where my brother was sitting and ask everyone who's in the car for their I.D, but my brother told him it's in his backpack and he didn't feel like searching for it. Then the officer's partner ask if he can search his backpack, and I looked at my brother and told him "You do not consent to any searches". So my brother tells that, and gives the officer his name. Get this though, the officer takes 2 I.D's and his partner has another set of 2. He proceeds to say "You got 2?" and his partner just nods. What does that mean? Are officers required to have 4 I.D's if there is more than 4 people in the car? The officer then ask if anyone is probation in the car, and I said "No, nobody is on probation in this car". About 10 minutes later after putting our names in the system, and we checked out with NO criminal record what-so-ever. He comes back and gives everyone their I.D's. He then says "So we just pulled you over because you had a broken tail light, and there is crack on your window. I would be the one to write you up for a ticket, but I'm going to let you slide and hopefully you can fix those problems on your car. Have a nice day" He and his partner gets in the car and leaves. After that I headed straight home, and wasted no time. As I am pulling into my driveway my sister says she's going to get out, and check the tail lights to make sure it wasn't broken. And guess the fuck what? IT WASN'T BROKEN. Also, how could the officer pull us over for a broken tail light.... when he was facing the opposite direction we were facing! The fuckery is mighty fucking real. I know this isn't a conspiracy as much, but I have to tell people this. Cops are not here to protect you, and they are not here to serve you. Know your rights while you can because these pigs  are ruthless fucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S The cracked part of my front windshield is not big, and it looks as if a a small cup landed on it, so I wouldn't gotten a ticker for something that minor.

       This 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only has it happened to be but I have a few close LEO "friends" and they have told me starring is an admission of guilt if you fit there profile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Couple years ago a cop actually admitted he pulled me over for mean mugging him which is something I tend to do unconsciously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also went on a ride along one time when I was younger and all the guys were literally different people in uniform.
      </p>

       Whole thing left me in shock.

       Without a doubt in my mind. The split personality's is what blew me away.

       And it's crazy cause I used to work with a schizophrenic at a law firm and the dramatic personality changes my co-worker had would equally compare.

       Absolutely, were all susceptible to the moral pitfalls once obtaining substantial amounts of power and authority over others.
      </p>
      <p>
       And about the personality changes after talking with friends who were in the service particularly in active war zones to me reflect LEO mentality. The major difference being my military buds have to readjust after returning home and it takes time. Having to switch into survive instincts day in and day out has got to deal a heavy toll on your mind never mind what they're being told.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't understand is how you wouldn't end up with a militant mentality overtime. That part seems natural to me and if you were to have a family or would like to engage in society it would require you to be able to suppress that side of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then couple all that with people who become LEO as a means to an end for financial gain rather than the ideology of a public servant and to me it seems like a crash course to disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you were getting at I would like studies done also and a more stringent hiring process.

       I could see the militant mindset as something that happens over time, but I'm willing to bet most cops don't see enough action for their life being frequently on the line enough to justify that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do see former military joining the force, and bringing that mindset back. The us vs them mentality too,but that's something that comes with the territory imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't come up with anything (aside from not having police which has obvious repercussions) that might keep this stuff from happening.

       That's how they do things today. They just make up shit or exaggerate to stop you in hopes they find something. For the most part when they just let you go, they knew they weren't going to right you up in the first place for that, it was just to initiate the stop.  Welcome to the police state.

       Funny that you mentioned that because once they had our I.D's I was talking to the people in my car, and I was telling them that I wanted to ask the officer if I could check my tail light to know which one was out, but they were telling me to just let it go and not ask the officer anything. I wonder what would've happened if I did check it. They probably wouldn't even let me out the car.

       Good thing you didn't and good on the people in the car for dissuading you. By getting out of the car, could've taken that situation from 0 to 8 in an instant. Especially if not commanded to stop out. Also, by stepping out on your own account you are opening the door for them to use against you (giving up rights).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you were video recording, that could of turned south very quickly. Which is why we all need to document interactions. For our safety and theirs. It also limits their bullshit (not 100%, but somewhat).

       Quite honestly if it were me and they said I had a broken tail light I would have got pissed immediately and got out of the car to check. Especially since you said you just got the car. I would have popped right out and asked which one so I could fix it. If they couldn't show me a broken light I would have started asking more questions as I start recording with my phone.

       Oh yeah, they definitely make shit up. About a month ago my husband and I were returning home from the farmer's market. We live in a rural area and were taking some of the back roads home. We weren't speeding- just enjoying looking at all the farms and listening to some music.
      </p>
      <p>
       We noticed a cop riding our ass and we were doing the speed limit, so I didn't think much of it- we were almost home. We signal that we are making a right turn (into our driveway) and the cop turns into our driveway and puts his lights on. Great.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cop asks for my husband's license, registration, insurance. Husband asks "what's the problem." Cop says "you didn't use your blinker back there when you went onto X road." Basically the cop is telling us that we didn't use our blinker to signal when we were on a road that doesn't require a turn, basically road Y becomes road X- the name of the road changes from Y to X but there is no turning involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Husband gives the cop a weird look and mentions that he didn't know you needed to use your blinker to signal when the road is straight. Cop then admits "I know it sounds dumb but I kind of needed a reason to pull you over. We got a report of a stolen vehicle that is gold being driven by two black males and I needed to see if you fit the perps description since your vehicle matches the description" (Our car is gray, btw)
      </p>
      <p>
       Husband says, OK. Cop says "have a nice day."
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically, we were pulled over with a BS reason so the officer could see if we were black.

       That's why.  That and other details about the car looked suspicious to them. THat initial U turn was when you know that they are going to harass you.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why when you see a police, stare ahead like a robot.  Do not hit brakes even if you are speeding.  You will have to train yourself of this habit, 99% of everyone makes this mistake of 'uh oh' better brake heres a cop.  Subconsciously, everyone is speeding and they know it.  I've been a passenger when someone was not speeding and they still hit brakes out of habit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So don't brake. It's dumb.  If they clocked you they clocked you.  By not braking, you are forcing them into making a difficult decision, whereas if you press brakes they already made up your mind--you just admitted to speeding implicitly (yes, they look for your brake lights).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't hit brake lights it tells them one of the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        ) You aren't aware your'e speeding so as a police they know they are going to get an honest "I didn't know I was speeding" and they'll have to be an asshole by giving you a ticket
       </li>
       <li>
        ) You don't give a shit about them and their dumb rules, maybe you have a lawyer or you are a lawyer, so you're going to be a tough customer.  They may even think they may have a hard time catching you.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, police are bullycowards, which means they go after the easy prey.  Make yourself a harder prey.  Don't look at them.  Don't even think about them.  Don't think the thought "uh oh i'm guilty". Think the thought "no they won't" and stare straight ahead.  I'm convinced they pick up on this psychic energy and leave you alone.  The moment you feel 'guilty' and televise it with braking they'll go for the jugular.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just saved you probably 75% of your future tickets.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also helps if you see them you can stealthily downshift and gently pull your emergency brake and you'll nearly immediately drop 10mph

       edit-on-top: This is some real life advice. 3 simple tips to not get fucked by law enforcement. It's like a fucking gawker list for not going to jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       I replied below to OP in an absurdly long post about a traffic stop, but here's some further basics:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         When pulled over you only LEGALLY have to provide license, registration and insurance. No, they can't search your trunk. No they can't take a look around your vehicle, aside from what they can see in plain sight from the outside. If they tell you to stay put to wait for a K9, ask them if your being detained and if you're free to go. Get that shit autouploading to the
         <a href="https://www.aclu.org/feature/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct">
          ACLU app
         </a>
         (if you're a young person, or person of color, or a person with a heartbeat, you should have this app.) You may be hit by every obscure traffic law in the book for refusing, but if you're carrying a pound of sweet BC bud, or, if you're in the midwest, a burned out roach in the ashtray, this is probably your best bet.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If pulled in for an interrogation by local police, you only have nine words that are allowed to come out of your mouth, "I would like to speak to my attorney, please." Then shut your fucking mouth. The only thing you're allowed to say next without you attorney present is "I would like to speak to my attorney, please."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you are pulled in in for an interrogation by federal law enforcement, there is only one word you should say, "lawyer." Nothing more. Repeat it as many times as you need until your lawyer is sitting next to you. Don't fuck around and try to play word games with the feds. You get ONE WORD: "LAWYER."
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       edit: And again, I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, just the opinions of someone who knows a bit more than most about what he is talking about.

       Thank you for the future information. I feel frustrated and pissed the fuck off to be honest. Knowing that they were in the wrong from the beginning, and still played it off as if I was at fault here. I guess I am lucky to have walked away from that situation tho. Where I live the cops constantly harass people on the daily basis.

       k, folks, don't crucify me here, I don't make the rules, but I sure as shit know what they are, and I'm going to attempt to explain what was
       <strong>
        possibly
       </strong>
       going through those police officer's minds at different intervals of the experience:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I was running some errands with my siblings and a few friends around town. We saw a police car driving the opposite direction I was driving, and we all looked at the officer that was driving, and he was staring straight back at us. It was as if we had committed some sort of crime. So he makes a U-turn, and he follows me as I'm driving.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If I can make an assumption, the majority of the people in your vehicle are under 26 years old, or as a (probably) mid-30's or older cop might assume, a vehicle full of young people. At the very least (as you can't say exactly what your friends did), you looked at the officer as he drove by. He probably saw you staring and thought, "that driver took quite the interest in me, I'm going to repay the pleasure." So he flips a bitch and starts following your car full of "youngsters" to see if he can find a reason to pull you over to talk to you (run your plate/names/ID's for possible warrants).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        My sister tells me to pull into a store parking lot so it looks like we're going inside the store to get something, and as I am parking the officer pulls up behind me and turns on his lights.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You pulled into a parking lot with the hope that it would look like you were just gonna grab some chips from a Walgreens, huh? You know who else does that all the time when the police are behind them? Drunks. You wouldn't believe the random parking lots drunks pull into. Dentists offices at midnight, nightclubs at noon, abandoned warehouses anytime. (Protip: next time pull into a residential neighborhood to drop one of your passengers off, it's worth a shot). He was going to follow you in anyway by that point, it wasn't the worst decision, but it probably wouldn't have mattered, anyway.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Oh shit, here we go. He comes to my window and tell me I have a broken tail light and ask the usual license and registration, but he ask for my insurance? That's something I've never heard before.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sounds par for the course. Quick note: providing proof of insurance is necessary in most (if not all at this point?) states. Your car could be impounded if you don't have insurance. Last time I was pulled over, I was able to show the cop my insurance card on my phone.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I provide him my license, but I recently just got the car that has been used before and I haven't got the registration just yet.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The PD dispatcher (the person chatting into the dangly piece on his ear) will be able to pull up all registration info from the DMV, including if the registration transfer is in progress. Don't lie about this stuff. If you just haven't gotten around to filing the paperwork because dealing with the assholes at the DMV is the worst and you work three jobs and go to school, let the cop know. Even police officers have to sit in ungodly masses of human filth to register their cars. They may understand and let you off with a fix-it ticket, understanding that the hell you will soon have to put yourself through is much worse than anything he could legally fuck with you with.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        His partner comes near the passenger where my brother was sitting and ask everyone who's in the car for their I.D, but my brother told him it's in his backpack and he didn't feel like searching for it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is accurate. The only person who is legally obligated to provide proof of identity is the driver of the vehicle ("driving is a privileged, not a right" and such.) But fair warning, this will not make the cops happy, and the driver may end up getting the entire traffic code thrown at them. Remember, the reason they wanted to pull you over is to check out you, your vehicle, and everyone in it. If you have nothing to hide, and are willing to take the hit on the vehicle citations, stand the fuck up for yourselves and your constitutional rights, and make sure people are recording EVERYTHING to the cloud, without shoving it in the cop's faces (for obvious reasons we can all youtube search.)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Then the officer's partner ask if he can search his backpack, and I looked at my brother and told him "You do not consent to any searches". So my brother tells that, and gives the officer his name.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm guessing he also got his birthday. Full name + DOB = those crafty dispatchers WILL find you. Your brother's record probably came up "clear, no match" or "clear and current" if he had a valid ID/DL. But don't underestimate what a clever/skilled/bored PD dispatcher can and will find with limited information. Again, passengers DO NOT have to say or provide anything unless there is probable cause that they have committed a crime.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Get this though, the officer takes 2 I.D's and his partner has another set of 2. He proceeds to say "You got 2?" and his partner just nods. What does that mean? Are officers required to have 4 I.D's if there is more than 4 people in the car?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You never say how many people are in the car, but making assumptions from your post, I assume there are 5-7. I'll also go out on a limb and assume that 1-3 are under (or look under) the age of 18. If there are no alcohol or drugs detected, those cops probably couldn't give a shit about the minors. They'll end up spending the rest of their shift waiting for mommy and daddy if the minors pop for anything. It'd be a waste of time and resources for their (again, I'm assuming based on your post) already understaffed department.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The officer then ask if anyone is probation in the car, and I said "No, nobody is on probation in this car".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A quick note about this: of the ID's you had given, they would have found out anyway. He was giving the person who had the most to lose the chance to speak up, get their search done quickly (granted they were not in violation), and get him/her and you non-criminals on your way so they could clear the call and get dispatched to the next bullshit of their night. Had one of your friends been on probation or parole and lied, you all would have ended up sitting there for a LONG time depending on the terms of your friend's probation/parole terms. (Sometimes a nurse from the local hospital will need to be called to take a bloodtest. It's a waste of everyone's time, but it's court-ordered...)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        About 10 minutes later after putting our names in the system, and we checked out with NO criminal record what-so-ever. He comes back and gives everyone their I.D's.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Getting returns on 4 ID's in 10 minutes means those cops were gods at running names from their in-car computers or a single dispatcher deserves a raise, either way, 4 ID's could take more than 40 minutes in many metro areas.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He then says "So we just pulled you over because you had a broken tail light, and there is crack on your window. I would be the one to write you up for a ticket, but I'm going to let you slide and hopefully you can fix those problems on your car. Have a nice day"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm going to translate that sentence from cop to civilian for you: "I needed a reason to stop and talk to you because I saw you staring at me when we drove past you and you were driving a car full of young people, who, based on my experience, are those who typically cause problems in this part of town. To solidify the fact that I'm 'letting you off easy,' I'm also going to point out that I could legally cite you for having a crack in your windshield. And keep in mind that just because I didn't write you a ticket for what I saw to be a malfunctioning taillight and an obviously cracked windshield, doesn't mean that you shouldn't get that fixed before some bored dayshift sheriff's deputy pulls you over and cites you it. I'm the graveyard patrol in this shithole part of town and I honestly have much better things to do than fuck with you law abiding kids any further. But I had to check."

And guess the fuck what? IT WASN'T BROKEN. Also, how could the officer pull us over for a broken tail light.... when he was facing the opposite direction we were facing!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't know what that cop saw or didn't see or whether your taillight was out or not. But remember this, it's very important, if a police officer wants to pull you over, he will find a way. Did you stop over the limit line? Did you go 1mph over the speed limit? Did you fail to signal between 100 and 300 feet from where you mad a turn? They will find a way.

       Get your windshield fixed. Sooner or later, there WILL be a bored cop who WILL give you a fix-it ticket for it. Save yourself the fee and hassle of getting a cop to sign off on your ticket after already paying ~$100 to get it fixed, only to pay another fee. It's not expensive to get a new windshield and most of them come with multi-year, no-questions-asked warranties.
