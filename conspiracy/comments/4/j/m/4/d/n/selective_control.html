       Hey guys, this is my first post on Reddit. However, I've always been a thinker and I've always been concerned for the well being of the world as a whole. 
This being said, I wanted to turn everyone's attention to the possibility that WWIII is very well in our midst. The following is an explanation of my views of the very country I live in, since I have no room to speak for the issues of other countries. As far as I can tell, America is on the very brink of revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that way too many people are too caught up in their own lives to realize that anything is wrong in the first place. Even the ones I call my family no longer want to be involved in the fate of this country. "It doesn't matter," "Nothing will change anyway," "I can't trust anyone, you can't trust them either." These are only a few of the excuses I hear to this day. Not only from them, but from others of whom I have asked what they thought of revolution. 
The brainwash is so strong. Even those who strive for the common pleas of the people are driven mad by their own ideas. And those who are brave enough to make a stand are found dead in their own homes, with no evidence of what could have been wrong. Not even numbers of people are safe. If one man deems a common belief as untrue, ridiculous, and a waste of breath, he will spend whatever amount of the green crack he has to eliminate the threat and preserve the illusion that we are living in a perfect utopia free of conflict and tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, needless to say, is utterly absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, has become the land of the imprisoned and the home of the cowards. Revolution is not a word to be spoken. Fear of our own police force is rampant and spreading. Discrimination is commonplace and not a single soul can even fathom the variations of the human mind, let alone bring themselves to accepting that it is real. Religion only strengthens the cowardice. As much as I respect the concept, all religion seems to do is reduce its followers to slaves, bowing and scraping at the ground and praying for peace. All this while the man next to them gets shot for breathing wrong and not believing the same way they do. Hypocrisy at its finest.
You are no longer a human being until the ground you walk becomes gold as you tread past, and the green shit that every person is addicted to falls from your pockets in pounds. 
If you are common, simple, and brainwashed to come and bark like a cocker spaniel when the government calls for you, you are safe. You are common rabble to be lost and forgotten. Mere fuel for this godforsaken machine. 
But if you so much as spit in the wrong direction, even dare to preach change and revolution, or attempt to come out as a Hero to those who no longer have the strength or will to fight for what is right, you are a terrorist, a traitor, a fool, and a mockery of what this "great and solitary country" stands for. You WILL be eliminated, and the man behind the mask, the one who takes your life, will always be innocent. He did it for the good of the world after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is why I'm scared. I could be found dead tomorrow. And no one would know what truly happened, or what I truly stood for. Everything I say here and now could be banned from those who MUST see it and at least try to understand. Or, the worst of it is, you will see what I have said. You will meet me, and others like me on the street, and we will be forced into silence. Either that, or face death for what was only an innocent struggle for true freedom and change.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR This country is absolutely corrupt. No one can be trusted and nothing can be said to instigate change. The government of America is no longer run by human beings like ourselves. It is run by a machine that has existed for FAR too long. And it will let you conspire against them. Oh yes, you can say whatever you want. You can prove whatever you want to prove. You can bomb buildings, give speeches, run for higher offices, and even live your life as honestly as possible. Only to be eliminated when the time is right and when your blood can be cleaned without a trace. If you so much as blink in the direction of revolution, you will disappear and lies will fill your place.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Selective Control. This is the fear that has kept all of us in neat lines like kindergartners. Somebody has to do something. No one can live like this and be expected not to feel like an animal in a cage.

       One of my favorite quotes that illustrates this point very well is from the movie The Cloud Atlas, in which one of the main characters says he is joining the abolitionist movement. Here is the

       Rant incoming:
Until recently it has been rare to find someone who has any interest in politics let alone realises the problem of capitalist democracy and the unarticulated loss of human freedom under the American system. Far too often I see people who are complacent with the system, they complain about it but do not hear and do not think of its alternative without harking back to the "horror stories" of the Soviet Blok. The majority of the people I'm around in my day to day are oblivious to the failings of capitalism and representative democracy. They fail to realize that the reason they have no power or say in government is that our politicians are owned by corporations and given large sums of money to implement policy that fucks the working class and makes them richer. We have no power because of capitalism, all forms of capitalism result in this oligarchical system that pretends to have freedom. Out of all the obvious ways in which capitalism is negative to the human race as a whole I think the most socially detrimental is the spectacle that capitalism makes of relationships. The comodifying of literally anything that can be comodified and the manufacturing of wants. ""In a consumer society, social life is not about living, but about having; the spectacle uses the image to convey what people need and must have. Consequently, social life moves further, leaving a state of "having" and proceeding into a state of "appearing"; namely the appearance of the image."" -Debord
      </p>
      <p>
       Why must we be made to accept dictatorship at school and work? We live in a country that tells everyone we are the most freedom loving country. But authoritarianism is practiced obviously by schools and police and subtlety at work. It's ludicrous that a country of people live under these conditions yet always proclaim to be the freeest and greatest nation on earth. I say, one should not need to be told they are free or live under freedom, truely free countries do not have to do this. And you can claim that we are freer by comparison to many other nations. But shouldn't we always be improving, there should be no civil rights issues in the US anymore, we should not accept authoritarian rules. We should not accept profit wars. We should not accept that we aren't taking care of our people, we need to improve the lives of those living in this nation by bringing collective jobs and abolishkng capitalism, garuntee everyone; education, food, housing, water, clothing, and medical. We should have control in the direction of our lives and give our people the power of absolute democracy. We should help improve the lives of all on an international level as well.

       Authority has no power unless it is given power by the subservient masses.
People today are spineless and mindless.
poeple do what they are told, without question.

       They bend over and take government dictates in the ass.
day, after day, after day.

       Well said, the fear of being eliminated for speaking truth. I am not as brave as some, my story is still coming together...but let me assure you the control structure is very firmly in place. I think that many people just haven't figured out how all the his shit affects them personally. They will. We don't need revolution,we need evolution, and the power structure is actively interfering.

       I guess it's just something I felt the need to do. Someone has to say something or no one will. Ripples in a stream grow larger the more they spread. I hope to cause one of those ripples.

       Keep rippling....I was wondering because if was something specific that triggered this, maybe it could be useful to reach others. I poke a lot of people out here in meatspace, give little truthdrops here and there....I was hoping for a new thing to use. But thanks for answering.

       No problem. 
If you want something a little deeper though, I guess I could say that this country needs a real hero. And I want to give that hero, whoever he or she may be, the courage to fight. This might not be a fairytale, but real heroes still exist. They're just hidden.

       Real heroes do exist, unfortunately we put them in Leavenworth and exile them in airports. What we need is a evolution of ethics...everybody comes clean,takes responsibility, dishes dirt and gets removed from office. Next. 
And way moar people to realize exactly how screwed we are....

       It's stupid to not inform people about the other options avalible to them. We should be telling everyone who will listen how the current system will cause us to fail, and what their options are after that. If we don't, countless people will be lost not knowing what to do after the collapse of our job system, and economy.

       People are far too concerned with chasing dollars and possessions they think will bring them happiness to listen. Major hardships have to occur to snap them out of their comfortable lifestyle. Just my opinion.

       I'm prepared if the shit hits the fan, but I don't live my life counting on it. Every generation thinks the world is going to end, it seldom does.

       The point of my whole post is to say that we truly have to do SOMETHING. Anything. Sitting and waiting won't get us anywhere but to the guillotine. 
As much as I'd love to ignore that I see the bad in this country, I'm involved now. And I can't back out silently.

       Keep an eye on it but don't live your life waiting for collapse. That's a waste of you time and effort. Enjoy the world as it is and don't expect it to change over night.

       Nope.
And even if I was, the young who speak these words are the ones who are free, uncorrupted, and innocent. They have more fight in their hearts than any soldier we will ever bear witness to.
