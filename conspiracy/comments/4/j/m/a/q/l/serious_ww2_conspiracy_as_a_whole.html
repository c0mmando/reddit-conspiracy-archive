        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>[SERIOUS] (interested for historical reasons only, cause I love history, especially when we get it wrong)</p>

<p>What does <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> think about this theory, or collection the collection of theories surrounding WW2? Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hitler was made out to be the Villain when evidence suggests otherwise / pro country / people / economy / animals. </li>
<li>There&#39;s evidence that supports he wanted the Jews relocated. They had infiltrated all aspects of government, and, as a way to avoid any further detrimental actions against the state-- he motioned to have them removed (not killed).</li>
<li>Polish atrocities against the Germans, leading to invasion.</li>
<li>No evidence exists of a mass extermination.</li>
<li>No evidence exists proving large gas chambers / cremation ovens existed nor had the capability of that kind of output</li>
<li>Hitler, on several occasions sought to acquire peace before, and during all conflicts.</li>
<li>RUSSO/GERMAN pact, and Russia&#39;s invasion of Poland, not Germany&#39;s (it was done at their request, though) - Russia backs out of this agreement later
...this is one of those things where the conspiracy seems extraordinarily real, it&#39;s just a HUGE amount of info to track.</li>
</ul>

<p>My grandfather fought in WW2, he told stories about the Germans, and how they always seemed to ask the Allied Troops about when they were going after Russia, and how they were the bigger problem. He never really had anything bad to say about the Germans, other than the warfare, obviously. He also was there at Dachau shortly (days) after its liberation. He believed that he saw gas chambers, but I doubt his story. How would any <em>grunt</em> know for sure? </p>

<p>What do you think? What else is there to discuss in this aspect that may have been overlooked? I always wondered why no one connected the 42 attempts on Hitler&#39;s life -- if he was such a good guy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Hitler removed the Jews from power in Germany and restored the German economy to robust health, the Jews collectively declared war on Germany. They actually published a written declaration of war. Now, as we all know, Jews never do anything directly -- they manipulate the goyim into doing it for them. That&#39;s how they operate. So why did WW2 really begin? The goyim in Britain were manipulated into believing that there was no other option but to go to war with Germany. This was a lie, of course. Hitler had no intention of ever invading Britain or interfering with the British Empire. His concern was the Jewish-led communists in Russia, who he rightly perceived as the greatest threat to world peace and freedom. So war began, just as the Jews wanted it to begin. Englishmen and Americans fought and died for their warmongering purposes, as they had done in WW1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every claim you&#39;ve made has plenty of holes in it. Plenty of evidence of gas chambers exists, that one was a blatant lie if anything. I don&#39;t think anybody believes Hitler was an overall good person, maybe that he had good intentions, he was a good person only to the people he liked. Any sort of Polish atrocity, which I&#39;m actually completely unaware of so feel free to fill me in, definitely pales in comparison to any actions Germany may have taken in retribution, and it&#39;s expected that they be ignored when such greater misdeeds occurred, especially since they were done by the losing side. Mass extermination definitely took place, it&#39;s clear simply looking at the numbers of people shipped into the camps and comparing them with the people that were liberated, these people didn&#39;t just disappear off the face of the Earth.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t quite care about Jews, or Hitler, or the Holocaust as a whole, but it&#39;s ridiculous to make these claims which aren&#39;t backed by any solid evidence whatsoever.</p>

<p>So did you, hence why it&#39;s ironic. Just because it&#39;s in the history books, doesn&#39;t make it &quot;evidence&quot;. Couple that with any disagreeing with the official &quot;evidence&quot; can land you in jail in Europe and other countries, leads many (including myself) to doubt the validity of said &quot;evidence&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s not the reason that law was enacted, the Holocaust was one of the biggest atrocities in human history and people outright saying it didn&#39;t happen contrary to evidence is one of the most offensive things a person on Earth can do, if anything warrants being called offensive it&#39;s that.

    <div class="md"><p>yea, and to be fair, and just to say...I&#39;m not making any claims as though they are 100% the case, I&#39;m information here I&#39;ve simply come across and posted, thus, asking for a discussion. That&#39;s it. Sure, there&#39;s holes in the theories, that&#39;s why they&#39;re just that- theories. There is evidence on BOTH sides of the argument. But, as Putin_loves_cats pointed out, just because it&#39;s in a history book doesn&#39;t make it fact, or even evidence. We&#39;ve found that out quite a bit. It&#39;s written by the victors. That&#39;s why we have places like this where we can talk about it openly to see what&#39;s what, and to form <em>opinions</em> because realistically, no one will ever know anyway. That&#39;s the lure of conspiracies. The fun of the hunt for truth. Again, there is basis for question. You can question the reason the war started, how it was started, and by whom. There&#39;s plenty of information to show that Hitler did what he could to avoid way, quite a bit, actually. The RUSSO / GERMAN pact did exist. There isn&#39;t anything to show there were ovens and gas chambers-- not by a long shot. They didn&#39;t have the capability. They even broke it down mathematically by what would have been necessary just to operate a crematorium needed to output that kind of deathtoll, and it doesn&#39;t match up. It&#39;s highly unlikely 6 million died. Another number? Sure. Even the Red Cross never found anything nefarious happening. </p>

<p>MY point is that, and i&#39;m not attacking you or your comment, is there is enough to question the war particulars. That&#39;s all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just really hate how you listed those things out as though they were certain facts. If they were theories you should have said so.</p>

<p>As far as proof of gas chambers here you go. <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/american/skeptic-magazine/skeptic-12.html">http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/american/skeptic-magazine/skeptic-12.html</a></p>

<p>You can&#39;t use math to disprove it considering nobody knows the exact number that died from those specific means, but a Nazi gas chamber or crematorium didn&#39;t have to follow any regulations limiting how many people could go in and other stuff like that, they just threw people in there and popped the switch, you can&#39;t do math with so many unknown variables. 4.3 million victims names are listed in the Yad Vashem, family members of living individuals that many still go to mourne, and these are all documented individuals, they didn&#39;t just disappear off the face of the Earth.</p>

<p>As far as the Red Cross stuff you&#39;re trying to cite, you&#39;re completely misrepresenting the information that exists. The Red Cross has stated that it would have been impossible for them to even gather such data considering their extremely limited access to CC&#39;s and that they never even attempted to get such data. <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0031322X.1978.9969431#/doi/abs/10.1080/0031322X.1978.9969431">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0031322X.1978.9969431#/doi/abs/10.1080/0031322X.1978.9969431</a></p>

<p>As far as the pact and all I don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re attempting to argue so I&#39;ll leave that be, it isn&#39;t an obviously false claim like these.</p>

There&#39;s evidence that supports he wanted the Jews relocated. They had infiltrated all aspects of government, and, as a way to avoid any further detrimental actions against the state-- he motioned to have them removed (not killed)&quot; </p>

<p>The above is where many conspiracy theory people fail in understanding WW2.   Every aspect of the rise and the movement of the Hitler was psyop on the World.</p>

<p>The German movement just prior to the Rise of Hitler was a genuine movement to better a starving nation- one man did not build this overnight as history pushes, a nation was rising out of the ashes of oppression and out of the grips of the starvation and the sanctions. Like every fucking real movement by real people, the Shadow men came and infiltrated the German peoples successful moment to free themselves from injustice and poverty. And just like  every modern day nation that dares to free itself from this kind of oppression, Germany was infiltrated from the top ranks, a stooge puppet named Hitler was installed, and they would use him to crush the hope of millions while finding a way to bring a war to the World. They would build Israel, and they would kill germans and Jews a like while turning them against each other. The entire top command of the German nazi army was Zionist Jew families of the Thule secret order who cared not who they slaughtered Jew or German, but rather who obeyed them and their sickness they unleashed on Germany.</p>

<p>This unfortunately is the real story that we too often see today happening to nations all around us. You don&#39;t get to make the cover of Time magazine unless you are the shit they are selling as part of the psyop on the World.</p>

<p>The Rise of Hitler was a zionist psyop, he was their man from day one. He curtailed a great powerful recovery that Germany was embarking on, But the shadow Zionists who puppet the world leaders installed their false leader and collapsed Germany so they could set up a New Order of the region.</p>

<p>There are no real heroes who get to be at top positions in ANY nation on this planet. If you are in a leadership position, you are a stooge of few powerful political handlers controlling the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Three key things that stand out as evidence for Hitler being a willful Zionist puppet.</p>

<p>1.He comes to power by minority government coalition, then through a false flag, later a corrupt industry political push, he was appointed Chancellor. Not by the will of the people. There was no democratic process. This is very telling as by any means necessary, Hitler was given power. The same shit we witnessed in Ukraine in 2014. They mounted some industry asshole who couldn&#39;t even form a majority government who came to power in coup etat false flag. It doesn&#39;t matter what people want when Zionists want to fuck up a country. </p>

<p>2.Who financed Hitler? That should tell you who he worked for.Funny how Germany was under heavy sanctions until puppet Hitler comes to power and the Zionist bank of England is ready to finance his mission. Of course, just like the EU and The IMF were suddenly ready to give billions to Ukraine of the coup etat to finance that bloody civil war.</p>

<p>3.Haavara Agreement signed by  Hitler, to send German assets to Palestine, in anticipation of th would be Israel state long planned out by the zionists. </p>

<p>She didn&#39;t say anything else more about it other than that.  I got a sense that her family didn&#39;t agree with how the western world saw the war.

    <div class="md"><p>When I think &quot;No, it can&#39;t happen again. No one will ever fall for it and do the bidding of their governments by being drafted&quot; I imagine that people thought the same thing during the war. The population was probably a lot smaller and still had its very minute percentage of free-thinkers. Now that the internet is around today we think there is a much larger amount of free-thinking individuals who&#39;ve seen through the brainwashing, but it is probably still the same minute percentage as there was during WW2 given the larger population now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a valid point too- I do agree that since the birth of the internet, obviously information-- of all kinds, wanted and unwanted, is available 24/7 -- which is a great thing, and a terrible one, considering the disinformation and bullshit that&#39;s out there that can make any investigation a pain the ass. I think we do, if only marginally, have a slightly higher amount of &quot;awakened thinkers&quot; as to what may be going on in our past, present, and affecting our future-- like you said, the population is different, in size, so it very well could be the same. We were so blindly to the cause, much like 9/11, that I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve stopped (in the case of WW2) to really take a look back and go....huh....yea that was odd</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hitler and Germany were revered by royalty, bankers and industrialists, and was backed by them. The main objective was war with the USSR as they were terrified by the implications of socialism and communism. Note the false flag fire at the Reichstag blamed on the Communists. Other objectives were to capture gold and oil reserves of South Eastern and Eastern Europe. In addition, to gather war prisoners to work in the labour camps owned by Germany&#39;s backers which it too had a stake in it. </p>

<p>It seems that the Jews that were captured were common people and their belongings were seized. If so, then the Jews in Germany who were part and in league with the royalists, bankers and industrialists sold their own people down the river and got a slice of that seizure. Its likely that they too brainwashed their own people to shift the blame to someone and thus hiding their involvement in the sell out. While on the topic of Jews, there were Jews that also served in German army even during WW2. </p>

<p>The allies invaded Germany to protect their &quot;investments&quot; at the closing stages of the war as the USSR was advancing in it after facing 80% of the forces with the allies 20%. After the war the royalists, bankers and industrialists continued their campaign against the USSR with NATO and Operation Paperclip which many Germans both in military and science were transported to the USA and some even made it into the ranks of NATO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) if that was the case, why the pact-- then? (Russo / German)</p>

<p>2) I highly doubt anyone of value was seized, like you said, it&#39;s mostly common people whose assets were then taken. That I do not doubt at all, nor do I doubt that the RBI&#39;s sold their people own people out. I can definitely see how they could be brainwashed, its seemingly easy to do-- so more or less, the opinion here is that Hitler was funded, put in place, and the agenda played out. So then a majority of the conspiracy following his acts in order to quell the notion of war wasn&#39;t accurate, or didn&#39;t happen? And if so, what about the above question? It does seem like there would be some holes in that as well.  (I know that Jews also fought in ww2, especially on that of Hitler&#39;s army, more so, it was more than just that too. Hit sought Alliances elsewhere...but and that brings up my next question...)</p>

<p>3) If that was the case (above) - how come there&#39;s video of Hitler meeting with Arab nations for backing? His army wasn&#39;t as white washed as we believe it to be. For the hatred that the Zionists seemed to have for that region, why would that take place, other than a massive ropeadope? (Which again I find funny that he quoted Germany and Saudi Arabia as working together to fight the jews)</p>

<p>4) Its clear to see that an agenda was played out, but I don&#39;t know that I believe that Hitler was apart of it (I may just need more education). Obviously the PTB continued their advancement towards the USSR and absorbed much of Germany&#39;s resources in the process...my grandfather used to comment that, while guarding POW&#39;s, the Germans (who were very friendly, apparently) wanted to know when the allies were going to take out Russia)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The pact, if there was one, was a pack to be broken. Its very likely that the NKVD knew of Germany&#39;s plan for war against the USSR. Poland was right in between the USSR and Germany so perhaps even if the Soviets knew of the German plan to wage war on them they wanted to slow the German advance into Poland. Poland was later the zone whereby at least German Army Group North invaded the USSR. The others were Army Group Centre and Army Group South. It could well be that all three Army Groups began from Poland. </p>

<p>Germany was producing military equipment en mass which by itself does not say such. The nature of the military equipment was mostly for invasion and not for defensive purposes eg. defensive lines. Someone implemented the plan in Germany for mass production of military equipment and Hitler was creating boogeymen like the fire at the Reichstag, blamed on the Communists. Later the war in France, which interestingly had been Germany&#39;s archenemy historically, and the arrest of the Jews which was palatable to the German people. In a way he was playing domestic politics with the populace - political approval. </p>

<p>There were Jews in North Africa and in the Middle East the Arabs seem to have been delegated to do like the Germans did in Eastern and South Eastern Europe. That is to say capture the common Jewish populace whilst leaving &quot;key&quot; Jewish figures at peace and cease their belongings. One point to introduce is that some common Jews also held gold British Pound coins at least that was the case for some of them living in South Eastern Europe so along with belongings and cash - there was gold. In Poland the Germans burned corpses which could have been of both Polish and Jewish civilians and harvested their gold fillings. So along with gold captured from governments they also captured gold from civilians along with other belongings. It was the Germans that supported (maybe even created) the predecessors of Islamists during WW2.</p>

<p>Hitler&#39;s speeches roused the German populace to believe sentiments like themselves being the Aryan race, which is quite suspect since the Aryans were known to be masters of horse riding and as such directs to the peoples living from the Far Eastern Steppes to the Crimean Steppe not the Germans who were living in the forests for the better part of human history. Similarly with the Atlantean theory with engineering and technology did not develop until the Middle Ages there, while other civilisations had it for most of human history. Hitler&#39;s sentiment to fight &#39;the Jew&#39; was not aimed at any of the centres of Jewry. </p>

<p>Very interesting that the German POW&#39;s that your grandfather guarded were waiting for support from England, US and the other allies. News as such does not go around military circles for the sake of it they received some kind of message. </p>

Is it far more likely it was people just trying to upset the order, or, were they financed or influenced by TPTB? As things got rolling, did they just want to try and take him down from the inside? Some of the more famous cases, I don&#39;t think they were Jewish connected...(but really I&#39;m not sure)</p>
