       From pointing out the secret points of society, r/conspiracy has taken a few steps backwards. Its users deprive each other of actual information and reduce each other to arcane arguements about gender roles.

      <p>
       Did you ever think about the conservative and biblical narrative that's being pushed here? Maybe, just maybe this could be a means to segrigate the poor? Men vs Women, Straight vs gay. Maybe we should be finding common ground to change the world for everyone. Not attack one another for looking to equality in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone previous said "this whole do what you want as long as it doesnt hurt anyone" being dangerous for communities is hogwash. The state tells us what we can amd can not regaurdless of what the people want, why do you think we can't smoke marijuana?  Is it really bad for the community for me to smoke pot?

       In addition, by effectively doubling the labour force, we have seen stagnant wages since the widescale introduction of feminism. Note that feminism - or female empowerment - was first promoted by Bernays in the 1920's with his "Torches for freedom" slogan. Modern 60's feminism was heavily promoted by the Rockefellers, among others.

       If you mention anything in terms of social progress like homosexuality or anything like that you immediately get downvoted. That's because it is considered 'controversial'. The reality is that american culture is being reprogrammed by TPTB through media and exported throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Western cultures are being reprogrammed to destroy themselves. The 'do anything you want if you dont hurt anyone' mentality doesn't help communities. An individual is part of a community whether he/she likes it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cultural reprogramming is becoming successful. Things like transgendarism, homosexuality, etc are very powerful at destroying traditional communities. The more fractured a community is, the weaker they are. The western person is becoming increasingly uncivilized, thats why the governments are becoming more oppressive at the same time. If people become uncivilized then the government can intervene and civilize people. The people themselves can't tell whats right or wrong anymore. They have no religion, no culture and fractured communities. This is important if you want a linked world, because the borders are already blurred, the only obstacle is culture and religion. All cultures or religions that oppose the western lifestyle are considered backwards for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       China and Russia aren't exactly doing the same thing to their societies in terms of 'social progress', they're actually doing the opposite.

       So because I was born gay, and people are no longer able to beat the living fuck out of me for it, or fire me for it, or in most places refuse me service because of it, there's some conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy was and is between politicians and churches, to keep one segment of society down and incite hate against them. Clearly by you posting this, their "conspiracy" has worked on you. #sheeple et al.

       I work hard. My partner and I own a house. He works hard too. I don't want you to be my friend, I don't expect you to start loving "the homosexuals" just leave us alone and let us live our lives.

       Coming from the guy who's posting pictures of his junk to Reddit asking if he has an STD, I'd say you're no stranger to promiscuity. Just because you're bitter that you haven't been able to find love doesn't mean everyone else is conspiring to hurt you, and keep you down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, if you ask almost any straight single guy if he would want to have sex with 200 attractive girls in a year, he would say yes. Men are promiscuous, it's not just a gay thing it's a gender thing. Some of us settle down into monogamy, some of us are serial monogamists, and some men are just out to play the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, I think you have to just be a troll out for attention.

       You are a sheep and a cancer to society. No point in arguing with somebody so asleep. Things like feminism, homosexuality, transgenderism are created to destabilize that which is at the heart of a strong society - the community and the family. I have no doubt that one day you will realize this.

       Feminism has run amuck unchecked, I'll agree with you there. I think it was needed in earlier times to secure basic rights for women, but in many ways, it has made life harder for everyone. There are some ideas of merit within the overall movement, like property rights &amp; equal pay. What I see however, is this strange culture emerging from it which assumes all men are the same, and women should automatically discount them as valuable partners. It's been taken too far &amp; has served to dehumanize both genders.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I think it's up to the individual to discern the value of mass messages in our culture. I see some of my feminist girlfriends out in the world killin it. They are blazing paths for themselves like crazy! However, time and again, they invariably tell me they just wanna chill with some awesome dude. It's interesting to me that some of my most successful friends absolutely destroy one relationship after another playing the "I-don't-need-a-man" game. They've taken the "battle" too far.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, I have guy friends who automatically assume all women are the same &amp; similarly shoot themselves in the foot with preemptive defensiveness. They would also be better served with the application of some discernment.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO, everybody needs to calm the fuck down. lol. Lots of women need to understand that having a competent partner doesn't diminish their independence or success. Similarly, many men need to realize that we are all bombarded with this message, but that doesn't mean everyone thinks that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, my first role is in my home. I take care of my SO &amp; he takes care of me. We are both creative, inventive, strong partners &amp; both bring value to the table. It's incredibly rewarding. It's also pretty hilarious when our single friends say things like, "I wish I had that. I don't see how you guys do it."

       Makes me giggle (knowingly) every time.

       I think feminism is what has destroyed the economy. Women fought for their rights to equal work, and now equal pay, but what this has really done is force families into requiring a dual income to simply survive. Feminism has destroyed the stay at home parents ability to stay at home. Very few can live off a lone income without taking out loans or going to school online. I really hate it because I enjoy raising my child, and that's what I want him to be, MY child. I don't want him raised by a daycare, I don't want other people teaching him what's right and wrong, and I especially hate the idea of getting a job, to pay for daycare, so you can go to your job, to pay for daycare.

       If you live like they did back when women didn't work, you'd be fine too. This is:
- 1 car, that you saved up for (no debt)
- man works 50-60 hours per week
- max two weeks vacation
- own no TVs, use your neighbour's tv to watch one program per week
- one landline phone per house, maybe shared with a neighbour 
- repair clothes instead of throwing them out
- never go out to eat
- never use a credit card
- do work around the house yourself
- spend days canning and preserving

       That would be the ideal and what I wanted at a younger age as well. But as the cookie crumbles that is not reality. But yes.working to pay for daycare...that is what you do on a minimum wage job. It is a sad thing that while we got the right to equal pay, we now also have to work as the consumerexploitationclass figured out we were making some.

       I would guess, from that statement, that you are not a parent. A child will pick up "point &amp; shoot" and simulated projections of flight paths, well before they can perform the lexicographical processes necessary for reading.

       Point was that a lack of focused and interactive parenting and creatively encouraging kids to love science, instead focusing on pass times with less educational benefit, has had more of a limiting impact on children from the west reaching their full potential.

       I would argue that there are some instances where you can show that social pressures, legal threats, or some other form of manipulation (even legal) resulted in a woman getting a job that a man also applied for. (I acknowledge the converse is also true, but ignore it for this point.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But now we have so many factors to work with, that it becomes a long discussion on each point, something I don't currently wish to participate in. But, it can still be debated that in some very specific instances, where we have all the available information, "feminism" in some form, stymied or limited the abilities of some specific man (or woman.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't mean that it should be blamed for "men not achieving as much as they once did." That would be disingenuous, even though it can be proven in some specific instances.

       Women's natural loving instincts have been undermined using the following mantras (cited from Myrna Blythe - Spin Sisters (2004):
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Men can no longer be trusted. Using the Lifetime Network as an example, Blyth concluded "all men are 1) unfaithful rats 2) abusive monsters 3) dishonest scumbags, or 4) all of the above. Women on the other hand were...flinty achievers who triumph despite the cavemen who...want to keep them in their place." (62-63)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Women are victims by virtue of their sex.  Blyth says the media sends "one message loud and clear. Because we are women, we remain victims in our private lives, at work, in society as a whole." (156) Thus women must have a sense of grievance, entitlement and rebellion. The same tactic was used to manipulate Jews, Blacks, workers and gays.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Women should be selfish. "Liberation and narcissism have merged," Blyth says. Leisure now means, "time for yourself, spent alone, or perhaps with one's girlfriends but definitely without spouse and kids...Endless articles preached the new feminist gospel, that indulging yourself is an important part of being a healthy, well adjusted woman." (65)
        </p>
       </li>

         Sex is not reserved for love and marriage. Magazines like Glamour and Cosmopolitan  urge young women to "put out on their first date,"ogle men openly" and be an athlete in bed. There is no discussion of marriage or family. (160) Such women can't trust a man enough to surrender themselves in love.

         Self-fulfillment lies in career success and not husband and family. "The social rewards of holding down a job are critical to one's sense of dignity and self worth," Betty Friedan pontificated. In fact, "most work is deeply ordinary," Blyth observes (35-36.)

       Playboy has aimed a similar message at men. You don't need to be married to have fun, wife and kids are a bore.

       Bait on. Economic dependency is never a good thing. Especially when we have so social structure that will assist. When any one man or woman can not engage in actively choosing this down activities meals friends....it devolves quickly to dependence. No one should feel their life depends on another person's permission. So yeah. Let's work on mutual respect and not.more stupid divisive bullshit. But please do share how has economic and physical abuse played a.role in your life, or did someone just get done on some he-man woman hating website and feel the need to share? the facts are our society in every way teaches us that everyone is replaceable. That is the problem.

When any one person or entity can make the rules for all others in a group you have tyranny.

       Before, you were seen as the people uniquely capable of carrying out the most important task required for the continuation of civilization. In exchange, a man would devote his entire life, blood sweat and tears,  to you and your mutual children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you're worker #37642 in a billion dollar corporation, maybe some guy uses you to warm his penis because he doesn't see any higher or deeper purpose in relationship with you, and fears that marriage will ruin his life if you are a less than ethically perfect  person. Fewer children, more consumerism, dying civilization. That's the real problem with feminism.

       Nice how you assume what I wanted...FYI...unlike many women I know I have not modified my body to bait a breadwinner, raised my first born alone as his rapist father was not around and still manage to take care of my dying father who has a history of failed relationships...again..maybe if he hadn't been an abusive asshole who quite literally abandoned us, I would have had a.better life. Again. Any relation ship that depends on one person being in power is in healthy for the person with none. And when I quit hearing jokes about how if I had put out more he wouldn't have had to take it will I take your bullshit serious. Have a great day, and try to not get yer dick stuck in any strange holes attached so silicone....

Some of us have enough ethics to take care of the abusive dying though, so while I am sure your sexdriven brain will have a hard time with this....I am a live in caretaker.

       Again being raped and choosing to fuck someone are two different things. Understood? Also I stated I had raised him alone, no complaint there at all. By the way, he is a God guy, respects women, Reddit and told me about redpill...something something tards....by the way. I raised my kid without fucking random men for rent, or food stamps. So maybe it is just that you guys have been going for the fake ass eyecandy and ignoring that which you call homely or humble.

       I get more of a vibe of anger based on rejection by women from most people who trumpet this line of "reasoning".  Da_Holy_Pope's comments read like a textbook case sour grapes and creating a narrative that vilifies half of humanity in order to explain his own feelings of inadequacy.  It's possible he's just a misogynist cultural dinosaur, but I doubt 99% of the people who think like this have a lot of relevant experience.
      </p>

       My point is that I doubt "going for the fake ass eyecandy" has ever been much of an option for most of the people who spew ridiculously antiquated and resentful tripe like this.
