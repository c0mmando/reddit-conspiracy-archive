<p>She goes on about how the system is rigged to cause cognitive dissonance on purpose. Not only is mindless obedience praised, but they also put students in situations that cause frustration and distraction. for instance, combining dozens of small schools to create a mega school in an area. Purposely mixing inner city kids with rural kids (cause cultural/mental conflict). Lowering standards and removing information etc. her father was a Freemason. She has printed off secret handbooks on the subject of destroying education and creating slaves (she had been given offers to purchase her original gov copy for thousands if not millions).</p>

<p>This is a very dry documentary series, but the info in it makes sense, and highly interesting. It actually scary to see how this is already implemented in the system. She was active in the 60s, so one could imagine how crazy this has become today.</p>

<p>(Edit) Not necessarily about Rockefellers specifically, but you can see how it is set up by the elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an interesting excerpt I found while researching this issue:</p>

<p>John D. Rockefeller, to improve his public image, poured millions into education.  Around 1902, he funded yet another organization, the General Education Board, to influence education throughout the country, but especially in the South. </p>

<p>The Board’s mentality is revealed in a letter from Frederick Taylor Gates, a Baptist minister and the GEB’s director, to the other members of the Board.  As you read this, please savor the astonishing arrogance and paternalism.  A century later, these traits still permeate our Education Establishment:</p>

<p>&quot;In our dreams, we have limitless resources and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding bands. The present education conventions fade from their minds, and unhampered by tradition, we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive rural folk. We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning, or men of science. We have not to raise up from among them authors, editors, poets or men of letters. We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians, statesmen, of whom we have an ample supply.</p>

<p>The task we set before ourselves is very simple as well as a very beautiful one, to train these people as we find them to a perfectly ideal life just where they are. So we will organize our children and teach them to do in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imperfect way, in the homes, in the shops and on the farm.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that libertarians are tools? anyone with a brain knows it, libertarianism was funded by Rothschild, all it is about is repeating the words freedom and liberty often enough to get believed by gullible idiots, and then make those gullible idiots support the destruction of their own social safety net. It&#39;s ballsy, but you&#39;ve got to be a fucking tool to fall for that shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the delayed response. That&#39;s an interesting standpoint, which I have not entertained much. I identify with the calls for sound money and non-interventionism which libertarians usually stand for. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea to disassemble social security systems altogether, but smaller units instead of centralization, do not sound bad in my ears.</p>

<p>What are you calling for?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The exact opposite. sound money is bullshit when the vast majority of the population is in debt: borrowed paper money? repay gold! makes no sense.</p>

<p>Second libertarians are the worst of the worst, in an economic depression they talk about cutting social safety programs, they are literally talking about attacking the poorest of the poor at their weakest, I don&#39;t understand how libertarians can be accepted in polite society.</p>

<p>And lastly Libertarianism itself is the love child of Rockefeller and Mises, there is a reason the very wealthy love libertarianism, an ideology based on cutting all social programs in a depression is litteraly an ideology that prepares the ground for fascism, all the time spouting as many &quot;liberties&quot; and &quot;freedoms&quot; in their speeches, just like the good old southern democrats who defended slavery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I understand what you are saying with &quot;the exact opposite&quot;.</p>

<p>I completely agree with your points. However, I believe there is slightly more nuance to the initial points. I think the sound money argument is about relieving the central banking system of it&#39;s power, while I agree that it would be a catastrophe if currently held loans were suddenly bound to &quot;sound money&quot;. I don&#39;t fall for repeated calls for &quot;liberties&quot; and &quot;freedoms&quot;, there should be well reasoned arguments to support decisions, not people shouting and waiving their arms. </p>

<p>I believe limited government that works as a servant to the people is the way to go, but that is not quite what we see in western governments today. One example being the federalization of EU, and facade politics drawing attention to the wrong issues, which is fueled by the MSM which is owned by powerful private interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you see, when we&#39;re talking generalities, I can get along with most libertarians. It&#39;s when we get down to concrete measures that I truly believe libertarian ideology stands for the exact opposite of what it talks about in general terms.</p>

<p>Small government is a call for more power in the private sector, it&#39;s the good old war of government on one side and private sector corporations and mega-entities on the other.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a civilian, I don&#39;t own major corporations, therefore I have absolutely no interest in giving more power to the private sector (and by the way the government has been weak for decades, strong governments were Lincoln, FDR, Kennedy and the likes, what we have today are governments so weak they get manhandled by corporations, just look at the TTIP). As a non &quot;0,01%er&quot; my only interest is in having a government for the people and by the people, that is strong enough to stand up to google, facebook, monsanto, etc.</p>

<p>I have absolutely no need for more powerful corporations, they already run the fucking world, but that is what libertarianism wants.
How can that be reconciled with more &quot;personal freedoms&quot;? The only way Libertarianism can be internally consistent is if &quot;personal freedoms&quot; means &quot;personal freedoms of the 0,01%&quot; (or oligarchy, or whatever terms you prefer).</p>
