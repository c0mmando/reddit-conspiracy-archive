        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Central Bankers/International Oligarchs actually PRIVATELY OWN the whole money supply of every country in the world, and any money the People earn from their jobs comes from a loan borrowed from the Central Bankers/International Oligarchs, and those loans all have to be paid back with interest. </p>

<p>The BIGGEST problem in the world is that the Central Bankers/International Oligarchs are printing/creating the money privately as their OWN money and then lending with interest it to all governments in the world. Further, the Central Bankers/International Oligarchs will send the US military to attack any country that tries to print/create their own money, as they did with Germany(WW2), Iraq, Libya, and now Syria and Russia.</p>

<p>All the money in every money supply in every country worldwide is money the Central Bankers/International Oligarchs first printed/created as their OWN money, and then lent it to the government or corporations thus creating the WHOLE money supply, therefore, all the money in existence gets paid back to the Central Bankers/International Oligarchs. Thus, it can easily be seen how they now own over half the worlds hard assets, like the food, water, oil producing land and precious metals, because they as this money is being continually paid back to the Central Bankers/International Oligarchs, they buy up the world’s hard assets with it, and once they own it they don’t sell it, because their plan is to use their OWNERSHIP of the money supply to transfer all the hard assets/real wealth to themselves by exchanging their fake-worth toilet paper money for it. Then they will then crash the fake-worth toilet paper money so it becomes worthless, and the People will then be forced to become the slaves of the Central Bankers/International Oligarchs or die, because they will own all food, water, oil producing land and the People will not own any of it. </p>

<p>They are using this unlimited wealth to not only make the People their slaves but also to actually KILL the People. The Central Bankers/International Oligarchs do this because the are Jews who follow the satanic verses in the Talmud, and nothing causes psychopathy/fanaticism like religion does. Further, since they own the cancer industry, they are intentionally giving the People cancer, with Geo Engineering/Chemtrail Aluminum in the air, pesticides in the GMO food, Nagalase in the vaccines, Fluoride and other chemicals in the water. They also want to destroy the sovereignty of countries with open borders so that unreasonable, uncivilized, violent illegals and terrorists can stream into the country and cause chaos and break the country by breaking the Welfare systems, and they also created ISIS and got caught giving them weapons and and medical treatment in Israel. They are also trying to make the People hate the Russians who are a fine Democratic people the exact same as Americans and Europeans.</p>

<p>The Democrats and the ESTABLISHMENT Republicans (NOT the non-Establishment Republicans) believe that they need the government to protect them, so they keep trying to give the government, which is completely bribed/owned/controlled by the Central Bankers/International Oligarchs, EVEN MORE power, when the government/Central Bankers/International Oligarchs are the very thing that is making them poor, enslaving them, taking away their Freedom, and trying to setup a One World Government with the TTP and TTIP, which makes sovereign countries subordinate and the slaves of the Global Corporations and the Central Banks, such as the Federal Reserve Bank, the Bank Of International Settlements, and the International Monetary Fund, all of which are privately owned by Central Bankers/International Oligarchs, who want to fold all of them into ONE central bank where they will continue to preserve their PRIVATE ownership of the Worldwide money supply.</p>

<p>The People are TOTALLY being had because Constitution clearly MANDATES that the OWNERSHIP of the money supply MUST be the People’s. The Congress is supposed to print/create the money and lend it to banks and make revenue from the interest as well as be able to print/create ANY amount of money that is need to build infrastructure, schools, social security, clean energy, research into curing cancer, medical advancements, space exploration, and everything else that We as Humans want, but this is not happening because the People don’t have OWNERSHIP of the money supply.</p>

<p>We must take this Highest Power On Earth, the power to print/create the money back to Congress, same way President Andrew Jackson did before the Federal Reserve Act signed by Woodrow Wilson in 1913 gave the monopoly on printing/creating and then lending it to governments to a small group of individuals who happen to be Jews.</p>

<p>You need to make sure and work on <em>your</em> awakening, however.  If you&#39;re going to give up on the rest of the world (and I understand and don&#39;t entirely blame you or anyone who thinks this way - this planet has gone to shit to a great extent anyway), then at least make sure and don&#39;t give up on YOURSELF.</p>

<p>You may not be able to change the world, but you can indeed still change <em>yourself</em> - how <em>you</em> think, how <em>you</em> act, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the movies telling you that.  Don&#39;t listen to the movies or propaganda.  They&#39;re there to lie to you.</p>

<p>Drone technology exists right now and that&#39;s as far as TPTB have currently gotten.  That alone isn&#39;t enough to take out the citizenry because those drones still need/require human operators - human operators with spouses and kids and cousins and extended family members that they&#39;re not willing to shoot and kill.</p>

<p>TPTB <em>can</em> very much overtake the citizenry.  Yes.  However, the citizenry have the capacity to prevent that from happening still if, as I said above, we put down all the idiotic indoctrination we&#39;ve been force fed to believe and we come together as one people against the tyranny and manipulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you believe that just because the current rigged scam collapses the actual Internet and human productivity will also collapse?  Humans will still want to create and work, and they will still have needs.  </p>

<p>The Internet will still be there, as will humans.  The difference between this crash and 1929 is that we will all be linked in a global communications network which allows us to circumvent any company or government while doing business.  Cryptocurrencies ensure that every step is executable from user to user without any permission necessary.  </p>

<p>Before the Internet and cryptocurrency, JP Morgan collapsing would have instantly halted almost all international trade and research.  Now that is no longer the case, and will be increasingly less the case as we move forward.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="comment mb-3 ml-6" data-depth="6" data-id="d34gijd">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">3</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/americanpegasus.html">americanpegasus</a> 2016-05-13</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I understand.  It&#39;s all overwhelming and extremely difficult to understand at first.  Just be patient and rest assured it exists and functions already.  It&#39;s quite amazing that anyone on Earth with access to the Internet has such financial power in their hands, but they do.  </p>

<p>A regular wire transfer depends on the actions of two (or more) institutions who are both trusted by the population and governments to handle money.  International wires are more difficult because they involve several foreign financial institutions who all must approve the money to be moved <em>and</em> exchange it securely using redundant and elaborate systems.  Ultimately though, an individual&#39;s right to move money is dependent on both the bank allowing it, and all governments involved allowing it to happen.  </p>

<p>Cryptocurrency is different.  Every computer running the network has a copy of every transaction ever made, and all the computers are all competing to be the next one who gets to write to that ledger.  They are competing over cryptographic math problems (too hard for a human to solve).  The computer that solves it finds a mathematical solution that incorporates all transactions that people currently want to make, while basing that solution off the mathematical equivalent of every transaction that has ever happened.  Why would they do this?  Because they get rewarded through new currency and transaction fees for their work (which is why it&#39;s called proof-of-work).  This creates not only a way to move money instantly and across the planet, but also an unchangable ledger that everyone can trust without having to trust anyone.  </p>

<p>Modern Cryptocurrency was born with Bitcoin in 2008 and for the first time we had money that could be sent instantly across the planet, for free (wire transfers cost a lot), and most importantly: with no company, bank, or governments permissions at all.  In fact to stop a Bitcoin transaction you would have to attack and disable the network itself, meaning you would need a supercomputer more powerful than any that exist on Earth.  </p>

<p>Bitcoin had a major flaw though: these transaction records were all public.  Monero solved that in 2014.  </p>

<p>It did so by encrypting the actual ledger itself, while still allowing it to be verifiable.  Now not only could you send money across the planet, instantly, and for free with no one&#39;s permission but also no one will ever know about it unless you tell them.  You account balance cannot be seen by anyone you don&#39;t allow, and your transactions cannot be traced by any government.  </p>

<p>And it does all this without a user needing to trust anyone at all, using some of the most advanced mathematics in the world.  </p>

<p>It can be a very hard thing to understand and for years after I first encountered it I thought it was ridiculous.  But it actually is one of the most significant inventions of the last fifty years.  You can learn more by visiting <a href="/r/Bitcoin">/r/Bitcoin</a> and <a href="/r/Monero">/r/Monero</a> or feel free to ask me.  There are also loads of YouTube videos about it, but beware that to understand the hard math that backs it up you will likely need a phD understanding of cryptography.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you buy monero with USD? Then it is bound to fail as well.</p>

<p>In my mind they own infinite amounts of money = infinite amounts of monero.</p>

<p>Current form of digital currencies produced great solutions but they are not the answer to crisis of uncontrolled money creation.</p>

<p>What we need is a digital currency that:</p>

<p>-Includes universal basic income so  to some extend each member of the society will be taken care of.</p>

<p>-Individuals can form their own communities with their own rules and trade their labour within a system that tracks such labour transactions (block chain).</p>

<p>-It should be resilient agains labour frauds. For example, when somebody spends their wealth to buy labour services from someone else, there needs to be some sort of protection for the buyer.</p>

<p>Successful implementation of above mentioned ideas to digital currencies will be rather hard, but I believe it is not impossible. If I get lots of free time perhaps in couple of years I&#39;ll try to create such a system that permits digital exchange of labour and formation of communities within blockchain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are going to be absolutely thrilled to know there is a finite and limited amount of both Bitcoin and Monero in existence and that can ever exist.  </p>

<p>The tokens can be divided down to much smaller units as the economy of a token grows: Each Monero can be broken down into 1 trillion sub units each, for example.  However what does not change is how many Monero can be generated.  Those variables are set in stone at the beginning of the blockchain and if anyone tries to change them, the majority can just ignore that rogue.  </p>

<p>There are only 21 million Bitcoins that will ever exist, the majority of which (15 million or so) have already been created.  The generation of these slowly trails off to nothing as the years pass.  </p>

<p>As far as Monero, there are 18.4 million initial issue, and a small tail perpetual emission (a few hundred thousand a year).  No matter how many computers compete for them, or how many someone tries to buy with US dollars, there is finite amount and the total in existence can&#39;t be changed.  </p>

<p>The powers that be are welcome to try to buy their way into Monero, but what will happen is they will send the value of each token skyrocketing due to finite amount.  </p>

<p>As far as fairness, there is no more fair system than a cryptocurrency for distribution.  All computers are invited to compete for the money, and only raw power is respected.  There is a floating conversion rate, as there is with all currencies but this is a function of the free market.  </p>

<p>Bottom line: cryptocurrency already has all the features of ideal money, and it exists now.  Some of the most powerful and altruistic intelligence on our planet was behind the creation of it, so instead of trying to reinvent the wheel you would be wise to learn about it and contribute to the movement.  It is still very early for cryptocurrency and if you wanted to be part of the future financial destiny of our planet - well, here&#39;s your chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On one level, it does seem that way, and I can see how and why you would say that.  On another level, however, if you take money and financial contributions out of politics, then the corporate/bank-owned politicians wouldn&#39;t have the ability to manipulate and propagandize the public to anywhere near the extent that is currently the case.  That is how so much of the stupid public continues getting duped anyway.  The masses get so much massive, overwhelming amounts of propaganda thrown at us that many of us eventually just believe whatever these corporate politicians tell us is true.  &quot;Up is down, left is right, and right is wrong, citizen.  Vote for meeee!&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.relatably.com/m/img/meme-happy-crying-face/2607593.jpg">&quot;Yes!!&quot;</a></p>

<p>If we take money out of politics, however, then there&#39;s a much better chance that the corporate owned politicians won&#39;t have as effective a means of manipulating propaganda and their smokescreen will be seen through much more easily by the people - causing much more (comparatively) accurate depictions of who&#39;s really who in office.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> ultimately agree with you that the power to print and create money must go to Congress and out of the private sector where it&#39;s been for so long.  However, the Banksters have very much <em>been</em> in politics since at least as far back as the creation of The Federal Reserve.  That&#39;s how they got <em>in</em> to politics in the first place.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t disagree with that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would also prefer the individuals be from academia or business</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s where you&#39;d run into serious problems again, however, and run right back into the same problem you had in the first place.</p>

<p>This is the thing, brother:  The corporatocracy is pretty much everywhere.  If you try to stipulate that people from academia or business are the &quot;best&quot; ones to get into the Monetary Printing Council (MPC), then what’s going to happen is that corporate money would suddenly start flowing in absolute bushels to THAT sector of society, and you would suddenly start seeing “academics” and people of that ilk making an argument for getting in the MPC that, for some &quot;inexplicable&quot; reason, somehow had TOOOONS of money in advertising dollars funneling into them as they create ads and got attention and all kinds of MSM time pushing for why they should be the next “MPC chairman”.  Next thing you know, they would get in.  And why?  Because that&#39;s the face that&#39;s been plastered all over the MSM and that everyone is now familiar with.</p>

<p>And how was it that they got all that time on the MSM?</p>

<p>Well...remember those corporate money changers we just kicked out of government and kept from donating tons of money to politicians?</p>

<p>Well...they switched their monetary focus and are now pouring all their contributions toward your trusty &quot;academics&quot; and &quot;scientists&quot; that are vying for a position in the MPC now.</p>

<p>And we&#39;re <em>right</em> back in exactly the same shit hole we were in before.</p>

<p>Therefore, NO.  Fuck &quot;academics&quot;.  A huge portion of them are just as bought off as politicians.  It&#39;s just a lot more subtle and not as overt in the case of academics.  Same with &quot;scientists&quot;.  If I had a couple bucks for every &quot;scientific study&quot; or paper or whatever that was heavily influenced by corporate funding, then I’d have a <em>lot</em> of money to my name.</p>

<p>So no.</p>

<p>The standard shouldn&#39;t be &quot;Who&#39;s an academic?” or “Who has some fancy letters behind their name?&quot;  No.  The standard should be &quot;Who&#39;s fucking making SENSE.  Who&#39;s speaking logically?  Who&#39;s not trying to bog down any debate with nonsensical minutia and unintelligible academic jargon?&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;d sooner vote in as the head of the MPC a janitor or a garden worker who speaks simply but who <em>really</em> makes sense, than some &quot;great academic&quot; who just lives in an ivory tower and makes the public go <a href="http://newsimg.ngfiles.com/231000/231290_lol_guy.jpg">woooo</a>, but who’s being funded behind the scenes by the same corporate elite that have ruined this government and this country.</p>

<p>Put the power as much as possible in the hands of the people.</p>

<p>The money would go to banks, as it does now, I would just not have it pre-earmarked, per law to go to a particular sector. If a board member is in real estate development, then you put a stringent limit on how much money can go to that sector, as for the gardener/janitor argument, my concern would be that they would have to have someone &quot;advise&quot; them on the concepts which would say the policies. As for Academics, i didnt mean the Professor Emeritus @ Harvard or Yale, i mean the professor of Economics from a community college or something along those lines, enough to understand and get it, but maybe not enough to manipulate the system</p>

He would subtly and with a humble smile on his face often turned the tables on them and would show the Western establishment to be sorely, sorely lacking in many areas.

    <div class="md"><p>i think that would part of the point, but ultimately its about removing the power of the ability to print money. A independent businessman who owns a bunch of dry cleaners and a local community college finance/economics professor are less likely to be moved into the ranks of the 1% after their 2 year term in a position vs. the professor emeritus of economics at Yale/Harvard,etc. They are more likely to end up the CEO at a defense agency or bank after. If we were to change the rules, we would have to make sure that whoever held that position, held it for a minimal amount of time and then also minimize the benefit afterwards, but that should be in all politics.

<p>Certainly, correct, and agreed.  This is the very reason why the last thing you’d want is to allow corporate money to invest itself into those individuals vying for office in the MPC.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, but it’s easy to see how an offer for a massive boost in dry cleaning business (as one example) can cause that particular businessman to possibly cut certain corners in proper MPC protocol for the opportunity to benefit even more greatly after his 2 year term is up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are more likely to end up the CEO at a defense agency or bank after.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  You’re right.  As mentioned above, however, I can see how a possible offer of some serious capital to his dry cleaning business made by some closed-door sources could happen “if you just vote <em>this</em> way instead of that way” - which would, of course, compromise his MPC standing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we were to change the rules, we would have to make sure that whoever held that position, held it for a minimal amount of time <strong>and then also minimize the benefit afterwards</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think <em>that</em> would be awesome really.  It would prevent the possible benefits of being involved in the MPC aside from its intended focus upon the public.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but that should be in all politics.</p>

<p>Most definitely agreed.</p>

<p>Before you spam this subreddit again with this theory, <a href="/u/yardley7">/u/yardley7</a>, you might want to learn a little about how central banks function in the real world. The idea that the Rothschilds own all but 7 (or 5 or 3 or whatever) central banks is a hoax of fairly recent origin. It dates back to just 2005, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Back in the early 20th century, most central banks were private, but that changed. Here&#39;s an excerpt from a 2011 academic article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Historically the vast majority of central banks, or banks of (banknote) issue as they were also referred to at the time, were institutions with private shareholders. This changed in 1935, when the Reserve Bank of New Zealand was nationalised. Nationalisation and government control of central banks subsequently gained momentum and all central banks (with the exception of the State Bank of Pakistan) established after World War II were established without private shareholders.</p>

<p>Central banks with private shareholding were reviewed extensively in literature, most recently in 1974. At the time, 15 central banks had private shareholders, but the central banks of Chile, Ecuador, Pakistan, Portugal, Mexico and Venezuela were nationalised in 1975. </p>

<p>The last nationalisation was the National Bank of Austria in 2010. Before nationalisation the Austrian government held 70.27% of the shares and Austrian institutions held the balance. The bank had no private individuals as shareholders at the time of its nationalisation.</p>

<p>Following this nationalisation, only the central banks of Belgium, Greece, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey and the US (Federal Reserve Banks) are institutions with some form or another of private shareholders. There is considerable divergence in terms of government shareholding, persons and entities eligible for shareholding and their dividend policies. In Greece, Italy, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey and the US, respective governments hold no shares in these institutions. The Belgium and Japanese governments hold, by law, at least 50% of the shares in their respective central banks.</p>

<p>Even on these eight, there are a lot of restrictions on who can own shares and how much control they have over the banks&#39; operations. In Japan, not only does the government own the majority of shares, the other owners have no say at all in the bank&#39;s leadership. The government of Japan appoints the Policy Board, the Governor and Deputy Governors, and the Auditors. The Minister of Finance appoints the Executive Directors and Counsellors.

<p>In Italy, ownership of Bank of Italy shares is limited to Italian &quot;banks and insurance and re-insurance firms, ... foundations, ... social security institutions, ... and pension funds&quot;. No single shareholder can own more than 3 percent of the shares. (<a href="https://www.bancaditalia.it/chi-siamo/funzioni-governance/partecipanti-capitale/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1">Source</a>) Dividends are limited, with most of the profits going to the government For example, in 2014, shareholders received dividends totallying €340 million and the government received €1,909 million.

<p>In Switzerland, the Swiss National Bank has a mixture of public and private control. The cantons (the states of Switzerland) own 39% of the shares and another 13%  are owned by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonal_bank">cantonal banks</a> (which are mostly owned by the cantons). Almost 48% of the shares are owned by private shareholders but, because each shareholder is limited to at most 100 voting shares, they only control 26% of the vote. In 2015, the largest private shareholder was Theo Siegel of Germany, who owned about 6.5% of the stock (worth about 7.4 million Swiss francs at the current trading price). (<a href="https://www.snb.ch/en/mmr/reference/shares_structure/source/aktionariatsstruktur.en.pdf">Source (PDF)</a>)</p>

<p>The Swiss National Bank is governed by an eleven member Bank Council and a three member Governing Board. Six members (a majority) of the Bank Council are elected by the government (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Council">the Federal Council</a>), and five members by the Shareholders&#39; Meeting. The members of the Bank Council are supposed to be 1/3 academics, 1/3 from politics, and 1/3 from business. The <a href="https://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/snb/bodies/id/snb_bodies_council">current membership of the Council</a> reflects that. The three member <a href="https://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/snb/bodies/id/snb_bodies_board">Governing Board</a> is chosen by the government (the Federal Council) from recommendations by the Bank Council.

<p>Over the past ten years, the Swiss National Bank has paid 13.5 million Swiss francs as dividends and paid 19 billion Swiss francs to the government. That is, the government got 99.93% of the pay-out. That money is divided ⅔ to the cantons and ⅓ to the federal government.

<p>I haven&#39;t researched the banks of Belgium, Greece, South Africa, or Turkey, but I do know about the United States, and it&#39;s complicated.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve System has several parts. One part, the Board of Governors, is an independent federal agency with about 2,000 employees, led by 7 Governors—including the Chairman—who are nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. To help keep the Federal Reserve&#39;s policy independent from the politics of the day, the Governors serve overlapping 14-year terms, so a President gets to appoint a new one every two years (or more often to fill out the remainder of a term of a Governor who did not complete the full term). (<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/frseries/frseri.htm">Source</a>)</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve System also includes 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks (FRB) which are not part of the government. The stock for each FRB is owned by all the member banks in the district. All national banks (federally-chartered banks) are members of the Federal Reserve and many state banks are, too. There are over 1700 member banks. Each member bank gets told how much stock it most own, based on the member bank&#39;s balance sheet. The stock cannot be traded. There is no individuals or families that own stock in the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>The amount of stock that a member bank owns determines how big a dividend the bank gets, but not control of the Federal Reserve Bank. Instead, each member bank gets two votes, one for a class A director, who is a banker, and one for a class B director, who may not be a banker. The banks in each district are split into three groups by size, so that the large banks pick two directors, the medium sized banks pick two and the small banks pick two. The banks all together choose 6 of the 9 directors for its FRB. The other three directors are appointed by the Board of Governors (the federal agency). Those three class C directors are not allowed to be banks or own any bank stock. The class B and class C directors then elect a President and Vice-President of the bank, subject to the approval of the Board of Governors. (<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/frseries/frseri4.htm">Source</a>)</p>

<p>Most of the important policies are determined either by the Board of Governors itself or by the Federal Open Market Committee, which consists of the seven Governors plus 5 of the 12 FRB presidents. In all votes since 1939, the policy votes have gone the way the Chairman of the Federal Reserve voted, so the Chairman essentially determines what the Federal Reserve policy is.</p>

<p>In the last ten years, the Federal Reserve has given dividends to its member banks totalling $13.4 billion. In the same period, it gave the federal government $583.9 billion. The federal government got 97.8% of the proceeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh. I&#39;m on the fence about it. Perhaps you can convince me otherwise, but it seems like such an unnecessary complication right now. I&#39;m fairly convinced (and I could be wrong) that if our current monetary system crashes, I&#39;d be better served with physical goods which I can trade. Similarly, if it doesn&#39;t, why should I be wasting time with digital currency? </p>
