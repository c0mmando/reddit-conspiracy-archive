       There has been a power struggle going on in the Western world since the time of Jesus. Every time the people in power rip off the masses, and the masses start to get a little uppity, the Kings or Priests look around at who has the most stuff to take and commits some sort of false flag and attack and blames it on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jewish people, among their other traits, pursue high paying careers and entrepreneurship. All such groups do this to a greater or lesser degree. Americans are somewhat inculcated with this value, as are the Japanese and many of the Protestant groups I've had the pleasure of being a part of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the Jews get kicked out of a lot of countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I believe that "exceptionalism" is deplorable and the root of much evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       And maybe there are some things about Judaism I disagree with...  But the vast majority of Jews would not agree to inflict the Federal Reserve on us, and most German Jews would have fled to America, if we would have let them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, in history, they are pawns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, in history, the world needs a scapegoat... so they are in danger... real danger of some degree of unfair treatment, up to another holocaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they hate the world, it's for the same reason that some of my friends hate Ron Paul... they've been lied to and soundbitten. There are probably about 100,000 real complicit assholes in this world... who really control things. Even if every single one of them were Jewish, that still wouldn't be "The Jews".
      </p>
      <p>
       Those 100,000... if we get this wrong... they will get away, and the other 10 million Jews will get the brunt of the backlash. To those 100,000 assholes... the other 10 million are both pawns... and the competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christians are also periodic targets of this wide-scale backlash, throughout history... but since the nature and culture of Christianity is different, the backlash takes a much simpler form... that of simple slaughter. [Edit: Or getting thrown against the Muslims]
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews, Christians, Republicans... they're all groups that are chock full of decent, well meaning people who have been lied to. They are all manipulated in games of power, and they all get screwed in their own particular way. There are lots more groups like this... Gays... Gypsies... Blacks... the Scottish... the Irish... the "Barbarians".
      </p>
      <p>
       A vast majority of people here have nothing against the Jews, and they are nuanced enough to differentiate anti-Zionism from being anit-Jew. Very true.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's also shed a tear for the many, many innocent Jews that did get caught up in the last phase of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's also not forget to look even one level deeper, and realize that religion, in itself, is just a tool for those who wish to rule over people, and the Jews are, in that way... just another set of pawns.
      </p>
      <p>
       And on that deeper level, ask yourself, does it really stop with "The Zionists" and the Rothschild spawned cabal??? Or perhaps it goes one level deeper, and this is all the work of the Jesuits, who see the Jews, Muslims, Protestants, 'Muricans, French... as just useful idiots, stuck on labels too much to peel them off and look at what is hidden beneath.

       Could you explain how they're being scapegoated into promoting degeneracy and moral decay through the positions they hold?

       And you can't simply hand-wave their eviction from hundreds of countries. The 'perpetual victim' narrative is the official version of history as told by those who control the legality of revisionist history.

       You forgot to mention the human soap bars &amp; lampshades. The gas chambers built after the war in Russian controlled Poland under JOSEPH Stalin's orders.
Or if you want more up to date stuff then you can always look at how Jews are hell bent on reducing the EU population to a mass of inbred / crossbred mongrels.

       Did we forget to mention Palestine?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and if it is just the Khazars/Ashkenazis causing all this shit then your average Jew would be well advised to start speaking up, big time and in a hurry. Because we're almost ready for a repeat of the persecution of 6 million Jews. Which in real numbers is 58 million non combatants, 2 million combatants and about 200,000 'innocent' Jews.

       Edit: I get what you're saying. A lot of people don't. And with the current focus on freedom, no borders, I'm gay today &amp; queer tomorrow, I think a lot of younger people are going to foot the non-combatant casualty bill.

       Thanks man, that actually means a lot to me. However, even when people do clump all of my people and just say "the jews", I know they don't mean me and I don't take any offense. They usually mean the zionists and those that support the genocide of the palestinians, which certainly has to be the overwhelming majority of at least American Jews, and to be honest I harbor a strong anger towards my own people for that as well, and find myself calling them "The Jews".  You should check out Ken O Keefe's lectures on youtube, he is a hero.

       What are you saying? OP's point is, in short, "don't hate Jews because that's bigoted". Are you arguing with that central point?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I never got why you kind think it's OK to hate on Ashkenazic Jews as long as you don't hate on all Jews. Is that somehow less bigoted because you're only biased against a certain race of Jews? Like if I were only racist against blacks from sub-Saharan Africa but not all blacks, does that make me not racist?

       How is discrimination against a group of people who continuously and ritually commit genocide, bigotry? What group they associate with and how they claim to identify themselves as is irrelevant. Unless if you are part of the group they identify as and you know they are not who they say they are then speak up.

       The acts of a few can not be blamed on an entire group, especially when one of the powers favorite tactics is to create racial and religious tension. Interesting that you used the term scapegoat, if anyone isn't familiar with the origin of the phrase it's an interesting read.

       As a former Jesuit and Freemason I'm telling you that you have the wrong end of the stick. There is a connection between the Jesuits and the Masons because both organisations have a more liberal interpretation of God than bog standard Catholic doctrine believes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term order out of chaos refers to the primordial chaos from which creation emerged from. Remember, to be a mason you have to believe in a supreme being. As you ascend the staircase that definition broadens as you learn more. God is not a man with a beard in the clouds. A true definition of an entity worthy of being called God must encompass not only good but also evil. The highest level Masons see light and darkness as two sides of the same coin.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are correct in that Masons have a strong in-group preferences. I believe this is fair. We tend to trust people we share our country with more than others. We trust advice from people in the same industry as ours, the same religion as ours and so on. Masonry is no different.

       Now for the Jesuits. I was referred by a lodge member to them because I was a seeker. The Jesuits are basically a branch of the church that devote themselves to spirituality. The vast majority of them are hermit Monks but elite members do take an additional vow, that most don't, to obey the direct order of the Pope.
      </p>
      <p>
       These brothers are sent on missions on behalf of the church. I'll give you an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mentor in the Jesuit order was a Monk called Paolo Dall'Oglio. He was ordered by the Pope to re-establish an ancient Monastery he came across in Syria. His specific mission was to work with representives from all of the regional religions (Muslim, Druize,  Christian etc) and to report back to Rome on human rights abuses and the current state of the Syrian government.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads me to the next part. The oath to the Pope. Like soldiers, any of the elite Jesuits must be willing to lay down their life for their mission. This is the actual reason for it. My mentor was expelled from Syria but snuck back in when Isis started taking over to hold talks with their leadership and attempt to broker a peaceful transition. The last I heard from him he was beheaded for his trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secrecy and a refusal to jepordise ongoing projects allow this kind of conspiracy nonsense to target a group of people who are only concerned with preserving peace. If Jesuits started publishing talks they're having, deals they're brokering the war mongers and despots they're forced to deal with wouldn't go any where near them again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I don't believe the world is being manipulated by a group of people. I just think those people are financiers and profiteers who make trillions out of human misery. From my experience both the Masons and the Jesuits do neither.

       The litmus test for being true to your word ("concerned with preserving peace") is the state of the world today. There is no peace, nothing but violence, for decades.  If your groups are so powerful, why aren't you getting the 'peace' you claim to preserve?  Are you all incompetent?

      <p>
       You have people embedded in international intelligence agencies.  Are you not intelligent?

       You could end all the conflict tomorrow, instead all you do is multiply it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe your words 0%.  You want to act like the victim here but you are not.  I have far too much evidence on your groups to put you at places of conflict as the common denominator, many times over.  Religion is a mask for the demon underneath--you guys are demonic in fact; Roman culture is one big shitshow and death cult going back to the phalloi of babylon.  You need to get your shit straight if you don't know the true nature of the team you serve.  And if that's the case, I believe you're either willfully ignorant of these things because you're trapped in their cultic dogma which is akin to pumping sunshine and piousness up your own ass with a gas hose; or you are coming here to reddit to 'control the dialogue and look like an innocent clergyperson' to screw up people's attitudes and 'instill the seed of doubt'.  But it won't work on me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole 'oh that's conspiracy stuff' doesn't work here any more--don't you get it?  There've been too many wars, far too much money in the vatican while nothing changes (pope could snap his fingers and end violence everywhere simultaneously but doesn't), too much mind control, too much child rape (that's on you guys--completely--because we know it's 1)politicians, 2)police, 3)intelligence, 4)clergy, 5)sportsleaders (again, politicians)---all of which have the common denominator of being freemasonic; We all watch the same brain-eroding pop videos with their occultic symbols like the chessboards and white rabbits and all this trash.  We know that the CIA created the counterculture and pumped mind-drugs into our culture to shut down the anti-war effort. What's that say?  It says 1) they wanted to keep doing war, 2) they felt entitled to their secrecy and to poison their own countrymen.  Know who did this cute plan?  Allen Dulles and the OSS who brought Nazi scientists and abusive social psychology (advertising) into the fold, a known knights of malta agent along with other cryptofascist jesuit operators.
      </p>

       YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYONE!  You're a mafia.  Your group is no differnet from drug cartels or italian crime families.  In fact, you are the original italian crime family going back to demon Constantine who killed his wife and son btw.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys are a luciferian cult of evil and death and people are waking up.  We will eventually destroy you, if not physically with our spirit, if not in this life but the lives beyond.  We are human, you're the disease and we will overcome through the TRUE grace of Yeshua

       This is my one issue. Sure I'm certain the vast majority have nothing against Jews. But more often than not, comments on this subreddit lump "Jews" and "Zionists" in one bag. Blaming "the Jews" for anything bad Israel does. Or picking someone out in particular because they are Jewish, even if there is nothing indicating that they are Zionist. I've had several long discussions with various users, and there is a huge cognitive dissonance over that one point. While claiming that "I only hate Zionists" they will, often in the same sentence, go on to point out historical events that didn't involve Zionists at all. Thus proving the point that they merely hate Jews and the hatred of Zionism is a byproduct of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly? For the most part I don't even think it's intentional. People are simply ignorant of their own ignorance. They understand a bit of Zionism, and they really don't like that. Fine. But they compound that with what they don't know about Zionism, plus a healthy dose of ignorance about Jews and Judaism until they get to the point when they
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       they may know the difference but really don't.

       The reason people lump in "Jews" and "Zionists" is because many aren't Zionists, but they are hardline Communists. Communism was, and still is, a Jewish developed strategy of war. The Bolsheviks who took over Russia were almost all Jewish, hell one of the first laws enacted in Soviet Russia post revolution was that anti-Semitism would be punishable by death.

      <p>
       Of course it's not "all Jews", but this is a childish argument and ignores the overrall pattern that can be clearly, clearly observed if you take off the blinders of "correct think". Low level Jews are brainwashed to think that all gentiles are evil and that anudda shoah is just around the corner. The movie (defamation](

       ] is a great documentary (made by a young Jew) which shows this process in detail, and its very revealing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Young Israeli's are taken into Germany to tour Auschwitz, and when they are not there but in the hotel in Germany they are kept under strict watch by their supervisors because there could be "Nazi's around every corner" looking to shoah them. Basically, young Jews are kept in the perpetual mindset that everyone is constantly out to stick them in an oven at any second. This is part of the process that leads to the rabid hyper-sensitivity and in group loyalty that we see in the Jewish population, where the low level Jews will stick up for Jews when they get in trouble whether they are right or wrong.

       Yeah it's ironic too, because the in group loyalty isn't exactly a two way street when it comes to the elite Jews. They definitely fully realized that by provoking Germany into all out war, it would lead to a lot of Jews dying and being displaced, having their property seized and everything else, but muh Zionism, they seemed to think it was a worthy sacrifice. Holocaust means burnt offering.

       Not this old canard again. Look, if we think Scientology is a bad thing, are we supposed to constantly qualify our comments by saying "but not all Scientologists are evil people"? No, we don't need to do that because it is understood. When we criticize Jews, we criticize the collective action of the Jews, as a tribe, against the rest of humanity.

       There's so much wrong with your post, I can't comment on everything. But as for your point about the Holocaust ... there never was a Holocaust, as Jews present it. Jews created the Holocaust myth to serve their own purposes, and it has served them very well (just as similar myths in the Old Testament undoubtedly served the Hebrews well in their day).
      </p>
      <p>
       What can we say about the Holocaust. Well, Jews were not well-liked in Germany during the 1930s. Why? Because they had taken control of Germany away from Germans. Hitler saw this as a problem that needed to be addressed, so he took back the powers the Jews had taken from Germans and gave them back to Germans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jews were viewed as potential enemies of the state of Germany, along with other fringe groups such as the gypsies, Slavs, Catholics, and homosexuals. They were rounded up and placed in holding camps to prevent them from working mischief against the German people. In the beginning those camps were nice places to be, more like summer camps than anything else; but as the war began and supplies for all Germans became scarce, those in the camps suffered as well. At the end of the war, when German supply lines to the camps were cut by allied bombing, the Jews suffered starvation and death by disease, along with everyone else in the camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no special Holocaust. There were potential enemies of the state -- the Jews, along with other groups -- who were placed out of the way where they could do no harm. And it should be pointed out that once power was taken from the hands of the Jews, Germany did very well indeed. The late 1930s were a time of great prosperity in Germany, indicating that the actions of the Nazis were well taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since that time, the Jews have resented Germans, and Europeans in general, because they interfered with the usual Jewish practice of profiting from the Christians, and cheating the Christians, and manipulating the Christians. Germany in the 1930s showed just how well Christians do when there are no Jewish fangs in their necks, sucking their lifeblood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews are by nature parasites. They do no work, they profit from the work and genius of others. The genius of Jews is the way they have learned to manipulate Christians. And they are still doing it. Why do you think the Jews have taken control over all Western media? It is so that they can
       <em>
        control the minds
       </em>
       of Christians.

       You're talking about Jews the way a lot of people talk about Americans. The average American didn't support the Iraq war until they were lied to, time after time... and the blame goes to the liars... not the victims who were deceived.

       The average Catholic didn't support the Jesuits pushing for the civil war... it just happened. They are "Catholics", but only in name.

       The priests and politicians lie to the masses and then they use them as human shields... protected by their inclusion in some big group, like "The Jews". Then the "Jews" get sent to concentration camps, and a shitload of them died.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to bicker about whether it was 6 million... it obviously wasn't... and there were obviously lies about many, many things in that war... but it wasn't the average Jew pushing for this. They were manipulated, just as you can be manipulated...

       The Jesuits knew this.
Perhaps the Jews know this.
The average mason or American does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you destroyed the Jews, to a man, another group would just pop up to replace them. There is no shortage of evil in the hearts of men, and we blind ourselves to the evil in ourselves to make it easier to hate that evil when we see it manifest in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, hate the Jews... call them names... blame them for whatever... but they are NOT alone. There isn't some mystically evil tribe from Khazaria where all the evil in men is stored up. That sounds like a fairy tale. Also, if Judaism has any advantage over the other religions, it is because it has been around longer, and had more time to perfect the craft of using a religion to serve ulterior motives...
      </p>
      <p>
       But if they never existed, we'd be bitching about how the Hindus are fucking up the world.

     <div class="md">
      <p>
       I mentioned "the hierarchy" as being evil... but I mentioned it in passing. I'd like to reiterate that...
      </p>
      <p>
       Men are NOT suitable masters of other men. WhenEVER you place men in a hierarchy, it gets corrupted. The larger the organization... the more corrupt. The more powerful the organization... the more corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hierarchy (a control mechanism masquerading as a collaboration technique), is outdated, and it always manifests the worst characteristics in those who wish to climb that ladder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since Jews and MOST religions are indoctrinated on the importance of hierarchy and authority (Hindus, Buddhists, Catholics, Muslims, Jews, and even Scientologists, as well as SOME protestant groups), it is predetermined by the laws of human behavior and game theory that these groups will be the most susceptible to the mild brainwashing it takes to be part in a large conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's not just the Jews... they are the most useful because:
1. They collude with each other... nepotism.
2. Their culture prizes wealth accumulation and easy living.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is both. The Catholics also collude with each other... nepotism... so does just about every group. In my "Assembly of God" Christian church, they told us to do business with other Christians.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the second factor is also very potent. Many protestants are taught to pursue high paying careers... political positions... medicine... tech... But since protestants are MUCH less willing to engage in blind Hierarchy, they don't control as much.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Catholics spent as much time teaching their flock to learn law as they do talking about birth control... the Catholics would be on top, right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about any of these groups... it's about the hierarchy of control... in itself... it is enough to destroy a world.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're looking for an "anti-christ"... I'd say the Hierarchy is the immortal demon you seek. It chews up and corrupts men... it is immortal... it lies to people. It places men above and below other men... it is unholy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And from a business standpoint, the Hierarchy becomes so inefficient once the organization exceeds about 5,000 people, that almost every organization of any size must turn to non-competitive practices to stay in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       A hierarchy of less than about 500 people can operate fairly efficiently, compared to a hierarchy[edit: meant heterarchy]... but past 500 people, it goes downhill, quickly. A country has millions of people, and so no FEDERATION can survive without becoming corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only a CONFEDERATION has any chance of being stable at a population over a couple million.
      </p>
      <p>
       A million person republic could limp along, barely getting by, for centuries... but once you push to 10 million, you're just plain fucked. You simply cannot give a hierarchy a control over a resource pool that big without getting a VAST majority of all the production wasted or stolen.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah... big tangent... but yeah.

       Don't believe this guy. Even if you don't believe Jesus was divine, he most certainly existed. I suggest reading "Zealot" by Reza Aslan to clear up any questions or doubts you have.

       How can anyone on this sub be so ignorant about the Jews at this point? Their "success" have nothing to do with this. It's how they have behaved for thousands of years with no end in sight. There is no anti-semitism without semitism.

       They are not ubiquitous. At best they are 'over-represented'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, and more importantly, modern 'Judaism' is more of fraternity than a race or religion. Anyone can claim to be Jewish. There is no test that can confirm or deny it. So some people in high status positions "join the club", for the benefits of membership (e.g., campaign donations) at the expense of the expenses of membership (e.g., alleged "persecution").

       That's because they teach us all how to argue in law school, which we're forced to attend between second and third grade. By then, we've successfully been taught to hate gentiles, manipulate financial markets, and terrify all who know the secret truths of the world. It's a heavy load, sure, but you have no idea how much work it takes to get millenials to buy into our multigenerational plot for world governance. Those little bastards just want to, like, go run a startup, or write poetry, and we try to tell them, No, Moshe, no, you must join the international cabal, but they think they're little special snowflakes, and keep asking stupid questions like why we can't just rename the whole thing Prtcl, because they think that'd resonate more with today's youth.

       Precisely.  and let me elaborate a bit.  as Israel approaches the magical 6,million mark, the Cabal needs to renew the holocaust story, now tattered and incredible.  60 more years of victimization myth for Jews to establish a new empire would be accomplished by a nuke to Ashdod or Tel Aviv, both to be blamed on Iran.  The US has already paid for underground shelters for Bibi and the boyz.

       I don't think they can spiritually afford to nuke that region. There's deeper significance and stuff hidden there they don't want to lose.

       This isn't one of my more thought-out realizations, just a pretty strong feeling. I could be wrong. But I will note that it's clear the Rothschilds (or whoever is pulling their strings) have had their eye on that land for a long time, and I doubt they got it to lose it.

       They'd love to put a lead dome over jerusalem and then bomb away.  It would be to them like making a beer can chicken roast, then they could go full soloman once everything cooled, cut open a door and put a rad-suited tyler at the entrance which a special handshake that gets you in.
