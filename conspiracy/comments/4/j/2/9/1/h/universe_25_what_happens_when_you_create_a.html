      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How do you design a utopia? In 1972, John B. Calhoun detailed the specifications of his Mortality-Inhibiting Environment for Mice: a practical utopia built in the laboratory. Every aspect of Universe 25—as this particular model was called—was pitched to cater for the well-being of its rodent residents and increase their lifespan. The Universe took the form of a tank, 101 inches square, enclosed by walls 54 inches high. The first 37 inches of wall was structured so the mice could climb up, but they were prevented from escaping by 17 inches of bare wall above.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now with the above, think 'humans' instead of 'mice' and 'earth' instead of 'tank.'
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Four breeding pairs of mice were moved in on day one. After 104 days of upheaval as they familiarized themselves with their new world, they started to reproduce. In their fully catered paradise, the population increased exponentially, doubling every fifty-five days. Those were the good times, as the mice feasted on the fruited plain. To its members, the mouse civilization of Universe 25 must have seemed prosperous indeed. But its downfall was already certain—not just stagnation, but total and inevitable destruction.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sounds like a golden age of cultural society...within limits of course....until....
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So what exactly happened in Universe 25? Past day 315, population growth slowed. More than six hundred mice now lived in Universe 25, constantly rubbing shoulders on their way up and down the stairwells to eat, drink, and sleep. Mice found themselves born into a world that was more crowded every day, and there were far more mice than meaningful social roles. With more and more peers to defend against, males found it difficult and stressful to defend their territory, so they abandoned the activity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sounds familiar? These days people are saying, "Fuck it all." Why vote if its rigged, why support a wife in a sexless marriage, why pay taxes, why be a man or woman if I can just change my gender, why, why, why.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Normal social discourse within the mouse community broke down, and with it the ability of mice to form social bonds. The failures and dropouts congregated in large groups in the middle of the enclosure, their listless withdrawal occasionally interrupted by spasms and waves of pointless violence.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again familiar? Normal social discourse is already breaking down with everyone staring into their phones/tablets, people text instead of call, their are subcultures of people who try to not leave the house like in Japan. With pointless violence errupting via random school/mass shootings.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The victims of these random attacks became attackers. Left on their own in nests subject to invasion, nursing females attacked their own young. Procreation slumped, infant abandonment and mortality soared. Lone females retreated to isolated nesting boxes on penthouse levels. Other males, a group Calhoun termed “the beautiful ones,” never sought sex and never fought—they just ate, slept, and groomed, wrapped in narcissistic introspection. Elsewhere, cannibalism, pansexualism, and violence became endemic. Mouse society had collapsed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Lol.....what does this last paragraph remind you of when you look around?
      </p>
      <p>
       So where could we possibly be headed?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On day 560, a little more than eighteen months into the experiment, the population peaked at 2,200 mice and its growth ceased. A few mice survived past weaning until day six hundred, after which there were few pregnancies and no surviving young. As the population had ceased to regenerate itself, its path to extinction was clear. There would be no recovery, not even after numbers had dwindled back to those of the heady early days of the Universe. The mice had lost the capacity to rebuild their numbers—many of the mice that could still conceive, such as the “beautiful ones” and their secluded singleton female counterparts, had lost the social ability to do so. In a way, the creatures had ceased to be mice long before their death—a “first death,” as Calhoun put it, ruining their spirit and their society as thoroughly as the later “second death” of the physical body.

       Obviously, no one is living in the deserts or the oceans, and the majority of populations are crammed within and around cities. Take NY for example, and extrapolate the numbers from mice sizes to correspond with their tank size, and then calculate what it would be for humans, whoa re after all, animals as well.

       There are many other takeaways from this.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, we're not mice. There are plenty of examples of places with plenty, that have not experienced this.

       Switzerland, the only democracy in the world... is a good example. Plenty of access to anything you can desire... no breeding catastrophe.

       There's one point I didn't hit, that I just remembered. When you replicate the experiment, but you only dispense enough food for 50 mice, the population grows to 75 before stabilizing back at 50 after a couple generations.

       I think Juan Lennon is trying to say something about us...that we are working for the illuminati. If that's what he's trying to say, he's just not gone through my post history.  I've begged the white dragons to join and they wont' even respond so the best I've done is compile the list of updated conspiracy theories if you have any doubt as to which side I work for after that, thenyou're a numbskull and I'd suspect you as working for the group I'm accused of representing

       You think that people can't see right through you?  Let's call it "odd" that you're using well exposed shill tactics to brush off what many already know.  The beauty of having a low IQ.  You can't see much anything past your rather ethnic nose.

       I'm trying to see if I can get the statistics reddit sub to translate the mice lifespan into human  numbers and get some some sort of time span in terms of generations to expand on this topic.

       I know one thing we're going to start seeing is people choosing VR Sex with the VR Goggles and eventually with Robotic women with perfect bodies and programmed a certain way, instead of with actual women. That'll be in our lifetime.

       Also A lot of girls in my own family can't get pregnant, and I remember just after high school quite a few girls who couldn't get pregnant no matter what...had to go to clinics to get it done.
