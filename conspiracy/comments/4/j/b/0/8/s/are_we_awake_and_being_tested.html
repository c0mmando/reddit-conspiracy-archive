      <pre><code> Here is the thing that really bothers me about Sandy Hook, Boston bombing etc...with being staged events with crisis actors.  Why?  If the "Powers That Be" want to change political or civilian agendas or perceptions and need a "staged event" to do so...why not just really kill all those people (use real bombs, use real ammo) wouldn't it be the easiest route to accomplish the goal?  Why take the time, effort, expense and most importantly chance of being caught to "act" out these tragedies?  Don't get me wrong...as a critical thinker and an objective observer I believe they (and many others) were and are orchestrated events (in fact all through history), but the nagging fact that I know "evil doers" would have no problem just killing the innocent to accomplish their goals really irks me....unless...they can't for some reason....and that is what I have a hard time getting my head around....  Do you think that "they" have rules that must be adhered too ?  Do you think it is a possibility that what is really being manipulated in all of this is our "free choice" choose the correct path or choose the incorrect one for both actor and audience alike....are we being tested....is that what being "awake" really is?

       either. I would genuinely like to see some serious opinions on crisis actors.

       Why bother to set up fake scenarios, leaving room to be exposed, when it would be much tidier to actually kill everyone involved?

       The people hired actually believe they're doing 'good'.  If they were to wholesale slaughter a bunch of innocent people, these operations would not find the actors/players to commit such atrocities.  You can see how short-sighted some fervent people can be towards abortion, gun control, feminism etc.. same with those who are patriotic.  Look at how some people adore their sport's teams.  Some are moved to actual violence over sports.  Now if the stakes were higher, say, involving your country's future - you can only imagine what a person would do.

       Also, money.  Money can make a person do anything.

       I also appreciate the analogy of the "hive" mind and would likely think along these lines except for the fact that when using the "hive" mentality all the bees are workers and productive. But, our current Societal..... oh heck... lets just say Humankind has an over population of useless "workers" so to speak and TPTB have seeded and bred that into many cultures ....why...? Also why would they want or allow to breed so many of those workers incapable of actually attributing to the "hive"... Maybe... if you take away mans potential to make his own food, make his own shelter, make his own life you also take away his being able to make his own decisions..."free choice". I love the commentary by Paul Harvey "If I were the Devil"...

       The people behind this type of fraud now realize that one day they could be brought to justice, so it's in their interests not to kill people, also that allows them to bring more people in on their plans to back them up, and justify the stage shows as "For the greater good of society", but if they are killing people in false flags like 9/11 and 7/7, they will always be seen as scum.
      </p>
      <p>
       The WTC7 screwup has taught them that their plans can never be perfect and there's always a risk of getting found out.  So in the future they would prefer to be found out as 'social engineers', not as 'murderers'.

       This makes me wonder if there are separate factions involved. One is absolutely muderous, as evidenced by 9/11. It would be far too late at this point to worry about how they'd be seen. Maybe a different group uses actors instead?

       We are naturally complacent and have a myopic world view... we naturally just want to protect ourselves and live a good life. We ignore most of the warning signs, and just go along to get along.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on 9/11, thousands of people lost loved ones in the twin towers, and those people were suddenly and swiftly snapped into a different world... a bigger world, and they want answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parents and family of victims of 9/11 are probably the hardest to dismiss according to the mainstream narrative. Technical objections can easily be dismissed by parading a panel of experts, but general distrust of the story, delivered by an actual victim of the attacks or their family... that carries a lot of weight for many, many people who are hard to wake up, otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine 50 actual kids getting killed at something like Sandy Hook... you would have 50 pissed off parents, and going by the numbers, about half or more will prefer the SOLUTION to the problem that they don't want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half of the parents might go along with "More gun control", but the other half are going to say, "Gun free zones are bullshit!"
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the parents have the potential to question the narrative, openly... with the same shield that soldiers get when they criticize the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine one of the children that died was the nephew of Wolfgang Halbig... They'd just have to kill him. That would be way too potent an investigative force. He's already getting so far on just the idea he's a school safety consultant... the link of being a parent or uncle would resonate with a completely different crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are able to completely monopolize that crowd, because they invented the victims. The narrative is much more controllable.

       I've got a friend that lives near sandy hook. The funerals for those children were very real.  So was the harassment several parents endured after their children were murdered and they had people confronting them saying they were acting and they never had kids in the first place.

       I am sorry if this is the case, but in all honesty many of those same parents own reactions/interviews were so very hard for the average loving family member/parent to digest as believable...maybe that is at the heart of the harassment.  We each grieve in our own ways but when you love another human being and they are taken from you (esp as horrifically as these children were) you go through stages of grief...these parents seemed to jump from loss to acceptance/gun control/send your money donation... in a heartbeat.  Seriously, who does this?

       I think 9/11 was the big test and we failed beyond their wildest expectations. Once they saw the public fall for it hook, they knew they were golden.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt that real children were killed at Sandy Hook. There is no way that Adam Lanza did all that, at least not by himself, but I believe the victims were real. Why would they chance not having real victims?

       Psychopaths don't care about guilt, particularly when they are advancing their agenda.  Look at how many they killed on 9/11.

       I think SH was the false flag that was finally going to allow them to revoke the 2nd Amendment. I think they were surprised by the pushback and quickly realized that armed resistance would be the result.

      <p>
       Honestly, I don't think it would be that hard to verify if the victims were real people. Surely, neighbors and classmates would know if they weren't real people.

       May I ask you if you saw the video of Robbie Parker's completely orchestrated and fake interview 1 day after his beautiful and innocent daughter was supposedly slaughtered at Sandy Hook?
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKr-av9jVx8">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKr-av9jVx8
       </a>
       I, as a woman, as a mother and most importantly as a caring human being, see his laughing, care free entrance "onstage" as reminiscent of actors getting ready to perform the "the role of a lifetime"  and not the actions of a grieving father in shock over the loss of his child even if he were the most calloused of individuals!  You could take away 99.9% of all the other wildly "inconsistent" facts about Sandy Hook and this video alone would make me know that this child (his child) did not die at Sandy Hook (if he had a child at all).

       I've seen it and it is suspicious. The interviews with the coroner are beyond ridiculous. That doesn't mean the kids weren't killed. I firmly believe that SH was the false flag event that was going to be used to revoke the 2nd Amendment but they were surprised at public resistance. Parker may have been a plant. There were most definitely actors in the Boston Bombing, but that doesn't mean that it didn't occur.

       I'm not sure why people think that the wealthy wouldn't murder a school full of children to advance their agenda.

       One of the people above explains why. It isn't about being merciful. The greedy, retarded reptile-brain types learned that when you kill real people, living family members might get involved and question shit that doesn't add up. Fake victims, no family, no questions, no problems. Get it?

       Yeah, but what if some pain in the ass reporter/investigator starts talking to neighbors,  classmates or school employees? All it would take is one person to say, "The children killed weren't in my class/neighborhood as reported." To use fake victims, they're relying on unknown people to keep their mouths shut.

       Well, I don't think they have much to worry about with reporters. And there are private investigators now who've tried to blow the whistle. Doesn't seem much different to me.

       I understand your argument and it goes back to my post on "evil" people could and would easily do "evil" things why the need for actors?  If there were real children killed… why would they need a plant (even a pathetic example of one as Robbie Parker was) wouldn't this just open up the possibility or doubt and inconsistencies in their story thereby harming the agenda?  Just one child having been killed in Sandy Hook would have been a tragedy and newsworthy and 19 would have been equally horrific just a larger number  ...why add 1 more (plant) child or parent to the mix?  As a parent I know many of my child's classmates and listen to stories about them via my child ...If I were a parent of a child who was killed at Sandy Hook nothing and I mean nothing would have stopped me from:
      </p>
      <h1>
       1 Racing into that school and to my child when that shooting happened!
      </h1>
      <h1>
       2 Digging and digging until I knew what happened and why!
      </h1>
      <h1>
       3 Dogging the police, FBI school officials coroner etc...until I knew that the story I was given was true!
      </h1>
      <h1>
       4 Relentlessly hounding Robbie Parker (and others) publicly and personally until I had explanations to why they acted like they did in interviews (that includes other parents/family/coroner/neighbors) that were so theatrical, disingenuous and so.... inconsistent!
      </h1>
      <p>
       Also if I gave an interview (which I would not have like so many did right after the shooting because in all honesty I would have been in denial, shock and shouting to the Heavens at the injustice of my loss) but "if" I had,  my heartbreak, my horror and my outrage would have been evident and honest not mimed and constructed.
That's why in my opinion no children were really killed in Sandy Hook, there are to many worm holes left open for the "grieving" parent to open up...and I assure you they would!  But, if all the victims/key players were actors or fictitious you would not have the depth of emotional need and dedication for answers!

      <p>
       Please excuse the way this post looks...I am new to this and not sure what I am doing wrong to make it look so darn "bold"...It looks normal when I open it up to edit it....

       When you say "look it up" do you mean I should find some fringe conspiracy article that makes the claim, and then take that claim seriously for no real reason? Because there really is no legitimate source or compelling data anywhere that suggests 9/11 had no fatalities. I live in Pennsylvania and have family in New York, I've talked to dozens of people since 2001 who personally lost family and friends in the 9/11 attacks.
