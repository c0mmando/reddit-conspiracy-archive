        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Look, we were never gonna get out of this pickle. The fact that some of us here on the Internet have tried is good, we should try, but it&#39;s over; they won. The numbers are not in our favor, not by a longshot. The truth is, it&#39;s a fucking game. They won the game, now they get a candy bar; whoo-hoo, they&#39;re still gonna die like the rest of us, or if they discover(ed) digital immortality they&#39;ll just be sucked right up into their AI god&#39;s group mind. What a deal! The point is, there&#39;s nothing to win. It&#39;s an illusion. I&#39;ve lost most of my emotional connection to the outcome, and instead tried to laugh; it&#39;s really quite funny, how easily they mapped out our brains and learned what makes us tick. We&#39;re just animals who learned how to think more, and better. If you believe in the spiritual, as I do, then you know at some point, spirit took hold and we became more than animals, but we&#39;re STILL animals nonetheless. That voice in your head saying &quot;I deserve better,&quot; &quot;they&#39;re wicked,&quot; &quot;how could they do all of this;&quot; that&#39;s just your ego. Your right, they are crazy, but it&#39;s still your ego saying that. Your ego will never help you with anything spiritual, it doesn&#39;t understand spirit. Spirit moves on, spirit doesn&#39;t care because spirit knows it&#39;s just a movie. You would have done the same thing in their shoes, as many of &quot;them&quot; we&#39;re born into occult families. They didn&#39;t have a choice. What we&#39;re seeing is good. Mankind is growing. There are two outcomes left; either we assimilate, or we reset. &quot;Assimilation&quot; will include technological wizardry that will astonish us, and eventfully consume us (in a short time span, maybe a generation at the most). Also, the world will unite under the flag of Artifical Intelligence and the &quot;Machine Mind.&quot; We will conquer the known universe. &quot;Reset&quot; will include a lot of death, and a lot of misery. We will revert back to our tribal and ancestral ways. Most of us will die. Only those who prepared for life in the wilderness will survive longer than a few months or years. I choose &quot;Reset.&quot; The elite can leave this planet and they will in the case of a reset. We have to make sure that those of us who survive teach our descendants who the &quot;Star People&quot; are, as not to fall into the same cycle we did last time. Rinse cycle, repeat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not fearmongering, at all. You know how serious the stakes are in this; at best, we have a system of control that eliminates the ability for freedom among the primary population, at worst, we&#39;re being sacrificed and soon-to-be slaughtered by a group of &quot;men&quot; who refer to us as &quot;herds.&quot; I&#39;m operating from the position of calculated resistance. We have to hit them back strategically. We have to press people each time something like the panama papers arrives at or ears. You can&#39;t just at back and do nothing but pray for their mercy! It won&#39;t work. Our will HAS to be applied. Sometimes, action must be taken. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is truth in your post.</p>

<p>However I wonder if there is something more to the spiritual than is let off. I don&#39;t think this is only one plane of spirituality, and while the ego may not be important, I have a feeling there are actually &#39;souls&#39;...at least up to a certain level when we are united with God at the highest level.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I subscribe to the notion that life is meaningless.</p>

<p>I also hear you <a href="/u/Ihopeitsround">/u/Ihopeitsround</a>. We have lost. Except maybe some of us didn&#39;t. I have a garden, sort of maybe because of 9/11. Because something shook me hard enough that day to give a fuck about something besides a new promotion or designer handbag. I learned I need earth in my life, so now I have it. If the time ever came where I had to, I&#39;d fight for sure, but if a slow descent into nothing is the other way, I have earth in my life until then. </p>

That&#39;s when I&#39;m at my happiest, when I&#39;m far away from the busybodies and the smell of industry. We&#39;ve lost our connection to nature and it WILL bite us in the ass very soon. The question is, will any of us not only survive, but thrive? I&#39;m here to push that agenda. We MUST become self-reliant; spiritually mentally first, then physically.

However, one could look at the random alterations among lifeforms and see, there is chaos, there is chance, and there is a lack of procession. Things just happen sometimes.

    <div class="md"><p>We need men like you, but think about this clearly; they&#39;ve had decades. The military has been infiltrated. At any moment, their could be a coup and anyone not willing to get chipped could be black bagged and either discharged, imprisoned, or killed. The military can&#39;t save us as a unit. Now, loyal, good men and women within the Miltary Industrial Complex who see through COULD have a chance of slipping through and joining our ranks and a guerrilla war COULD be fought. I&#39;m not ruling that out. This things just gonna get ugly, and I mean real ugly. Might be a few more years before more people realize, and by then it&#39;ll be too late for them. Our best bet is a confederation of loosely aligned and loosley connected community militias. We could orchestrate common objectives, a sort of &quot;Community Watch Confederacy.&quot; </p>

Also, a whole lot of these folks have health issues where they are afraid to speak truth or rock a boat, lest they get cut off.

<p>It&#39;s not over by a longshot.  So many things <em>could</em> happen.  The FBI and Dept of Justice could regrow a spine.  The dollar could implode making the election moot.  Someone could assassinate Hillary and Bill, blame it on conspiracy theorists again, of course and then that lone wolf would die by suicide or autoerotic asphyx (the swartz or the &#39;carradine&#39; respectively).  There could be a night of long knives where a bunch of white hat operators hack their agencies, exfiltrate real data and make it available in a way that can&#39;t be suppressed.  Or those white operators could start executing fascists one-by-one.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even over if/when Hillary steps in office.  Because that&#39;s when crazy things will happen.</p>

<p>If hillary is arrested then it&#39;s trump and sanders.  Which means trump because even though people may elect sanders the fascists in the cia will not allow a socialist president, much less a jew.  They are waspy bigots with a pavlovian vitriol response to &#39;socialism&#39;.</p>

<p>I think anyone tying to &#39;sell apathy&#39; like you&#39;re doing has to be some kind of megashill or your&#39;e megadeluded.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s an awakening happening and you&#39;re totally missing it.  I feel bad for you.  Because it&#39;s just getting exciting at this point.</p>

One could start and lead to the other, or vice versa. Many things are still up in the air. If we can get enough people to get angry and do angry, crazy-stupid human things, (like military people revolting, for example) we can pressure the elite to leave. Also, if there is a serious, devastating war, we can use it to our advantage (possibly). I don&#39;t know exactly how the chips would fall, but anything can happen; these two possibilities stick out to me. Either we concede and accept comfortable slavery forever, or we push back and go through hell to regain our human dignity. Our dignity is what I&#39;m worried about. I want dignity. </p>

Things will get to a certain point where people have no jobs, no money, food or medicine and will start to revolt.  US is already preparing for civil unrest.
And if well timed, the armed forces can be turned against TPTB using information, if widely distributed.  News anchors and TV broadcasting personnel will be in the same boat as everyone else.

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I&#39;m maybe a bit of a dreamer.  It certainly won&#39;t be easy but as you put in your post its either reset or assimilate.  If those are the 2 options you know my choice. 
I am a strong believer in collective consciousness.  As seen in animals and humans.... I could go on and on.
Point being everyone goes with the flow.  Even if the flow is downward.  If you stand in a crowd of a thousand people you can literally feel it.
It may not be as difficult to get the majority on side as you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You did not understand me. Propaganda is a part and parcel of our existence and everyone, including you and me knowingly or unknowingly manufacture propaganda on a personal level. You are not tricking anyone. You are just playing a role to shape the environment that they rely on to make their &quot;free&quot; choice, just like everyone else is doing. Anyway, I hope I could explain better. But this is the best I have. Peace!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said, and I agree. I personally have this thought as well. Not a whole lot we can do, and that&#39;s one of the sources they feed off us. They drain/rob us in so many ways, and we forget how beautiful the world and nature are. They try to disconnect us from this natural connection. I always say TPTB are like Redwood trees, you cannot pull it down with your hands, so you use a saw. That&#39;s find and dandy, but what about the miles of roots below the surface? In time another will rise up from the root networks. As above, so below..</p>
