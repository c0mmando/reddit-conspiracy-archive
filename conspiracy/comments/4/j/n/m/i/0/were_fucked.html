        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just wanted to stop by and say that I&#39;ve noticed that in every single thread, doesn&#39;t matter what sub I&#39;m in, there are always people arguing over minutia details and irrelevant shit, often overlooking or ignoring the general picture. Just one example because I&#39;m sure some of you notice this as well, the Nevada caucuses in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. I don&#39;t give a fuck what anyone has to say to the contrary, there is a system in place that is going to put Hillary into the white house. And yet most people can&#39;t seem to accept this fact. Then go on to argue about completely irrelevant details such as the rules in the Nevada caucuses. Regardless of the truth about this particular example. </p>

<p>It&#39;s extremely frustrating to be witness to this going on, even in topics unrelated to politics or religion or something of relative &quot;importance&quot;. And obviously Reddit does not represent the entire human race, but seeing people incapable of coming together on certain issues and remaining argumentative over the bullshit leaves me with little hope that we can progress out of the de-escalating situation that most conspiracy theorists are aware of. Even this sub isn&#39;t a shining example of people coming together thanks to trolls and shills, but I posted it here because people actually seem to be capable of critical thinking and challenging the status quo here moreso than in other subs. </p>

<p>Thanks for listening</p>

<p>However, I think it is important that people understand these &quot;techniques&quot; are employed by shillsshills, which is why I shared the link. Obviously most people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> already know of this, but there are some noobies to this sub everyday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s the funniest (saddest) part - so much of what people <em>think</em> is a conspiracy is actually just a virtual perpetuation of the ignorance carried over from the real world. just because you have 50 idiots tell you something, that doesn&#39;t make them correct nor does it make them a coordinated site-wide government takeover. </p>

<p>you would think that by nature, with a super computer behind everyone&#39;s finger tips, we would all be making great strides towards truth and understanding as opposed to spreading misinformation and fallacies. this nature depends on the user, unfortunately. and the general nature we witness is as you described:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They argue the minute details and nitpick arguments to death as though it somehow makes them correct or more intelligent</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I was going to say this is also an apologetics tactic because arguing over written rules reminds me of what I used read in police brutality threads back when cops weren&#39;t as exposed for being corrupt as they are now. You&#39;ll have a thread about a video of a cop beating someone to hell and most people who see this video will agree something is egregiously wrong with the cop&#39;s behavior. But then the cop apologists will chime in quoting statutes and laws, trying to justify and explain how the cop was in the legal right to basically brutalize someone. Then the thread gets completely derailed with people trying to interpret and reinterpret the laws. The law is beside the point. The point is one human is beating another human to dust and getting away with it. The apologists want to mask that fact with as much jargon and complexity as possible so that the truth is basically buried and cognitive dissonance sets within the minds of most people reading the thread. </p>

<p>Cognitive dissonance is the goal for apologists actually. They want your mind hooked like a fish and tugged at from opposite ends until you can&#39;t think or act anymore. Then you kind of just walk away confused and silent and then you&#39;ll work hard to get it out of your mind. You&#39;re not thinking about it anymore: Apologists win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree with you more mate; there are some things so simple that we should all be able to agree on them; things like corruption is bad, morality is good, but they&#39;ve flipped just about everything and I try talking to people nowadays and their moral/emotional gauges are so abused from Hollywood and other satanic influences. People simply can&#39;t realize how fucked they, and I&#39;m starting to believe they are in an actual trance. The constant state of Orwellian hypnosis has actually lulled people into a conscious trance. They are physically awake, but they do not process. They are like a computer set to hibernate; they&#39;re in a setting where they simply cannot operate, but all it would take is a little push and they&#39;d awaken immediately. The right media can awaken people. Whether it&#39;s a 9/11 truth video, or something else, people can go from asleep to awake given the right catalyst. That&#39;s why I love this place so much, and refuse to give up on it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. All it took for me 5 years ago, when I was 20 was a Ron Paul ad on YouTube. It was like 12 minutes long (long for an ad) so I was curious and watched it. Didn&#39;t even know who he was prior to watching this ad. I noticed how this dude was talking about things that actually mattered and yet the mainstream media was shunning him and doing their best to keep him out of the spotlight. It didn&#39;t make sense why this was the case and I was definitely asleep at this time. But it piqued my interest and was the catalyst that led me down the rabbit hole and awakened me to the truth. Haven&#39;t been the same since.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>funny thing is watching people fall for the same scam over and over again, like donald trump (a clinton and bush family friend and campaign donor being set up to control clinton&#39;s opposition and split it in half/discredit her opposition by connecting it to an idiot like trump).</p>

<p>a clinton donor and family friend set up to &quot;run against&quot; a Clinton, who appeared on the political scene just at the moment she needed someone to split her opposition and share a fake election with -- he&#39;s a fake incarnation of Ron Paul, key word fake, which is why he&#39;s getting such amazingly heavy promotion online and on TV (he was given <em>center stage</em> at the debates, how did it work out for Paul or Bernie?)</p>

<p>these are the most obvious scams on the planet but people fall for it every damn time, I see a ton of trump signs around me and I want to make some signs to put next to them that say trump &quot;<em>is a Clinton donor and family friend who&#39;s being set up to &quot;run against&quot;a Clinton, it&#39;s a scam</em>&quot;, but people are just too far gone to handle reality at this point in time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>also OP, the reddit admins post web stats on the reddit admin blog, and it&#39;s common to see <em>Eglin AFB</em> as the #1 visitor to reddit.com of all the cities in the world.. not LA, not NYC, not London.</p>

<p>guess what else happens at Eglin AFB? The USAF runs their online information operations and &quot;inform and influence&quot; activities (ie propaganda posting). surely just a coincidence.</p>

<p>that&#39;s not even the beginning though, as PR firms and advertisers are all over this place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This example is a bit harmless in the grand scheme of things but it still applies. Recently a new Doom game was released. A few weeks before that I was seeing little tid bit facts about the previous Doom games suddenly appearing on Reddit. I started to see TILs mentioning Doom but not completely related to it. Doom pictures. Doom logo. Doom first game to do this, first game to do that. At the time I didn&#39;t know a new Doom was coming out. My mind was seeded with Doom interest and I went to google to search about Doom, hoping to download the original. Then I read on Steam that a new Doom was going to be released in two weeks. Wow, what a crazy &quot;coincidence&quot;. </p>

<p>Then as the release date drew nearer I saw more Doom threads but interestingly they weren&#39;t about the new Doom as I assume they would be if this was really grassroots. They were just cute little TILs about Doom in general. </p>

<p>Its purpose is just to make Doom feel fresh in your mind, to remind you of Doom and then give you the option to buy the new game. That&#39;s what it tried to do with me. Immediately I went and searched for Doom and &quot;discovered&quot; that a new one was coming out. It&#39;s all part of the plan. They&#39;re balls deep in. the psychology of the masses.</p>

<p>NPCs, in video games, are non-player characters. They’re inserted into a game to populate the world and give it a feeling of life and fullness. They are, of course, completely unconvincing at this, as there are only a limited number of responses that the programmers can ever give to one (or more) computer characters. These responses eventually exhaust themselves and the NPCs begin repeating identical phrases no matter what you try to do or how many times you activate them. </p>

<p>There are NPCs in the real world.</p>

<p>There are people who autonomously follow groupthink and social trends in order to appear convincingly human. They have no thoughts of their own. They do not create, they do not discuss, they do not change, and they barely even reason.</p>

<p>When you talk to them they say the same thing every time. “TRUMP IS HITLER”, “JUST BE YOURSELF”, “SPORTSBALL”, “THE NEW ADELE SONG XD OMG.” If you get in a discussion with them, it&#39;s always the same buzzwords and hackneyed arguments. They’re the kind of people who make a show of discomfort when you break the status quo to invoke a real discussion. Sometimes they won’t even respond correctly. It’s terrifying, actually. If you were to ask about politics, they would reply with sports. Ask about economics, they’ll reply with mindless minutiae about their personal lives. Try to get them to care about the invasion of Europe and they’ll start humming.</p>

<p>It’s terrifying.</p>

<p>Wow, very well put. I never thought about it like that. But you&#39;re right. Especially when it comes to almost anything mainstream. Such as music, news, movies, sports, phrases (swag, 100, fam, <em>insert any phrase</em>), etc. I&#39;ve noticed how many people I can actually have a mind opening discussion with and it&#39;s definitely a minority. The rest are essentially programmed to think &amp; respond a certain way. Truly terrifying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hi bud, while I agree that you get banned for posting too much of the truth on reddit, maybe you can address some of the actual concerns people have about your favorite billionaire clinton campaign donor.</p>

<p>2 families are passing the highest offices and appointments back and forth between each other and their own wives, sons, and campaign donors/family friends(which is what Trump is to both Clintons and Bush families) -- and you think he&#39;s opposition? Will you also believe in the fake election when Putin&#39;s wife is &quot;running against&quot; a Putin campaign donor and family friend who is pretending to &quot;be her opposition&quot;? How stupid does a person have to be to fall for that shit? How easy to scam are you?  It&#39;s so sad to see people fall for the same thing over and over again, administered by the same people, their wives, their campaign donors, and their sons.</p>

<p>When Bush son #2 ran, he &quot;ran against&quot; his own frat brother from Skull and Bones, now when Clinton wife runs, she runs against a Bush and Clinton family friend and political campaign donor -- and you think that&#39;s genuine? I don&#39;t believe you and I think you must be a PR firm hireling - either that, or you are playing along with and being fooled by a dangerous anti-american force, my friend. an anti-democratic force that runs the same scams over and over again using different actors, billionaires, family friends, sons, wives, people who are stupid enough to work for them, etc.</p>

<p>Time for you to think things through instead of falling for the same scams over and over again. Trump is false opposition, he&#39;s part of the incestuous, intermarried anti-democratic forces that have staged an anti-american revolution in our country.</p>

<p>while I personally have near-zero faith in politicians, the general idea behind Bernie supporters is that Bernie is the only one who isn&#39;t a Clinton family friend and campaign donor like Trump is, who&#39;s been set up and heavily promoted (eg given literal center-stage at debates) to &quot;run against&quot; a Clinton like Trump has, and Trump&#39;s doing nothing but making a fool out of all of you poor guys who keep falling for the same propaganda and emotional manipulation scams over and over again administered by a clique of powerful criminals and their families, donors, and friends (like Trump is to both Bush and Clinton families, to repeat for you).</p>

<p>Trump appears on the political scene at the exact moment a Clinton needs someone to control and split her opposition - eg tricking the stupid right wing idiots into following a fake ron paul, so that they never get their heads out of their asses and stop fighting the fake &quot;socialism&quot;(which we already live under, corporate and foreign state socialism and for wars based on lies, instead of tax money being used for americans). how stupid do you have to be to fall for that?</p>

<p>Trump is the repugnantcan version of Obama to trick the idiots and to split, disgrace, and discredit the &quot;anti-establishment&quot; sentiment brewing in America by connecting it to a combover billionaire asshole who wants to &quot;ban all the muslims and darn immigrants&quot; -- while the REAL dangerous immigrants (massive corporations) are the actual danger, and the real socialism is already administered for them by every political party -- but you&#39;re busy mocking and fighting against the only candidate who is talking about them or who has a record of action against them. Congrats on falling for that dude.</p>

<p>How can you not see what&#39;s going on here? He&#39;s only existing to split Clinton opposition and make &quot;anti-establishment&quot; people look like racists/extremists/all the other propaganda terms that are used to label you fools - but you aren&#39;t fools because of being racist, you&#39;re fools for falling for an obvious anti-democratic scam administered by billionaires and anti-american families who have run a coup in our country and who are now passing high office back and forth while tricking the stupid poor and middle classes who can&#39;t manage anything but to consent, cooperate, and participate in their own subjugation - while smiling and cheering at rallies, like North Koreans.</p>

<p>it blows my mind that people can fall for Trump after watching what happened to Ron Paul (and watching the same happen to Bernie this election) while Trump &quot;breaks through&quot; in every way and is given literal center-stage at mainstream debates and absolutely MASSIVE press coverage, &quot;o ya man, super real opposition to the establishment bro&quot;. LOL. You guys must be fake posters driven by PR firms hired by the repugnantcans and trump to trick the idiots just like the dumbocrats were tricked by Obama. This is why those darn smart people you hate so much don&#39;t support Trump, because it&#39;s an OBVIOUS SCAM to anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>&quot;the best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves&quot;</em> - VI Lenin (you know, one&#39;uh dem darn commies)</p>

<p>it&#39;s what happened in Russia and it&#39;s now   what is now happening here and you trumpers are supporting it all.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>it&#39;s so obvious I have a hard time believing people are really falling for it, but just like all the wars and lies everyone falls for, they will fall for this as well. they are easily tricked into being victims of the dangerous anti-democratic revolution currently unfolding in America - one that will continue whether Trump or Clinton &quot;wins&quot; this &quot;election&quot; between themselves.</p>

<p>welcome to reality and the real reasons why a great many people aren&#39;t stupid enough to believe donald trump is any meaningful political player. Trump and Clinton are just part of the emotional manipulation used to manage the masses. Neither will do anything for you or for America, except to weaken it and abuse it.</p>

<p>also, if you listen to alex jones, you should stop listening to alex jones and realize he&#39;s another example of &quot;the best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves&quot;.</p>

<p>We don’t give a shit. Of course we’re extremists. Of course we’re racists. Of course we’re those other propaganda terms. They don’t matter. Words don’t matter. They don’t mean anything. They don’t hurt us. THEY WON’T STOP US. IT’S FUCKING OVER FOR YOU. The thing about liberalism is that eventually they spend enough time antagonizing and attacking everybody who would disagree or even question them… they spend enough time tearing down everybody and shaming everybody and eventually their opponents come to a very simple conclusion. <strong><em>You want a bad guy? You’ve got one.</em></strong></p>

<p>And all of a sudden the shaming doesn’t work. All of a sudden the mockery gets thrown back twice as hard. All of a sudden calling someone an “-ism” isn’t winning the argument, it makes them look like a damn fool while their opponent doubles down and presses harder. Suddenly their tactics are being used against them and it hurts because they’ve never been on the receiving end. Suddenly they find themselves in the precarious position of having spent all of their time crying wolf. Now that someone has decided to ruin them, there is no one who cares that the pack is circling.</p>

<p>It’s a deep hole these people have dug, and we will be all too happy to bury them in it.</p>

<p>I used to value the idea of social programs, too; and then I started using Reddit for five years, and found out what many Socialists are really like.  Angry, self-righteous, mean-spirited human beings, who are utterly crippled by perpetual self-victimisation and envy.  Capitalism might be a depraved ethos, but Marxism is ultimately no less so.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been living with hippies for the last two years, and believe me when I say that collectivism really is not what it&#39;s cracked up to be.  Collectivist scenarios don&#39;t mean that the people involved with them magically lose their ego.  It simply means that ego battles get resolved in far more pathological ways, because the ideology usually will not allow even <strong><em>admitting</em></strong> that there <strong><em>is</em></strong> an ego battle in the first place.</p>

<p>I did a permaculture design course, and then I watched permaculture largely die in a head on collision with Capitalism, not to mention getting hijacked by Peak Oil whackjobs like Michael Ruppert, and the cult of Rudolph Steiner.  To paraphrase John Lennon, I&#39;ve well and truly tried giving peace a chance.  The entire thing is hollow; it&#39;s all just one giant lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The practical definition of unity, is having your most important life
decisions made by someone else.  Unity is a scenario where you voluntarily
give your own power away, in the name of peace.</p>

<p>We do not need unity.  Unity is not the answer; it&#39;s the opposite of what we
need.  If everyone stopped focusing their attention on what the government is
doing, and simply did their own thing, how would the government stop them?  Do
you really think it has sufficient manpower to do that?  The entire reason why
they have had to work so hard to brainwash people, is because they know full
well that said brainwashing is the only real power they have.</p>

<p>Understand something else.  All of the myths which the system has caused you
and me and the rest of us to believe, rest on irreduceable arguments.</p>

<p>Government is an inherent source of authority.  How?  Why?  Occasionally
someone will offer the Lockean argument, but Locke&#39;s social contract has never
existed in formal or de jure terms, literally anywhere on the planet.</p>

<p>Unity and/or world federalism is supposedly essential, and is the only hope
for large scale peace.  Why?  We are never told.  We are simply shown imagery
of Gandhi or Martin Luther King in association with this statement, and are
then expected to get tears in our eyes and turn our brains off.  Unity is
mandatory, end of story, case closed; and if you don&#39;t understand that, then
you are obviously an evil, unspiritual person, but again, don&#39;t bother asking
why that is.</p>

<p>I do not believe in unity any more, and the reason why, is because I have
never seen a single human group of any kind, anywhere, which does not have
some kind of hierarchy or power structure; even if, in the case of instant
return or hunter/gatherer societies, the only purpose of said power structure
is actually to prevent any other kind from developing.</p>

<p>You can not go anywhere there are other human beings, without finding someone
who wants to dominate you.  At this point I am completely certain of that.
Some of them are subtle about it.  Hippies try and pretend that there is no
hierarchy within communes, but when push comes to shove, you will always
ultimately find one person who owns the place, or thinks they do.  Same with
the Amish.  Sure, they&#39;re a spiritual community, but watch how fast you get
shunned if you don&#39;t tow the line.</p>

<p>So I do not want to be a member of a group with more than five people at the
most; and even then, I don&#39;t want to be dependent on any of those people for
my survival.  I do not want to sleep in the same room as anyone else, and I do
not want to eat with anyone else for the most part either, because the only
thing that those activities result in, is someone else using that as a basis
for controlling me.  I do not like cooking, but I will now gladly go and buy
salad sandwiches or cook eggs for dinner, in preference to having anyone else
cook for me, because unless I pay someone with money for that, I pay with my
freedom.</p>

<p>Again, I know that some of you will probably respond to this by saying that I
am a sick, selfish, evil human being; but what you very predictably will
<strong><em>not</em></strong> tell me, is <strong><em>why</em></strong> I am supposedly selfish and evil.  Is it so
wrong that I do not want to be the target of someone else&#39;s manipulative,
narcissistic control dramas?  I have seen far too many cases now, of people
who were supposedly enormously giving and compassionate, when the only reason
why they did any of it, was because they either wanted people to thank them,
or wanted to use that as a form of leverage, so that they could tell their
supposed beneficiaries what to do later on.</p>

<p>I have also seen how relentlessly vindictive and fundamentally rotten
Millennial collectivists are; how even the vaguest hint of ideological
non-compliance is used as an excuse for savage public mockery, and how the
only thing that matters to any of them is that they belong, yet they never
<strong><em>can</em></strong> truly belong, because they are constantly being tested for
ideological non-compliance, and unless they are literal zombies, they are
constantly failing those tests.</p>

<p>If you want &quot;unity,&quot; then you can have it.  I want none of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, extremely interesting post. I agree with a lot of what you&#39;re saying. I used to believe in unity myself and I still sort of do. You&#39;re right that no matter where you go there will always be someone trying to control others. But here&#39;s how I imagine it; If everyone was simply doing their own thing, like you mentioned in the first couple paragraphs, it would render govt useless. A unified Utopian future is where mostly everyone is aware they are in charge of their own life and sets out to pursue their passions and desires. Whatever they may be. If a majority is educated and responsible for themselves then those who try to rule over others or harm others are cast aside. They will be in such a small minority that their selfish, controlling, harmful desires would be easy to bring into the light and do something about. </p>

<p>This, to me, is the unity that I&#39;m optimistic about. Not some unifying group or govt that says, &quot;you must all be equal or else.&quot; That seems to defeat the purpose. It&#39;s more along the lines of, nearly every person fulfilling their individual responsibilities and helping each other as communities and (extended) families. We are already truly one with each other, it&#39;s an illusion that we&#39;re separate. If we work together to bring about this change, it will be easy to deal with those who want to go against this system. But that won&#39;t happen anytime soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s hard to know exactly how deep the rabbit hole goes. If you want my opinion, I think they&#39;re using Trump and Sanders as a means to completely polarise the population and obviously keep us fighting amongst ourselves. The issue with Trump is obvious, the issue with Sanders is that he&#39;s a proponent of big govt and govt is the reason we&#39;re in this shithole to begin with. I know it&#39;s not possible for him to accomplish all of the things his platform is based upon but I had some shred of hope that with leadership like him, we might actually swing the country in the right direction. Obviously not possible if he never becomes president. </p>

<p>I agree with your second statement, though. There are different factions or groups within the government that have different agendas and each different/varying levels of power and influence. I agree that she fucked with the wrong people and we might actually see something done about that because if you&#39;re in a position of power, they don&#39;t fuck with you unless you fuck with other people in power. But maybe to the intelligence faction, they don&#39;t really see her as a big threat, I could be wrong. I hope I&#39;m wrong. I want to see her indicted. But they may just take the hit if it would hurt them in the long run/big picture to indict their choice candidate. Who knows though? At this point it&#39;s all speculation until something real happens and right now we can only sit back and watch as these different factions within the govt fight it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Sanders supporter and like I said above, he is a proponent of big govt. Meaning, he&#39;s a fan of making the system of what got us into this mess even larger. In my opinion, this is not good. But he has a true moral compass and would hopefully lead the country in the right direction. But we do still have checks and balances and not everyone in the other branches of govt have the same moral code. So while the govt grows, the system still stays fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. It comes down to what you want out of life. It also helps to know that none of it matters anyways. You&#39;re going to lose all your possessions, any success, all your money when you die. So pursue what really makes your heart happy. In my case, that&#39;s drums and longboarding. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find other things I enjoy doing but for now those are good enough for me. It took me a long time to finally afford my own drumset and since then I&#39;ve never been happier. But I managed to take control of my life and I own my own business. I make decent enough money to pay the bills and put food in my belly but not enough to really save up or get a nice place for myself. But I am my own boss, I don&#39;t have to answer to anyone and it allows me the free time to do things that I would otherwise have to do to make money in a lower paying job. </p>

<p>Having more money would definitely give me the advantage to pursue other things that I may want to try or get into, such as skydiving or piloting or going into float tanks (sensory deprivation chambers), etc. But if I stressed over <em>not</em> being able to do those things yet, I wouldn&#39;t enjoy the time I&#39;m spending here in the present.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe we are anywhere near being fucked. You raise the topic of American politics and speak of it as being omnipotent. There are another 195 countries in this world that sit outside of the American political agenda. Yes you could argue that American influence spans the globe but that will stop real quick when peoples lives are at stake. I&#39;m talking about the 6 billion people living outside of a Trump or Hilary presidency. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories aside, when it comes time for people to fend for themselves (and it will) it won&#39;t be us who are fucked, it will be the establishment. You think cops are going to arrest you for stealing baby formula when they will be doing the same. </p>

<p>The common people will always win, but it won&#39;t happen until we are forced. That time will come, and the commoners will be victorious </p>
