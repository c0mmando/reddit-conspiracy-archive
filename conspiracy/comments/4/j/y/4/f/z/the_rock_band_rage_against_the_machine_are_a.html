       Hilary has already stolen this election.

        Rage just announced a countdown and a new website.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They only existed as a creative entity during the Clinton years.  And they never really had much to say about that slimeball president.   And they disappeared when there was a president, and a chain of events that were overtly worth 10 RATM albums.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet they're gearing up to do so again, because the election is already bought.  They'll rant about everything but the incoming war criminal president.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Edit:
      </p>
      <p>
       I need to say somewhere that this is just a theory that sprung to mind after I noticed a coincidence.   More of a "something to think about" than an idea that I am actually invested in.   I was a teenager in the 1990s, and a fan of their work then.   I'm interested to hear if they have new music, because their last album was really great, musically.  But, again, it is a coincidence worth paying attention to.)

       yea, i saw them live back in 08. I thought they were legitimate, revolutionary thinkers, pushing for change. Until I heard them spewing some nonsense about Obama changing America. I realized they're just a bunch of liberal dip shits then. Not really interested in changing anything, just pushing their side's agenda.

       It's probably just a coincidence, but a strange one at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think PE was brilliant and truly revolutionary.   I became skeptical of RATM when they disappeared for the Bush II years.   Hell, they should have released 8 albums between 2002 and 2004 alone.   There was more than enough fuel for song material.

       This is one of those things where neither the Clintons nor the band intentionally contributed to the rage being completely mis-directed and a decade too early. It happened, instead, because another band with a more encompassing message and during the right time period would not have been allowed to be in the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was in high school and college for the entire decade of the 90's. RATM was music which almost none of the audience who listened to it gave a shit about the Zapatistas or the federal reserve. The Government had done nothing but give us a great life.
      </p>
      <p>
       RATM's audience were rich white kids who had access to affordable college and jobs waiting for them in an economy that was booming during a time of (in the mainstream) little to no war or strife. The cold war had just ended, America had won! Bill could do no wrong (Lewinsky made sure no one really paid attention to what he was doing)! The economy was great! Pop culture was at its apex!
      </p>
      <p>
       It was all illusion, because the machine was working so well even the band didn't know how to properly rage against it.  They had legitimate complaints but they were largely about minority issues in a country that just didn't give a fuck about anybody who wasn't white.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is, the band had to sellout to the machine to even be heard in the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       The song during the closing credits of The Matrix works supremely well as an ironic wake-up call. I guess pop culture has been used to control the masses by appearing to be on their side while actually serving the ruling class. Shocking.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that the most apparent Matrix is a false one designed to lead those who seek to break free right to the entrance of the next... and so on. Enough layers and many will stop early, thinking they are finally free.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I agree with you, they are cashing in and aren't going to say anything truly disruptive or the label won't release their music or promote their tours or any of the shit they need from the machine to get what they want. Don't be too hard on them, though, they have good intentions. Almost everyone does...

       well fwiw, they were 'banned' from clear channel radio just after 9/11, so that partly explains their disappearance.

       This would make them a political tool of the Bushes, then.  But then you'd have to explain Tom Morello's solo career.

       I spent plenty of hours listening to RATM between 1993 and 2003, and I don't remember them saying much about ol' Wild Bill, especially in a hit single.   You

       Maybe this post might have better fit in fan theories or shower thoughts, but it was a passing thought on a coincidence that felt worth sharing with conspiracy heads.

       If it's a shitty post, the mods will take it down.  But it definitely seemed to rustle some jimmies around here, that's for sure.

       ...no, boner for factual statements.  The whole "conspiracy" community gets a slap in the face every time some idiot neglects ACTUAL things going on in the world, and instead spends time and energy blabbing on about moronic shit like this.

       I too find it peculiar that RATM was so suspiciously quiet during the absolute farce that was the 9/11 attacks and subsequent criminal invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq.

       They are a bunch of Marx reading, Che Guevera t-shirt wearing Trotsky-ites, who only managed to regurgitate the sentiments of the 1960's for the purpose of rousing socialist ideas in the minds of guilty liberal blowhards.

       Communism is not socialism and fuck yeah he would best you. He has lived social justice for pretty much his whole life. He would rock your world and I would pay to see it. Tom is a heavyweight.

       Socialism is how they sell communism to the ignorant masses.

       Your talking points fell right out of Rush Limbaugh's  asshole into the toilet of right wing talk radio. Don't even get me started. Just know you are on the wrong side of history and your antiquated ideas are dying with the boomers.

       I think Obama is a neoliberal shill slightly more palatable than Clinton and Limbaugh talks about his disillusionment with the Obama administration and liberals in general on a regular basis. I am far to the left of the DNC corporatists who are really center right on everything but social issues like LGBT rights but this isn't about me and you have zero chance of moving me from my admittedly radical positions. The point is Tom knows his shit and is well educated in theory and in practice. I think he would slaughter most people in a debate on the issues he cares about.

       The point is if you stand for state authority, whoever is running it, you stand for tyranny.

       It's so typical of you "leftist" state worshippers to paint all opposing viewpoints as "right-wing."
