    <div class="md"><p>Although you might be able to flee from the depravity and decadence of the West, there&#39;s a whole set of different problems you&#39;ll run into. These places still bear the scars and trauma from the communist era, which means crime, unemployment, faulty infrastructure, lack of quality goods at an affordable price, general distrust still permeating through every fabric of life, corruption, scammers, cheaters, despondency, boredom and general backwardedness are the trade-offs you&#39;d have to consider.</p>

<p>While there mightn&#39;t be any Arabs in f.e. Slovakia, there will be Roma (gypsies) which are just as bad, oftentimes even worse to deal with. </p>

<p>The languages are prohibitively difficult. Czech, Slovak, Polish, Serbo-Croatian, ... Unless you&#39;d take 4 years of intensive language courses full time in some university (that probably doesn&#39;t even exist) you wouldn&#39;t be able to master it properly. And even if you did, what would you do with it anyway? </p>

<p>Europe is not like the US where you can start over in 50 states if need be. If you&#39;re a native English speaker, your best bet might be Australia, Canada or New Zealand. </p>

<p>Everybody under 30 speaks English, and if they see you making an effort to speak Bulgarian they will LOVE you. Everybody there is so much more real and straight forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will be left alone in Chile to live your life however you want. That applies to everyone, including doomsday preppers, gay people, East German exiles, literal Nazis, everyone. Tolerance is practiced to a much greater extent than it is preached, as is tradition. That is a basic part of society - the tolerance of people PREDATES American influence despite however much you might wish to believe otherwise.</p>

<p>On top of that society is the American-run oligarchy in control of the government. I&#39;m sure you know that Chile&#39;s government is one of the US&#39;s star examples in how to create a neoliberal slave state in which corporate and government power is merged. You&#39;ll never be able to earn enough money in Chile to support the lifestyle you&#39;re used to in the west, but on the other hand if you come in with outside money it&#39;s a low target to buy into being part of the elite class (compared to other developed or near-developed countries). Fortunately, unlike in other western countries subjected to this model, Chile&#39;s government for all its faults actually does demonstrate fiscal responsibility.</p>

<p>What does that leave you with? A cultural war for the future of the nation. The first generation of consumers are coming of age, and many of their parents have been successfully &quot;converted&quot;, but they are finding out the materialism-based western lifestyle advertised to them is not attainable in the same way as it is in the US, and the consumer debt crisis (and the student debt crisis) has arisen as a result.</p>

<p>It seems unthinkable to people from western countries that nothing will change, but remember this is Latin America, and at the end of the day Chile was bought out by the west during Pinochet&#39;s reign, and this makes it incapable of deciding on its own future in the face of global corporate interests who only want to see &quot;stability&quot;. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the backdrop you would be living in, and like I said if you accept the premise that Chileans cannot be blamed for the machinations of the world elite, you can live a very happy life here in a society that values privacy and personal freedoms to a very large extent. <strong>In the end I think you&#39;ll find that no matter where you go in the world, the same old group of globalist figures will rear their ugly heads, just in different forms.</strong> Chile won&#39;t save you from them, Bulgaria won&#39;t save you from them, the Baltic states won&#39;t save you from them. Latin American people in general are experts at ignoring their bought and paid for governments to the maximum extent possible, and that may not be the perfect permanent solution, but it&#39;s at least a workable solution considering the circumstances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am an American expat living in Prague for almost three years now. It is cultured, great life style, civil polite people although a little too serious for American tastes. Homogeneous white population. Czech is impossible, but many speak English well. You have to slow down and simplify your speech which can get a little frustrating. </p>

<p>Hardly ever see police, public space is generally safe and the whole region is beautiful. Prague is idyllic, whimsical, nicely preserved and just fun.  Far better place than most of America. Gateway to rest of Europe, it is all close. Housing is affordable for the quality as is cost of living. One would need an alternative source of income or savings as wages are lower.  Challenges are surmountable, I rate A or A minus and have no desire to return to US. </p>

Clearly, You have never been to Europe, eastern or otherwise.
I do a LOT of travelling back and forth between USA, EU and Asia - there is a difference in multiculturalism/diversity/sexuality between the three regions, but it&#39;s nearly hilarious to see such an cretinous statement:</p>

<p>Take a trip to Prague, or Dubrovnik, or Vilnius then come back and honestly tell me you saw no evidence of Homosexuality or multiculturalism.</p>
