<p>It was the reason for WWI. Germany’s attempt to divorce herself from a fiat banking system is what caused WWII.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let’s take a look. I’m lifting this straight from somewhere; I forget who wrote it.</p>

<p>Patton realized late in the war that the United States fought the wrong country. Patton felt the US should have sided with Germany to destroy Jewish Bolshevik/Communist USSR. This information comes from Patton&#39;s diary entries, letters he wrote to his wife, and comments he made to military officers and staff.</p>

<p>World War II was incredibly complex. However, in the final analysis, WWII was essentially a war between two competing ideologies: Nationalism -vs- Jewish Internationalism/globalism. Adolf Hitler and his allies fought to preserve the concept of nationalism–not just for Germans, but for all peoples. Nationalism means the sovereignty of an ethnic people and the right thereof–within their own bordered country–to self-determination. What is meant by self-determination? An ethnic people preserving their unique culture &amp; heritage and pursuing their collective goals as a unique people. This applies to any ethnic peoples: Nigerians, Germans, Swedes, Vietnamese, Mexicans, Tibetans, etc.</p>

<p>On the other side of WWII was Jewish (Bolshevik) Internationalism (known today as globalism). In the 1920s, ’30s, and during WWII, powerful Jewish Internationalists were fervently advancing the Jewish worldview of eventually eliminating all nations… except for a Jewish homeland… (what became Israel after WWII in 1948). Today we see that nothing has changed; Jewish Internationalism/globalism still works toward gradually “merging” all peoples of the world (particularly in the Western World) into one globalist system with a global government, global laws, global culture, global bank, global currency, etc. In short, Jewish globalism (i.e., the weakening and eventual elimination of all nations) is the ideological opposite of Nationalism (i.e., a world composed of nations–specifically, ethnically homogenous and bordered nations). The Allied powers of WWII (led by Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, et. al.) were tools of International Jewry and thus de facto fighting for the Jewish globalist worldview. After the Allies won WWII in 1945, International Jewish forces were then free to exercise a Jewish &#39;Sphere of Influence&#39; over the greater Western world (and, as we see today, increasingly over the rest of the world).</p>

<p>If Hitler had won World War II and then exercised a Nationalist &#39;Sphere of Influence&#39; over the greater Western world, we’d have a more just, fair, and moral Western world today. The rest of the world would have similarly benefited had the Germans been victorious, since German influence would have surely spread elsewhere (ideas such as non-usurious banking and strong family oriented culture would likely have spread globally).</p>

<p>Had Hitler won World War II, what would be different in the postwar world? Here are a few examples:</p>

<p><strong>1. No USSR</strong> (the Soviet government murdered roughly 30 million of its own people during its 70 year reign–to study this topic, read the writings of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn; Hitler would have liberated the constituent republics of the USSR from communism, setting up buffer states in the Baltic, Ukraine (Germany would annex Crimea), and Belarus regions.</p>

<p><strong>2. No Cold War</strong> (because there would be no USSR).</p>

<p><strong>3. No communist Eastern Europe</strong>/Iron Curtain (when WWII ended, Eastern Europe fell to communism–this was part of Stalin’s spoils of war).</p>

<p><strong>4. No Red China</strong> and Mao’s subsequent killing of 40-60 million Chinese (the USSR created favorable conditions for Mao’s communists, ultimately leading to Mao’s victory over Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists in 1949. Without a USSR, Mao probably would not have won).</p>

<p><strong>5. No communist North Vietnam</strong> (both the Soviet Union and Red China aided Ho Chi Minh).</p>

<p><strong>6. No communist Cambodia</strong> and Pol Pot&#39;s slaughter of 2 million Cambodians (Red China aided Pol Pot).</p>

<p><strong>7. No Korean division</strong> and no Korean War (the Allies split Korea after WWII ended, North Korea became communist–another of Stalin’s spoils of war).</p>

<p><strong>8. No communist Cuba</strong> (given the previous, what support would Castro have had in the 1950s?).</p>

<p><strong>9. No communism anywhere</strong> (Hitler was the world’s most fervent anti-Communist).</p>

<p><strong>10. Liberalism &amp; multiculturalism wouldn’t dominate Western ethos</strong> (both are Jewish creations and both have always been heavily promoted/advanced by Jews. Without Jewish influence, no liberalism and no multiculturalism–at least certainly to nowhere near the degree we see today).</p>

<p><strong>11. No Cultural Marxism</strong> and no political correctness (these are social engineering tools which came out of the Jewish think tank known as the Frankfurt School).</p>

<p><strong>12. No third world immigration</strong> into Western nations (Jews wouldn’t be in positions of power to craft and illegally enforce liberal immigration laws. Jews are responsible for each and every Western nation’s immigration policy/laws, as all were orchestrated by a consortium consisting of the World Jewish Congress, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and B’nai B’rith).</p>

<p><strong>13. No depraved filth on TV, in movies, etc.</strong> (because Jews wouldn’t run Hollywood).</p>

<p><strong>14. No widespread pornography</strong> (Jewish lawyers and Jewish activists were the main challengers of anti-obscenity laws under the guise of “freedom of speech”).</p>

<p><strong>15. There would still be prayer in public schools</strong> (Jewish lawyers were instrumental in banning prayer to Jesus in public schools under the guise of so-called “separation of church and state,” something that appears nowhere in the US Constitution).</p>

<p><strong>16. No man-hating radical feminist movement</strong> (Jews such as Betty Friedan, Sonia Pressman, and Gloria Steinem, among others, were the key drivers of radical feminism).</p>

<p><strong>17. No Israel</strong> and all the problems it has brought the USA and the immeasurable misery it has wrought the Palestinians.</p>

<p><strong>18. Jews would be living in Madagascar</strong> (perhaps) and would be carefully monitored (Madagascar was one place Hitler considered as a Jewish homeland).</p>

<p>Was World War II “the good war” as is often claimed? No, it was exactly the opposite. <strong>The Allied victory marked the beginning of the end of Western Civilization.</strong></p>

<p>The Ukrainians, specifically, absolutely loved the Nazis when they rolled into the USSR and liberated them from the Bolsheviks. Much of Eastern Europe felt the same way.</p>

<p>You brought up the idea that there would be a refutation to what I have said, and yet since you have none and can’t disagree with the primary sources (which support my statements), yes, I blamed you for being what you so obviously are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are theories that Hitler was Catholic and controlled by the Vatican and Jesuits, in order to continue the Catholic prophecy. In order to do this, Israel must be created.</p>

<p>Third Reich is really the extension of the Holy Roman Empire:</p>

<p>The name given by the Nazis to their government in Germany; Reich is German for “empire.” Adolf Hitler, their leader, believed that he was creating a third German empire, a successor to the Holy Roman Empire and the German empire formed by Chancellor Bismarck in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>As you&#39;re unable to shake your heritage, choosing instead to deflect away from that heritage.  It&#39;s becoming more and more obvious.  The other day I witnessed you attempt to argue that because someone had &quot;sources&quot; their laughable opinion mattered somehow more.  Nothing to the credibility of the references.  Simply selling the value of having ANY source.  The head is shaking.</p>
