    <div class="md"><p>I saw that pic earlier and I don&#39;t really see a Mason grip there. </p>

<p>Another problem with the whole theory is the top sentence of that article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you shake hands, the thumb naturally extends upward or straight ahead. When it points downward, you are signalling that you are a member of the world&#39;s largest satanic cult, Freemasonry, and are committed to its goal of world government under the anti Christ.  - </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that&#39;s just not true. There is no universal handshake among human beings. Everyone&#39;s hand is different and everyone&#39;s handshake can be different from shake to shake depending on the other person&#39;s hand. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy that Hitler was a Mason at all, honestly. A lot of Masonry is steeped is Jewish/kabbalahistic tradition, which doesn&#39;t seem like Hitler&#39;s cup of tea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not entirely sure. But the more you dig, the more likely it seems. Especially for a few reasons:</p>

<p>1- Nobody&#39;s been back. Russia would spend $60 billion on the Olympics but not less than that to send a guy to the moon? </p>

<p>2- If you look at the landing module pix, there&#39;s never any stirred up dust on the legs of the unit, they remain pristine. And there&#39;s no rupture in the ground at all where you&#39;d think some kind of blast would leave some kind of marking.</p>

<p>3- How great some of pictures came out, how appropriately placed, considering how rudimentary the cameras were and how hard it was to hold them.</p>

<p>4- The weird way the transmissions were transmitted from the moon to NASA to TV stations. </p>

<p>5- The flawlessness of every trip with no practice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny....yes, it is depressing at first but when you bust out on the other side it&#39;s very freeing and almost amusing. The whole of our culture and most of our history is a giant fucking scam. Many of your fellow humans, you realize, actually do seem little better than cattle. One you reach this point, it&#39;s easy to let go of so much meaningless stuff, reach a sort-of zen. Going back to church helped me, not saying that it will work for you, but it definitely made me realize this is all some kind of test/game/proving ground and the stuff that the fake culture tells you matters completely does not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand, but I just feel like everything is so pointless, so rigged, so impure. I try to wake up those around me, but usually it just goes in one year and out the other. It&#39;s frustrating. Should I just keep these things to myself and I will naturally gravitate towards like minded individuals? Does it really even matter that much whether people are awake or not, since the situation is hopeless? Is the situation really as hopeless as it seems?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does feel that way, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s that way everywhere, just in the West. I would recommend gravitating towards like-minded individuals. I&#39;m always reminded of that great line near the end of &quot;Heaven&#39;s Gate&quot;: &quot;You can&#39;t force salvation on people.&quot; That&#39;s what it is. People have to reach for it themselves. The problem is that the inherent cancer of corrupt capitalism and materialism makes that very difficult. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if things are as hopeless as they seem. It seems like life is a struggle, and that&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be and always has been. But it&#39;s not like there&#39;s NO joy in the world. I have friends, some of them very good and close and trustworthy. I have loved ones. Some entertainment still brings me pleasure.</p>

<p>Honestly, see if you can find a good church or other place of faith worship. You will find other good people. It took me a while, but I prayed hard, and when I was near wits end I just started walking one rainy Sunday morning until I reached a church and, lo and behold, the pastor was an in-tune guy and it really helped my soul. I don&#39;t want to lecture, but I&#39;d sincerely recommend starting with prayer and see where it gets you.</p>

<p>I appreciate your outreach. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Nobody&#39;s been back</p>
</blockquote>

<p>China sent a rover recently. The US has sent several missions to map the moon from its orbit. No people have set foot on the moon since Apollo because it&#39;s really not worth it except for the bragging rights, but we&#39;ve definitely been back.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been some traction over the past decade or so in the idea that a lunar observatory might make sense. I&#39;m hoping that goes somewhere, but beyond that, going to the moon is much more of a &quot;to say we did it&quot; endevour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you look at the landing module pix, there&#39;s never any stirred up dust on the legs of the unit, they remain pristine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not shocking. The metals that they used for radiation shielding (the stuff that looks like gold foil) almost certainly would become charged, so either you select material that will become charged in such a way that it will attract dust or repel it, and the former would be disastrous, so you pretty much have to go for the latter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How great some of pictures came out</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the year, some of the pictures were astounding. Even the live feeds were pretty awesome, and the film they brought back was even better (not surprisingly). But nothing was beyond my expectations for the day. Ansel Adams was creating much more impressive work before Apollo ever lifted off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The weird way the transmissions were transmitted from the moon to NASA to TV stations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see why this is surprising.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The flawlessness of every trip with no practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We blew up an entire mission of astronauts, nearly lost a second and had dozens of minor failures that were recoverable. How are you defining &quot;flawless&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The correlation between major Vietnam military incursions and moon shots</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cite an actual statistical correlation (not just the positive correlation, but the lack of a negative correlation) and I&#39;d buy it. Otherwise, this is just confirmation bias at work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, no there aren&#39;t. There are bad pictures of clumsy handshakes. But, that being said, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me all that much. Hitler was notorious for shutting down Lodges and imprisoning their members (tens of thousands of Freemasons were sent to camps wearing the red triangle of political prisoners), and in that time, I&#39;m sure he confiscated enough material about the degrees to have learned about them, so he probably <em>did</em> know more about Freemasonry than the average person on the street, and if he demonstrated something in specific, I would not have been shocked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, when two of us shake hands with each other, we destabilize the community with feminism. Very source; so Mason. :-)</p>

<p>Seriously, though, all of the various &quot;Freemason handshake&quot; claims out there are utterly false (as far as I&#39;ve seen in the hundreds I&#39;ve looked at). The thing is, it&#39;s a very, very rare Freemason who&#39;s dumb enough to give any kind of mode of recognition in public. Why would I ever do that?</p>

<p>Even more so, if you&#39;re in the public eye / at a public event, that&#39;s the last thing you would ever do. The modes of recognition are there as a symbolic tool for the degrees. It&#39;s not a cocktail party greeting.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve shaken the hand of dozens of Masons in public. I&#39;ve never exchanged any sort of mode of recognition in those circumstances.</p>

<p>My first paragraph was meant to be silly. Humor is necessary when digesting absurd claims. As for being a Freemason, well, there is no way for me to satisfy a non-Mason that I am a Brother, but that doesn&#39;t change the validity of what I&#39;ve said. Assume what you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny....yes, it is depressing at first but when you bust out on the other side it&#39;s very freeing and almost amusing. The whole of our culture and most of our history is a giant fucking scam. Many of your fellow humans, you realize, actually do seem little better than cattle. One you reach this point, it&#39;s easy to let go of so much meaningless stuff, reach a sort-of zen. Going back to church helped me, not saying that it will work for you, but it definitely made me realize this is all some kind of test/game/proving ground and the stuff that the fake culture tells you matters completely does not.</p>
