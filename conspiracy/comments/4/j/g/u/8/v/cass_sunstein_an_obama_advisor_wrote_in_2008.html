      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How  might  this  tactic  work?  Recall  that  extremist  networks  and  groups,  including  the  groups  that  purvey  conspiracy theories,  typically  suffer  from  a  kind  of  crippled  epistemology. Hearing  only  conspiratorial  accounts  of  government  behavior,  their   members   become   ever   more   prone   to   believe   and   generate   such   accounts.  Informational and reputational cascades, group polarization, and selection effects suggest that the generation of ever-more-extreme views within these groups can be dampened or reversed  by  the  introduction  of  cognitive  diversity.    We  suggest  a  role  for  government efforts,  and  agents,  in  introducing  such  diversity.
        <strong>
         Government  agents  (and  their  allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.
        </strong>
        In  one  variant,  government  agents  would  openly  proclaim,  or  at  least  make  no effort  to  conceal,  their  institutional  affiliations.    A  recent  newspaper  story  recounts  that  Arabic-speaking   Muslim   officials   from   the  State   Department   have   participated   in  dialogues at radical Islamist chat rooms and websites in order to ventilate arguments not usually heard among the groups that cluster around those sites, with some success.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         In another  variant,  government  officials  would  participate  anonymously  or  even  with  false identities.
        </strong>
        Each  approach  has  distinct  costs  and  benefits;  the second  is  riskier  but potentially  brings  higher  returns. In  the  former  case, where  government  officials participate openly as such, hard-core members of the relevant networks, communities and conspiracy-minded organizations may entirely discount what the officials say, right from the beginning.  The risk with tactics of anonymous participation, conversely, is that if the tactic becomes known, any true member of the relevant groups who raises doubts may be 
suspected  of  government  connections.    Despite  these difficulties,  the  two  forms  of cognitive  infiltration  offer  different  risk-reward  mixes  and are  both  potentially  useful instruments.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         There  is  a  similar  tradeoff  along  another  dimension: whether  the  infiltration should  occur  in  the  real  world,  through  physical  penetration  of  conspiracist  groups  by undercover agents, or instead should occur strictly in cyberspace.
        </strong>
        The latter is safer, but potentially  less  productive.  The  former  will  sometimes  be  indispensable,  where  the  groups  that  purvey  conspiracy theories  (and  perhaps  themselves  formulate  conspiracies) formulate  their  views  through  real-space  informational  networks  rather  than  virtual networks.  Infiltration of any kind poses well-known risks:
        <strong>
         perhaps agents will be asked to  perform  criminal  acts  to  prove  their  bona fides,  or  (less  plausibly)  will  themselves become  persuaded  by  the  conspiratorial  views  they  are  supposed  to  be  undermining
        </strong>
        ; perhaps agents will be unmasked and harmed by the infiltrated group.

       Very interesting that this would be called out as a specific concern. Reads as if the risk is really "our disinfo agents might figure out which theories about us are actually true"
