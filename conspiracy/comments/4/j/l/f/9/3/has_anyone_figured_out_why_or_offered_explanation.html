    <div class="md"><p>Says the blatant apologist trying to use the shill rag Infowars as a resource.  Talk about laughable.  Who then provides no evidence showing that ANYONE BUT CRAFT INTERNATIONAL WAS OUTFITTED WITH PRESSURE COOKER SIZED BACKPACKS IN THE DIRECT VICINITY OF THE FIRST EXPLOSION.  Mind you, in the exact same location they announced they would be detonating a training device prior to the first explosion.  </p>

<p>The Boston Bombing HOAX was not believable.  You are not believable.  All you have to support your asinine claims that officials didn&#39;t directly detonate the alleged terrorist devices at the Boston Marathon is an article from the pro-zionist shill Alex Jones.  That, and cries about everyone else has &quot;no counter-argument then, just ad hominem attacks!&quot;  Oh, poor you.  People aren&#39;t going to waste their time debating with people who are clearly only posting apologist replies.  You know everything, every little detail, but when pressed, as expected, you have <strong>nothing</strong> to back your apologist claims up with.  </p>

<p>Another entirely fabricated story. The sole evidence for this &quot;controlled detonation&quot; story is a Tweet that was actually sent <a href="https://storify.com/dkiesow/the-controlled-explosion-farce">after the bombs went off</a>.  Seems that some people are just too dumb to understand how time zones work. </p>

<p>The evidence for Boston being any kind of staged event is basically non-existent. It&#39;s a mix of false claims, like the one of yours I just debunked, poorly interpreted events and <em>post-facto</em> attempts to connect it to a training exercise that was actually months later. </p>

<p>This tired time zone lie doesn&#39;t work.  Time-stamped 12:53, some what, 20 minutes prior to their planned actual detonation?  Someone still outside of the decision the craft international staff were going to take the drill live tweeted what they heard.  An internal notification of the upcoming stages blast.</p>

<p>If your blatant lie here were true, perhaps they would have actually detonated EVEN ONE suspect device.  They didn&#39;t.  Your lie instantly crumbles upom even the lightest scrutiny.</p>

<p>Guess I was right when I said: &quot;Some people are just too dumb to understand how time zones work.&quot; Let me explain this in detail. Hover over the date/time of the Teeet on that page. You&#39;ll see a pop-up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time posted: 15 April 2013, 19:53:32 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can also be confirmed if you pull up <a href="https://twitter.com/BostonGlobe/status/323886829596205056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">the original Tweet</a>, view the source code for the page, pull out the &quot;data-time&quot; field [1366055612], which is the Linux timestamp, and <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1366055612+linux+time">convert that</a>.</p>

<p>Boston in April uses Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT), which is four hours behind UTC. So, the time of the tweet was actually 3:53pm. Well AFTER the bombs went off - the rest of your claims then fall apart like the poorly-constructed house of cards they are. </p>

<p>There was <strong>absolutely no mention</strong> of them detonating a training device prior to the explosion. It flat-out DID NOT HAPPEN. </p>

<p>More apologist lies.  An answer for everything, yet complete and total nonsense.  The timestamp doesn&#39;t lie.  It was just prior to the explosion at the finish line.  The Globe was definitely on the scene.  If the tweet is referring to a different device being detonated at the Library, show us a detonation after the library.  </p>

<p>Because there absolutely was an explosion directly at the library.  And the Boston Globe called it.  We refer to this training device being exploded as &quot;Bomb #1.&quot; </p>

<p>You&#39;re right about that, but...</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As proved beyond all doubt above, it wasn&#39;t. The bombs went off at 2:49 pm. The Tweet went out at 3:53 pm. You are simply wrong. End of story. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because there absolutely was an explosion directly at the library. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Presumably you can show me an entire roster of eyewitness reports confirming an explosion &quot;directly at the library&quot;? Because there were, literally, hundreds of thousands of people present. And, yet, I&#39;ve heard no-one say they heard or saw this supposed explosion you claim &quot;absolutely&quot; happened. Odd. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the Boston Globe called it. We refer to this training device being exploded as &quot;Bomb #1.&quot; </p>

<p>Again, proven completely false, there&#39;s absolutely no evidence this &quot;training device&quot; ever existed.</p>

<p>Finally, you know who was among the first to make this mistake about the timezones, pronounce it a &quot;training exercise&quot;, and is largely responsible for this myth? That would be your <a href="https://twitter.com/RealAlexJones/status/323903309603823617">&quot;Zionist shill&quot; friend Alan Jones</a> whose mistakes you are repeating. </p>

<p>Actually, it&#39;s you who &quot;keep claiming this&quot;. You said, and I quote, &quot;there absolutely was an explosion directly at the library...  We refer to this training device being exploded as &quot;Bomb #1.&quot;&quot;  </p>

<p>So, prove it. Where are the eyewitness reports of this happening, as you claim, before the finish-line bombs went off? Where is the video footage of this? All it seems you have is a solitary Tweet - one conclusively proven as sent an hour AFTER the bombs - and the false claims of someone you called a &quot;Zionist shill&quot; in this very thread. </p>

<p>I trust you understand why this seems thoroughly unconvincing. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re telling the truth (which isnquite clear that you&#39;re not), I&#39;ll ask it again.  Where and when did they safely detonate the explosive announced by the Globe?  There was only one solitary explosion that EVER occurred at the library.  The tweet perfectly described its timing and location.  </p>

<p>No other devices were found.  No other devices were safely detonated in that area.  You&#39;re a liar.  And not even a good one.  It&#39;s just sad.  The same nonsense repeated over and over.  As wrong as the very first time it slimed out of that lying weasel mouth.</p>

<p>YOU are the only one claiming this happened. The Boston Globe Tweet - sent an hour AFTER the explosions - was a garbled report apparently based on them misinterpreting an entirely separate incident, a fire <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/04/15/jfk-library-evacuated-after-explosion-fire-polie-probe-possible-link-marathon-blast/4gQintGxnUv8he2Ul8THLI/story.html">at the JFK library</a>, several miles away. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s review your various claims in this thread.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they announced they would be detonating a training device prior to the first explosion. </p>

<p>No, they didn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time-stamped 12:53, some what, 20 minutes prior to their planned actual detonation</p>

<p>Flat-out wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because there absolutely was an explosion directly at the library.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This simply never happened.</p>

<p>There was no training exercise on the day. There&#39;s no evidence Craft International were present, or that this was a &quot;drill gone live&quot;. You&#39;re repeating unproven and/or false statements from your &quot;Zionist shill&quot;, which don&#39;t stand up to scrutiny. </p>
