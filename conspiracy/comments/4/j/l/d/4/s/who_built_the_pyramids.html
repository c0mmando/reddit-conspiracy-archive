    <div class="md"><p>One of the best explanation was the used of Waterway to float the blocks in place. We have found the causeway that would have been used for that purpose. However, for the Nile to be at the end of it would require to push back the date of the construction by multiples thousand of years, since the riverbed has drifted quite a bit over the millennial. But it would explain why there is no hieroglyph inside the pyramid (and no the painted graffiti doesn&#39;t count). There is a clear lost of stone cutting technique over time instead of a improvement.     </p>

Nevertheless the lack of carved hieroglyphs has never been explained properly (at least to my satisfaction :) especially if you compare the great pyramid to any of their supposed contemporary temples and tombs. As for the 1 cartouche they found, it&#39;s a painted graffiti.

    <div class="md"><p>They are certainly far older than generally believed. In my opinion there have been multiple ancient civilizations that may or may not have been entirely human as we know it. It&#39;s not crazy to think some of these civilizations had as much or more time to develop than us, and while their technology may have been completely different and unknown to us, it allowed them to accomplish a great deal. </p>

<p>While the current human race will likely poison the earth to a point of destroying itself, the other ancient cultures likely died off to a cataclysmic event, or maybe even left this planet behind. We really don&#39;t know just how advanced these people were, not just technologically, but spiritually as well. Spirituality holds little merit in today&#39;s society, but it may have held the key to manipulating space-time and matter with minds that were less limited by the constraints of perceived reality.  </p>

<p>The video above will give you an idea. I know that Vedic brahmanas would be trained since birth to perfectly utter certain mantras that could affect their surroundings...even change weather patterns. They did this by envoking the frequencies that nature uses to cause events. There is a vedic mantra that makes it guaranteed that a cow would give birth to a cow (instead of a bull...so they could get milk) when uttered at the right time to a pregnant cow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your gross equivocation of matter and frequency ends any further discussion with you. This is all some form of new age garbage, mass and energy are equivalents, not energy and frequency. Mass and energy can be expressed as a function of frequency just like you&#39;re a function of your height and age. But you are not, as a totality of your being, 180 lbs. &#39;Who are you? I am 1 second sir!&#39; That semantically and logically makes no sense. I strongly urge you to take a class and basic harmonics, physics, or even wave functions before you continue talking about this. Even if I assume you meant the de Broglie wavelength (and that&#39;s a big if) of y chromosome spermatazoa, <a href="http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?&amp;amp;id=111264&amp;amp;ver=11">the difference between that and the x chromosome containing spermatozoa is on the order of tenths picograms at the most.</a> It&#39;s actually 0.025 pg. But the mass of a normal sperm cell is 2.2×10<sup>−14</sup> kg. So the de Broglie analysis is as follows:</p>

<p>Briefly, frequency = Planck&#39;s constant/(velocity * mass). Therefore, f = (6.62607004 × 10<sup>-34</sup> m<sup>2</sup> kg/s)/(4.16667*10<sup>-5</sup> m/s<sup>SpermSpeed</sup> * 2.2×10<sup>−14</sup> kg). That gives us 7.228 * 10<sup>-16</sup> . If one sperm has an X chromosome and another a Y, then their frequency difference (using a sperm mass difference of .025 pg) is 7.056 * 10<sup>-17.</sup> To give you an idea of how mind-numbingly small this scale is, this is on the order of how big a virus is. If you&#39;re seriously suggesting that someone could chant and separate out virus sized differences in sperm, then you&#39;re so far removed from reality that I really hope you get professional help. I mean, why would there be diseases at all then? Couldn&#39;t they just &#39;denature&#39; the viruses and bacteria with chants? Why stop there, let&#39;s go ahead and apply chanting to material science to discover new composite materials. Better yet, let&#39;s just all chant to control diffusion in the atmosphere and localize all the carbon to one tiny spot in the woods where on one lives. </p>

<p>And don&#39;t get me started on how these &quot;chanting waves&quot; would get diffracted almost immediately and never make it through to the uterus of any animal. </p>

<p>I am guessing you don&#39;t even have a firm understanding of what energy is but instead think of it as an ethereal ball of light. And you keep saying the word frequency like it means something, but you&#39;re just using it as a buzz word. I hope I helped you understand how asinine thinking any of this is true is and if I didn&#39;t, well I just wasted 20 minutes typing out a response to an idiot. Which makes me an idiot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen - I never claimed to BELIEVE any of this. I simply argued against your point claiming there would not be the requisite genetic material to produce offspring in reply to my initial pondering. If you look at the comment you had replied to I used a big &quot;IF - &quot; . These threads are about entertaining ideas - regardless of their validity because there is no way to prove nor disprove the claims of the vedics at this point in time. FFS we&#39;re in a thread discussing who built the pyramids outside of the historical narrative that we&#39;ve been taught, including everything from aliens to supposed supercivilizations. People in here are discussing levitation using chanting and you think that my suggestion is unrealistic in this subsetting - at least it was an attempt to apply the suggested vedic principles to our understanding of biology. Yes, there is a difference between Y and X chromosomal spermatozoa, regardless of how small that difference is, it is one that is exploitable. Is it realistic? Probably not - but was it worth pondering in relation to the original statement? Maybe. Why not? What&#39;s the harm? I mean, aside from getting your bloodpressure up. </p>

<p>There is a lot to be said about energy being represented as a wavelength - I&#39;m not sure what has your panties in a knot, but I&#39;ve taken classical and quantum physics alike, both of which describe this phenomenon and have yet to be united under some overarching theory - so if you&#39;re arguing that the science is concrete then you might as well be arguing that the sun revolves around us and not vice versa. If you&#39;re unable to entertain and play with ideas that you don&#39;t believe (based on what you believe to know) then you&#39;re missing a huge part of the discovery within science. And that&#39;s where your idiocy lies. But I did enjoy your rant - I could&#39;ve written it myself 5 years ago, before I starting taking things less seriously. </p>
