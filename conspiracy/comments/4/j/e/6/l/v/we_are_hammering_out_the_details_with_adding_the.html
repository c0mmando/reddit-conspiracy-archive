       This post here was very popular, for good reasons that are probably different for everyone.  So at some point in the future we will be adding it to the sidebar in one format or another.

       <strong>
        Looks like the best way to do it is going to be as a wiki page, so that it can be updated/maintained by multiple contributors instead of just one user.

       If they didn't we would label it as a confirmed conspiracy so they will have to make it anyways. Some things work in very strange ways :)

       We'd need to add a lot more confirmed stuff onto it, otherwise it's more of a limited hangout.  In my opinion it's OK to have such a fixture in the sidebar, but it would need to be expanded and not under the control of one user, otherwise it leaves the sub vulnerable, I would prefer to see the mods put together a more comprehensive list, under mod control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also most of the links go to Wikipedia, that means outsiders can come in and 'cleanup' the information whenever they wish, really we could do with each 'confirmed conspiracy' posted in a place which cannot be interfered with, certainly not on Wikipedia.

       Very good points. The definition of "confirmed" is itself unclear. Also many, perhaps even most, officially confirmed conspiracies  are limited hangouts - where the real conspirators (and their intentions) are concealed behind some hapless patsie or faceless terrorist group.

       OK, how about you provide a precise definition of what a "confirmed" conspiracy is. Don't forget to tell us which organisations you think have such authority and credibility to declare something a conspiracy, that we should accept it as "confirmation" without question.

       Smart move is to start with all the "project" programs that have been declassified over the years... The bluebeams, MK-Ultras, Gladios, Tonkins, Manhattan Projects... there's five exceptionally easy ones right there...

       What's your point? Is the point to compile a list of every single conspiracy in the history of mankind, or give people a starting step as to open their minds to the possibility of these things happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       They're all confirmed as happening right? Despite public opinion claiming the contrary for an extending period of time, while also grouping those who claimed its truth as "crazy"?
      </p>
      <p>
       So in 3 minutes I've given you a list of things that were thought to be conspiracy that were fact, and were de-classified by the same organizations who actually conducted these projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, I'll be happy to provide the definition of "confirmed" since everyone else seems to have issues with it.

       No, I think it's important we establish which conspiracies go on this list using
       <strong>
        objective

       I'm with you on this. If you can't get everyone to read the "confirmed conspiracies" and universally agree, it makes the judgement of the entire sub look stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if as a group we are going to stake our "reputation" on all of the info necessary to "confirm" a conspiracy, you better get it right!
      </p>
      <p>
       If we were smart, we would have had the definition years ago so we could be gathering information to fit a strong definition of "confirmed."

       confirmed and repost it as your own.  Call it 'revised' whatever.  It won't hurt my feelings.  Go for it.  It would be interesting to see what you remove and why

       Since reddit has a very real TEXT blob character limit, it's not going to be possible to capture them all.  We could create a list by country and do USA conspiracies and Italian ones, Canadian ones, etc.   Or international ones...  It could get complicated.  I think the idea is that it's a tool to copypasta on any fool who dares to say "oh you conspiracy theorist!"... to make them eat their words

        Confirmed is if wikipedia says it's confirmed, because that is the establishment admitting it was a conspiracy---because wikipedia has been outed as controlled by the establishment by at least 3 people verifying that fact here including myself on

       How many unrelated whistleblowers does it take for you to be convinced it's confirmed?  2, 3, 10?  20?  What's your number.  Let's decide.

       I considered it confirmed if wikipedia says confirmed (you'll see most of those are) and has references to US gov documents exposing it; or if there is videographic evidence that is corroborated by at least 2 government whistleblowers.  I consider that a triangulation.  I can talk more about the methodology, but since I wrote the list, it really comes down to me making an arbitrary judgment call on what is 'confirmed', but if you think something is not confirmed (OKC bombing is a great example) I can break that off into a 'unofficially confirmed, but c'mon' section

       I like to think I coined the term "Wikipedia-true" for that. If not even Wikipedia, which contradicts all its articles on classical mechanics in one article on 9/11 "conspiracy theories", can deny the conspiracy fact, it qualifies for the list.

       It looks like a good methodology. We want to be applicable for future entries in the registry, and this should work.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem arises, I think, when a conspiracy has been "confirmed" but this confirmation may be hiding something else. The example I used from your list was the 1605 Gunpowder Plot, which (like 9/11) unquestionably involved a conspiracy, but the people who were officially blamed were not necessarily the real culprits/masterminds behind that conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some "confirmations" are limited hangouts or decoys.

       My mistakes and omissions are just mistakes and omissions.  I don't work for the government, and if you read my other stuff you'd just know that... and I want reinvestigation of 9/11 more than anything else from our future president although it's extraordinarily unlikely.

       My point is that list is not a limited hangout just because mistakes.  You gotta stop calling everything a false flag or limited hangout and learn to trust your fellow

       Seems consensus was to put it in the sidebar, at least that's what I've read in the actual forum from the actual people who post here, but I don't think that fits the proper criteria of "they", since it's taken this long.
      </p>

       It's an easy 30 second fix... put a nice big "VERIFIED CONSPIRACIES" link underneath the IRC room link. That's it. Done. Easy.

       I have to wonder why you're even here if you think we are out to get you.  Seems like an easy problem to solve, start a new sub, you're the only mod, and then you know the mods aren't out to get you.  It's ridiculous to sit back and moan about the mods being a part of some plot to hide this information when we were the ones to sticky it in the first place.  Hell if we wanted to hide shit from you we wouldn't have public mod logs and we would just delete the shit we wanted to hide.

       Stop being so damned melodramatic and relax so we can get this thing turned into a wiki entry that is updatable and linked in the sidebar.

I have little patience for chicken little BS directed at the mod team, especially considering that this sub is the only one of its size/traffic that publishes it's mod logs!

      <p>
       The sticky was taken down because that's what we do with ALL stickies after they've been up for a while.  People want some level of permanence with this list so we are actively working that out, keeping a sticky up forever keeps us from using stickies for a multitude of other things we frequently use stickies for so it's simply not an option.

       TBH IMHO fam, I think it's in the best interests of the moderators--especially of a sub with such a sensitive nature--and for their mental integrity and the peace of the users, to utterly divest themselves of pride, and accept (or respond) placidly all manner of insult and implication against themselves.

       Hm, thanks, never heard about these complaints. I thought it is a great tool where you can create a few huge markdown pages to drop some background info and required reading. Worked for
       <a href="/r/thebutton">
        /r/thebutton

       ,
       <a href="/r/asoiaf">

       and
       <a href="/r/towerchallenge">

       People don't agree OKC was confirmed and so it's been removed.  The us gov totally blew that shit up and killed those people though.  Others still don't believe and evidence--like 9/11--isn't enough.  If OKC's on the list 911 should be too, similarly if 9/11 is not on list neither should OKC.  They are linked, believe me.  they'd been working on 9/11 for decades.

       Ok so I read below the comments and this is really the solution: I remove the OKC bombing entry.  There.  Now they are all
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       confirmed.  Seriously, verify for yourself.  The OKC one is literally teh only entry that has any doubt as to its 'confirm'edness.

       It was a sticky, it was eventually unstuck after a time.  Nothing unusual happend.  beyond that it was a great post that we are considering turning into a wikipage and having linked in the sidebar.

       I'm so exhausted with all the assumptions that because we unstickied a post there is some sort of mod corruption.

       some others to join.  If you really want to start a podcast I'm sure I could find you some kickass interviews.

       Yes after seeing my resume, all the good work I did with the carbonaro effect, the Trump campaign and allatolya komenei, they decided it was probably best to let agent Levi mocking bird handle the megaphone.

       But in reality it was the users idea, I just bridged the gap between the users and the mod team.  If you want something done around here just bring it up to the mods in a normal way without pitchforks and torches, shit gets done faster that way.

       It would handicap all the current submissions of new stuff we're trying to get out, this sub is more about conspiracy theory than facts which have been exposed

      <p>
       To inform people who are uninformed we needs posts here to get as many upvotes as possible, so by handicapping all our posts we're going to get less of those 'uninformed' people who we want to get to.  At least if we add 'confirmed conspiracies' into the sidebar we won't be handicapping all our latest submissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all about balance, there are lots of important factors, but we've got to make sure we don't lose our reach, I'm all for improving legitimacy, it's one of the top priorities, as is reaching as many people as possible.

        How is providing proof of known conspiracies at the top of the sub a 'handicap' of other posts? To me that's not a valid viewpoint at all.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The top post gets a significant amount more upvotes than the one in second place, lots of people are only passing by, the top post gets more of their attention.  By putting a sticky above the posts which have been naturally voted to the top, we stop the democratically elected ones getting as many upvotes and hence from getting as much attention/views around Reddit, so the sticky reduces our reach around Reddit, making it less likely that we'll be spotted by non-regulars.

       Leaving the same post at top time all year isn't going to help much as the algorithm is time-dependent, if a new post gets a lot of upvotes early on and makes it to the top of the sub, it then has the potential to go viral around Reddit bringing in huge numbers.  If a post which had been there for months suddenly receives all those votes the same won't happen.  We've also got to factor in that the regulars can only vote for it once.  It's in the interest of the sub to regularly get new posts at the top which get many upvotes, bringing a lot of visitors to this sub, then once they've run out of steam get replaced with the latest fresh post which does the same.  By having a sticky at the top for months which has already ran out of steam (due to the time-dependent Reddit algorithm), the sub will have a reduced reach around Reddit, while the regulars will still come there will be far fewer newbies and passers-by i.e. fewer of the people we most need to influence.

       Running this sub is like running a website, you have to get the ingredients right, if the recipe is wrong you could either end up with great posts with a small audience, or a wide audience with poor post quality.  It's all a balancing act and every move has to be thought out carefully, because while it might help in one way it may also hinder more in another.  They sticked the informative post for a bit, good move, get the information out, but now move it out of the way to get new info out and expand the reach of the sub.  Discussion has started about placing it in the sidebar from where it can't handicap the reach of the sub, an important discussion to have.

       I never understood this list. For it to be a "confirmed conspiracy theory", it would have to at one point not have been confirmed, but still out there as a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       This list just seems like a bunch of conspiracies of bad stuff people in power has done. I don't think anyone specifically theorized about most of the stuff on the list specifically prior to the declassification or whatever.

      <p>
       I don't know, seems like a pretty important distinction.

       I had a look at the list. I think maybe some historic (older than 200 years) conspiracies should be added too. This will help drive home the point that conspiracies are not only taking place, but are as old as human civilisation.  There really are endless examples in Roman history  for an area which is widely known in the west (most users on this sub i guess?). Maybe we could do some posting on the history request subs asking them for some specific historic conspiracies to add. This is a great idea btw.

       Lmao at the in-fighting in the comments. Get it together people. We are a minority in our beliefs. We need to stick together and put the spreading of this information first. Lots of people are waking up these days.

       Good Idea, I completely agree. In the future we may even vote to create a list of very mind intriguing/blowing unconfirmed conspiracies. You know what they say, if the heart believes-it's true ! I might wanna reformulate my post later but I think you got the idea.
