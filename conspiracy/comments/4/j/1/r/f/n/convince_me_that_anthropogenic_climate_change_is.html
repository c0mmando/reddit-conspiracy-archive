       Greetings

       !
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a believer in man-made climate change (current climate is changing into one that is increasingly hostile to human life, this change is accelerating, the speed of this change is a direct result of human activity). But people I respect contend that this concept is just a tool used to justify a one-world government. Basically climate change will be the new hell, and the government will become salvation, they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm very curious. So would you please share your best evidence that climate change is a hoax?

      <p>
       Sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       First the climate changes. It always has and always will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets Start with Greenhouse Gasses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Greenhouse Gases make up 1-2% of the atmosphere. CO2 makes up 3.6% of all greenhouse gasses. Man contributes 3.4% of all CO2 output.
       <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2009/03/27/man%E2%80%99s-contribution-to-global-warming/">
        http://dailysignal.com/2009/03/27/man%E2%80%99s-contribution-to-global-warming/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So 96.6% of all CO2 output has nothing to do with human activity.
       </strong>
       The plot thickens....
      </p>
      <p>
       But CO2 is making the climate hotter right??? What does history say?
      </p>
      <p>
       CO2 was ~200ppm higher than thought in the early Pilocene, but the temperature apparently didn't respond to that
       <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16000388?np=y">
        https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16000388?np=y
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a report comes out that actually says that
       <strong>
        CO2 is NOT the driver of temperature.
       </strong>

       <strong>
        This guy will even give you $100,000 if you can statistically prove "Global Warming" is happening and not simply a statistical anomaly.
       </strong>
       <a href="http://ktwop.com/2015/11/20/statistician-issues-a-100000-challenge-for-anyone-to-prove-that-global-warming-is-statistically-significant/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       How can they get it so wrong??
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        “It’s a well-kept secret, but 95 per cent of the climate models we are told prove the link between human CO2 emissions and catastrophic global warming have been found, after nearly two decades of temperature stasis, to be in error.”
       </strong>
       Maurice Newman, the chairman of the P.M’s business advisory council, daringly wrote in The Australian:
       <a href="https://climatism.wordpress.com/2015/05/27/real-world-data-sinks-the-great-global-warming-swindle/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then why would they do all this?? I give you two possible hypothesis....
      </p>
      <p>
       So Goldman Sacs says the new
       <strong>
        Carbon Market will be worth Trillions....
       </strong>

      </p>
      <p>
       And they have admitted that the goal is
       <strong>
        world wide wealth redistribution.
       </strong>
       What better way than "You are saving the planet".  People will line up.

       Hey, this bit was actually correct! Without that natural CO2, the global average temperature would be well below freezing. Instead, it's more like 12C.

       I don't think that it is a hoax but I also don't think that carbon emissions are what is causing it. I think that its a change of landscape which in results in heat islands which affects the weather patterns. This in turn affects local flora and fauna and cascades. I don't think that CO2 has as much causation do to the massive increase in CO2 levels with a minimal increase in temperature. Also, I don't rule out that while humans affect the climate at least to some degree, I think the solar activity affects global conditions as well.

       well nearly every advanced, and not so advanced, country in the world have been keeping records of surface sea temperatures for at least a century or more, and you'll not find one that doesnt show a continuous rise in sea temps over the last century...and it takes a lot of extra heat to rise the surface of the ocean, especially given that the depths are all much colder

        Even if you take the 1999 version, there is global warming, not global cooling as you originally suggested.

        Others have analysed the same data (eg Berkeley Earth) and got very similar graphs.

        If you try to align them on the first or last decade, then the datasets will look wildly different. However, if you match them over the whole period,
        <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/history/">

        "NASA continues to show rapid warming after 1997, which is not present in the satellite temperature record." -- proceeds to pick one of the two available satellite temperature records. Satellites don't measure the temperature of the surface, they attempt to guess the temperature of the lower atmosphere using, basically, a camera far above the upper atmosphere. Surface, atmosphere -- two different places with different temperatures.

        They are losing rural stations, causing the temperature record to be driven by urban stations – which are much warmer.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Actually, they measure how much warmer an urban station is than a rural station, and then subtract it. "Although the number of stations has increased significantly, the total area covered has not changed as much. Decreased coverage occurs when urban stations without nearby rural stations have been dropped in order to avoid bias due to urban heat island effects."
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also just take all rural stations and get basically the same result.

       Also, what about physics? The physics of why CO2 warms the atmosphere were described by Arrhenius in 1896. The concept still stands to this day, and his numerical estimate was not far off.

       What about it? No warming is occurring, which doesn't violate any laws of physics. CO2's warming happens in the first 20 ppm. There is subsequently zero correlation between temperature and atmospheric CO2.

       Not a single one of the graphs you linked showed overall cooling since the '40s. You could argue that they show no warming 1940-1970, which applies to both the old and new graphs. However, this is explained by aerosols.

       Yes, they literally say so on their website, with explanations of each change they made, and they even still have the old version on their website so you can see the difference. I linked it to you, it was figure 4.
      </p>
      <p>
       With more effort they found better ways to use all the data to determine the average global temperature. Their method isn't biased towards warming or cooling - the data is, because duh, global warming has been happening.
       <a href="https://github.com/ClimateCodeFoundation/ccc-gistemp">
        It's open source
       </a>
       and you can run it on your own computer -- takes 8 minutes. And of course there's the other groups using different groups of thermometers, analysing them in different ways, coming to very much the same graph. Must be collusion.

       Nope, the greenhouse effect also warms the oceans - which has been happening all the time, even since 1998 or 2000 or whatever year you want to pick.

       You're wrong, but whatever, take out all the urban stations if you want. You'll get practically the same graph. Again, I did it with the virtual machine I linked.

      <p>
       Yeah, that's not true. Arrhenius described the warming effect of doubling the CO2 concentration. It's as true at 20ppm as it is at 200ppm. You can actually test it in a lab.

       Well the first time I learned about it was in high school, in our science class. I remember seeing "An Inconvenient Truth." I've seen the photos of melting glaciers and graphs with the CO2 content. And I learned that many of the hottest years on record have been recent. I can't list out everything, but in total these are the things that lead me to believe in the theory.

       Just now getting around to watching these, and thank you. I'm always a fan of anyone who is trying to get to the bottom of it with real science and at least mentioning that it's difficult to sift through the ones who have been paid for their results, encouraged to throw out or manipulate data, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to pay attention to it while I work in challenging though :/

       Can't say I've found any, except the skeptics like Willie Soon. It sounds like you're talking about CRU/Climategate, where some leaked emails were spun as showing some manipulation. This was not the case, and the YouTube playlist I linked in my previous comment actually covered the topic in two videos. You might want to see the rest of the playlist.

       global warming is just air littering.  everybody knows that littering is bad.  lets call it air littering instead and we'll be good.
