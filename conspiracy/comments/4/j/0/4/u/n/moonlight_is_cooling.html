       Has anyone else tried measuring the temperature of moonlight during a full moon?  I've been measuring for the last 6 months or so,  and I get a consistent temperature difference of about 5-7 degrees Fahrenheit.  Can anyone explain this using the heliocentric model?  If the moon is reflecting sunlight, why does it have different properties?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit to clarify:  Ideally, you have two thermometers for this experiment, though you only truly need one.  Verify they're accurate by placing them in the same conditions and making sure they read the same temperature.  Then during +/- 48 hrs of full moon and at night, you take a thermometer and place it in moonlight and one in shade and the one in moonlight will consistently read about 5 degrees cooler on a reasonably clear night.  Will vary with weather conditions.  You can also magnify this effect further with a magnifying glass.

       Moonlight is not going to cool anything down. If you truly are getting a warmer result in shadow, you are probably putting your thermometer in a sheltered place, where the residual heat radiation from the soil and plants and structures, that was accumulated during the day, can affect the reading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and about the magnifying glass making the moonlight cool more -- I don't believe it. I have to call bullshit on it.

       Typically the initial experimenter thoroughly documents his procedure first, so that the "peer review" process
       <strong>
        can
       </strong>
       attempt to reproduce the experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's see the specific procedure used, documented in proper fashion. Then I will attempt to reproduce it, assuming there aren't any glaring issues with the procedures.

       For example, it doesn't document the equipment used, the specific layout of the thermometers relative to each other, the manner in which the light from the moon was obstructed, the prevailing weather conditions at the time and the specific procedures used to mitigate them or factor them into calculations, and many more details that could impact a replication attempt, all of which would ultimately be called out as discrepancies to the original experiment were the replication attempt to produce a different result.

       This isn't how actual science is done.  Go to a university website and pull one of their peer-reviewed scientific papers.  There's a specific format you have to follow for ALL of them, and then more specific formats for different branches of science.  You need to document with very precise details EVERYTHING you do and use.  For example:

       </a>
       in the moonlight for ~30.0 min.  eT650D thermometer 'B' was placed in the shade for ~30.0 min.  After allowing a sufficient time for the thermometers to adjust to the correct temperature and reach approximate thermodynamic equilibrium, readings were taken.  The readings for thermometer 'A' were 28.9°C and the readings for thermometer 'B' were 23.5°C.  This experiment was repeated 4 more times for precision and the following results were acquired:
       <em>

       </em>
       .  From these results, we can conclude that the moonlight affects the ambient temperature by
       <em>
        x
       </em>
       °C on average.  This means that
       <em>
        (an explanation of what these results mean is needed)
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You will also need, at the very least, VERY detailed diagrams of what your experiment set up was.  Preferably you would have high resolution photographs.  This is to back up that you have done this experiment according to your claims, and anyone who wanted to could replicate the experiment EXACTLY how you did.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's an extremely basic overview of what an actual scientific experiment with an accompanying report is.  OP has not done much of the report, or proof of his experiment, so we can't replicate it.  Since we can't replicate it, we throw it out.  And in the scientific community, OP would be shunned for proposing his ideas like this.

       OP is obviously a layman. His instructions are simple enough to follow for laypeople and experts alike and surely do not require the format of a formal peer-reviewed paper to verify or falsify his findings. Your dismissal based on form constitutes a logical fallacy.

       That's a sad excuse. The description of the experiment is straightforward. All I need now are two, preferably four, thermometers and a piece of cardboard -- and a cloudless day once full moon approaches again.

       I am not arguing against asking for additional information. In fact, I did so myself. I am arguing against the claim that OPs pretty straightforward description of his experiment is insufficient to replicate it. Get two thermometers, test their measurement spread, then put one into moonlight and one into the moonlight shadow. You still have not explained which part of that is unclear to you, or open to interpretation, or, if followed even in the most crude manner, would yield a decisively different result.

       No, its a dismissal based on methods. You learn the scientific method in grade school, and even if you don't remember it you can look it up. OPs post was blatantly unscientific, and its not up to the person calling it out to provide the evidence to base their claims, it's up to the experimenter to provide evidence for theirs.

       If we all get different results, OP is a moron, or made a mistake, or is trolling on purpose. Complaining about "unscientificallyness" at this point, when nobody else had the opportunity yet to conduct such an experiment to verify or falsify the findings, is pure nonsense and flies in the face of scientific curiosity.

       We don't need to test this. I have spent enough time actually outside that I know for a fact that moonlight doesn't cool you, especially not five degrees. It's a very soft light, there isn't anything else going on there, and light of that intensity isn't going to warm you up, but it's certainly not going to cool you down. I trust in my knowledge of science enough to know that before testing it.

       I ordered two thermometers of the same type, and both have arrived. One is broken however, so I must either improvise or wait another month or hope that the replacement arrives in time. Moon is still only at 68%, so one must wonder which part of "full moon +/-48h", as specified by OP, you did not understand. Full moon will be on 21st this month, hence, the experiment can be replicated on 19th earliest as per OPs instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hilarious. Everyone complained about how OPs experiments aren't precise and "scientific" enough, yet they don't even understand the most simple instructions. Full moon +/-48h. That means the experiment must be conducted between May 19th and May 23rd. We have May 15th and you ask how the experiment is coming. That is how we know you are an anal ourorobos.

       What can I say, I got similar results as OP. 1K difference between moonlight and shade. Thermometers side by side. Control experiment the second night by putting them into Haribo boxes to exclude windchill, same results. Even switched the thermometers - one cooled, the other warmed, 1K difference again.

       Lol no my dismissal is based on the fact that OP has done nothing to prove his experiment. He could be trolling for all we know. And I can't replicate it because variables such as humidity, barometric pressure, time during the night, the type of shade (a box, under a tree, etc) aren't given, or taken into consideration.

       Poor excuses?  I'm sorry, my education in EARTH SCIENCE with a focus on METEOROLOGY kind of keeps certain things about experiments like this in the forefront of my mind.  Things I KNOW effect things such as temperature.  These would include the barometric pressure, the humidity, the time of the day/night, where in the fucking world it even is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me see if I can dumb this down for you sufficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I try to do OP's experiment, I'm going to take one thermometer and put it on the top of a white roofed house where light will be reflected everywhere like crazy with very little absorption.  The other thermometer I will put in a charcoal grill (low light emission, and shaded, no?).  Think my results would be a bit fucked up?  Yeah, because I have no clue how OP set his shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before you start saying "hurrdurr of course OP wouldn't set it up like that, ur dumb", it's hyperbole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lol pressure and humidity seem to be completely inconsequential.  So you've never taken the most basic chemistry class available?  You know, where they teach you all about Boyle's Law and the Ideal Gas Law?  Hell, even some physics courses would teach it to you. Here's a formula for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       PV=nRT (ideal gas law)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        P=Pressure
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       V=Volume
      </p>
      <p>
       n=moles of substance
      </p>
      <p>
       R=universal gas constant
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        T=Temperature
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the thermometer would be taking ambient (air) temperature, and air is a fucking gas, you kind of need that formula.

       I said: "Pressure and humidity seem to be completely inconsequential.

        OP stated he performed the experiment over six months.
       </strong>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       Over those six months, pressure and humidity can be assumed to have varied greatly, yet OP reports consistent observations. Hence, pressure and humidity seem to be completely inconsequential. For the fucking observation at hand. In the words of a wise man: "learn to read."
      </p>
      <p>
       If, and only if other experimenters report different observations is it useful to wonder which variables determine the outcome.

       You can call it evasion all you'd like.  If you knew what actual science was and how it's done, you'd agree with me.  Given that it's obvious you've never taken a science course, or didn't care in your courses, I can see why you'd think OP's experiment is valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       If his experiment is valid, PLEASE go replicate it.  Get the same results OP got.  For the sake of the argument, take some pictures of it.  You know, that way we know you did it, instead of just hopping on a computer and saying you did and typing some numbers down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will bet you any amount of money you want, that if you do OP's experiment with just the information OP gave, you'd have a worthless experiment with results that are all over the place and tell you absolutely nothing.  Seriously.  Let's do this if you're so confident in OP's 'experiment'.  If even ANY of your results don't match OP's, even one, your experiment is wrong and must be thrown out.  That's how science is done.  The reason the theory of gravity still holds up to this day is because we test it millions of times and EVERY SINGLE TIME the results are the same.  If even one result one time were different, the ENTIRE theory would be considered wrong and would have to be reworked.

Again, if you knew science, you'd know these things matter as EVERYTHING will affect your results.  That's why you have a control group.  So you know what you're baseline is and any deviations from that can be identified.  Otherwise, you just have random numbers.

       Can be assumed?  Sorry, science does not assume.  Science is precise and EVERYTHING must be known.  If you can't accept that, then stay away from science.  Feel free to keep arguing with me about this.  I'm sure you feel good about it behind your computer screen in your room in your 'safe space'.  But for your own sake, go to a university and go talk to some of the science professors.  Go ahead and try to argue with them with the same thought process you're using now.

       Nice strawman you are building there. It would be a shame if someone came to knock it over. I never said his experiment is valid. I am saying that the arguments against replicating it are feeble and invalid.

       I have no clue how OP came to his results. I already asked him. I know how I will conduct mine. It will be utterly unfavorable towards his conclusion, I promise. But WHAT I will do is what he said he did: take two thermometers, put one into the moonlight, and one into the shade.

       Why is it you skeptopaths always invoce judeo-christian deities when you run out of arguments? My point stands. If OP is correct, and telling the truth, he took
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       six measurements. If he consistently made the same observation, that means pressure and humidity can be excluded as factors influencing the outcome, because it would be a rare thing if there was no variance in pressure and humidity over the course of six months. Get it? Odin.

       You are pretty angry just because I'm saying let's take OPs challenge and replicate his experiment. Really funny to watch how you work yourself up over such a small thing, for being genuinely scientifically curious and taking a true Socratic approach. I don't know whether OP is right or wrong. But I know the dismissal which I originally addressed, upon which this whole hellhole of a thread developed, was wrong, unscientific and plain religious. And I intend on actually verifying or falsifying OPs claim with diligent methodology to the best of my knowledge. I want to check. That makes me a better scientist than you are, who cries "bullshit" at heliocentrism before he even had an opportunity to look through the telescope.

      <p>
       I'm leaning more towards the latter 2.  Seriously, if you've taken any chemistry or physics course, you'd know this experiment hardly qualifies as an experiment.  More "hey guys, I just did this, what do you think?"

       I would greatly welcome them, as I am not a native speaker and find my English terrible myself. My reading comprehension is quite fine, though, and the claim "I don't believe it" is found in the same post (not thc's, but luckinator's) that said "I have to call bullshit on it", which caused the debate I'm having with thc right now. So stick your feeble, pathetic, passive-agressive insult somewhere neither moonlight nor sunlight shine.

       It should be. But that is not what happened here. OP's claim was dismissed before anyone on this beautiful planet had a chance to replicate the experiment. The moon is at 41% at the moment I am typing this. OP specified full moon +/-48 hours.

       Just to be clear, I'm letting you know something about your moon - you can test it yourself or look at other people's tests if you like.  It was not my goal to reach into your mind and prove to you that moonlight is cooling, I'm simply telling you it is and I suggested a very simple experimental set up that will demonstrate this beyond the shadow of a doubt :)  What you believe is up to you, but what is factually true is true for everyone.  So measure the moonlight for yourself if you want to know.  And as always, have a good day buddy

       Based on what little info you've given of the experiment, I don't think enough was done to mitigate mundane variables that could account for the variances seen. How were the thermometers mounted/what were they resting on? Different materials conduct heat differently and can retain residual heat from during the day that can affect the readings. How close together were the thermometers? What were the weather conditions like during the experiment? What was producing the shade?
      </p>
      <p>
       Refuting these kinds of nitpicks are why science papers are so meticulously detailed in their methods; because correlation =/= causation and you want to be sure that there is positively no other explanation for why things turned out as they did. I'm not saying that you need a 50page report on it, something even on the level of a grade school science fair project would be an improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it this way, if I replicate the experiment and come up with a different conclusion than you, wouldn't your first thought be "what did he do differently than me?". And if I didn't detail it or record it you would have no way of knowing if I fucked something up or even made the experiment up, and would rightfully disregard it as unverifiable.

       I think you're having some issue with your experimental set up. The error you're getting is probably due to inaccurate thermometers or their position. For example if I had 2 thermometers and placed one in front of a window and one several inches away behind a wall first would read cooler. Windows are terrible insulators and you could be losing heat there.  I would way to a very small degree you are losing heat through radiation of the moon thermometer as well. Try to set them directly next to eachother &lt;1" apart. Position them some distance away from the window &gt; 10'. Place a piece of cardboard on the window to block the moon light and they will read nearly identical.  The moon does not reflect sufficient light to measure with inaccurate equipment, and cooling by light has no factual basis.

       A simple video showing the difference in temperature along with the experimental setup will suffice. You flat earth goons love to make videos, so why not make one that proves you aren't just making shit up?

       I've only been measuring when the moon was within 48 hours of full.  So no, I don't expect a spike, I just think the heliocentric model has no explanation of why moonlight is cooling while sunlight is obviously heating - do you know of any?

       I don't believe you understand my experiment or question - 
There's an easily measurable temperature difference between the shade and moonlight just as there is between the shade and sunlight.   The difference being that the moonlight cools whatever it falls on.  You can magnify this effect with a magnifying glass just like sunlight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if the moon is only reflecting sunlight as the heliocentric model says, why does the moonlight have different properties?

       Well I'm not sure about the telescope because I haven't tried it, but I would guess that it would be noticeable with a strong scope because you can definitely notice with just a magnifying glass on your hand.  It's not as severe as a magnifying glass with sunlight though, which could easily burn your hand.  With the moonlight it's more of a subtle effect but definitely present and measurable.

       If the moonlights cooling powers can be amplified with a mere magnifying glass, a telescope would surely create a greater, far more noticeable effect.

       Have you tested this with a telescope? If not, then i've already experimented more than you have and are therefore more suited to speak on the topic - And I conclude it is nonsense.

       Because the moon isn't reflecting all ranges of the spectrum of light / radiation that the sun emits. Visible light is different from infrared light is different from ultraviolet light.

       I would recommend using an identical experiment during a new moon to test your hypothesis.  If moon light in cooling, you can test your methodology during the new moon, when we should only expect environmental factors to change your results.  This could be used to ensure there are not any unforeseen effects clouding the results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, partly moon lit nights should be expected to show intermediary results, right? Testing all across the lunar cycle could be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The duration of your experiment is laudable, and certainly lends more credence to your results.
      </p>
      <p>
       My gut reaction follow up questions would be: since you are claiming moon light is like no other light we know of, what other properties does it exhibit?  What objects does it pass through, and what blocks it?  How is it affected by weather?  What would happen if you split it with a prism?
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope these recommendations help your future experimentation.

       I'm curious that you chose to post this to r/conspiracy instead of r/askscience? Don't know whether to take you seriously...
      </p>
      <p>
       Kudos to you for trying out the experiment, but I suspect that your results might be skewed by a separate phenomena known as radiative cooling.
      </p>
      <p>
       See Wikipedia link here:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling#Radiative_cooling_on_Earth.27s_surface_at_night">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling#Radiative_cooling_on_Earth.27s_surface_at_night
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the idea is that any surface exposed to a clear night sky is going to cool down. If, during your experiment, your shaded thermometer was also shaded from the night sky, while your moonlit thermometer was exposed to the night sky, your moonlit thermometer will be losing heat to the sky and will be thus cooler.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure how you might amend your experiment to account for this effect. Is there a way to shade your shaded thermometer from the moon but not from the rest of the sky?

       Yeah but the moon only reflects like 10% of the sunlight that hits it and it's very very small so it's many hundreds of thousands, if not millions of times more dim than the sun. Imagine shining a mirror into your house during the early morning before the sun comes up, yet there is ambient light.

       But WHAT I find interesting is how all the armchair experts hurry to call bullshit without even doing the experiment themselves, or without even having had the opportunity to verify or falsify your findings.

       Please explain what type of thermometer you used, how you generated the shade for the control thermometer, and give other additional information that might influence the results of the experiments.

       You assume incorrectly!  I have been repeating the experiment and will continue to do so.  My goal here is not to create concrete proof for everyone, but to prove the concept to myself, and to encourage others to do the same.  This experiment is great because it costs less than five dollars typically and you can get the thermometers just about anywhere from hardware stores to big package stores across the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't realize my post would straw so much attention, I will definitely make an effort to record results and share in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flat earth model - as far as my understanding goes - does not know exactly what the sun and moon are (or the planets and stars for that matter) and they are described merely as luminescent bodies.  The difference in the quality of their light is noted though and is a key difference between the geocentric and heliocentric model.  If the moon is allegedly a mundane rock that's reflecting sunlight at the earth then how can the quality of its light be different than the sun?
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, are we to believe it's merely a coincidence that the moon and sun are exactly the same size and capable of eclipsing one another?  And that we only ever see one face of the Moon?  But I digress - thanks for your feedback
