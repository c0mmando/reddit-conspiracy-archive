        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They said the gas was harmless, but this link says it was a sugar similar to splenda with a small amount of fluorescent material (like a glow stick), both of which we know are harmless, especially if breathed instead of consumed.</p>

<p><a href="http://gothamist.com/2016/05/09/this_is_totally_normal_right.php">http://gothamist.com/2016/05/09/this_is_totally_normal_right.php</a></p>

<p>But wait  This part is really something: the particles contain DNATrax like a barcode.  Which means every particle has a different kind of dna in each one, being absorbed through the epithelial cells of the lungs.  That&#39;s wonderful.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like they are trying a shotgun approach at creating new disease and human mutations by dispersing exogenous, randomized dna into particles to be uptaken by the lungs.  They will of course say &#39;those dna were randomized in a non-critical &#39;junk dna&#39; area of dna&#39; or &#39;inactive dna&#39; or some shit. You know they will science it up to sound cute, but the fact is, even some miniscule percentage is going to screw up and cause a problem.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is about the most fucked up, Bain-level thing I&#39;ve read about in ages, and as such it deserves more attention than it&#39;s being given on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  These psychopaths are getting more bold by the minute.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the corbett-mediamonarchy take on it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha yeah, sure. I trust NYC to be honest with its citizens about health risks involved here.....NOT.</p>

<p>I used to live in NYC and I seem to remember the city telling us that the air downtown was safe to breathe just DAYS after 9/11. Whoops!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in NYC for a week and I can tell you it&#39;s an abusive puzzle maze.  I mean one <em>could</em> get acclimatized to the sub system, but when I was there, the return path from wall st to port authority changed every day after 3 days.  They were doing construction.  I asked if it was normal, 3 people said &#39;yeah&#39;.  </p>

<p>So basically they are running this experiment on people to delay them, move them around; they are probably monitoring people and watching how people &#39;learn to course correct&#39;</p>

<p>Like those lab rat experiments where you put the cheese and make them run the maze  and then you move the maze around and see which ones adapt the fastest</p>

<p>Keep in mind, I had to run this maze to the port authority and back to NJ to/from wallst while in a happy ketamine haze, and only been to NYC twice before, so it was only mildly annoying to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agreed. This is unethical human experimentation and I&#39;ve spoken up about it every time I see this story. How do we not just punch the people in the face trying to do this? Shit&#39;s getting real bad. Wake the fuck up!!! Some of these past experiments are directly related to Zika virus. They are testing bioweapons, not preparing for them. Terrorist liars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people don&#39;t have a choice; others would never leave.  </p>

<p>You know how they say that a city has a culture?  NYC definitely has a culture.  Every time I go there I get a glipse of it, through the advertising your bombarded with from the ads that hover at the rooftops of the subway cars, to the ads on cabs, to the constant flutter of things at times square and other electronic billboards that are everywhere now; even to the things overheard by street musicians, knockoff mongers, and other &#39;street performance people&#39;, and other tourons too.  </p>

<p>Lights that rage all night--it&#39;s a luciferian city--why it&#39;s called gotham.</p>

<p>People are well invested into the culture of NYC and they won&#39;t leave.  It&#39;s funny becasue they think that their culture is the same outside of the city and it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s just as insular as they claim other locales are.  You only know this by traveling between them.  Its even more insular since you have to go through a long dark tunnel or bridge to get there.  It&#39;s a cauldron.  Non natives don&#39;t give a rats ass about broadway unless they want to sound like an insider, which everyone knows is pretentious. Its an expensive way to say you did the ny experience</p>

<p>My point here is that people are going to stay in NYC even if it kills them, letting themselves be boiled to death by the witches of cultural engineering. There&#39;s also something to that, thats even darker...from the numerous pre-videocamera gargoyles staring down at you to the authority-chic, shiny black wrought iron clad buildings acting as a standin for a gateway to oblivion.  And they love it, willingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I do not agree with their methodology or practice, but I can see why they came up with this particular system. They&#39;re using DNA because we have very well established, almost trivially easy, techniques for amplifying miniscule amounts of DNA - namely PCR. By using coded DNA fragments, they can selectively amplify only the fragments of interest. Using this technique you could theoretically detect a single DNA molecule in a sample. That&#39;s good detection.</p>

<p>However, spraying synthetic fluorescent DNA particles into a public air system? Not a good idea. </p>

That aside, why does them using dna make sense?
What does PCR have to do with the OP?</p>

<p>technically its illegal and unethical medical experimentation, also possible genocide or mass murder if something mutates. and unforeseen  mutations happen as seen in GMO crops and cultured GMO animals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a DNA molecule. It&#39;s an allele. Fragment is ok to say, but codon is more correct.
Oh, and it&#39;s not theoretical detection. It&#39;s actual detection. :p
You weren&#39;t far off. I just had to correct your use of the word molecule, mainly..
Have a wonderful day :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha. Thanks for the correction. :)</p>

<p>Can I re-correct the correction though? Any form of DNA is a molecule. A single strand of DNA is a bunch of atoms held together by covalent molecular bonds...thus a long, complex molecule. See this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.austincc.edu/emeyerth/dna.htm">http://www.austincc.edu/emeyerth/dna.htm</a></p>

<p>An &quot;allele&quot; refers to a variant of a particular gene. &quot;Codon&quot; is a coded sequence of DNA (or RNA) that is used to encode the protein transcription process.</p>

<p>Also, I didn&#39;t mean it is a theoretical test but that it is theoretically possible to detect a single molecule of DNA. This may not happen in practice since the single fragment may be lost or somehow damaged in the collection and amplification process.</p>

<p>(I was a molecular biology major. Did this stuff change since I studied it?)</p>
