    <div class="md"><p>We are continually violated by the MSM no matter what country you reside.</p>

<p>Australian politics is a farce as is all western style democracy. The media control how we view the world and also tell us how to vote for example.</p>

<p>If any imdividual tried to do this shit, we&#39;d have a defamation suit so fast our feet wouldn&#39;t touch the ground. Yet these monkeys who run our fucken societies continually get away with it and we have no means to dissent.</p>

<p>Are you waking up yet people??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Tax-Free threshold, which is what Storrar was talking about, was raised in 2012 from $6k to $18k. I&#39;m willing to bet this had a bigger net positive result on the economy than any tax breaks to the big end of town simply because people like Storrar spend every cent they earn and have no capacity to save. The theory that the wealthy create jobs ignores the fact that jobs cannot be created without consumers to support the wages. Give a rich man a tax-break and he might create a job or he might pocket the cash and save it as extra profits. Give a poor man a tax-break and he can go and support local businesses by taking his kids to the movies and buying them some ice-cream and new shoes. Without the poor man to buy the ice-cream, the rich man who owns the ice-cream parlour cannot hire a new worker.</p>
