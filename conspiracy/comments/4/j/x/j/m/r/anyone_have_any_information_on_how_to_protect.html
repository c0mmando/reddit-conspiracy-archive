    <div class="md"><p>The only thing you can do is to help your body get rid of the accumulations of poisons. Detox somehow. Drink RO water. Wash your vegetables, go organic. Some say molasses can help chelate metals out of your body, same with pectin. Have your mercury amalgam fillings removed if you can afford it. Have an electrostatic air purifier and hepafiltered air for your house and car. Investigate the medications you take. Try an elimination diet to see if you are reacting to glyphosate in wheat and corn or hormones in milk products. Do a yeast cleanse. Get a colonic. Stress and worry are multipliers of the negative effects of environmental and electronic pollution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are really good tips but I have a suggestion:</p>

<p>When drinking RO water, it is important to add minerals (ie. EARTH) to help build strength. Drinking empty water makes one weak (I know from personal experience). I add minerals to my water by storing my water in an unglazed clay pot, or by adding a pinch of bentonite clay.</p>

<p>I think the air purifier would be a good idea!</p>

<p>And the concern is keeping body and soul together for inquiring into higher truths. If there is an easy solution I&#39;ll take it. If the solution takes too much endeavor or is nonexistent, then I&#39;ll leave it at that and move on.</p>

<p>Worse things than death? Yes, dying while ignorant of divinity. Death is only a problem when you are ignorant of its foundation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I live in a community of 12 monks. I feel it is my duty to protect them. I cook for them, and prepare herbal medicine when they are sick and I&#39;m in charge of researching and maintaining the monastery&#39;s water purification system. I figured this was worth considering...but my expectations are very low.  </p>

<p>We don&#39;t really &quot;believe&quot; in reincarnation. We understand it as an axiomatic truth by philosophical observation and research. No where in the Bhagavad-Gita does Krishna tell us to &quot;believe&quot; him (or even to believe <strong>in</strong> him!). In fact in the last chapter, he says &quot;Now that I&#39;ve told you this philisophy, <strong>do as you like</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, fear is a natural phenomenon for those who are embodied and, more importantly, who <strong>identify as the body</strong>. So while I have significantly less identification to the body, I am still not fully realized and thus not completely liberated from fear. That being said, studying this philosophy has diminished my fear enough to where it is under my control (at least in current cirsumstances). Whenever I experience fear, I read the Gita and it leaves me swiftly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting stuff. From reading a few selected passages this text really speaks to me. Lord Krishna speaks quite a bit about duty, not only to God, but to yourself and those around you. That is something I strongly believe in myself. I appreciate the concept that we all have our own duty to fulfill as well, that we are not all called to the same cause. Thanks again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Krishna is very reasonable. He never condemns anyone. He simply states how individuals condemn themselves. We are not sent to hell. Our hellish behavior will create a hellish consciousness (and thus hellish existence somewhere).</p>

<p>If you read the 14th chapter, Krishna describes the results that certain activities lead to. It is described as a natural mechanism, rather than a judgemental God-based mechanism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best wisdom from the chemtrail believers is to use vinegar to disperse chemtrails. As soon as you see an aircraft spraying you rush out into the yard and spray the sky with vinegar. Spray yourself and your kids all over if they&#39;ve been exposed to chemtrails. Spray vinegar directly AT the chemtrails and you can see them break up and dissipate within minutes. Vinegar is your friend. Spray it everywhere. Ignore the hacking coughs of your kids... you didn&#39;t spray them in time! Spray more. Don&#39;t bother with orgonite....that&#39;s just bullshit pseudo-science.</p>
