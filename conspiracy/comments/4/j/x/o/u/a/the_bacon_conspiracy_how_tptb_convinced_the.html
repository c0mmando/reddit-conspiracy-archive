<p>TPTB are mainly vegans and eat only the finest non-processed and organic foods. They actually consider bacon to be highly unclean and wouldnt go near it. Yet, in the world they rule, bacon is extremely hyped up and enjoyed by the masses. 
Why? Why would TPTB tolerate bacon??</p>

<p>Are they making bacon part of peoples diet so as to dehumanize them? So they can justify looking down on them as subhuman filth and exterminate them? </p>

<p>I stopped eating bacon (and meat in general) years ago after I looked into how disgusting pig meat is. TPTB are LAUGHING OUT LOUDLY at the fact that the masses gobble down bacon and are actually convinced it is &quot;awesome&quot;. Its a sick practica joke, like having somebody eat SHIT and like it.</p>

<p>Explain, how is pork disgusting?  The whole aversion to pork comes from  ancient times when pigs where full of parasites.  This is not true of modern pork.  </p>

<p>Also how is it dehumanizing to eat pork?  </p>

<p>It is rather dehumanizing. TPTB see the general public as low class garbage and got them to eat what is essentially garbage of edible animals, AND also convinced them to think its &quot;awesome&quot;.</p>

<p>TPTB themselves don&#39;t eat bacon because they find it disgusting, but got the masses to love it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can confirm that pork and human smell the same when cooking...</p>

<p>I feel this requires an explanation however. I am an electrical and structural engineer who now works in software but just over a decade ago I was working with a you engineer on a big wiring project. After placing his hand across a live terminal in a large transformer the young fellow burnt his fingers quite badly (they recovered most of it, thankfully). After we got him away from the transformer all that was left was a strong smell of roast pork.</p>

<p>Bye, and enjoy your parasite infested pig meat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So that &quot;proof&quot; includes leaving pork out in the open air for two hours and pouring coke over it. And you&#39;re surprised that flies land on it and maggots form?</p>

<p>This is hardly proof that the parasites are <em>in the meat</em> like you continually claim. </p>

<p>As far as the diet of swine, you might actually want to educate yourself - they are omnivores but generally try to defecate away from their food. They look &quot;dirty&quot; because they do not have the ability to sweat - therefore they lay in mud. The evaporation of the water from mud lets them cool off in ways their body itself doesn&#39;t allow them to.</p>

<p>Oh, and dogs sometimes eat their own vomit - are you going to invent a giant conspiracy from Big Canine now to explain why they are such popular pets?</p>

<p>exactly. Its flesh is full of toxins and impurities. And yes, pigs do eat their own shit sometimes. </p>

<p>As for dogs doing gross things, are people around you raving about how awesome dog meat is? no? then your comparison is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Creatures have these amazing organs called kidneys and liver. They are used to remove impurities from the body. Sweat is not the only mechanism to remove impurities.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a distinct lack of evidence that sweating does anything other cool humans, primates and horses. Yes those are the only mammals who sweat, with humans being the only ones to sweat profusely. Cows and sheep also do not sweat, are they full of toxins and parasites? A lot of animals use mud, dust and external water sources to cool off.</p>

<p>Also, I very much doubt that parasites can be sweated from the body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it wouldn&#39;t have happened if Bacon didn&#39;t adhere to our cravings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sweet, fatty and salty, a combination we have evolved to find almost irresistible, because it indicates nutritionally fulfilling foods. While bacon mania might have been tripped by advertising and almost everything coming with extra bacon, you&#39;d have a harder time doing the same with any other food.</p>
