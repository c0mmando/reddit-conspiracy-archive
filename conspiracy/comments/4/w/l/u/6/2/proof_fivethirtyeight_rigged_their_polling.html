At 538 they turned corrections for pro-Clinton bias into corrections for pro-Trump bias, and they took existing corrections for pro-Trump bias and amplified them further.

    <div class="md"><p>You missed the point of my question. It&#39;s one thing to make a case like OP made, gather all the evidence, and present it to an echo chamber where any one is unlikely to have any expertise to evaluate it. It&#39;s another, however, to present it to people who would have expertise in the matter and who could evaluate it. If OP has a PhD in statistics, then OP likely has a number of peers in the field who could honestly evaluate his evidence. If 538 made an error or committed some sort of fraud, then it is OP&#39;s ethical duty to present his analysis so they be given the opportunity to:</p>

<p>A. Become aware of any mistakes
B. Correct any mistakes they made
C. Correct any mistakes OP made
D. Make an excuse of some sort</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for thisâ€”apropos.  They talk about criticisms of the polls themselves, and they mention that they &quot;unskew&quot; polls themselves by accounting for the house effect of each pollster.  My concern is not about the polls themselves being skewed, but the 8-point shift in the way that 538 has been &quot;unskewing&quot; the house effect of the pollsters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing nefarious here. 538 is a dynamic model. You&#39;re confusing the <strong>house effect</strong> with the <strong>trend line adjustment</strong> and other factors, which interpret data points in light of other data points available at the time the election simulations are run. As new data points become available (e.g., here, new polls showing Clinton ahead), this can change the significance of previous data points. You can argue with whether this kind of adjustment is methodologically sound (prior versions of the 538 model that used a version of this technique predicted 49/50 and 50/50 states correctly in 2008 and 2012), but bad methodology is quite different than intentionally skewing the numbers.</p>

<p>Re-read the section of the original methodology post concerning trend line adjustment and LOESS regression. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On August 7th, the trendline adjustment was a total 2.7 points toward Clinton.  Back on July 29th, the trendline adjustment had a negligible impact, as both candidates had roughly the same trend/slope.

    <div class="md"><p>Fucking bullshit, you obviously don&#39;t know the first thing about statistics. If 538 rigged the polls, why would they post all their &#39;rigging&#39; for everyone to see? Do you think they want conspiratards like you bitching to them all the time?</p>

<p>Let me lay this out for you in simple terms. After the Republican convention, Trump was at +1, and currently he sits at about -7 according to RCP.</p>

<p>So the important part is that this is at the STATE LEVEL. Obviously adjustments at the national level would be bias. But if, at a time when national polls had Trump +1, Ohio polls had Trump +3, it stands to reason that when national polls have Clinton +7, The same Ohio poll should be interpreted as Clinton +5 because of the change in the national polls.</p>

<p>This is the &quot;trend line adjustment&quot; that Nate Silver so helpfully pointed out</p>

<p>Its sad that lying pathetic basement dwellers like yourself cook up these conspiracy theories to detract from actual questions people have about government and authority in this country. You even feel the need to propagandize your position (&quot;Nate Pyrite&quot; &quot;I have a Ph D so listen to my inane rants&quot;), truly you are the kind of scum people should be rallying against, not professionals who actually know how to do their job. If you want to &quot;unskew&quot; all the polls just ask Romney how that went.</p>

<p>What&#39;s even worse is your own self-righteousness. Not only did you have the kind of selfish stupidity that leads you to the conclusion that, despite 538&#39;s transparency and openness, you &quot;discovered&quot; some conspiracy and even tried to contact them, but you honestly believed you were the only person that noticed. You special fucking snowflake, you.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4vwch5/rant_no_the_earth_is_not_flat/?ref=search_posts">This</a> is where I&#39;ll link you, because you&#39;re the kind of stupid outlined in this post. Not only are your claims easily disprovable by anyone, but you look so stupid as to detract from anyone with a legitimate gripe. God help us all when people like you exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The trendline adjustment for August 7th is listed at the bottom of the national poll page.  It&#39;s +1.3 for Clinton, -1.4 for Trump.  That&#39;s a total of 2.7 in favor of Clinton.  The trendline difference on July 29th was negligible, because they both had the same very slight upward slope to their polling averages.  Between July 29th and now, there hasn&#39;t been a 7.9 point swing in the trendline adjustment that would explain the differences I&#39;ve highlighted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pollster bias isn&#39;t the only adjustment made in their model. It includes a likely voter screen, omitted third parties, trend lines, and allocation of undecided voters. State polls also include a demographic regression, and the polls-plus model includes economic data. The big swings you are seeing are largely from the trendline adjustments. Remember, 538 is trying to predict what the result will be Nov. 8, not today. </p>

<p>Lucky for you, they publish what those adjustments are:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/d6Svv3q.png">National polls</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/f7ua9XM.png">Pennsylvania (as a state poll example)</a></p>

<p>On July 29th, the DNC had finished but few (if any) post-DNC polls had been released. The trend, at the time, was heavily in Trump&#39;s favor: the full effect of the email investigation and hearings brought Clinton down, and Trump had his own convention bounce and had (somewhat) solidified support from the Republican base. So, the trendline pointed to the race going in Trump&#39;s favor by election day, and the polls were adjusted towards Trump. Now, after the DNC convention, the trend show Clinton&#39;s lead growing rapidly, so the polls are adjusted in Clinton&#39;s favor instead.</p>

Rather, the model always interprets data points in light of other data points available at the time the election simulations are run. As new data points become available (e.g.,new polls showing Clinton ahead), this can change the significance of previous data points. You can argue with whether this kind of adjustment is methodologically sound (prior versions of the 538 model that used a version of this technique predicted 49/50 and 50/50 states correctly in 2008 and 2012), but bad methodology is quite different than intentionally skewing the numbers.</p>

<p>Nate Silver explicitly stated that the model was doing this kind of adjustment all along. In fact, he described the adjustment in <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-why-our-model-is-bullish-on-trump-for-now/">a post justifying why 538&#39;s model was more bullish on Trump than other models at the time</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another tricky question is how to reconcile state polls with national polls. <strong>For example, there have been no polls of Pennsylvania over the past two weeks, during which time Clintonâ€™s lead has evaporated in national polls (and often also in polls of other states, where weâ€™ve gotten them). The FiveThirtyEight model uses what we call a trend-line adjustment to adjust those those old polls to catch up to the current trend. Thatâ€™s why our polls-only forecast shows Pennsylvania as a tossup even though Trump has only led one poll there all year.</strong> Those older polls came from a time when Clinton led by 5 or 6 or 7 percentage points nationally, and they generally showed her up by about the same margin in Pennsylvania. Now that the national race is almost tied, itâ€™s probably safe to assume that Pennsylvania is very close also. Some of the competing models donâ€™t do this, and we think thatâ€™s probably a mistake, since it means their state-by-state forecasts will lag a few weeks behind, even when itâ€™s obvious thereâ€™s been a big shift in the race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Previously, the trend line adjustment favored Trump. Now it favors Clinton. It&#39;s driven by data and math, not pro-Clinton bias. </p>

<p>Holy shit. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/IbScW">They&#39;re biasing in the wrong direction</a>.</p>

<p>YouGov historically leans left according to 538&#39;s adjustments. They say that, on average, YouGov gives a 1.6 polling boost to Democrats.</p>

<p>Why, then, did they bias Trump&#39;s polls <em>towards the Democrats</em>? If they wanted to counteract the bias of the poll, it should have been <em>towards the Republicans.</em> That would mean that Trump would go from +2 to +3.6, not +2 to +1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the convention bump is reflected in the raw poll numbers. What changed was the adjustment that 538 applies to every poll to correct for the &quot;house effect&quot; bias of each different pollster.  Except this appears to have been an across the board adjustment of 8 toward Clinton, implying that every pollster has been producing polls biased towards Trump by 8 points. And that they only discovered this following the DNC.  And that they didn&#39;t report what would otherwise be major story about the deficiencies of all national polling done this election cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason you&#39;re seeing the big disparity is if you&#39;re calculating these from nowcast then you have to take into effect all the other weights(which is impossible to figure out really or fact check for that matter).</p>

<p>If you&#39;re noticing it from strictly polls only and not polls+/nowcast.. then you need to take into factor the previous days polls they&#39;re using polls from up to a week ago, now those polls have less weight but trump wasn&#39;t doing well for many of them. The other thing you need to factor in is that STATE polls hold <em>much more weight</em> in terms of their forecast than NATIONAL polls. </p>

<p>For the polls only things they don&#39;t count the bounce, but she still was leading polls in general, if I&#39;m not mistaken. You need to look at the polling data from the previous window that they state their using. It doesn&#39;t look at that surprising to me given that, but I&#39;m not willing to dig. Each of the previous polls loses significance but say it was a leading poll from yesterday and the day before by hillary that&#39;s going to add to the weight. Is there a bias for hillary from 538? Probably. Would 538 keep it&#39;s so-called integrity? I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not the one posting a thread on r/conspiracy and doesn&#39;t understand the methology used by his source. 538 uses new poll numbers to adjust all of the averages based on their three tiered system. Oh course 538 has only guessed presidential elections correctly 99% of the time so the OP should send his research to a major news source. I&#39;m sure OP could make a real name and a lot of money for themselves disproving 538&#39;s methology. It&#39;s only the most respected source in polling so I&#39;m sure everyone would love to hear op&#39;s theories and &quot;proof&quot; of them screwing with the numbers. </p>
