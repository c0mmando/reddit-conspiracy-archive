        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Taking a break from the usual election nonsense, I&#39;d thought I&#39;d share/rant some of my thoughts I&#39;ve been having these last few months, thought this sub would receive it best.</p>

<p>A little bit of backstory: I&#39;m a computer guy. I&#39;ve always been a computer guy. I remember when I first used the internet; I didn’t know what it was, or how to navigate the vast amount of information and people it contained. I was overwhelmed, much like someone seeing sunlight for the first time, it was a lot to process. The packets I sent down the phone lines were like heroin through an addict’s veins, and I was addicted. </p>

<p>Back then the Internet was free. I remember reading old copies of <a href="http://www.phrack.org/issues/10/1.html">Phrack Magazine</a> and being amazed at everything in it. Phone phreaking, though severely outdated, was extremely cool to me. I entered a sort of cyber-punk phase, got into a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/3fxkkd/i_was_banned_from_using_the_internet_for_a_year/">bit of trouble at my school</a>, moved away from home and sort of grew out of it.</p>

<p>Now the internet has a very, very different feel to it. There&#39;s no reputable news sources anymore; Reddit is ok if you stick to smaller subs but needs to be taken with a grain of salt, but every national cable news network is straight up cucked, bought and paid for by politicians on both sides. Local news is slightly better but doesn&#39;t really cover all the major events. The internet as a whole feels very mundane and boring. It feels like a source of entertainment, and not a tool for communication and sharing information.</p>

<p>And with the government trying to make encryption illegal, trying to make Tor illegal, trying to make saying anything that a major company doesn&#39;t like illegal, it&#39;s honestly fucked. There&#39;s no free way to share information and discuss it. Every form of communication is completely monitored so unless you&#39;re using PGP encrypted email or iMessage (which I don&#39;t even trust anymore) then all your communications are being logged. And what&#39;s worse is we&#39;ve known this for three straight years, and we don&#39;t care, and half of Americans either don&#39;t know the guy who leaked the info or want him prosecuted. Everything on this sub is being monitored. Our lives are monitored.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s the thing that bothers me. Not that people in power are abusing that power, but that everyone knows, and doesn&#39;t seem to care. And it feels like I can&#39;t do anything about it. The internet is the single greatest thing to happen for humanity since modern medicine and it feels like it&#39;s being controlled and losing its core values.</p>

<p>I am not a citizen of the United States, I am a citizen of the world. My body may be here but my mind is on the web, and it feels like my thoughts are being controlled. Does anyone else feel this way?</p>

<p>The thing about mass extermination is that there is no logic to it, murder everyone.... YAY who&#39;s running the power plants? Who&#39;s gathering food? Who&#39;s flying planes? whos taking care of water, roads, trash etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are good questions but not good reasons to doubt mass extermination. Ultimately, none of us know EVERYTHING that is going on in the world no matter how hard we try. </p>

<p>Who is to say they haven&#39;t kidnapped kids from African countries you&#39;ll never hear a peep of news from? Who is to say these people aren&#39;t responsible for some of the kids going missing around the world? Who is to say they can&#39;t clone/create humans at this point? </p>

<p>We need to understand that some of these families are worth hundreds of trillions in assets/money. It would not be hard for them to build some massive underground bunker/city somewhere where young kids are taken and programmed to be slaves after the mass extermination is complete. </p>

<p>The Georgia guidestones 1st &quot;commandment&quot; is to reduce the world population to 500 million. No one knows who exactly had these stones built but it wasn&#39;t some poor chump and it likely wasn&#39;t a millionaire because they don&#39;t have THAT much disposable income. </p>

<p>That really leaves us with billionaires/trillionaires as the people behind the Georgia guidestones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right we will never be able to know everything it&#39;s impossible they could be building freaking underground tunnel all over the earth and no one would know. But the matter of fact is if you ever been in charge of employees training people to do stuff is hard and time consuming .</p>

<p>You want to train children to run a power plant? or gather garbage? People get FIRED from McDonalds because they can&#39;t flip freaking paddies of beef... now you&#39;re talking about cloning people to learn how to maintain the basic of a society for an elite to go hide underground to survive an apocalypse created with GM mosquitos...</p>

<p>Sorry but it kinda sound like crazy talk, they would develop AI and robots before doing that kind of shit and not rely on human that could rebelle and fuck shit up.</p>

I&#39;m not Pro-Israel or Pro-Palestine its just how shit are... Going on all your mighty Horses because Google map is showing the world as 99% of the countries see it...</p>

<p>Also why the fuck am I arguing and getting into the good old bait and switch I asked a question about his fucking extermination tin foiled hat and he&#39;s just &quot;WELL GOOGLE IS FUCKING WITH PALESTINE THINK ABOUT IT MAN!&quot;</p>

<p>To you maybe and that is because you might be lacking the imagination or being in other people shoes ability. Just for a moment think outside of the box and imagine a world that has been run by evil beings for hundreds no thousands of years and that everything has been manipulated and covered up (from history up to technology). Now there are multiple examples but lets take just one now. If you can do that and entertain the thought then it&#39;s not illogical or even crazy that they might have means and ends to create totally automated society controlled by single AI, is it ?! They would not need anyone and the only threat then would be AI becoming sentient and going against their will...</p>

<p>I am a really open minded person but IF they are that advanced and intelligent it does not really take a genius to understand that we are past medieval age and our society runs on a different level of maintenance and structure.</p>

<p>You&#39;re telling me that they want to narrow down the population to 500 millions peoples. How you select such people? You vaccinate 500 Millions people without anyone knowing it? 160mil more people than the population of the USA? </p>

<p>Please use your imagination and tell me how you do such a thing without A SINGLE person telling anymore about it, no one spilling the bean to the media every single person that gets a vaccine against these GM mosquitoes have a pure dark conscience and does not give a shit that 99% of the population is wiped.</p>

<p>How do you hold back army? Civilians with guns? The person that learn that, everything is getting fucked up and have the power to starts shooting missiles randomly into cities. Peoples blowing shit up because there is a crisis?</p>

<p>What the master plan is to hide more than the entire population of the USA underground in a bunker and chill until everything is burned into the ground and just surface back. &quot;Welp everything is burned down and fucked up guys, let the super AI kick in and it will fix everything&quot;.</p>

<p>Yes and no, it might be far more complicated then that so with time everything changes even them and its possible that they have been in some kind of internal conflict for control for centuries. This might be just my thinking by i cant see a world where only evil exists therefor there must be some good secret societies/powers call them what you want. There are a lot of disinformation on big secrets for a reason lol</p>

<p>Yes and yes, i&#39;ve come to conclusion that technological big bang has happened during 1960s and has only been accelerating so right now humanity has technology that would seem like magic or only seen in sci-fi movies... also having an AI (even sentient one) that is isolated from the rest of the world/internet is nothing special and i would not be surprised one bit.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>When it comes with companies like google that are &quot;too big to fail&quot; they don&#39;t really care about anything but profit, it just that simple.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is what they say not me lol, personally i don&#39;t believe that 500 mil. part one bit not because they can&#39;t do it but because they would not be allowed to do it, same goes for ww3 and usage of nukes on global scale.</p>

<p>When you have &quot;unlimited&quot; resources and people that are in it that don&#39;t even have an idea what are they working on (compartmentalize everything) it is in fact &quot;easy&quot; to keep big secrets/projects hidden. Ever hear of The Manhattan Project where one a few knew the whole picture or &quot;MAJIC PROJECTS&quot; or as some call it Majestic-12 and now know as MAJI... this world is full of secrets and mysteries only waiting to be revealed by design or pure luck.</p>

<p>How do &quot;people&quot; fight an enemy they don&#39;t even know exists... they don&#39;t or they make one up odds are a false/wrong one (yes, the divide and conquer tactics on global scale). Internet might be the biggest threat to these evil secret society, i mean just look at the last 30 years of Internet... things have been unreal !</p>

<p>Anyway this is reddit after all where opinions and facts are often looked the same (sometime even goes to extreme where insults are used for many reasons most unjustified) but the fact is that there is only ONE Truth and i doubt anyone will learn it here only in bits and pieces maybe but i&#39;m sure some here know the truth and they are wise enough to know not share it for very obvious reasons, not all at once at least lol ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply as far as I think about the technological big bang it&#39;s just snowball effect. You work your way to silicone tech then from there you can build better greater machine that project you to another level so on and on. </p>

<p>There was big leap before but they just seems insignificant because its everyday life now. The wheel, pulley system, math, navigation etc... it&#39;s just that now we are at another level, ek a few years ago going into space was impossible and now we have SpaceX.</p>

<p>I think AI is near our doors but I don&#39;t think that we are at a point that we can computer powerful enough to have a &quot;skynet&quot; or a AI that control anything. When we will achieve quantum computing this kind of things will be possible other than that  supercomputers are great and all but we are limited by the tech we are right now.</p>

<p>There is probably ONE Truth but not one that you might know or hear about, I&#39;m pretty sure that if everything was told, this is how they would wipe 90% of the population most of the people would just drive off a cliff. The Truth is that 99.99% of the population have no power over their lives and that you can&#39;t do anything thing to change how the world function. Because the machine is too big to fail the wheel have been turning for far too long, even if everyone would walk in the street try to change thing and take arms they would just mown people down in a heartbeat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the same feelings about the internet.</p>

<p>When I was in grade 8 I finally got access to the internet through the library at my junior high school. Before that I was on Apple IIe&#39;s in elementary school. I couldn&#39;t afford it at home. I remember spending long periods of time on it. I&#39;d get kicked out of music class to go to the library and look things up. I even went to my only after school activity, a wake-a-thon, in order to use the internet for 12 hours straight. I was hooked on it. Eventually used it to teach myself C++ and got into computer programming.</p>

<p>Now when I come online, it&#39;s just propaganda everywhere. Most information websites are corporate propaganda and political agenda. Even wiki now.</p>

<p>Now I spend most of my time looking for alternate sources of information and fighting back against the corruption.</p>

<p>I definitely don&#39;t feel the innocence anymore. Even the small subs on reddit are devoid of discourse. Most people online are like most people in real life, no talent and no knowledge. They regurgitate corporate information.</p>

<p>For instance, I like to troll r/startrek a lot because the people there are mostly ignorant fools. It&#39;s a sub for brigading and zero discourse. All that they post in that once decent sub is financial reports on the movies being released and biased media coverage.</p>

<p>The people there are either in on it or have no idea how ridiculous they behave. There&#39;s a complete lack of achievement and creativity online today. Everything has become vile online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>3 grade was similar for me. We had a computer in the class room with Oregon Trail . Even though I was just playing a game I also became aware of the importance of knowledge, history, and free movement of people. As soon as I got access to the internet I started downloading documents, books and anything else available over 56k. </p>

<p>Now 15 years after Kazaa, torrents, and the free exchange of ideas that the internet has provided I am edging on believing we maybe less informed of meaningful information than ever before.</p>

<p>Institutions are a scam, certifications are a scam, heroes are a scam, money is a scam, news is a scam....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in my mid 20&#39;s and only recently got interested in politics due to all the attacks on the internet such as my country&#39;s internet spying bill and TPP(which quite honestly is the single most important thing to the corps because it gives them the ability to undermine the sovereignty of every country in the agreement). </p>

<p>I started following the US election because I realized that the outcome is the only chance we(the people) have to stop TPP due to the fact that all of the countries in the agreements are cucks to the US and will surely ratify it. </p>

<p>At first I felt great about all this new information I was learning because I was finally getting answers to how the world came to be/is so fucked by corporations. The unfortunate thing is that it has turned into depression over time. I was so sure that we were going to reach mass awakening with all the mass fuckery being exposed but it has not happened.</p>

<p>I have reached the point where I have accepted how fucked we are and the only thing I&#39;m looking forward to is the day when the agenda is fully completed and I can laugh at all the people I know who weren&#39;t expecting it and even denied that anything sinister was going on. I want the doubters to know it is entirely their fault when it comes to pass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, strange times we&#39;re living in. They&#39;re trying to control the internet and I guess do a good job at that with the average citizen/internet user. If you know what you&#39;re doing and what to look for/avoid, I feel like it&#39;s pretty easy to navigate around. Problem is most people aren&#39;t web savvy and do buy into all the propaganda nonsense. </p>

<p>|And it feels like I can&#39;t do anything about it.</p>

<p>Sure you can; speak up about it. Most people simply don&#39;t know the depths of what&#39;s really going on and aren&#39;t used to hearing someone spit raw, uncut truth. You can get away with doing this and not come off as a total crazy man because there&#39;s a ton of verifiable evidence that supports. In my experience, most people are open ears about it. If they aren&#39;t, well then they are imbeciles and that&#39;s a different story entirely. Again, this shit is factual. Denying it is like denying 2+2 equals 4. I feel people in general aren&#39;t really used to hearing this stuff because they&#39;re so used to the bullshit coming through their television and simply don&#39;t know any better. If you are more educated on the subject, have facts to back you up and don&#39;t communicate the info passive-aggressively (which I&#39;m sometimes guilty off, because the shit pisses me off and I&#39;m passionate about it, but sometimes can come off as aggressive), it can go a long way. I&#39;ve seen it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jews are closing their grip on the Internet. Look at Facebook, Google, and so on. It&#39;s all Jews. Those of us who saw this coming have been predicting it for more than a decade. The Jews will control everything, and when they do, free speech of any kind will be a thing of the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always wondered how the holocaust factors into all this?</p>

<p>Were they trying to pull this shit back then and people got pissed off and decided to exterminate them?</p>

<p>Or has the holocaust been exaggerated and engraved into our heads  for the sole purpose of attacking anyone who realizes that we are getting royally fucked over by them?</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious to know what the Qurun says about Jews because the Bible refers to them as the chosen people. That alone should honestly wake people up to the fact that Religion was created by them to control others. If &quot;God&quot; created us equal then why the fuck are there chosen people? </p>

<p>You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those who associate others with Allah; and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say, &quot;We are Christians.&quot; That is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant.</p>

<p>They were chosen at that time, at least thats what Islam says.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of fishy thing on theofficial Holocaust narrative. Hitler did not plan to exterminate the Jews, just exodus them out of Germany with their wealth even if that meant that they had their own state (see the Transfer/Haavara Agreement) due to the grip of Zionist control in finances and whatnot. Most of the Jews in the Nazi camps died to starvation, or more so, disease as supplies became scarce to to Allied bombing of critical infrastructure (roads, railroads, vehicles, production buildings) and maybe even farm land. Many of the Japanese in the US camps may have had the same fate of the Axis attacked the US Homeland and destroyed a bunch of critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>You can find many resources on the Holocaust at <a href="/r/Holocaust">/r/Holocaust</a> and <a href="/r/Holocaust/Wiki">/r/Holocaust/Wiki</a> </p>

<p>Edit: Punctuation and addition.</p>

<p>Edit 2: The Zionists called a for a worldwide boycott by Jews of the world of German goods before the Holocaust.</p>
