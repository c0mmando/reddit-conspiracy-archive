I hate the Clintons as much as the next guy here (related officials dropping like flies, election rigging, etc.), but it only helps the Clintons&#39; case when you say things taken out of context or said in a misleading way.</p>

<p>For example, take the claim that Hillary Clinton pushed weapon sales to ISIS. The chain of articles leads to this original article, which supposedly has an interview with Julian Assange himself:
<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2016/7/25/assange_why_i_created_wikileaks_searchable">http://www.democracynow.org/2016/7/25/assange_why_i_created_wikileaks_searchable</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thepoliticalinsider.com reported: In Obama’s second term, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton authorized the shipment of American-made arms to Qatar, a country beholden to the Muslim Brotherhood, and friendly to the Libyan rebels, in an effort to topple the Libyan/Gaddafi government, and then ship those arms to Syria in order to fund Al Qaeda, and topple Assad in Syria.</p>

<p>Clinton took the lead role in organizing the so-called <strong>“Friends of Syria” (aka Al Qaeda/ISIS)</strong> to back the CIA-led insurgency for regime change in Syria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(emphasis added)</p>

<p>This excerpt from the current top post on this sub makes it sound like HRC sent weapons directly to ISIS/AQ while knowing that the weapons were going to ISIS/AQ. Did she and the State Department take the correct route by trying to send weapons to rebels, and more broadly, artificially create regime change? Almost certainly not. She did something very bad, but not exactly what the links might suggest. </p>

<p>a) I&#39;m going to withhold judgement until someone gets me a primary source on that. Not an article breadcrumb trail that I have to click a dozen times only to end up at the same article I start at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Each particular issue needs to be meticulously researched;  accusations can be baseless or a trap of misinformation.   On the other hand,  the Clintons have been involved in drugs,  murder,  rapes,  financial fraud,  since the 80&#39;s.   The list of crimes they have avoided jail for is almost endless.</p>

<p>While Hillary was Secretary of State:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In December 2011, former counter-terrorism specialist and CIA military intelligence officer Philip Giraldi asserted that already &quot;unmarked NATO warplanes are arriving at Turkish military bases close to the Syrian border, delivering weapons from the late Muammar Gaddafi’s arsenals as well as volunteers from the Libyan Transitional National Council who are experienced in pitting local volunteers against trained soldiers&quot; and that in addition, &quot; French and British special forces trainers are on the ground, assisting the Syrian rebels while the CIA and U.S. Spec Ops are providing communications equipment and intelligence to assist the rebel cause.&quot; Giraldi stated that &quot;CIA analysts are skeptical regarding the march to war&quot; for reasons including that &quot;the frequently cited U.N. report that more than 3,500 civilians have been killed by Assad’s soldiers is based largely on rebel sources and is uncorroborated&quot; while cautioning in The American Conservative that &quot;Americans should be concerned about what is happening in Syria… It threatens to become another undeclared war like Libya but much, much worse.&quot; (NATO vs. Syria By Philip Giraldi December 19, 2011, The American Conservative)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree about meticulously researching every issue, not taking anything for granted.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree that the evidence clearly shows that HRC sent weapons (guns, chemical weapons, etc.) to people in Syria. What&#39;s a point of contention, in my mind at least, is whether or not HRC/SD sent them directly to ISIS/AQ around 2011-2013 knowing that they would end up in the hands of groups who could/would use these weapons against U.S. interests. The articles make it sound like the SD under HRC was actively funding and providing materiel to organizations who&#39;s stated goals were to attack the U.S. and its allies. Maybe this is true as well, but the evidence that supposedly backs this claim up doesn&#39;t. They sent munitions over to someone in Libya/Syria, but it can&#39;t be proven (yet) not directly to ISIS/AQ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of time is wasted trying to pretend exactly who the players are in the battles of Libya and Syria.   For example,  a lot of the anti-Assad forces in Syria have come to be found containing a lot of Kurds and foreign mercenaries.   The  ISIS/AQ label is really pretty meaningless except from a propaganda perspective.</p>

<p>There are constant tensions between factions that had Iranian or Iraqi ties.</p>

<p>The other thing is that ISIS was invented a month after the &quot;raid&quot; on the &quot;bin Laden&quot; compound in Abbottabad Pakistan,  which was a farce.</p>

<p>Its probably better if we address any of these groups in Afganistan,  Libya,  Iraq,  or Syria by their local names and find out specifically the history of leadership etc.  of these groups.    The CIA and US propaganda is playing the American public with a shit load of propaganda.    &quot;Moderate rebels&quot;  is another one.</p>

<p>The US strategy in 7 countries was outlined in September 2001.   The stories are played to make it seem like the US is on the &quot;right side&quot;.   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw</a></p>

<p>I am not putting this out there as if there is a final authoritative position.    Look,  the UN decided that it wasn&#39;t Assad&#39;s gas.   The US has been playing incredibly dirty,  even in the Ukraine where we directly funded,  armed,  and &quot;appointed&quot; Neo Nazis to run the country.   The Russians were not deeply involved at the time.   It would have been stupid for Assad or his Russian backers to be using gas the week before the UN was coming to do a fact finding intervention on the civil war in general.    It really looks like it was the US backed &quot;mercenary&quot; group(s) that did it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other thing is trying to look for credible sources these days.   The are few,  if any.   Some of the sources that in the past used to break stories like Watergate,  Mai Lai,  etc.  are no longer reliably credible,  including NPR,  PBS,  NYT,  LA Times,  Wash Post,  etc. etc.   Sure,  story by story,  I look at them.    Most of the best reporting these days is outside of the MSM.    Democracy now is also very very spotty and incomplete.   And biased.</p>

<p>Some of the best sources are individuals,  as in whistle-blowers or independent investigators.    Research has to be done on an issue by issue basis.   For example,  on 9/11 issues,  Kevin Ryan and David Griffin have done the least to embarrass themselves.    There are others that have lost all credibility on the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. MSM is so corrupt already, you can&#39;t take what they say as true anymore. The issue with smaller, unheard of publications is that while there are almost certainly nuggets of truth that make them worthwhile to trudge through, it&#39;s just as easy for people to just fabricate things. In general, I take everything I read with a bag of salt, no matter the source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Criticism of the Clintons will now be forever linked with the baffoonery of the Trump campaign.  Nobody can seem to remember he played the part of the conservative Trojan horse before when it came to Obama&#39;s birth certificate which just so happened to be released soon after Trump got involved.  That issue then became the major source material for ridicule in mass media and anyone who had questions about our president&#39;s mysterious background was shut down by being called a birther. </p>
