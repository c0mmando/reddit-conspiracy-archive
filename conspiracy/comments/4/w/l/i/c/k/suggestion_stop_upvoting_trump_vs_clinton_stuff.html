<blockquote>
<p>Politics in America is identical to pro wrestling.</p>

<p>In front of the crowd, in front of TV, they pretend they hate each other. They pretend like they are big adversaries and that’s the sell job they do to us, the citizens. Just like pro wrestling, my job was to go out and piss everybody off so bad they would pay their hard earned money to go out and see me get my butt kicked. Well, the point is, we are all friends in the locker room. We all work together. It’s entertainment. We put on a show and this is no different. They are putting on a show, because behind the scenes, they are all friends. They go out to dinner together and cut their deals together. It’s a show. That’s what I believe. I taught at Harvard in 2004. Do you know what one of my classes was? How Pro Wrestling Prepares You For Politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great example of the problem as I stated it. Land (property) was seized by the government without any respect to the property holders. It was then either parceled off, allocated for homesteading, or held for use by the government.</p>

<p>So yeah, had the government respected property rights, they would have bought the land. Of course, most of the land mass of the US <em>was</em> bought and it was actually the governments of France and Spain who first seized the property without just compensation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your slavery point is nonsense.</p>

<p>However, your point is that in the entire time of the existence of the human race we have always inherently understood that we own the product of our labour. Yet property encompasses a wide variety of &quot;things&quot; including land and goods.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t argue about the use of inherent, there is nothing inherent about understanding of social conventions.</p>

<p>There is plenty of anthropological evidence that suggests that in many societies you were expected to share your bounty, hunter gatherer societies could not have survived without sharing, certainly you were entitled to a portion, perhaps even the lion&#39;s share.</p>

<p>There is also no indication that in such societies people believed they owned land merely because they added some labour to it. This stretches even into feudal lord-vassal relationships where you worked another&#39;s land. You did not own that land, nor did you own the entire product of it. You worked it in exchange for livelihood, protection, or whatever. Your lord owned the land and enjoyed his <em>prima noctae</em>, and you understood this to be the normal course of the world.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with communism and keep your petty insults to yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please explain how the point on slavery is nonsense. Clearly slavery is incompatible with property rights – that they were ever combined is a perversion of justice. Property rights are the product of liberty so where there is no liberty there can be no justly acquired property.</p>

<p>The sharing societies you mention are by any standard impoverished – not in the monetary sense, but in the sense that they lack medicine, access to information, refrigeration, etc. Show me an example of a society which developed all these things without property rights. Because as far as I can tell, trade is required for the development of advanced technology, and trade is rather complicated without property rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t need to show you that because I never made the point that such things didn&#39;t require property rights. Nowhere did I say that modern medicine etc was possible without property rights. My point was that you were wrong to say that humanity at all points in history understood that individuals own their labour. Whether or not societies who didn&#39;t have property rights are impoverished is besides the point.</p>

<p>If someone said &quot;man has always buried or burned the dead&quot; I suppose you could come back and say &quot;No, technically ceremonial burial didn&#39;t develop until 50,000BC or whatever&quot;. Perhaps you might be right, but again, you&#39;re just being pedantic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There actually something wrong with it, if you&#39;re trying to say that because something does not apply in isolated edge cases that it does not generally apply. Especially since the assumption that isolated tribal cultures are anything like prehistoric &quot;connected&quot; cultures remains an assumption. So if precision is your concern, then you should have included in your statement a clarification that today&#39;s isolated tribal cultures may well not be indicative of how our ancestors lived, and instead may posses certain cultural quirks that have for whatever reason prevented their assimilation into the world&#39;s trade and information network. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never even mentioned today&#39;s isolated cultures, though I suppose I implicitly supported the anthropological study of them as a means to understand prehistoric cultures due to inherent requirement for that assumption to make the very point. I concede that. However I also made several other points which included western European Feudalism, and didn&#39;t even mention the countless examples such as Russian serfdom, kapikulu, and more. </p>

<p>Communism can never be achieved without dissolution of the state. If the state is not dissolved, it grabs power from the vacuum.</p>

<p>For there to be an &quot;empire&quot;, there would need to be a ruling class. In communism, <em>there is no ruling class</em>. This is why Leninism and Stalinism were failures, just as capitalism is doomed to collapse.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m a libertarian socialist, not a communist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Actually existing communism&quot; is communism in self-titled name only. Not in practice... at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like &quot;military intelligence&quot; a contradiction in terms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice way to prove that you probably didn&#39;t even go to college to regurgitate any of the nonsense you are. In mainstream political discourse, socialism refers to &quot;social democracy&quot; (state uses taxation to fund welfare) and Marxist-Leninist states where all industry is controlled by the state.</p>

<p>In America, &quot;libertarian&quot; commonly refers to right-wing advocates of free market capitalism and private corporate ownership of industry, opposing state management of the economy. Yes, it&#39;s exactly like military intelligence as a contradiction, but the fact that you&#39;ve resorted to that proves you don&#39;t know as much as you think you do.</p>

<p>Neither of these are what I describe. Libertarian and socialism have other, earlier meanings. When I say I want socialism, I want the means of production to be owned and managed by workers, not the state. The 1936 Spanish Revolution is an ideal example of this. China, Cuba, USSR, etc, are not examples of this. As for libertarianism, it refers to a general scepticism of authority and social hierarchy, with state capitalism being an unjust form of hierarchy.</p>

<p>Libertarian socialists reject establishing socalism through political parties. I favor direct democracy over representative democracy. Both corporate capitalism and state socialism are failures.</p>

<p>The definitions of these two words that you subscribe to are actually new, and not the original meanings. Some reading would be good for you, starting with Joseph Déjacque, who coined the word libertarian, which used to be mainly used as a polite form of &quot;anarchist.&quot; <em>The Betrayal of the American Right</em> will help illustrate this point about it being appropriated by the American right. Why should libertarian socialists change their terminology because someone else applied their own later?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope a lot of people in this sub take the time to read what you said. You did a wonderful job of articulating the <em>actual</em> meanings of 2 words I see so very many people throw around without understanding what they really mean. </p>

<p>Without getting too deep into the topic of governmental philosophies, I  would like to point out that right now European countries are smaller and much more nimble and manageable than the somewhat bulky and unwieldy United States is. The smaller country land masses and populations have allowed a certain amount of experimentation and because of that have developed much more evolved approaches to governing. </p>

<p>That said,all things appear indicate that it is the more democratically aligned forms of socialism that are producing the evolved and successful societies in  Europe. Hopefully the success of Sanders&#39; campaign is an indication that the United States population is starting to see that the current incarnation of capitalism that the United States has  been using, with  it&#39;s dogma of competition, dominion, conquest and consumerism, is an unsustainable failure that is, predictably, too parasitic, greed driven, and corrupt to be a truly valid means of governing a country.  </p>

<p>People look to the more evolved European countries and cultures and wonder just why, exactly, it is we can&#39;t have something closer to that ourselves. I like to see this as a hopeful sign for us going forward. </p>

<p>Sadly, the hopeful signs these days are a rarity among the many other signs of foreboding and gloom that are facing the future of our country. Fascism&#39;s roots run very deep in America.  </p>

<p>LOL - I studied STEM in college, not post-structuralist Marxist theory.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t care less about Marxist theory - it&#39;s nothingness, it&#39;s just a bunch of words with no practical application.</p>

<p>The only communism that matters is really existing communism - which is awful, no matter how you slice it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think being STEM-educated makes you smarter or more &quot;correct&quot; politically? You clearly don&#39;t understand some fundamental concepts of something you&#39;re trying to criticize, so that&#39;s obviously not the case.</p>

<p>Like I said, you haven&#39;t given a single example of communism. This is like arguing that the political spectrum is not actually a spectrum. Your continued use of them as some semblance of a point does not undermine any of what I&#39;ve said, you who claim to be omniscient.</p>

<p>Marxism is not a buzzword or indeed a &quot;canon&quot; text of some sort. Something being merely <em>called</em> Marxist does not mean it is faithful to his foundation, or his morality and character as a man. China today is not Maoist, but still claims to be communist. This is like calling someone an anarchist even though they want a central government.</p>

<p>It&#39;s meaningless. If there is no actual practical applications you can point to - or all the actual implementations are &quot;not true communism&quot; - then it&#39;s literally just words with no application to the real world.</p>

<p>Actually, that is EXACTLY the way you are using it. The actual existing communist movements of the last 100 years aren&#39;t &quot;true communism&quot; to you because they don&#39;t follow the canon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggested you never studied politics in college, which you confirmed. It&#39;s fine to admit you&#39;re not knowledgable on a particular subject.</p>

<p>You&#39;re meandering trying to pin down a point because you&#39;re devoid of not only it but also any understanding that&#39;d help you formulate one. You are not presenting any form of criticism, only thinly-veiled insults. You&#39;re too conceited and ignorant to truly ponder the opposing view, and scramble in search of examples that appear only on the surface to conform to your worldview. That&#39;s cognitive dissonance, a cornerstone of capitalism and the only reason it continues to function.</p>

<p>Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism, Marxism, etc. The facts you misrepresent and misinterpret are that no communist state in history has actually adhered to communist principles. Each one is state-run. That automatically invalidates it as communist <strong><em>by definition</em></strong>. Your examples are only communism in the same manner your definitions of libertarian and socialism are false. Your fledgling argument doesn&#39;t hold any relevance to anything I&#39;ve said.</p>

<p>You yourself have just admitted that your examples have no relation to what I&#39;m talking about aside from a term you don&#39;t even give a particular definition. How do you expect to feign a foray into reasonable discourse if that&#39;s the kind of mental gymnastics you resort to?</p>

<p>Millions of people took libertarian socialism seriously in 1936. Not all of them went to college.

    <div class="md"><p>Simple. That world cannot exist. Sure, We can all become &quot;one state&quot;. But even if the world became one giant &quot;commune&quot;, certain people who had the job of supplying certain &quot;supplies&quot; would be more in demand than others. This would give them more power than they should in a society that relies on eachother, would it not? If &quot;something went wrong and it&#39;s gonna take longer for the oil/natural gas/food/water to be collected, or more time for the people who&#39;s jobs it is to deliver it to distribute it, does that not increase their value as a citizen in a society where everyone is supposed to be equal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That world can exist just fine. Human nature is not a flaw, ignorance is. We are fully capable of overcoming what we call human nature, the current global political system however presents no incentive to do so.</p>

<p>Capitalism is quite recent in historical terms, and will soon fade just as feudalism did. However I&#39;d argue that capitalism is merely a branch-off of feudalism. In a truly free world, there are no &quot;jobs&quot; and there is no money. Without either of those, people are much less incentivised to screw over others. People do as they desire, and those who desire ill are filtered out since the tactics they use to impose their will are no longer usable.</p>

<p>You are fretting over matters that are irrelevant to the world I&#39;m talking about. Without the pursuit of personal wealth, the monopolization of natural resources becomes an after-thought, while the pursuit of free, clean energy will be significantly boosted. Capitalism incentivises these issues you mistakenly attribute to a world without borders.</p>

<p>Only in a capitalist world. Without it, we are free to put our energy into fruitful pursuits. We could end homelessness and world hunger easily. The amount of homes and food, at least in most developed countries, severely outweighs the number of poor and hungry. But capitalism does not incentivise solving these problems and inherently ignores human well-being because its goal is not advancement, in any form.</p>

<p>Absolute power corrupts. But in a libertarian socialist world, there is no absolute power to grab. A complete and thorough decentralization of power and the implementation of direct democracy leaves little to no room for abuse.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pessimistic too, but I don&#39;t see that as a reason to not fight for something that&#39;s so clearly <em>right</em> for people, and not this self-destructive monster we&#39;re slaving under.</p>

<p>Squabbling over resources in this day and age is entirely due to capitalism creating markets for them. It&#39;s virtually a macro-level perspective on the diamond trade. Illusory value placed on something that isn&#39;t even rare, fueled by feudal and capitalist power.</p>

<p>The good news is that once you remove the desire for profit, attention can be diverted to clean and unlimited energy for which we have already devised several functioning methods held back only by money. The same applies to food and water. So these hypothetical resources you allude to will never have conflict for them come to fruition. There&#39;s nothing people would desire to kill themselves over, unless we find something in space that changes the paradigm.</p>

<p>Also, post-scarcity is inevitable and fast approaching with continued automation and outsourcing. Capitalism and the governments that grossly adhere to it are not built to handle it. Libertarian socialism though...</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t expect the whole world to follow suit. But the nations that claim to be &quot;enlightened&quot; would be a good start, the rest will follow. Orwell was present during the above revolution:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of any size in Western Europe where political consciousness and disbelief in capitalism were more normal than their opposites. Up here in Aragon one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it. There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life—snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.—had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It took Catalonia just three months to adapt. And that&#39;s with war. More peaceful and diplomatic processes would obviously be more favorable and with quicker transition. People simply need to be educated, not misled, coerced or indoctrinated, as is the capitalist way.</p>

<p>People won&#39;t refuse to work. If they need something, they&#39;ll make it. People are not motivated to work by money, but by necessity. In this case, the new necessity will be production, not money. A purer motivation. </p>

<p>Have you considered the aftermath of inevitable automation under a capitalist society that still binds quality of life to wealth? It will be a monumental and unparalleled catastrophe if the 1% hold onto that power, but by pure numbers, they cannot, especially when presented with working examples of the superior alternative.

<p>The inevitable backlash would be people trying to hold onto elitism. And they&#39;re 1%. The 99% will reach a breaking point. People rally behind themselves or people they choose through direct cemocracy. Representative democracy is a failure. There has never been a need for a leader in human society (a queen ant is merely a broodmare, a point that perfectly illustrates the illusion of power), but I suspect at some point an ASI or several might fill that role if someone is desperate for leadership in a post-capitalist world, it&#39;s the only pragmatic option.</p>

<p>Yes, frequently. It&#39;s terrifying. The alternative is a system not utterly unlike what you describe where machines do all the work and people occupy their time with other things. That&#39;s in a world fundamentally at odds with the system we have now. In the interim - pain, hardship, death, suffering. That isn&#39;t a system to be advertised as an alternative... it is the death throes of free men... because if you think for one moment that a system such as this will go unabused and unexploited by those hungry for power - you are mistaken. We will have our utopia - but only after a total break down of the current system, only after immense suffering and only after TOTAL COMPLIANCE after that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of this is answered in the stuff I&#39;ve linked.</p>

<p>Yes, a total breakdown of the current system is inevitable and will cause suffering, on some level. But it is also likely the transition will be smoother than what you envision. In the end, it&#39;s at the mercy of human will. We can&#39;t predict the future, but we should always strive for a better one. The majority will see that the pros vastly outweigh the cons and will adapt quickly, society is much more progressive now, we just need to see exactly how much. The time is always nigh, and if it fails, then it should try and fail again until it succeeds. Trying to better society is an ever-present goal. Homelessness and hunger will be swiftly erased, financial burdens gone, health care and other public services significantly improved, farming production better regulated with increased productivity, direct democracy, unbiased and non-competitive news coverage controlled directly by the people, advancements in free and clean energy, free and open education of the highest caliber, a cleaner environment, a fairer justice system, civil rights, opportunities, no surveilance, a &quot;New Left&quot; resurgence with the absence of an oppressive regime or empire to impede it, etc. A libertarian socialist revolution would be the prelude to a cultural renaissance. Creativity and the arts will flourish. The scale at which money controls and inhibits these and other aspects of society is abhorrent.</p>

<p>I have actual real-life examples to draw from, the 1936 Spanish Revolution was a limited success, but the rise of European fascism at the time crushed it with help from lesser corrupt &quot;enlightened&quot; nations. We should strive for the same goal without making the same mistakes. Perhaps I&#39;m an optimist, but pussy-footing should never stand in the way of advancement and freedom. You subscribe to the idea that all of the current suffering, corruption, poverty and control is fine as long as you yourself are relatively at ease. Meanwhile, your death toll and incarceration rate rocket beyond that if we&#39;d gone the revolutionary route. The innate corruption of capitalism is rooted in so many aspects of society that it exacts pain, death and imprisonment from every corner of it. Prohibition promotes crime and unjust policing while abusing the poor. Pharmaceutical profits are valued more highly than the well-being of their patients, such as the overprescription of painkillers for profit and negligence over the resulting deaths while opposing safe alternatives such as cannabis. Millions spent on new weapons out of a compulsion to update and continue to remain relevant and profit. Wars started under the pretense of promoting peace in order to steal land and resources or install a puppet fascist dictatorship for capitalist ends with the death toll being completely negligible, etc. These strange juxtapositions of morality are unforgiveable and should not be glanced over, they should not be allowed to exist.</p>

<p>Humanity has free will, albeit also a number of reasoning and logical fallacies. We should not resign ourselves to misery when we can choose a better way that benefits the majority and not the few, while resisting those who live for greed and control. Capitalism will implode but we are well within our ability to limit the impact on ourselves, and with the significantly high probability of improving our lives, and the lives of others who&#39;ve been directly hurt by a festering failed system. Also when I refer to revolutionary, I don&#39;t mean by force, even if some measure may be employed.</p>

<p>Even Islam has this right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Islamic thinking, especially in the Shi&#39;a school of thought, a social revolution is needed when any form of government is tyrannic and despotic to its people. The underlying concept of Islamic revolution maintains that moral freedom is the most important aspect of a human&#39;s fundamental needs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting how demographics change in here though?. Most of us figured out years ago politics is a show to keep people distracted and divided. Ironically it was this sub that taught me about a lot of that. Now 75% of posts are politically motivated.</p>

<p>I guess if you figure in the amount censorship happening here on reddit it doesn&#39;t surprise me people come here to post. It&#39;s one of the last places posts won&#39;t get deleted or censored heavily.</p>

He&#39;s lost pga deals, been dropped by major clothing stores like Macy&#39;s, and lost the miss universe pageant among countless others. He&#39;s also sunk a lot of his own money into the campaign.

<p>The people we are dealing with are spoilt kids it could be potentially enlightening treating them as children not men.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I completely DISAGREE. One of them is going to get elected. Yes it&#39;s true that we need complete electoral reform, especially a system laid out by Robert David Steele, but to completely check out is actually worse. Word on the street is Trump thinks the Clinton&#39;s are disgusting animals, they are certainly not friends. They don&#39;t represent some of the same interests, but to check out is to let them do whatever they wish. To talk about it,to bring up the corruption is how to get it into the mass consciousness. It&#39;s not energy wasted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not enough. How do you know they are friends? Just because they did business with each other before? That means nothing. When you are a BIG real estate developer you&#39;re always going to grease the prime time politicians, would be stupid not to. There are many different power players and different &quot;factions&quot; if you will. Just because you did business with someone years ago doesn&#39;t mean you like or respect them. Obviously a big time developer gets cozy with politicians. Probably heard a reputation that the Clintons were doing underhanded deals. Doesn&#39;t mean you like or respect them either. We&#39;ll see how it plays out, anything is possible and I&#39;m open minded and skeptical of both sides. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The Clintons have long had ties with the real-estate magnate. As The Post notes, Hillary Clinton attended Trump&#39;s wedding in 2005, and the reality-television personality donated money to her past Senate campaigns, though he has also donated to several of his own Republican presidential rivals. He has said those donations were transactional.</p>

<p>The former president has spoken positively of Trump in the past.</p>

<p>In a 2012 interview with CNN, Clinton said he liked Trump, despite the real-estate mogul&#39;s controversial campaign to get President Barack Obama to release his birth certificate.</p>

<p>&quot;Donald Trump has been uncommonly nice to Hillary and me. We&#39;re all New Yorkers,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;I like him. And I love playing golf with him.&quot;</p>

<p>Aides to both Bill Clinton and Trump did not comment on record to The Post. Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign also didn&#39;t respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Bill Clinton has occasionally doled out advice to Republican presidential candidates.</p>

Anyone trying to bash both trump and Hillary is clearly just shills for Hillary trying to deactivate this sub which has been waiting for a candidate like trump who calls out voting/media being rigged for a long time.  Also trump is the future of media, in that he puts out his own narrative, very similar to the journalists that have risen upon the truth/conspiracy movements</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple. That world cannot exist. Sure, We can all become &quot;one state&quot;. But even if the world became one giant &quot;commune&quot;, certain people who had the job of supplying certain &quot;supplies&quot; would be more in demand than others. This would give them more power than they should in a society that relies on eachother, would it not? If &quot;something went wrong and it&#39;s gonna take longer for the oil/natural gas/food/water to be collected, or more time for the people who&#39;s jobs it is to deliver it to distribute it, does that not increase their value as a citizen in a society where everyone is supposed to be equal?</p>
