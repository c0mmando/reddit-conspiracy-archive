        Here's the contents of the post:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The straightforward question is this: Are paid proponents of candidates for office required to post a disclaimer when promoting their candidate on Reddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/notices.shtml">
        Special Notices on Political Ads and Solicitations
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From that document:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a "disclaimer" notice is defined as a statement placed on a public communication that identifies the person(s) who paid for the communication and, where applicable, the person(s) who authorized the communication.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When is a Disclaimer Required?
       </p>
       <p>
        (3) web sites available to the general public, regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, or solicits funds in connection with a federal election
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A disclaimer must appear on any "electioneering communication" (defined below) and on any public communication by any person that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate or solicits funds in connection with a federal election.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I was under the impression that if a person or group claims to just be an educational entity promoting ideas that happen to align with a particular candidate, then certain exemptions apply. However, this document specifically states "regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate".
      </p>
      <p>
       So what if you ask one if they support a particular candidate and they say they do, and they're being paid to say so? Would that comment then require a disclaimer? Would all of that account's politically-relevant comments need disclaimers, even if they didn't advocate for a specific candidate? It sounds to me like the FEC is saying all payed shilling online should be marked with disclaimers. How wrong am I?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any recourse if a person or group is found to be in violation?

       for sharing this. I was the OP in a post over there about a week ago...

       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4vngfk/does_reddit_have_legal_standing_to_sue_correct/">
        Does Reddit have legal standing to sue Correct The Record (CTR)?

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         The post I created 6 days ago never asked if I could sue CTR. I asked if Reddit could sue CTR
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       After hearing a different suggestion I created this post requesting that
       <em>
        Reddit
       </em>
       sues CTR for tortious interference.

       If you look throughout that post or

        Are paid proponents of candidates for office required to post a disclaimer when promoting their candidate on Reddit?

       Clearly you don't understand the term "censorship," nor do you apparently understand what happened over at r/legaladvice. Reddit is what would, in 1st amendment jurisprudential terms, be called a private space - meaning it is free to prevent any speech or none at its pleasure.

      <p>
       That said, the issue over at legal advice was people asking ridiculous questions about suing primarily Hillary Clinton or the Democratic national committee for what they perceived to be violations some law or another. In addition to there being no merit to the claims the responses tend to be off-topic and filled with debates about politics rather than law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not every sub Reddit is or should be a fora for political discussion. As such the "censorship" that you decry was both perfectly appropriate and not in anyway A limitation on anyone's free-speech rights because there are ample other fora both on this website and elsewhere for those discussions to take place.

       Fuck you and your legalese crap. Of course reddit has the right to censor, and I have the right to bitch about it and fight against it, the "legality" of it all has nothing to do with the "ethics" and "trust" issues these actions raise!

       The legality of it has everything to do with it. You were posting on the legal advice sub Reddit. The purpose of that sub Reddit is not to give people a place to grind their political axes, rather it is to offer concrete legal advice to realistic problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the moderators shouldn't have joked about correct the record because apparently there are people who actually believe they care about thought on Reddit. But as a policy we are removing those posts because they don't generate interest in legal discussion, rather they devolve into political rants back-and-forth.

       Tell me about becoming a man. Because obviously we're all still kids whether we know it or not. And please don't mistake me for a naysayer, or cursemonger etc., but I feel that mods must stand for more than nothing. If their actions are indefensible, then it is well within logical reason for subscribers, nay contributors of the sub to be upset and demand at least some kind of dignified response. Let's make this sub great... For once.

       You can legally sue them but only because you can legally sue anyone. However, you won't win and the suit won't stick because of some legal jibberish that I don't know. If I was a lawyer I'd answer the question, but sadly I'm not. Either way, the entire thread was pointless cause the op just said the same stuff over and over, and the ones answering got mad and started being sarcastic and rude.

       They've removed all of them. I'd find the archive but I'm on mobile and don't know how. I remember reading through the thread when it was posted and it actually had legal answers as to why you can't sue. I wish I had saved them.

       Posts don't get removed but there's definitely some brigading happening here in regards to Trump. There's been a few shills in here trying to propagate the "Trump is with the conspiracy theorists" paradigm. I've also seen a fair share of "Conspiracy has a majority Trump supporter user base" posts receiving a lot of upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have forgotten that the Trump campaign most likely has a very successful online group pushing his propaganda. While everyone seems to be focusing on the CTR folks the Trump campaign has pretty much been forgotten about.

       Trump shills are here and they are out in full force.

       I literally didn't care either way. Reddit comments and karma are one of those things that I think are entertainment.  It's why I'm saying I'm shocked if someone would be upset based upon negative comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case in point I'm on a local subreddit. I remember someone complaining about thw mod not being responsive to their request for being a mod of the subreddit. I responded who cares. In the great scheme of things practically no one know Reddit much less this obscure subreddit. Relax. Worry about something important like wether you have food, housing etc.  The poor guy reacted similar to the fake post above. I honestly can believe there are people out there who really take serious shit i, you and others finger type on their phone while standing in line at Starbucks.

       This is an information platform that serves people all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not taking things seriously is why things are going to hell in a hand basket. The folks out there that just bury their heads in the sand and rely on their elected officials to run the country are a major part of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because the US "is the greatest democracy in the world" doesn't mean you shouldn't be doing your duty to regulate this democracy. People who disregard information that shows their leaders committing war crimes and violating international laws because "it makes them feel uncomfortable" are just as culpable as those who perpetrate those crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are the regulator and final oversight to your government. This is what democracy is established upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is a tool. You can either post memes all day and discuss Kim Kardashians latest plastic surgery or you can use it to disseminate or collect information that is critical to keeping your democracy alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       When all the media has been turned into a propaganda machine designed to polarize and divide the masses a tool that gives direct access to the populace of your democracy becomes very serious.

       Crazy idea here, just contemplate this for a second.

      <p>
       Some people agree with Clinton's policies and want her in office not because of some illuminati world is flat dipshit conspiracy, but because they agree with her policies and vision for the future and want to see this country to continue moving forward rather than regress.
But sorry if everyone who disagrees with you has to be some shill because why on earth would anyone ever vote for the most qualified candidate for the job.

       Clinton is all about regression, my friend. She's been a neocon her whole "adult" political career. The only thing she really stands for is more war, more coups, and more dead innocents in favor of lining her pockets with blood money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and she also likes to arm terrorists who then use those weapons to kill Americans and innocents.

       Neither party will win when all of this is over. Both will be removed from power and the people will take back the country. This will happen eventually.
      </p>

       There's only so long truth can be hidden from the populace before everyone realizes the extent to which their government and media have been lying to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Green Revolution was a great example of how this happens in reality. Laugh all you want but insurrection is already in the air. Dividing the people and polarizing them in between two parties is no longer working.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary or Trump can take the office for all I care. It's all ending with a political revolution at this point. Millions are sick and tired of their tax dollars going to bombing innocents in foreign lands. Morality will eventually prevail over tyranny.

       That section of the law that says you must post a disclaimer even when not advocating for a specific candidate references websites funded by the campaign. This is not relevant for Reddit. The next part that says you must post a disclaimer if you are paid to advocate a specific candidate on a public forum is relevant, but unless ctr shills actually say "vote Hilary 2016 !!" (Spoiler: they don't), then this section is also not relevant. Sorry to burst your conspiracy bubble.

       It's a valid question and shouldn't have been deleted, IMHO. I often wonder if rules like this are the reason that agrichemical promoters spamming and harassing people on Reddit are somewhat obvious (though they're NOT obvious to those who don't spar with them, so I think they could be pretty easily legally fucked should certain bored lawyers have the stomach for it).

       The Guidestones had a 3 blocks inserted into the bevel in the center stone. It was a date. That is the date. Couple this with US talking about nuclear war, the GM Mosquitos just pushed on us through fear tactics of Zika... The complete censorship of social media to stem information flows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tie this all together with the leaked emails showing US arming isis and really doing nothing but causing devastation and instability among our countrirs and others for god knows how many years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not forget the race war the media is trying to provoke, the "too big too fail" when the banks fucked us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish it weren't true but hot damn there is a ton of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then we look at the one mural, you see the guy in the biohazard suit? I take that as the Zika warning. The fireball of people going into the sky and compete chaos on the ground, nukes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combine all this together with the leaked email of Hillary stating she is going to sacrifice an animal to a god.

       I mean, you have to be extremely low IQ if you can't see through the veil.

       Sorry buddy, this is why you're going to have a very difficult life. I'm... negative? No, I'm realistic. I don't need to stroke people like you for having a delusion in your head. Your perspective, like that of most conspiracy theorists, is that dissent means obviously being in cahoots with the "devil".
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading through your history, you're living your life in a fever fantasy of shit and misinterpretation of what's all happening in front of you. You're not special though. It's sad how many people are actually like you... demographics of people who can flatout deny sensibility because they have control issues and can't see the world not playing out by whatever bizarre scenario/narrative they have in their very special, super smart brains.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, maybe I don't have a favorable outlook about a redditor thinking they could sue Clinton, rattling off a spooky label like "neocon" or "status quo" like it's an argument, or being told Clinton "wants wars and coups and blood and money". Fuck the lot of you, seriously. Why you circlejerk around so much shit that never happens or comes true? What compels people like you to get off to that?
