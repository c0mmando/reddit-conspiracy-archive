       When it comes to showing absolute proof that 9/11 was a staged, psychological operation conducted on the American people by its government, this has become the ace up my sleeve. People who swear I'm a crazy conspiracy nut watch this, and their jaws drop. Most of them, if they recover healthily from the heavy psychological blow, become researchers themselves--not just into 9/11, but into our government's entire history of secret dealings. They become awakened. They understand that if one 9/11 event was staged, it was all staged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of you might already know about this, and to those who do, kudos for doing your research. But for those of you who don't, let me start with a few key details.
      </p>
      <p>
       This deals with the alleged plane flying in low &amp; level, and crashing into the Pentagon in Arlington, VA on the morning of September 11, 2001. On that morning, there were a number of key "eye-witnesses" who gave first-hand testimony to the media in order to help sell the event to the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       On that day, perhaps the most widely-covered eye-witness account on mainstream networks was that of Lloyd England, a DC cab driver who happened to be driving by the Pentagon at the time of the event. He told the reporters that as he was driving by, a large airplane soared overhead and, flying at almost ground level, began clipping the 240lb street light poles that cover the Pentagon grounds. The first of these, according to Lloyd, crashed violently into his cab's windshield, and the car came to an abrupt stop with the light pole hanging out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully, Lloyd was unharmed, but as he stated in his many interviews with the media that morning, if someone were to have been riding in the cab with him, they certainly would have been killed. Lloyd says that soon after the incident, a "white van" came along and a "silent stranger" helped him pull the pole out, and lay it on the ground. Here is the famous photo of the cab and light pole with the Pentagon burning in the background.
       <a href="https://truthandshadows.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/lloyde-england-and-long-pole1.jpg">
        https://truthandshadows.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/lloyde-england-and-long-pole1.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A group of researchers took interest in Lloyd's story in the mid-2000s. They interviewed him countless times, and his story seemed to have some details that just didn't add up. So they dug deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you care to watch the long version of the Citizen Investigation Team's look into Lloyd, you can find it here:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC3LRdjocmc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC3LRdjocmc
       </a>
       Watching Lloyd's behavior when confronted with image evidence after he changes his story is highly disturbing, and without a doubt points to him as being part of the cover-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you who want to see the bombshell evidence moment:
      </p>
      <p>
       When the interviewer's camera was turned on, Lloyd stuck to his story 100%. Even when shown evidence proving inconsistencies in his story, he remains stubbornly adamant that he's telling the truth. However, Lloyd is older, and not very tech-savvy. When he does not realize he is being recorded, he admits that "It was planned".
      </p>
      <p>
       Lloyd and the interviewers are riding in the car near the scene of the crime, and Lloyd, unaware that he is being recorded, says "Do you know what history is? It's not the truth--it's 'his-story'. I'm not supposed to be involved in this. This is a big thing. This is a world thing. I'm not supposed to have nothing to do with this. This is for people who have money and this sort of thing. That's not me. I'm a small man. I ain't got nothing."
      </p>
      <p>
       Interviewer: So you're saying the people with the money, this is their event
      </p>
      <p>
       Lloyd: This is their thing
      </p>
      <p>
       Interviewer: So they used you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lloyd: I'm in it
      </p>
      <p>
       Interviewer: But that must mean that they planned this..
      </p>
      <p>
       Lloyd: It was planned
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, you probably want to see for yourself. No problem.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km9SwgpvSPo">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km9SwgpvSPo
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I would encourage all of you to watch the long version as well. Even if you don't believe that Lloyd's statements he makes in the short version are enough to prove that he's part of the cover-up, his statements and behavior in the long version leave you with no doubt. The reason CIT investigated the Pentagon event so much was that the government narrative and all the key "eye-witnesses" don't match, eg. they all SWEAR they saw the plane coming from a certain direction, while the light pole damage says otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is nothing our community doesn't already know about. We know people are trained in how to give false testimony using details and emotion to help stage false flag events. However, when someone who is not awake sees this video, you can almost watch the color drain from their face. It's not a fun thing to watch, but it's necessary. We have to wake people up if we are ever going to affect any sort of restoration.

       To me, that video looks nothing more than a struggling hard worker saying this shit is out of his pay grade.
      </p>
      <p>
       He went from cab driver going from fare to fare to on tv, interviews and being the centre of attention. All I can see is he wants nothing to do with it and that he might be religious or something

       Yes. I watched this video thinking it was going to be some incredible proof because of the way OP built it up so much. But all I saw was a guy saying stuff that could be interpreted in more than one way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem here is that there are now people trying to make jobs for themselves by creating 9/11 conspiracy videos.
       <strong>
        Remember that the driver himself is being interviewed 15 years after 9/11 took place
       </strong>
       . That means he's had 15 years of exposure to false flag theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       He probably believes it was an inside job and rightly so. But if you keep this in mind, it puts his comments in a whole different light. On camera, he sticks to "the narrative" while off-camera his admits he's skeptical. Doesn't add up to a covert confession of active involvement though... not by a long shot.

       The long video shows him repeatedly examining and acknowledging multiple images of his damaged vehicle on the unmistakably south side of the bridge where the official story said the plane went over, and he keeps saying that it was all really on the north side.
      </p>
      <p>
       For something like 20 minutes, both in his house and circling three times around the relevant roads, he goes mid-sentence back and forth between "accepting" and contradicting the pictorial proof of him being on the south side of the bridge, as if this proof were in some way incomplete or potentially misleading, when your own screen view of the pictures (as he views and talks about them) is patently and absolutely conclusive (and this is not remotely an overstatement).
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me he would like to say outright that its all bullshit, but knows that's too dangerous, and prefers to illustrate it instead by making the absurdity glaring in an endlessly repeating loop of contradiction, beyond ad-nauseum.

       Incorrect. The driver is not being interviewed "15 years after 9/11 took place". CIT interviewed him in 2006, but that's irrelevant. The important thing is that his story in and of itself proves that the "light pole" scene was staged and that he was placed there to help sell the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would recommend you watch the long video I posted about Lloyd so that you can see the way he reacts when they present him with evidence that refutes his placement on that morning.

       Yep, it makes no sense. If the guy was going to out it to people why not do it on cam knowing people will spread what youre saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said what he said on cam then went on to basically say some crazy shit happened that had nothing to do with him and he will let the rich people do what they do aka news presents and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
       As previously stated I think there is some fishy shit in relation to this but a cab driver is not irrefutable evidence either way.

       Did you get any feeling the cam crew people were kind of sketchy? It's like they were making comments on-camera knowing that later they could edit to make it look like something more sinister.

       It doesn't matter what the interviewers said or didn't say on camera. If you focus on the reaction of Lloyd when presented with hard evidence after he changes his story, it proves deception. The video conclusively proves that the "light pole" flight path, was staged, and therefore Lloyd had to have been placed there with a story to tell the media in order to help sell the event. That's the bottom line. If you don't see that, I would encourage you to watch it again.

       No, simply that we're so bitter in my area that something like free dessert would put us in a sour mood because we'd still bitch about it not being the right temperature or having too little sugar. Dancing would never happen. I had culture shock, I guess.

       5 Israelis working illegally for a moving company heard about the first plane, drove to a good lookout location and took selfies with the towers burning in the background. They got arrested. FBI concluded they had no knowledge of the attack prior to it happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above is what you can find in the FBI documents (which are fairly long). There is a 30k word article on the internet that says many other things with no evidence whatsoever. I got sucked into this hole once and I'm still angry at myself for caring enough to read the FBI reports and then argue with people who haven't about what they say.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When the men were transferred to jail, the case was transferred out of the FBI's Criminal Division, and into the bureau's
        <strong>
         Foreign Counterintelligence Section
        </strong>
        , which is responsible for espionage cases, ABCNEWS has learned.
       </p>
       <p>
        One reason for the shift, sources told ABCNEWS, was that the FBI believed Urban Moving may have been providing cover for an
        <strong>
         Israeli intelligence operation
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        After the five men were arrested, the FBI got a warrant and searched Urban Moving's Weehawken, N.J., offices.
       </p>
       <p>
        The FBI searched Urban Moving's offices for several hours, removing boxes of documents and a dozen computer hard drives. The FBI also questioned Urban Moving's owner. His attorney insists that his client answered all of the FBI's questions. But
        <strong>
         when FBI agents tried to interview him again a few days later, he was gone
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In his own words:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to ABCNEWS sources, Israeli and U.S. government officials worked out a deal — and after 71 days, the five Israelis were taken out of jail, put on a plane, and deported back home.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the former detainees refused to answer ABCNEWS' questions about their detention and what they were doing on Sept. 11, several of the detainees discussed their experience in America on an Israeli talk show after their return home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Said one of the men, denying that they were laughing or happy on the morning of Sept. 11, "The fact of the matter is we are coming from a country that experiences terror daily.
        <strong>
         Our purpose was to document the event
        </strong>
        ."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The fact that our government didn't pursue a legal case against these Israeli agents has nothing to do with the fact that the evidence is extremely damning.

       Wooooo, bold text, scary. However, literally nothing in the story aligns with them having prior knowledge of the attack, including the FBI writing that nothing indicates that they had prior knowledge of the attack.

       Why would someone who owned a half-legitimate business that admittedly employed illegals, whose computers are in the FBI's hands and whose employees are in jail would want to flee the country? Let's ignore the obvious explanation and make up far-fetched ones!

       Let's just ignore the fact that they were held by counterintelligence for 10 weeks, confirmed to be Israeli agents, and failed lie-detector tests about the incident:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For the FBI, deciphering the truth from the five Israelis proved to be difficult. One of them, Paul Kurzberg, refused to take a lie-detector test for 10 weeks — then failed it, according to his lawyer. Another of his lawyers told us Kurzberg had been reluctant to take the test because he had once worked for Israeli intelligence in another country.

       Look at the size of that pole. If that pole was made out of pine wood, it would already be heavy, but it's made out of metal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now think about the effort it would take to extract that pole from the car. How is it that the car has no scratches on the hood (bonnet), after two guys pulled it out through the car's windshield? They would have had to have held it aloft the
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       time that it took to extract it,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       swing it away from the vehicle and onto the lawn, without scratching the hood. Impossible, unless the mysterious "silent" man in the white van was Superman.

       You got it. If you haven't, watch the longer video about Lloyd England I posted as well. Watching the way Lloyd reacts when he is confronted with image and video evidence that contradicts his (the government's) version of the story is deeply disturbing.

       Simply describing him as a silent man, makes it sound like he had a run-in with the CIA. From that knowledge, you can assume everything he tells you is shaped by what the CIA leveraged him with during that meeting. If a "silent man" came and visited me, I'd be telling pretty fables too. :P

       Thanks for this.  You received a lot of attention for something I have tried to bring to light for a while.  Most times the post doesn't get more than a few votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, this is great.  The story of Lloyd England and his participation in the bullshit is an amazing one to say the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, and most importantly regarding the other portion of CIT's work, no plane impacted that building.  All witness testimony to the event at the Pentagon confirms the plane being seen on what's called the "
       <strong>
        North of Citgo
       </strong>
       " flight path.  The "
       <strong>
        South of Citgo
       </strong>
       " flight path and damage path could not have happened and must have been arranged for in order to support the South of Citgo story. (Light poles being downed before the event, mobile generator nearby that was impacted "left" in flight path).
      </p>
      <p>
       Below are some of the witnesses to the plane as it flew by or at their position.  These are the important one's, in my view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sean Boger who was the Heliport control tower operator at the time, confirmed he had the plane heading directly at him with the plane to the right of the Citgo gas station.  Sgt. Bill Lagasse and Sgt. Chadwick Brooks were at Citgo and testify the plane was north of them, further solidifying the witness view the plane was not in a position to create the "South" side damage path.  North of the Citgo in the Cemetery, Darrell Stafford, Darius Prather, William Middleton with George Aman confirm all seeing the plane fly by just south of their position.  Edward Paik is also very important as he was furthest away and he had it come over his head.  The further the contested "south" path is away from the witnessed "north" path, the less you can argue it could be witness mistaking the planes actual position.  It could not have flown on a "south" path because Edward Paik is no where near a "southern" flight path as proposed by the Gov't.  See the full video to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did I type all of that?  Those testimonies and views essentially triangulate the exact position of the plane that day.  Sean Boger  had it fly at him, the police Lagasse and Brookes were south of it and the cemetery workers were north of it.  The plane flew in between all those witnesses but it managed to do a totally different damage path supposedly on the south side!!  AMAZING!!  It was a decoy plane that got it wrong.  They screwed up and this is another good chance to bring this to light and show 9/11 for what it really is.  The plane couldn't or didn't fly on the south side so now they had to cover it up.  That's why you heard of the the global hawk or the missile, even the C-130 as distractions to muddy the waters of information.  It was all more BS for people to lap up.

       Furthermore, you can clearly see streetlights that are closer to where the plane's cabin would be and thus more in the range of being demolished by the wings than this streetlight, which seems to be placed much wider spatially.

        did

       hit that building, they would have released the high-resolution video of the event from any of the probably 20 cameras that would have caught it. Buuuuut, nothing.

       I'm not sure what you mean?

      <p>
       The American Airlines flight ramming into the Pentagon at over 500mph, after rapidly descending into a perfect 360-degree corkscrew, fooling some air-traffic controllers into thinking it was a military fighter jet, coming perfectly level with the ground being hand-flown by a Saudi who could not even successfully pilot a tiny single-engine plane is integral to the government's version of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your question "What would that mean if it was a missile?" - It would mean that the government lied about what really happened that day, essentially proving that it was a false flag event carried out by elements within. A lot of people, even ones who realize that no plane hit the Pentagon ask "Well that hijacked American Airlines jet HAD to go somewhere--where did it go?" That's a great question. There are a lot of theories, some pretty disturbing. Some pretty out there. But I'll tell you where it didn't go, and that's into the Pentagon.

       That is a very popular theory. I don't think we will ever know what happened to the planes. I say "planes" because I do believe that a swap occurred as the planes were over Andrews. The planes that hit the WTC towers were exceeding their max airspeed envelopes by such a wide margin that they should have ripped apart in the thick air at 1,000 feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've read Operation Northwoods, you know that swapping an aircraft filled with people with a remotely piloted aircraft in a way that deceives radar was possible even in the 60's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Planes can travel very fast at 30,000 feet because the air is very thin, but any commercial pilot will tell you that a normal commercial jet could not achieve the speeds at 1,000 feet that the New York planes achieved due to the thickness of the air. It is physically impossible unless the planes were modified to have a much higher flight envelope threshold.

       The Pentagon was hit directly in the newly-renovated budget analyst office, where Pentagon staffers and accountants were trying to figure out where $2.3 TRILLION went that could not be accounted for (and whatever else they wanted destroyed that we don't know about). This was announced by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld a day prior to 9/11.
      </p>

       The entire budget analyst office chain of command was killed in the explosion.

       The media made it sound like it was unoccupied, citing the construction/renovation. Truth is, the renovation was all but complete. Amec, the contractor in charge, was scheduled to start wrapping things up that week. The budget analyst office was fully functional and staffed.

       I think this could possibly be you answering your own question. Yes, the evidence points to the light pole path being a staged path, as it contradicts eye-witness accounts of where the plane was seen. This points to a possible timed fly-over of the Pentagon by a plane that was seen not approaching from the path that would have caused the downed light poles.

       My friend, if asked in good faith, there are no dumb questions. I was only 13 years old when 9/11 happened, and it affected me personally, as we lost a family member in the North Tower that day. Since then, I've had a lot of questions.

       Anything is possible, of course. In this particular case though, if you watch the long version I posted and watch how he reacts to evidence that contradicts his placement that day, it shows deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he's trying to get media attention/fame, he has done an outstandingly lousy job. His story is all but forgotten/unknown except in small segments of research circles.

       He could have easily written a best-selling book if he wanted, but he didn't pursue that path to making money/garnering fame as a result of his placement on that day.

       That PROVED nothing. The guy was talking about how this was bigger than himself, not how he was involved. "Yeah, it was planned." Did he mean that or did he mean the terrorist planned it.

       He's saying that he's involved, and doesn't want to be. He's very clearly saying that it was planned by our government. I've never heard one person refute such strong evidence--yet you show up immediately to refute it. Not enough time has even passed since I've posted this for you to watch the longer version that further proves it. But here you are, automatically saying it proves nothing.

       Watching the video of him denying where his car was when it was hit by the light pole was weird. Chalk it up to him being an old man confused about a traumatic event. But then the lack of damage on the hood or quarter panels of the car is just plain disturbing.

       He could mean "it was planned" as in the hijackers planned it. Even if he does think it was planned by the government, so what? He admits that he himself is an avid conspiracy theorist. He never actually says the light pole incident was staged. These disinfo nuts are clearly leading him into wording things in a certain way and then taking it out of context.

       Valid point. He doesn't admit to being an "avid conspiracy theorist" though. He can't even remember Princess Diana's name.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says he had been attending a class every week where he was being taught about conspiracy, or "hush hush stuff", as he puts it. If you ask me, that's actually pretty revealing. Suppose this "class" wasn't a standard book of the month club. Suppose the members of this "class" were being introduced to Icke's work and taught about conspiracy for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know the government has trained citizens through black operations on how to sell stories to the masses and then used them. I honestly believe that this "class" he attended was much more than a weekly book club.

       Dude give me a break. The reason I've spent so much time on 9/11 research is because I lost a family member in the North Tower that day. And I hate it. So I've devoted my life to waking people up in hopes that maybe one day, enough people will be angry enough to do something about this. Probably won't even happen in my lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "mountain of evidence" isn't going anywhere. It's small things like this that can easily be wiped off the net. That's why it's important to cover them. As for "turning rational-minded individuals away from the truth", that is precisely the opposite of what I'm doing. Did you watch the longer version where they present Lloyd with photo and video evidence after he's had to change his story? Did you see his reaction? It's very disturbing to me, and would be to any "rational-minded individual".
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that there was a cover up. And there were people involved in that cover up, from the highest levels of government all the way down to civilians. People like Lloyd. A rational-minded individual cannot watch that whole video and walk away not thinking he was involved in the covering up of that event.

       I'm really sorry about what happened to your family, and I don't want to shit on your grief, but it doesn't change what this video is. It's a B grade effort to trick a simple person into creating soundbites that can be edited together out of context. The efforts of groups within the truth movement for 9/11 is pretty commendable, but this is just a cheap gimmick.

       I understand that the short version does not have you convinced. Believe me, you have made that abundantly clear. If you watch the long version again and don't see the clear evidence of deception, I don't know what to say to you--we'll just have to agree to disagree.

       Exactly. Look at the post history. I was respectfully pointing out that not enough time had passed for him to view the post in its entirety before refuting it. He then thanked me for being respectful, and admitted that he did not watch the full version.

       I admit that I only watched the short clip. You stated it was proof. Nothing was "CLEARLY stated" by him, only you. Like I said, the Pentagon story disturbs me greatly but this was not anything more than grasping for evidence in something you already believe. Listen to the interviewer voice. He was clearly excited. He led Mr. London

       The two videos combined, to me, are the closest thing to proof. Everyone has their own perspective, though, and I respect that. I was just sharing because it's my favorite bit of evidence.

       Him saying these things is really negligible and prove nothing, you're correct. But what really hits me in the face when he says that the pictures don't represent "reality" - he swears he
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       where the pictures show him to be because that contradicts the whole story.

       I'm not saying that the short version of what he said is the "proof". The thing that "hits you in the face"--that's the proof, or as far as we're probably going to get to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I encouraged everyone to watch the full-length version as you did. A person in his/her right mind cannot hear what Lloyd says in that car, combined with his behavior and statements about the pictures, and walk away still believing that he is not involved in the cover-up.
