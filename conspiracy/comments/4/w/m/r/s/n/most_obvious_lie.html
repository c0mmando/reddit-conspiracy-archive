    <div class="md"><p>The most dangerous myth of all, is the idea that taxes fund government spending.</p>

<p>We are literally living in a post-scarcity economy, the shops are filled with food, robots do most of the heavy lifting and we have enough building materials to house everyone.</p>

<p>But why are we so miserable and zombie like?</p>

<p>Ignoring more obvious conclusions like poisoned food, internet addiction and lack of physical exercise, there is a huge economic burden that has been placed on our shoulders which for the most part goes unnoticed.</p>

<h1>TAXES</h1>

<p>What is money? Well, the next time you watch a basketball game and you see the points go up every time a team scores, think of money. </p>

<p>Just as the numbers on the scoreboard can be changed at will by the stadium managers, the numbers on our deposit accounts can be changed at will by the currency issuer, allowing for all legal/accounting procedures of course.</p>

<p>When the government spends, the money supply increases, when the government collects tax, the money supply <a href="http://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/powerpoints/7DIF.pdf">decreases.</a>
(page 14)</p>

<p>So what are the implications of all this?</p>

<p>Well we are being taxed to death. Not only do we pay income tax, but we pay taxes in more hidden/covert ways. </p>

<p>Interest payments, corporation tax and toll fees are all examples of secret taxes, and remember, even if you personally don&#39;t pay any tax, you still suffer from the <strong>loss of economic activity caused by taxation.</strong></p>

<p>Taxes do NOT fund spending and they are only imposed on us to impoverish humanity.</p>

<p>The only taxes a country needs are taxes on exporters, as this allows the central bank to acquire foreign currency.</p>

<p>But domestic taxation is absolutely without justification...</p>

<p>So you&#39;re now not talking about boycotting Israel? Sorry, I&#39;m having a hard time following, you&#39;re not making much sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then maybe read the original post to which you failed to reply.</p>

<p>Which post? Your post which I replied to? You&#39;re not making very much sense here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure thing. Whatever you want to think we’ll believe.</p>

<p>Okay, so can you answer my question?</p>

<p>Oy vey, they did nothing wrong! They were just a scapegoat!</p>

<p>…No, ignore those child prostitutes in Weimar Germany! Ignore that the nightclubs and resorts out of which they operated were owned by jews! The leaders of the German Revolution of 1918, which tried to overthrow the government and install communism? Their… nationality? Well, that’s… you know, they were… I mean, it’s not… YOU’RE AN ANTISEMITE!</p>

WHILE THERE IS PROOF that the jews acting as Bolshevik Leaders in Russia at the same time MURDERED 50,000,000 Christians.. Where is the Christian Holiday honoring their dead? Where is the constant victim status among Christians? Nope, doesn&#39;t fit the Khazar narrative, so move along Pleb.  </p>
