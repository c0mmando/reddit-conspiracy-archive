<p>&quot;In 1987 Donald Trump purchased his first casino interests when he acquired 93% of the shares in Resorts International.  Resorts International has a sordid history which began in the early 1950’s when it evolved from a <strong>CIA and Mossad</strong> front company which had been established for the purpose of money laundering the profits from drug trafficking, gambling, and other illegal activities. On October 30, 1978, The Spotlight newspaper reported that the principle investors of Resorts International were Meyer Lansky, Tibor Rosenbaum, William Mellon Hitchcock, <strong>David Rockefeller</strong>, and one <strong>Baron Edmond de Rothschild</strong>.&quot;  </p>

<p>“In 1987, upon the death of longtime CIA front man James Crosby, the nominal head of Resorts International, up-and-coming young New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump stepped into the picture and bought Crosby’s interest in the gambling empire.”  </p>

<p>“Trump soon became a household name, with his colorful personality and his insistence upon naming a variety of luxury hotels, apartment houses and other commercial ventures after himself. But while the name “Trump” appeared in the headlines, the names of the real movers behind Resorts International remained hidden from public view.”<br/>
<a href="https://americanfreepress.net/who-towers-behind-trump/">Source</a>  </p>

<p>&quot;After quickly expanding the reach of Resorts International to Atlantic City in the final years of the 1980’s, Donald Trump found himself in financial trouble as the real estate market in New York tanked. The three casinos in Atlantic City, like other Trump assets, were under threat from lenders.  It was only with the assistance and assurance of Wilbur L. Ross Jr., senior managing director of Rothschild Inc. that Trump was allowed to keep the casinos and rebuild his threatened empire.&quot;<br/>
<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1992-03-22/the-donalds-trump-card">Source</a>  </p>

<p>The same Wilbur L. Ross came out in support of Trumps nomination in <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-09/billionaire-wilbur-ross-would-support-trump-if-he-s-nominated">March 2016 as reported by Bloomberg.</a>  </p>

<p>Jacob Rothschild son - Nat Rothschild, also dated Ivanka Trump.  </p>

<p>I have no doubt both candidates are controlled by the powers that be. I mean you have Hilary sacrificing chickens and getting prepared to pay her penance to the Rothschilds. Meanwhile, The Donald appears to have been bought long ago. Either way, American citizens have a tough choice to make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about cultural assimilation and certain immigrants having a lot more kids then native populations which puts a huge burden on our education system which gives us the low ranking system we have now globally.</p>

<p>Also should these immigrants be able to send money back to the native country because that means they are not investing in their new home nation. </p>

<p>What affect does immigration have on developing nations? are we stealing their brightest and best chances to develop and modernize their countries? Like if we take in doctors from India are we robbing India of its opportunity to be the medical leaders of the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No need to get so upset.  Often times it is the release of anger which indicates an ignorance on the subject.  Illegal immigrants do not care about our constitution.  Do you really think immigrants care about our laws and our founders or just about getting what&#39;s theirs  I&#39;ve never said people don&#39;t want better lives.  There are ways to do that other than voting for the government to get bigger and control us more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say illegals do this and that. Have you interviewed any? Because most likely if they came illegally, they were raped financially by the immigration system. I&#39;m not giving them a pass for coming in illegally but they aren&#39;t a boogeyman. They&#39;re human. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve known illegal immigrants beyond interviewing them.  I worked with many when I was a teenager and they were very nice people.  That&#39;s not the point.

    <div class="md"><p>And the elites care nothing about the everyday man. Why worry about them? They fucked everyone of us back in 2008 with the bail out that destroyed us, the American people. </p>

<p>It&#39;s beyond race man, it&#39;s class warfare. Race shit is  carrot on a stick given to you by the same elites. Stay petty, fight the small fight or get privy and fight the ones who want to keep you a slave. </p>

<p>Lemme say this, if slavery hasn&#39;t taught people anything it&#39;s the idea of the house boy. House boys stayed in with Master while the others worked the fields. The house boy don&#39;t realize that he&#39;s being used to cause envy, hatred and anger between the other slaves. The house boy may know and don&#39;t care. Either way the house boy is a pawn. </p>

<p>Now equate that to everyday people. Black, White, Hispanic, Asian. It doesn&#39;t matter because we are slaves to the elite. Stop being their pawn man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>minus the criminals who run drugs back and fourth. do you see immigration as a solution to the problems these people are running from? How many immigrants can america take in IYO? Should we be more focused on stabilizing and developing the countries these people come from? </p>

<p>I have seen some Ted talks that suggest its selfish to have a immigration system that takes in the more educated and wealthy immigrants from developing countries. that it is also impossible to take people who just want to walk here in. That the worlds woes are to great for america to just take in mass. </p>

<p>So how do you see your role in helping these people? Do you blame western imperialism for the state of affairs they suffer from? Do you see immigration as an atonement? </p>

These are the most powerful and smartest people who have been in control of the world for centuries... What if this was their plan all along? To have both candidates operate under their interests whilst systematically pitting the entire nation against each other? If they don&#39;t at least TRY to assassinate Trump, I think that&#39;s a big red flag that we are in big trouble. </p>

We also know that both the Clinton and Trump families are friendly with members of the Rothschild family and both are indebted to them in different ways. So, the idea of them being used as pawns to pit the American people against each other isn&#39;t that much a stretch of the imagination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just watched the Libertarian &quot;Town Hall&quot; on CNN last night.  They&#39;re hardly even libertarians.  More like soft spoken centrists.  They say things like &quot;Libertarian or not, the government needs to do something&quot;.  Well, that&#39;s sort of the idea of Libertarianism... small gov&#39;t.  I understand if you don&#39;t agree.  But you&#39;re not a libertarian.</p>

<p>Saw a little of some Libertarian convention on CSPAN a few weeks ago.  The big &quot;speaker&quot; they had, was basically saying that it is pointless and stupid to try to stand up for libertarian values, because it&#39;s a stupid ideology, and if you want change, you have to compromise(I.E. let there be big gov&#39;t).  The crowd(which traveled to come hear people talk about HOW they were going to get LIBERTARIAN ideas out there), basically just heard, &quot;Give up already&quot;.  It&#39;s obvious they are suppressing the Libertarian movement, after Ron Paul stoked the flames a bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention, trump said he saw &quot;thousands&quot; of Muslims in NJ cheering after 9/11.  This was obviously a cover for the Israeli spies who got caught cheering after 9/11.</p>

<p>Trump also famously attacked a judge for his &quot;mexican heritage&quot;.  Once again, this is cover for Israel.  4/8 US Supreme Court Justices are Jewish.  Obama was trying to nominate Jew #5(Majority Jew control in Supreme Court).  Trump &quot;taught&quot; us that attacking a judge based on his/her ethnicity/heritage is wrong.  Even if a 1.4% minority(Jews) gain a 55% majority in the supreme court.  Trump taught us that like with the Mexican Judge, you cannot use a person&#39;s ethnicity/religion/heritage against them(or you&#39;ll get the beat down, like trump did).</p>

<p>Trump doesn&#39;t make much sense in what he says, much of the time.  Unless you realize he&#39;s here to teach us lessons, and not to win.</p>

<p>Trump is a fall guy, to get Hilary elected.  Along the way, he&#39;s conditioning the American public, and making the south, as well as old ideas seem like the &quot;wrong&quot; side to many people(especially young people).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>many bias replies, left or right, to this post. But what I did not see is anyone actually providing substance and proof of what has happened since. Yes, it appears Trump created a relationship with the Rothschilds years ago. However, he apparently paid off a significant debt and his ties to them were officially severed. You can find info on it by simply Googling &quot;Trump Rothschilds&quot;, the one I read was on harddawn dot com. I won&#39;t give the exact link as I don&#39;t want to get my comment banned. But do some research people. Trump clearly made friends and got involved with the elite over the years but its apparent that he has grown distasteful of them and wants to ruin their globalist agenda. I am not a Trump nor Clinton fan. I am looking at this picture at the elite level, they are the main source of the problem.</p>
