      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is the conventional
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        wisdom,
        <strong>
         which 100% ignores the existence of omnipresent surveillance programs that already captured every "lost" Clinton e-mail, as well as captured unknown amounts of blackmail material on Hillary and Bill
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        As others (very few) have noted on this subreddit, the FBI "investigation" is a high-level game of cat &amp; mouse that dates back to events in the 1990s between the FBI and Bill Clinton.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am interested in fact-finding, not interested in a highly subjective and high-temperature interpretation of the ongoing FBI "investigation" of the Clintons.
       </p>
       <p>
        Louis Freeh put about a dozen knives into Bill Clinton's back throughout the 1990s, and the entire FBI-Clinton relationship smacked of an intelligence operation against Bill Clinton of a long-game nature since PATCON.  The FBI and the Clintons are enemies.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a long and very complicated narrative involving the true nature of the Clintons and the true nature of the intelligence communities that pre-dates Mena.
       </p>
       <p>
        That narrative is as not simplistic as
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        would like.
       </p>
       <p>
        The simplistic analysis -- by all of
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        -- of who Comey is &amp; what "his" game is, as well as who the Clintons are, conveniently ignores all contradictions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Who's blackmailing whom? Put all the options on the table, including "both/and".
       </p>
       <p>
        Why aren't (we) interested in
        <strong>
         what Binney said about the totality of NSA surveillance?
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Clintons may indeed belong in prison. Are (we) interested in letting Hillary be Nixon, the fall guy for a global crime ring?  How about letting Hillary be the patsy for foreknowledge of 9/11 and letting the Bush/Cheney team get away scot-free, to carry the Hillary/Nixon analogy further?  Or are we interested in prosecuting the actual kingpin?
       </p>
       <p>
        Why did Comey give Hillary the July 5 reprieve?  Lynching Comey gives us no answers.  Bestowing victimhood upon Comey gives us no answers.  If we're serious about conspiracy research, then why the heated leaping to conclusions?
       </p>
       <p>
        Speculate, don't accuse: Is Comey blackmailed?
        <strong>
         Or is there no need, because for Comey to reveal that he already has the "lost" Clinton e-mails would spotlight illegal and perpetual FBI/NSA/CIA/DIA surveillance of all of Congress &amp; the Executive Branch?
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Did Comey have zero choice except to recommend no Hillary indictment due to his own crimes? Is Hillary smart enough to understand this?
        <em>
         She wasn't smart enough to understand that she's under surveillance.
        </em>
        So what did Hillary do in the meeting with Comey?  Try to blackmail him?  There are a lot of variables and factors in play.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why is there an attempt on the part of
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        to become a partisan lynch mob?  Why so willing to forget 9/11-Anthrax crimes that Comey is helping to cover-up?
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Comey already has the Clinton secrets, illegally.
        </strong>
        So what else can he do with those secrets?
       </p>
       <p>
        Do those secrets implicate others on his own team, not just the Clintons? Is it just a Mexican Standoff? Is it a chess move?
        <strong>
         Or is Comey/the FBI/the Bush Mafia just as implicated by the "lost" e-mails and must keep them secret?
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Is there a larger plan for the "lost" e-mails down the road?
        </strong>
        What is the evidence for a longer-game Republican plan for Hillary?
       </p>
       <p>
        When you put all the options on the table, speculation reveals many possible directions, instead of just "Hillary is a cunt." Which makes conspiracy theorists look like dumbasses. I get it, (we) hate the Clintons.  Now, how about moving beyond the first closet full of Clinton skeletons, and opening the rest of the doors in the house, like a real investigator?
       </p>
       <p>
        Why did Clinton stop UNOCAL from building the Afghanistan pipeline? What was the real goal of the Bosnia intervention? What was the real goal of Iran-Contra? If Bosnia was all about drug-trafficking as some conspiracy theories allege, then

        We should all be asking questions about the plotlines that don't add up.  Why did Republicans (overwhelmingly) confirm a Secretary of State who had already lied about being under "sniper fire" in Bosnia?  Why haven't Republicans who are "against" Trump nuked him with Epstein?  Was Epstein an intelligence operation against both Trump and Clinton?  How could it be against only one of them?  If Trump is a Clinton mole, was Epstein intended to divide their trust in each other as a wedge?
        <strong>
         If we believe in the reality of Stellar Wind &amp; Prism &amp; all of the total-surveillance/wiretapping programs, then Epstein was known about long before he was "investigated."
        </strong>
        Both Trump/Clinton should have known that.  Did they?  Both the Trump/Clinton associations with Epstein happened within the era of Bush NSA surveillance programs, so are they both stupid?  Or did they already know?  How many options are here, to be listed, for who could have originated Operation Epstein?  Who would/could launch Operation Epstein, and why?  Pentagon, Mossad (Lewinsky was almost certainly Mossad),
        <em>
         [or privatized intelligence firms?]
        </em>
        or what about Trump or Clinton themselves?  What are Epstein's foreign connections?  The Franklin Scandal/Fiona Barnett milieu is military in nature, not civilian.  Epstein is not, apparently?  Does Epstein have military connections?  Has he visited military bases?  If not, does it look more like an intelligence operation?  Putting all the options on the table raises questions.  Although perhaps not remarkably, the media won't touch the Epstein story (yet), but it's such a potent loose nuke for whomever uses it first, why hasn't it been used?  Even by a third party?

       The surveillance state enables powerful groups within the intelligence community to blackmail key figures like Trump and the Clintons.  You understand this key point.  And I am glad you mentioned Epstein and the Franklin scandal.  I don't have any answers, but you asked a lot of good questions.

       that's not what the NSA guy said.

       the NSA guy said that the NSA has hillary's emails -- NOT because the NSA was "omnipresent" -- that's an assumption on your part.

      <p>
       frankly, it's much more likely that the NSA was targeting the Sec State, as the NSA targets all political leaders.  they are not targeting pepe jurarez rodriguez's laptop in jalisco, mexico.  (sorry, pepe, you are just not that important) ;)
