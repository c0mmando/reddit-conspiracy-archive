        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hillary will get elected. She rigged the DNC, she&#39;s going to rig the whole election. They gave it to Obama in 2008, now it&#39;s her turn. </p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said from the beginning, Trump is there to scare people in to voting for Hillary. He&#39;s a scapegoat bad guy, but he attracts lots of people through racism and xenophobia, which ties in to how scared people are about the economy and their desire to fix it. Trump will keep getting crazier, and the media will make him look like an insane person to ensure Hillary wins. But it will be a squeaker, of course 51%/49%, to give the illusion that people <em>almost had it</em>. They just need to try a little harder next time and their voices will be heard. This is a lie. Both options are rigged, they both lead to the same place, that is control by the military-industrial complex and the biggest international banks. Same as we had under Obama, same as we had under Bush. Same as we&#39;ve had since probably every president after JFK.</p>

<p>They run the show. It&#39;s a big club, and we&#39;re not in it. We are not in the club. </p>

<p>They are trying to engineer a very profitable war. It is very profitable to blow up billions of dollars of equipment, because then you have to build it all again, but it seems like for a purpose, so money keeps getting borrowed from the banks and put in to the pipelines of the manufacturing of arms, missiles, planes, tanks, etc. </p>

<p>People don&#39;t like wars, you have to convince them a war is necessary. In this bad economy, it doesn&#39;t take much. People are looking for scapegoats to explain why they can&#39;t make it. War makes economies prosper. </p>

<p>But this economy does have one prominent metric that appears to be prospering, the stock market. So if that were to go away, then everyone would pretty much be ready for a war to stimulate the economy. (As happened in/after WW2 and other wars, as the US grows its empire and takes over more land and governments and banks and so on.)</p>

<p>The previous stock crash, just under 8 years ago, happened right after Obama started. So some people blamed it on Obama, some blamed it on Bush. This diffuses the blame, adds confusion, and keeps people arguing about their side vs the other side, instead of looking in to who is actually screwing them. </p>

<p>So I think the stock market crash will be in close proximity to the election, probably right after it, unless they lose control early because this thing is ready to pop. </p>

<p>The stock market crash will upset lots of people, who will want it fixed. They will be told that the way to fix it, is to bomb Syria. They will do this through some alchemy of emotions, through the media. By a terrorist attack <em>causing</em> the market crash, that is then blamed on ISIS, or by the market crashing more naturally and then blaming it on systemic issues like immigration of people from Syria. Like there&#39;s so many Syrian refugees that are causing problems we <em>have</em> to go over there and fix this civil war! (that we&#39;re funding and arming the rebels to create in the first place, but they won&#39;t say that part) Or a third option is that Russian/Syrian/ISIS hackers caused the market to crash. Any of those would take the outrage of the market crashing, and focus it on a war with Syria. </p>

<p>With the crash blamed mostly on Obama, and the market crashing, Hillary guides us to war, to try and save the day (and everyone&#39;s retirement accounts). Meanwhile the military-industrial complex gets a fat paycheck, the bankers get access to a new market (the Syrian government currently prints it&#39;s own money instead of borrowing through debt from a central bank) and America conquers another country. America profits from the rebuilding as they install the  new government through supposedly democratic elections (see trump vs hillary) and the stock market booms once again, showing the economic value of war, which is a lesson the MIC wants the public to learn. It wants war and economic prosperity to be associated, so that the people are always begging for it. </p>

<p>Then Hillary gets re-elected in 2020 by a 51/49 margin against some crackpot republican plant (unless some charismatic figurehead arrives) and the war in Syria continues over the full 8 years, just like the Iraq war. This puts them closer to cracking the Iran nut, and overthrowing that government again as they did in 1953, before it was taken back by Iran/Russia in 1979.  </p>

<p>At some point, America is going to start to fall apart, and this Syria war is their last effort to save the Empire and drag this out a little longer. The Chinese are already poking holes in our defense in the Pacific. We are collapsing domestically and that will soon be reflected abroad. If the Russians and Chinese fully cooperated, they could begin to end the US world hegemony and they know it. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t even touching on the issue of what&#39;s going to happen as the US dollar loses its status as a reserve currency. Countries are beginning to shun holding the US dollar, and are trying to get out of using it to trade oil (See: Libya, Syria, Russia, Iran) which upsets the US greatly because it could break the foundation of the currency. If suddenly the world is flooded with trillions of USD, the value of one USD will go down a lot, which is also known as inflation. China and Russia know this, and they&#39;ve already begun to dump, but not before the US financiers set up banks in Belgium to buy up the excess liquidity. This game cannot be continued forever. The loss of the reliability of a currency is much more serious than a stock market crash, it may happen once every 80 years instead of once every 8. But this seems to be the situation, as between the petrodollar and reserve currencies, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any more mechanisms to soak up excess printed dollars. Those are quickly coming to an end, which means the market will become flooded with USD, and it will become worthless. They&#39;ve managed to figure out strategies to kick the can down the road, but the situation is quickly becoming untenable as other countries lose faith in the US government and the USD.  </p>

<p>The stock market is at all-time highs even though the economy itself has been stagnant since the 2008 crash. This is largely because of corporate buybacks, where corporations borrow money to buy their own stock to keep the price up. This practice has exploded in popularity the last few years. At some point, the banks will not lend them anymore, and the buybacks will stop, and the market will crash. </p>

<p>So roughly, I see the timeline as Trump goes nuts -&gt; Hillary wins -&gt; Terrorist attack/Stock market crashes -&gt; War in Syria -&gt; Hillary re-election -&gt; War in Syria  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have contingency plans for that, and they will probably work out in their favor. The US government (mostly the CIA) has overseen the overthrow of 53 international governments since WW2 ended. There&#39;s no doubt they could handle an overthrow here. Any revolution, especially if it&#39;s violent, will have its momentum captured by people who are experienced in using the media to guide revolutions to create outcomes that benefit the CIA. They&#39;ve been doing it for 60 years at the least, they&#39;re really good at it. </p>

<p>This is why non-violent revolution is the only way to go, because they don&#39;t have good plans for that. If everyone starts shooting and there&#39;s a civil war, then you can bet they will be playing both sides, and playing them well. If 300 million people simply go stand in DC and clog up the streets until we have a new constitution and a new government, it would happen and the momentum would be much harder for the CIA to capture because it would be a movement by the people and there would be much less confusion and distractions as compared to a violent one. We just need to change the government, we don&#39;t need to destroy it all forever. </p>

<p>If possible, I would prefer doing like the UK and many other European countries did with their kings and queens, let them live in a castle and have a fancy title, but take away all their actual power and let the people direct the government. If we could pull off a modern-day version of this with the Bush and Clinton lineages, I think that&#39;d be terrific. </p>

<p>Or Americans could do an 2009 iceland-style pots and pans revolution, where people literally bring their pots and pans and bang them very loudly as they clog the streets for days and weeks, bringing the operations of various organizations to a standstill.  </p>

<p>These avenues are very preferable to banana-republic tactics, which the CIA perfected, because they were the ones who did them. </p>

<p>But you&#39;re right, we largely get what we deserve, and as long as people keep acting like things are OK when they are clearly not OK, change will not happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed if such massive peaceful protests would happen they would surely try to turn it into a violent one. I don&#39;t know how you could avoid that as all it needs is some provocateurs shooting the police and the response would force the protesters to arm up too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4v6uzj/why_this_can_all_only_end_one_way_with_violence/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4v6uzj/why_this_can_all_only_end_one_way_with_violence/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think most people who post here would agree that we have a government whose goals is to use the populace as a cash crop and exploit them for their own personal gains. We have domestic spying, a federal reserve system of monetary slavery, and increasingly tyrannical behavior.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I propose that this will all end one way... with massive amounts of violence. This is the way it has always been and always will be as long as there are individuals willing to use violence to get their way.</p>

<p>Take for instance, this idea: Two men, Bill and Tom, have a disagreement about who owns a pencil. Bill says it is his. Tom says it is his. Tom is not willing to kill Bill over his claim to the pencil. Bill, on the other hand, is willing to kill Tom over his claim to the pencil.</p>

<p>If Bill is willing to kill and Tom is not, then simple logic dictates that since Tom is not willing to reciprocate the level of aggression that Bill is, then Tom will cede ownership to Bill.</p>

<p>This is how government treats its citizens in all instances.</p>

<p>Try not paying your taxes because you are against making military contractors rich.</p>

<p>If you claim that you are the sole owner of the fruits of your labor, then you will be killed if you resist. The same goes for every injustice that those in power force on the citizenry.</p>

<p>We are seeing this play out right now. Democracy is being subverted and those in power are more than happy to let people stomp their feet and protest because it will not actually change anything. They know that they have the force of violence on their side that the populace has been told on a bad thing.</p>

<p>Why should the government have a monopoly on violence?</p>

<p>No amount of hand-waving, feet stomping, and protesting will change anything. Only when enough people get angry enough to take direct action against those who use violence to control them will we ever see anything change.</p>

<p>They are willing to kill you to get their way. What are you willing to do?</p>

<p>[disclaimer] I&#39;m not a violent guy and am only giving my opinion on how this will play out based on what has happened over and over again throughout history.</p>

<p>Yeah.  I know.  The whole Fema Camps and radiation guns, etc, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and they will probably work out in their favor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not if ALL of us got together and did something about it.  The elite are bullies of only a SUPER fractional percent of the population.  The population itself is the <em>real</em> giant here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no doubt they could handle an overthrow here. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not if the people came together as one.</p>

<p>I know this isn’t likely, but I’m just saying that NO government could handle an intelligent uprising of the people.  Period.  Full stop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any revolution, especially if it&#39;s violent, will have its momentum captured by people who are experienced in using the media to guide revolutions to create outcomes that benefit the CIA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>100% agreed.  I shouldn’t have necessarily said “Nicaraguan Sandinista style” then.  I don’t entirely mean a violent revolution per se.  We have to be intelligent about what we do.  We can’t be like dumb animals.  That would definitely never work.  If we are smart, however, we <em>could</em> do it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mantlethought.org/sites/default/files/article/1267/body-images/MLK%20Selma%20March.jpg">Martin Luther King</a> and <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Marche_sel.jpg">Gandhi</a> style revolutions, but with a <a href="https://images.rapgenius.com/8054a3e515f9a6289781808bda9d1774.252x400x1.gif">Malcolm X flavor</a> and a willingness to fight and defend itself if necessary.</p>

<p>If <em>everyone</em> got together with that kind of mentality, then TPTB here simply wouldn’t be able to deal w/that.  I understand that they have indoctrinated us with so much divisive and racist propaganda, however, that such a thing as what I talk about here is not very likely (unfortunately).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;ve been doing it for 60 years at the least, they&#39;re really good at it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree.  It’s been a lot longer than that though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is why non-violent revolution is the only way to go</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d say it should be a revolution that has an absolutely non-violent focus, but that is not unwilling to defend itself if it’s facing imminent physical harm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>because they don&#39;t have good plans for that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we just all came together and did a nation-wide worker strike and just all stopped showing up for work, but still helped one another independent of the state, the system would all come to a screeching halt but the population wouldn’t necessarily suffer immediately because of it because we would be helping each other.  Again, I know such a thing wouldn’t be likely to do, but that <em>would</em> help the people and <em>not</em> the state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If everyone starts shooting and there&#39;s a civil war, then you can bet they will be playing both sides, and playing them well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t disagree.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We are saying exactly the same thing, sir.  Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We just need to change the government, we don&#39;t need to destroy it all forever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Good point, and well-said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If possible, I would prefer doing like the UK and many other European countries did with their kings and queens, let them live in a castle and have a fancy title, but take away all their actual power and let the people direct the government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see what you’re saying in theory, but I’m not sure the people in the UK are all that advantaged, to be honest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or Americans could do an 2009 iceland-style pots and pans revolution, where people literally bring their pots and pans and bang them very loudly as they clog the streets for days and weeks, bringing the operations of various organizations to a standstill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would prefer for the population to NOT have a loud, ravel-rousing demonstration, honestly.  I feel that creates an atmosphere of general ignorance.  I like the way the three civil rights figures I mentioned above comported themselves.  Many of their marches were in general silence - and they were a lot more powerful as a result because everyone was focused, concentrated, sober, and very orderly.  It wasn’t a bunch of loud people inciting activity that <em>could</em> lead to the type of ignorance and violence that we both have said already here is not a good thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These avenues are very preferable to banana-republic tactics, which the CIA perfected, because they were the ones who did them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, sir.  I said “Sandinista” above a bit out of step.  I was actually meaning some of the very things you’re talking about here more.</p>

<p>Upvote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try a legal impeachment.  Should be easy considering Republican control of both houses &amp; the list of allegations against Hillary, which don&#39;t need to be proven for an impeachment.</p>

<p>A military coup is why Hillary is being installed as president, however.  They need a boogeyman who isn&#39;t even liked by her own party, thus creating public support for elimination of the Constitution.  That&#39;s how it worked with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Peron">Isabel Peron</a> in Argentina 1976, in a direct parallel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t do shit when we&#39;re all living paycheck to paycheck, or those of us that aren&#39;t, if we do pick it up and head to Washington to protest, we lose our careers because we have been forced to accept a world where it&#39;s normal to live paycheck to paycheck and it&#39;s normal for a tiny gap in employment to tank an entire career. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost as if this whole system has been engineered to keep us all in line. We have no choice really. Participate or starve or rot in jail. Nobody is a martyr anymore. Remember how SJWs began pushing the media to never mention the NAME of the &quot;terrorist&quot;? They say it&#39;s so these people cannot be glorified. It&#39;s really so that nobody can start a revolution. Groups like black lives matters and occupy wall st. and the mockery they attract serve only to make people even less likely to rise up. In 2016, our society feels that protesting is for losers and assholes. This also feels engineered. Protesters are now a joke. Well, yall should know what that&#39;s like because it&#39;s the same thing the government did to people that believe in legitimate conspiracies. People that thought the government was spying on them based on actual evidence were lumped in with people that thought the moon landings were faked and so nobody took them seriously. So there you go. Either you&#39;re a terrorist, a tinfoil hat weirdo, or jobless loser asshole blocking traffic, or just another citizen sheep, either way you&#39;re not changing a fucking thing. </p>

<p>That’s what’ll happen if you/we LET it happen.  Dur.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EU will follow suit and everything will be over very soon. it would be a dystopian world.</p>

<p>It’s <em>already</em> a dystopian world for many, Chappie.  Wake up.</p>

<p>you see all the pseudo internet freedom and all the privilege you enjoy right now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  It’s wonderful.  I’ve been at or below (way below) the poverty level in the United States since I moved out on my own roughly 20 years ago.  I’ve been “enjoying” the fuck out it (/s).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>more like the fake smile and hug before someone stabs you to death repeatedly, TBFH.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that’s the VERY fucking reason why I said what I said in my initial comment.  This is EXACTLY why the citizenry do need to come together.  Listen, dude.  If you depend on the state to help you, then yes.  YOU WILL BE <em>FUCKED</em>.  That’s the way it goes.</p>

<p>And this is the very reason why I’m talking about the citizenry itself coming together and HELPING EACH OTHER.  If we <em>can</em> do that, then we’ll be okay.  If we can’t do that, however, and we have a significant enough portion of the citizenry saying “well fuck you then”?  Then yeah.  We will indeed be fucked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the world after this will be very different.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GTFOOH w/this gloom and doom dystopian shit.  People have been saying this very thing for how many generations now?  Look, it MIGHT happen.  Yes.  But it doesn’t HAVE to happen, and your talking like it’s some sort of foregone conclusion and there’s just nothing we can do about it is bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they just let you enjoy your last meal before the final death row show down. the unsuspecting sheep with their last imbecile happy smile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you’re being just as much of a sheep by pining into this “holier than thou” perspective as if somehow you’re above it all because you “see that things will be bad!”…all the while you’re not doing <em>shit</em> about it but coming online and saying “things will be baaad! and there’ll be nothing we’ll be able to do about it!”</p>

<p>Yeah.  The sheep that do nothing but keep eating their fucking burgers and watching their fucking reality shows aren’t doing anything to help.  Correct.  However, the <em>other</em> sheep that are saying “Yeah.  Look at these sheep who know nothing.  <em>I know</em>.  And you know what I know?  I know that we’re fucked and hopeless!” are actually no better than any other sheep they try to point at.</p>

<p>I’m <em>not</em> reading your other posts.  I’m too busy w/what I’m doing here…and I don’t bother much w/going into someone’s post history to see what else they said.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wrong fucking question, bro.  <em>My</em> AR-15?  Who cares about <em>”my”</em> AR-15.  If we’re all together in this, then try asking how long you think ALL OF OUR AR-15s TOGETHER will last.</p>

<p>Things would be a little different then.</p>

<p>And that’s to a great extent part of my point.  It’s not about <em>me</em>.  It’s not about you.  It’s about ALL OF US.</p>

<p>They can take me or you or a few of us out.  No problem.  I understand that.  And because too many of us are too scared over this possibility to think critically or straight about the issue, we don’t realize that just because they can take a few of us out, it doesn’t mean they’d be able to take ALL of us out if we all came together as one.  THAT’S the point.  AR-15 or no AR-15, all of us working together would be able to accomplish almost anything.</p>

Hillary will use Russia to have a serious conflict where there will be destruction on both sides distracting everyone from the absolute shitstorm global bubble we created and then provide ample room for economic reset &amp; growth.  Russia has been ramping up oil production and actually fighting the radical Islam in the middle east.  Remember they were the ones that called out Turkey for buying oil from ISIS, basically cutting them off at the knees while the US stayed silent.  They also are bombing the rebels that Hillary put in place to overthrow the government.  Russians have been strategically undermining US authority over control of the middle east and over the stock market via oil.  And who would blame them for being fed up with the corruption of the West.  They and China want to end the petrodollar and bring some sanity to the world.  We should be allies with them but it&#39;s obvious the media wants to make them the bad guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to fight anyone. The idea you have to fight someone is how the military-industrial complex makes use of you, imo. Especially if it&#39;s based on nationalism and nation vs nation type of thinking. Citizens of russia and US have more in common with each other than Obama does with US citizens. My 2 cents</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ding ding ding someone understands. To clarify, Zionist meaning the belief that the Israeli government should own mount Zion, aka Jerusalem, aka Palestinians should go away and &quot;greater israel&quot; should be formed (meaning Iraq and Syria and Palestine all become part of Israel). </p>

<p>Zionism is an ideological belief system, and over half of US Jewish people reject it. There are many non-jews who are Zionist, like Joe Biden and Obama. Jewish people are great. Zionists are not. Zionism was popularized by the Rothschilds. You have to be a Zionist to do business with them, hence why it is found everywhere in power structures. </p>

<p>Just wanted to clarify what Zionism is before anyone comes in with the &quot;you&#39;re anti-semetic / racist&quot; line, because that&#39;s not what Zionist means. Zionism is a belief about the superiority of Israel, and has nothing to do with race or genetics.</p>

<p>2017
I return home from my mandatory estrogen injections as required by the new Hillary administration
Turn on computer
Realize my allotted hour of internet time has ran out
Spend next ten minutes updating my personal info on the NSA website before they will re-enable another hour of internet access
Soon after, there&#39;s a knock on my door
I answer, it&#39;s a single mother collecting community child support from all the men in the neighborhood
She smiles and says, &quot;trick or treat&quot;, holding out her money collection bag
I recall I wasn&#39;t even able to pay my water bill this month because a girl down the street had twin children this week
Overcome with rage, I say &quot;Fuck off slut&quot;, before slamming the door
As I turn around, my blood freezes
My Xbox Kinect is still powered on, it saw everything
I dash to rip it out of the wall
Too late, my front door is bashed open
Privilege police swarm my small apartment
I am wrestled to the ground and a large pink boot steps on my throat
&quot;This will teach you&quot;, an effeminate voice growls, as a huge, hairy, pangender, non-conformist multisex hambeast pulls out a rusty iron dildo
I clench my ass in preparation for the worst, then...
BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!
The sudden loudness stuns me
Blood spatter eveywhere, the Privilege Police have all fallen over
The silhouette of a large man stands in the doorway
It&#39;s Christopher Dorner
&quot;I thought you were dead&quot;
He looks at me and smiles
&quot;You can&#39;t corner the Dorner</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said that Donald Trump was a plant from the beginning.  He is an entertainer, and I can&#39;t take him seriously.  I don&#39;t hate him though.  Some of the things that he has said have been good, and seemed very reasonable.  We are in for it as a nation to be sure.  Its hilarious to try and say something like this on Reddit in any other subreddit.  The non-thinkers really come unglued.  Its almost amusing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s good satire. Everything that comes out of his mouth is an act, he&#39;s an actor. He&#39;s good at fooling people. That&#39;s why he&#39;s a billionaire. That&#39;s why he had a reality tv show. It&#39;s like people have amnesia about things that happened more than 2 years ago. But something like 53% of Trump voters are only voting Trump because they don&#39;t want Hillary to win. The whole thing is rigged to push people around like sheep. I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s not more discussion about 3rd parties. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man you hit the nail on the head.</p>

<p>I think coupled with all this, we&#39;ll see mass chaos in europe. more and more terror attacks in france (watch out for chemical and car bombs), which will create more civil unrest (french have no qualms about violent rioting... they relish it), which will result in martial law being declared in France.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;ll also see the further disintegration of the EU (or in other words, consolidation of it) especially if Britain proves you can economically survive and do well without it.</p>

<p>I also think this insanity happening in Turkey will result in their leaving NATO, and then mounting a Russian-backed invasion into Syria, prompting the West to respond. I know this prediction is a bit far fetched but far stranger things have happened in history, especially in that particular part of the world.</p>

He is an executive of how many individual business? Executive branch is the same thing. Government is a huge business taking tax payer money and moving to other places. All he needs to do is make sure the government has the ability, funds and leadership to get its job done. This means the right people in the right places. Making informed decisions. Politics exists outside of government btw.</p>

<p>Honestly anything outside of that he is stepping outside of his job title.</p>

<p>Same as we&#39;ve had since probably every president after JFK.</p>

<p>It happened way before JFK. America was fucked forever the second they handed power over to the Federal Reserve and let a bank with the word &quot;federal&quot; in its name that isn&#39;t fucking federal own the country and decide what stays and what goes. JFK wasn&#39;t a boy scout but I&#39;d argue he and his brother were two of the few good ones who saw what was going on and tried to put a stop to it. And you saw how they thanked them for it.</p>

<p>And now whenever someone wins the presidency, their first day in office they are taken into that secret room where they show you the JFK assassination and assure you that if you don&#39;t play ball then this is your future. And that is how &quot;Change&quot; evolves into &quot;abject use of funds to continue the destabilization of the Middle East and expand the war on terror.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it was after. I think this one will be in the first couple months, or before she gets elected maybe so Obama is a fall guy and absorbs all the blame. However the economy crashing makes democrats look bad, so that might help Trump. So there might be some group on the big money right causing a crash before the election for that purpose. I think the democrats are going to try and delay it until a month after she gets in or so, and the republicans want it to happen before the election to make Hillary lose. I think it will be somewhere in the middle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a pretty good theory, I&#39;ve got to say.
But I believe that as prepared and experience they may be with overthrowing govs etc, there are way more people in America that are armed, so that will cause a bit of a problem if everyone joined forces. 
For now I choose to be positive and think Trump is the real deal, an eccentric guy, who wants to conclude his legacy by bringing back America from the brink of collapse, be remembered for generations as a savior. Maybe I&#39;m wrong, and I&#39;m prepared for your outcome as well, but I can&#39;t really control it so I try to stay positive. Trump is calling both Obama and Hillary out for all their crimes and poor decisions, until I see signs that she&#39;s getting a pass from him, or like you said that he&#39;s starting to go too extreme, I don&#39;t know ... But the system is rigged, and with technology these days the control and hold is more powerful I think. Many variables.. Interesting post</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think everyone being armed serves to their benefit. It&#39;s just more chances for things to escalate so they can step in with the military and stomp dissidents. Look at Turkey and how Erdogan is cleaning ideological house, he&#39;s firing and jailing people who disagree with his ideology in any way. If there&#39;s a revolution type of situation, the guns will only serve as markers of who might rebel, especially if those guns are used. They will then step in and rid the world of those people using the most powerful military in the world, and the public will have their back. They use the guns to create revolutions, it is not a way to bypass their system, but falls exactly in to the trap of it. The state has a monopoly on violence. There are other ways to change governments that work much more easily and offer more legitimacy post-revolution. Like the Icelandic revolution. </p>

<p>I think people should vote 3rd party, personally. I think both of the two major candidates are absolutely disastrous for America.  The only &quot;wasted vote&quot; is for one of those two MIC Zionist patsies. </p>

<p>My 2 cents, I know you&#39;ll probably choose to disagree on a lot of that and that&#39;s fine, but that&#39;s my take on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of those things that you just need to keep an eye on because it will go exponential. Have a plan for what to do when there is 2% inflation a DAY instead of a year. Be prepared to buy physical assets that hold their value as the currency hyperinflates, instead of holding your value in cash. Physical gold and silver are decent options, but it could be anything. Like a used piece of expensive laboratory equipment that isn&#39;t depreciating in value, or a vintage baseball card that is always valuable. The problem is specialized things can be hard to sell, whereas gold is easy to sell. </p>

<p>So just keep an eye on real inflation - not the CPI numbers put out by the government because they ignore food inflation and several other costs, and not the inflation as compared to the JPY and EUR because those are being manipulated in lock-step with the USD to keep it from looking like inflation is happening - keep an eye on real inflation and if you start to see it get too bad for you to stomach, know that it will get worse and begin pivoting your savings in to physical assets that will weather the hyperinflationary storm which may last a year or more until a new currency is brought in to replace it, likely a union currency like the Amero or a world basket currency like the IMF&#39;s SDRs, but probably the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (BRICS banks) equivalent.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some theories that the stock market numbers will go up a lot because the inflation will be going up so fast, but it&#39;s risky and there&#39;s no guarantee that the growth of the market would keep pace with the growth of inflation as you experience it in your life. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my 2 cents on how to deal with it when it comes. Physical assets retain value. And there is the option of moving to another country, as well. One that doesn&#39;t use the EUR, JPY or USD. </p>

I&#39;d distinguish between this insidious organization that controls most if not all nations, and what will be the <strong>overt</strong> US military that will control the US population. Once protests reach critical mass, US military officers will be roaming the streets, and they are relatively different to the transnational black ops groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they are going to nuke something and blame Russian negligence. There are at least 20 nuclear devices that are missing from both Russia and the US. Also, we have never tested our space warfare equipment. If the nuke a major production center in India or China or Europe, they will do the economy and unite people hesitant to join us. Got to split up China Russia India some how...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said that Donald Trump was a plant from the beginning.  He is an entertainer, and I can&#39;t take him seriously.  I don&#39;t hate him though.  Some of the things that he has said have been good, and seemed very reasonable.  We are in for it as a nation to be sure.  Its hilarious to try and say something like this on Reddit in any other subreddit.  The non-thinkers really come unglued.  Its almost amusing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it was after. I think this one will be in the first couple months, or before she gets elected maybe so Obama is a fall guy and absorbs all the blame. However the economy crashing makes democrats look bad, so that might help Trump. So there might be some group on the big money right causing a crash before the election for that purpose. I think the democrats are going to try and delay it until a month after she gets in or so, and the republicans want it to happen before the election to make Hillary lose. I think it will be somewhere in the middle. </p>
