<p>I tried to read up on this once but there was far too much to read haha. Although, it was pretty brilliant in the fact that it told the story entirely using news clippings and quotes from leaders at the time so you can&#39;t really claim it&#39;s falsified. I need an ELI5 about the true history of the world wars. </p>

<p>From what I gathered though, it seems like the soviet revolution in 1917 may hold pertinent details. </p>

<p>On your nat geo link. Peter Frost destroys this. </p>

<p>“I believe that the earliest humans in the Americas were physically and culturally similar to the Solutreans of Western Europe. But this simply reflects the fact that prior to 20,000 BP a single breeding population extended from southwestern France to Beringia. It was only after the glacial maximum that west and east Eurasians became different from each other.”</p>

<p>There was a single breeding population. That&#39;s why they show West European affinities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The World Wars are the creation myth of the West and the current world order. It was the birth of the &quot;democratic free world&quot; and legitimises everything we&#39;ve done since because World War II &quot;proves&quot; we&#39;re the good guys. The Nazi&#39;s are history&#39;s last great evil. Defeating them went a long way to allowing the west to wash their hands of their own histories of concentration camps and genocide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The talk that you linked speaks about nothing except the book. The first 3 minutes is her saying &quot;the hidden history of the white race&quot; and &quot;got to the 4 corners of the earth&quot;. </p>

<p>Too bad modern day genetics disagrees with this claim. </p>

<p>I do not disagree with what you wrote above, however the video is garbage from a pseudoscience book. Excuse me, pseudo history </p>
