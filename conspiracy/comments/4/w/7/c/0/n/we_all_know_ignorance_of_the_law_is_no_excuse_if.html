<p>How does this make any sense? I mean seriously, with the law this complex it means that cops can arrest anyone they want because everyone is constantly breaking laws without even realizing it. This takes power away from the judicial system and puts it in the hands of cops, which more and more makes them the judge, jury, and executioner. </p>

<p>The US legal system is abusive and anti-human. It&#39;s written by lawyers, for lawyers and their clients. It bears little relevance to what everyday people want in regard to justice, and gets more off the mark by the day and lawyers re-write and append more and more laws at the behest of the people paying them. Big money owns the legal system. They create ridiculous standards, then the masses are held to them but they are not. It&#39;s a selective-enforcement system that does not benefit the masses. </p>
