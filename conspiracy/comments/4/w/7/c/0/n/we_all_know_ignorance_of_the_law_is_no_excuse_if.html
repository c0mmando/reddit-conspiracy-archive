       How does this make any sense? I mean seriously, with the law this complex it means that cops can arrest anyone they want because everyone is constantly breaking laws without even realizing it. This takes power away from the judicial system and puts it in the hands of cops, which more and more makes them the judge, jury, and executioner.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US legal system is abusive and anti-human. It's written by lawyers, for lawyers and their clients. It bears little relevance to what everyday people want in regard to justice, and gets more off the mark by the day and lawyers re-write and append more and more laws at the behest of the people paying them. Big money owns the legal system. They create ridiculous standards, then the masses are held to them but they are not. It's a selective-enforcement system that does not benefit the masses.

       People were arrested for exiting vehicles on the drivers side. and harassed for operating vehicles on the cities main thoroughfare on Sunday. It apparently would scare the horses of church goers.

       To me the most mind boggling thing is that no one even knows how many possible crimes there are. I've read some estimates but no one knows for sure. Is that not an ignorance of the law in itself?

       It is a fucking joke. Honestly, if 90% of the law text was removed, it would STILL be a huge undertaking to know the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the way it is written lawyers commonly argue what it even means and how to interpret it. It should be COMPLETELY rewritten with no jargon.
