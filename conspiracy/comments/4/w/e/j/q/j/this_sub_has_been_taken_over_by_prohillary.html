       Is it possible he's for trump just because--like nearly all of us here are--completely terrified of a hillary getting her hands on the nuclear codes; and terrified of a corrupt CIA that seems to be ushering her in against the will of the vast majority of the public (it's well over 60% by now that are against her; don't listen to polls, listen to bumper stickers...with me she's polling around 2% of people who have political bumper stickers, if that's an indication, many more with hillary stickers in asheville, but that's because it's the wiccan capital of the us (or east coast at least))

       Actually people like OP are jamming the sub with  pathetic zero value content. We should just not Feed trolls. He gets Front page for this crappy post. But you try posting decent conspiracy thoughts, see how far u get. Most anti-Trump, anti-establishment post I made in the last 6 months has been met with downvotes and anger. It's been fucking frustrating.

       there are many still who are eager to sell their souls, waiting in line to replace the clintons.......... and the bushes too.

       The mods will remove anyone that we have evidence is shilling for any cause. But this has to be something more than just posting lame pro-Hillary comments. And anti-Trump comments don't count either, because a lot people are not enamoured of either Hillary or Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you find evidence that somebody is a shill, message the mods.

       YES, the same Rudy Giuliani that many Fire fighters of NYC blame for not purchasing new radios before 9/11...the same Rudy Giuliani who allowed the evidence to be taken away before an actual investigation happened...the same Rudy Giuliani who employed the corrupt as fuck Bernard Kerik on the NYPD.

       I smell something fishy, why do you not have moderator on your name now?  You are anti trump through some weird argument.  Obviously to be president you have to make allies.  New Radios? that is a pretty obscure argument.

       Trump is very much a truther talking about election fraud, and how the system is brought and paid for.

       Trump is exposing how Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for with Saudi $.  Truther as they get and be this close to the presidency.

       I don't care who it is, if they're saying what Trump is saying then godspeed. I don't give one fuck about the celebrity and grade school gossip horseshit that surrounds him, I just want this 'government's' henchmen finally brought to justice and I want to live a life without their influence while I'm still here. That's what he said he'd do if he were elected. I want someone in the oval office with that mindset. Hillary is the opposite of that mindset. Everything aside from this is meaningless to me.

       And what is it that trump is actually saying? He hasn't been involved in politics, hasn't really cared what people in power have done. He has focused on himself and his money, not public service.
      </p>
      <p>
       The president doesn't have a lot of power. Congress makes the rules. Trump is already talking about surrounding himself with other rich business folks. He has shown he has problems running a business and people want him to run the government?
      </p>
      <p>
       No public service. Iffy businesses/bankruptcy. Bad mouths everyone. Doesn't understand foreign policy. Wants the government run like a company of his.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our country isn't perfect, but it has a lot of great things going on with it. We need changes - some big ones to justice. The poor get screwed on a regular basis. The rich get away with most everything. Corporations break laws and pay a small fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is one issue you are big on, focus on that. BLM for example has issues they address (police/justice), some folks focus on abortion rights, others on gun rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump doesn't know how to run a government. He can't even run a coherent campaign. He can't fix the problems we have but he sure can create a heckuva lot more by screwing up things to make it all even worse.

       You say no public service as if it's a condemnation. It's his saving grace. He doesn't have a track record of fucking the public over... Hillary has a new thread about someone trying to prosecute her being murdered every other day.

       You say Trump doesn't understand foreign policy. Probably because of the weak but repeated ad nauseam no muslim thing. What you don't realize is that they're saying the sketchy alleged CIA sponsored radical group in Syria (who I assume is there to eventually orchestrate a false flag operation to start the eventual war in Syria with our consent) has access to a machine that prints passports. (wonder how they could've gotten that...). Meanwhile our foreign policy doesn't seem to be going so well as it is seeing as how the world hates us, might as well let them and take our ball with us. Its about time to do ourselves a solid for once. Why is it our responsibility to foster nations? Why are we an asshole when we decide enough is enough and let them loose to fend for themselves for awhile? Fuck us for telling them to nut up, right? What role does the secretary of defense play in the overall perception of a nation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it his stance on moving jobs back home? Are we really that much of an asshole if we finally start supporting ourselves again by actually producing goods instead of trying to play the middle-man game of musical chairs, of which the song stopped playing for the fortunate ones long ago? They all talk about depopulation as if we couldnt possibly  supply adequate food and shelter for this many people when in reality if it weren't for NAFTA we might not have entire cities known for a particular product or resource going bankrupt. We might not have people going around accepting the massive negative affect it had and continues to have on their lives as an inevitable part of life because they don't remember or weren't around for the time before the husband of Trump's opponent in this election decided to sell us out for a bribe and corporate profits 20 years ago. I think it was around the time they burned that 'cult' alive in Waco, Texas.

       as far as foreign policy - he sucks at relations and his stances on wto/nato come to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so what if he runs a company? Lots of people do/have. And he filed bankruptcy 4 times, so he obviously hasn't run them all that well.

      <p>
       The US is not a company. It isn't there for profit - how hard is that for some people to grasp?

       Watch his portland speech, he just stammers around making up shit and hopping from topic to topic with no real plan in speaking. He knows all he has to do is stand up there and say america sucks, believe him, and ramble on and he knows people like you will just nod your head without thinking at all.

       Like a preacher to a blind flock. His people 'believe' something and he just confirms it without real information (or distorted). No wonder every other few words he has to blurt out 'believe me'.

       That makes no sense. And it looks like plenty of folks have downvoted me around here, and I didn't downvote you - it's not a disagree button. When you disagree you say so in a post and move on, downvoting people you don't agree with is a cop out that some people use to try to silence others.

       I prefer direct discussion, like an adult, and because I rely on my ability to talk about things. Some people can't argue a point so they downvote and run. And when that happens, I know I won.

       To be a super power you must have the ability to project your power economically, militarily, culturally and politically on a global scale.   China has none of that.  They are a regional power.  Really the only country that can do all four is the US.

       Agreed! He called out Obama the fraud regarding his non existent birth certificate, he's called out the rigging of politics, he's talked about 9/11, maybe he is a fraud like Obama was, but currently he is the only candidate worth anything, well and Jill Stein

       I am amazed that anyone would think this sub is pro-Hillary, but since about 50 people have upvoted you, some here must obviously share this view (even assuming many of those votes are from people will upvote literally anything that is critical of the mods).
      </p>
      <p>
       I know, perhaps you could link a pro-Hillary comment by any mod just to prove your point? Just one will do. Failing that, you could try to find a single pro-Hillary post (by anybody) on this subreddit, with a score higher than zero. Surely the "pro-Hillary" mods would have managed to engineer that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you will struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you need to understand that this sub is anti-[the political system]. Hillary has no supporters at all in this sub, but that doesn't mean this sub is a platform for activists from either
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/SandersforPresident">
        /r/SandersforPresident
       </a>
       , because this sub has been critical of both of them too, and many here are suspicious about their personal motives. Sadly, Sanders has already proved the doubters right by folding like a pack of cards and endorsing Hillary.

       I can't wait for the elections to be over so this sub can get back to normal operation. All these anti-clinton/trump submissions are really starting to take over actual information. There's no real content in 90% of the submissions and none of these folks really want a discussion. Both sides are just trying to shove a message down our throats.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you point out the hypocrisy you are immediately labeled as a shill by whichever side.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, there's substantially more "Trump supporters" pushing content here than Clinton supporters. I've seen a few profiles that could have been CTR at work but you would have to be completely blind to think that Trump hasn't also recruited their own internet army.

       Trump is the one this sub has been waiting for, we haven't been given a better option to vote for in a long time.  The Hillary people want to trick us into wasting our votes on third parties, they are trying every trick in the book, fortunately the majority in this sub are too smart to fall for it

       Actually you are very uninformed.  Look up what Stephen Cohen of Princeton says about Hillary in that she has brought us closer to nuclear war with Russia than ever before.  Trump says nuclear war is our greatest threat, and will avoid nuclear war with Russia, he is making moves to work together with Russia.  You have ruined this forum with your never trump attitude.  You are pushing some weird agenda.
