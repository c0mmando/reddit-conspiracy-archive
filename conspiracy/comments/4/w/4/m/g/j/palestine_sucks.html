    <div class="md"><p>How fucking dare you assume that I or anyone wants to &quot;wipe out Israel?&quot;</p>

<p>Do you think this is a new trick we haven&#39;t seen before? </p>

<p>We know how it goes. Anyone who criticizes the expansionist policies of the Israeli government, you slander and vilify as wanting to &quot;wipe out Israel,&quot; which is to say &quot;wipe out the Israeli people,&quot; which is to say &quot;wipe out the Jews.&quot; Therefore, anyone who criticizes Israeli policy, you think you&#39;re justified in calling them a genocidist equivalent to Hitler.</p>

<p>Pure lowlife smear tactic right out of the Intro to Counterintelligence textbook. Isn&#39;t that true? Don&#39;t answer. Everyone here knows it is. </p>

<p>How about if I call on all states to abide by international law and norms of state conduct as established by agreements to which ALL PARTIES are signatory? Oh, that&#39;s much too hard. So you&#39;re going to find it necessary to construct some elaborate rhetorical device by which you can equate that suggestion with genocide. Isn&#39;t that right? Go ahead. Let&#39;s see if I called it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sympathize. Religion doesn&#39;t belong in the affairs of state. </p>

<p>At the same time, I think there&#39;s not enough religion in the world. And by that I mean in people&#39;s private lives. And by religion I don&#39;t just mean empty outer forms but a true and life sustaining spiritual path. Industrial civilization seems to know or care only about the material world. We&#39;ve lost the old spiritual ways, and I&#39;m firmly convinced that we suffer for that very conspicuously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well. If that&#39;s why you posted, then technically, that&#39;s trolling.</p>

<p>Just about everyone will say they&#39;re not trolling when they do this, but that&#39;s what it is.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;ve noticed anti-Zionism among my fellow conspiracy connoisseurs. I also have a problem with the aggressive, expansionist form of Zionism. Early on, the state of Israel faced a policy choice: security or expansionism. You can&#39;t have both. Everyone knew that from Day One. Well, as you know, they went the expansionist route.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I know enough about the essence of Zionism to say whether or not I have a problem with it at its core. Maybe you can help me with that. From a distance, I feel suspicious of the Balfour declaration in the first place. On the face of it, it seems as if the writer claims the authority to give away somebody else&#39;s territory. There&#39;s probably a different take on it.</p>

<p>Also, from this distance, and again I don&#39;t know enough details, I don&#39;t like it when any government discriminates on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, and so on. And it seems as if Israel does a lot of that to the Palestinians. The whole citizenship thing bugs me. But maybe nothing can be done about that except a 2-state solution. I prefer one state where everyone has equal rights, but what do I know?</p>

<p>Anyway, yes, I&#39;ve noticed anti-Zionism here, which in principle doesn&#39;t bother me. I sympathize with it. But too often (not necessarily here but in other conspiracy circles), I see people promulgating outright hatred of Jews. This is NOT ok with me and I do NOT sympathize with it! It mystifies me. They may say it&#39;s Zionism they object to, but when they talk, it&#39;s Jew-this and Jew-that. Sometimes I wonder if those people are plants trying to make critics of Israeli policy look bad.</p>

<p>So those are my thoughts, FWIW. Maybe nothing.</p>

<p>Hey, check it out, I got a downvote for saying people could use more spirituality in their private lives. Was that you? Just curious. I often get downvotes for saying something like that, and I wonder what the reasoning is. Is it an atheist who feels compelled to thumbs-down any expression of spiritual sentiment, no matter how mild? As if the downvote button is there to signal &quot;I personally believe a different thing.&quot; Well, whatever, it&#39;s just fake karma.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I didn&#39;t think you downvoted me, and I wouldn&#39;t blame you if you did. I just always get curious about why, so I asked.</p>

<p>If I understand you right, I might get disapproval here just for saying I don&#39;t want to wipe Israel off the map? Like, let&#39;s go ahead and keep Israel? I don&#39;t disbelieve you. I just wouldn&#39;t have thought of that because my opinion seems so... bland. Like extremely moderate. It&#39;s funny to me that anyone would get offended by the most inoffensive position I can think of.</p>

<p>Anyway, I read you wrong, and I apologize. I thought you were setting me up for the whole &quot;you want to destroy all Jews&quot; straw man. I&#39;ve experienced that so many times that I thought I saw it coming sure as anything. But it sounds like you were <em>genuinely surprised</em> that I didn&#39;t want to destroy Israel.</p>

<p>Man, it&#39;s sad when we have such low expectations of a conversation.</p>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t want to argue about whether or not Israel has pursued an expansionist policy. I&#39;m satisfied to say it seems that way to me, and I&#39;ll reexamine that opinion with your viewpoint in mind.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny you say that Palestinians are taught to hate Jews from birth. The last one I was really friends with picked a Jewish neighborhood to live in because he liked Jews and said they make good neighbors. Maybe he&#39;s an anomaly, but I dunno.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are definately more likely to get anonymous votes down by making any statement that can in any way be interpereted as sympathetic to israel or zionism, than for complaining about industrial civilization. Just MY view though. </p>

<p>Many people here believe Israel has no right to exist. Many believe there were no 911 hijackers. They think zionists made up 19 arabic names just so they could blame muslims. Etc etc and on and on, exactly the same approach to every issue in the world. Its a morass to wade through every day.</p>
