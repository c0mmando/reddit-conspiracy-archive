<p>Do you want to cripple your overlords? You have the power to cut them off at the knees. It&#39;s simple. We can build a counter-initiative against them. It&#39;s easy. Stop the flow of consumption. </p>

<p><strong>Just for 30 days:</strong></p>

<p>Join a food co-op. </p>

<p>Shop local. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t fall for licensed labels.</p>

<p>Avoid Walmart. (Seriously, they need to sweat.)</p>

<p>Ask how to start local promotional start-ups. Pm me. :)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t settle. Don&#39;t be poisoned. Don&#39;t waste time being pissed. </p>

<p>Stick together. </p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>- use credit unions instead of banks. </p>

<p>Changing the world starts with changing your own neighborhood. We can&#39;t stop corruption overall, but we can sure as hell put a dent in their cash-flow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really the most effective way to protest in a capitalist society. There are just always places to compromise. Like, when I&#39;m low on gas and don&#39;t want to buy BP because of the Gulf or Shell because of the Arctic or Chevron because of their sins and so on and so forth. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it before, but one of the most effective ways of bringing change is making &quot;doing the right thing&quot; profitable. A simple example is how a good deal of companies have hopped onto pro-gay fads and hashtags because consumers care about gay rights now more than ever.</p>

<p>My previous post was to illustrate that that <strong>sometimes</strong> the system is unavoidable.  </p>

<p>If you think you can completely avoid using the system, then you should stop using a fiat currency (USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, etc).  I&#39;m pretty sure you do use their money, since you are using a computer and the internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This struggle tends to leave one embittered, disconnected, and hopeless. To believe in a thing that is widely criticized and demonized, especially by close friends and loved ones, is a hard thing and tends to lead one to the conclusion that all is  futile. For someone to imply that there are ways by which one can have an effect, however small it may seem, is hope. Hope is essential in the search for the truth.

Walmart destroyed small town america, literally, and are a drain on food stamp programs, welfare etc, because they refuse to pay their employees a living wage when they very easily <em>could</em>.  You and I support the Walton billionaires in a very real way, with our taxes.  The Walton family is worth over $40 billion, and they could easily give every one of their employees a living wage.

<p>What makes you think you are the only holder of this arcane knowledge? If I need a new inner tube, I go to Walmart, because that&#39;s where they are sold. I cannot go to Momma&#39;s Inner Tube Emporium, because it doesn&#39;t exist. And if it did, they would charge more than evil old Walmart.</p>

<p>Big fish eat little fish, deal with it. IKEA put a zillion cabinetmakers out of business, you don&#39;t hear them screeching about it. Be flexible, and move the fuck on with your life instead of whining like a little bitch.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because over the last few decades, Walmart has killed small town america.  There often were places to go, and people shopped in them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Big fish eat little fish, deal with it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, the big fish went to China starting in about the 1980&#39;s and started the trend of sending cheap, shitty Chinese crap to the states in place of quality items.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what I expected from you.  The next time you look around at this country, and take a nice hard look-- remember that you contribute directly to its downfall.  Walmart is just your kind of store.  Have fun on your scooter.  <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/41/4b/00/414b00f5b79bdea5240bc0424c65eae9.jpg">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/41/4b/00/414b00f5b79bdea5240bc0424c65eae9.jpg</a></p>

<p>As I made clear before, made in china cheap, shitty throw-away items emerged with Walmart&#39;s nationwide dominance, while they devastated small businesses. </p>

<p>Yes, I do understand that, very clearly.  Do you understand that it was Walmart who put thousands upon thousands of US made, better quality producing items out of business?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We got tired of the ol&#39; $60+ a month for TV channels that aren&#39;t even good... so we went with Netflix for a few months, which was under $10 at the time.  r/cordcutters gives a shitton of really good advice also.</p>

<p>Now we just get DVD&#39;s from the library, watch youtube videos, or buy a lot of them at estate sales etc, used.  Mostly listen to music, and stick with the internet though.  It took a little getting used to, but it really isn&#39;t bad once you get used to it.  It&#39;s really nice not being sold something at all times.  Kind of a relief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometime when I was a teenager, I stopped buying CDs and started pirating music. When the government and record companies and dying bands started trying to guilt me into buying CDs again, I came to the realization that I wasn&#39;t contributing to my favorite artists...I was contributing to a business, and I didn&#39;t want that, I wanted to give directly to the people who MADE the thing I enjoyed. </p>

<p>I love to buy from eBay and etsy and similar sites. Reuse helps stop pollution, because otherwise a lot of stuff just ends up in the closet or attic or dump. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t just hit you at the Grocery Store, the whole goverment is rigged to relieve you of as much money as possible. Most don&#39;t know this but there are only a few states that Insurance companies even base your insurance rate off your Driving Record, they base it off your Credit Score!! Now why would that be you ask? There are far more people with Bad Credit than there are with bad driving records. The entire system is rigged....</p>

<p>It would cover auto, home, life and have salary caps at $80k per year tied to inflation, and try to undercut all current players in the market.

    <div class="md"><p>:) Fellow gardener here. It amazes me the ideas people have about things, and their aversion to a little bit of authentic work. You would think you were threatening to hang them or administer some dire existential consequence.</p>

<p>One day a few years ago I gave my best friend&#39;s wife a fresh garden tomato. She took it home. A week or two later I asked her if she enjoyed it she said &quot;no&quot; because it &quot;didn&#39;t look right&quot; when she cut into it. She said the core wasn&#39;t white like those in the store so she thought it was diseased.</p>

<p>SMH.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing quite like biting into the first tomato of the summer grown from heirloom seed, that you&#39;ve tended carefully and watched grow from a single leaf struggling to burst from the ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My advice in this vein would be to never buy crappy furniture. If you take a closer look at a consumer grade couch, it has fucking <em>cardboard</em> as support, meaning that you sit on a thin piece of cardboard and it&#39;s bound to bend and snap at one point, forcing you to to chuck the entire thing into a dumpster and buy a new one.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, my dad snatched a military bed during his service, it&#39;s made of solid steel and can withstand two kids jumping on it whole day long. So, buy only the toughest furniture you can find and consider it an investment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am trying to live the way you describe, but it&#39;s harder than it sounds.<br/>
Growing stuff is not easy.  You need to own land, which means you need money.  Not a single place I&#39;ve rented has allowed me to dig up their precious grass.  Also, the climate has to agree with what you&#39;re plantng.  This spring was vicious to my plants - frst freezing and then boiling - the poor plants died.  Also, you need to pay for water and fertilizer etc etc.  Growing, when you mean it, is a rich man&#39;s game.
I shop a LOT at thrift stores, and they do not carry a huge stock of needed things.  These are the things I&#39;ve bought lately not from a thrift store: shoes (I am not going to buy diseasy used shoes - sorry.), a freezer, a garden hose, and a computer.  Show me where someone local makes those things.  Artisan shoes, my ass.  You want me to pay a LOT of money.  I am wlling to pay $5 more for a product made in the USA - oddly enough, my check-out girl used to work at the factory that made the garden hose, so I knew the label wasn&#39;t lying to me.  I have yet to fnd things homemade or local where I don&#39;t have to pay through the nose.
My local co-op is also a pretentious money drain.  I can buy the exact same brands for cheaper at a regular grocery store.  Of course I&#39;m not a big drinker of artisanal luxury beer.
So, I love the sentiment, but you have to realize that your approach requires a lot of money and time.<br/>
I still believe the BEST thing a person can do is to get their tubes tied, and not have children.  THAT is the real way to stop consumerism in one generation.</p>

You might want to wait on growing stuff until next year. Joining a food co-op is always a good idea or if your in an area like I am there are farmers with food stands everywhere. Buying local from your IGA will support the same companies that make the food for Walmart, so you won&#39;t be hurting those food producers that pack our food with toxins, just Walmart which is a start. Where I&#39;m at there is a Meat shop which IMO is way better then anything you can get at the store. Avoided all can goods, sodas, frozen goods, etc. you can if you want to hurt those companies. I know the horror, you will have to make your own meals. Buy your beer from local microbreweries.</p>

<p>Cut the cord btw! No tv, no social media, no reddit or internet! Can&#39;t have those bastards brainwashing you! Live off the land! Even if you don&#39;t have the land to live off of...just find some! It&#39;s everywhere! </p>

<p>All sarcasm aside, it sounds like a great idea. But what about the people that work at these places? Good hard working Americans that really don&#39;t get paid what they should...but ya know..once sales drop you know the first thing to go? The grunts of the stores. You&#39;re not hurting Wal*Mart by not shopping there, you&#39;re hurting the employees who will be laid off. (No that does not mean you should shop there because of the people, but the point is made for all things commercial) </p>

<p>It wont work. Sorry to be the bugger of bad news, but it wont. Remember when gas prices where like 4-5 bucks a gallon and everyone was like, &quot;ON AUGUST 4th DON&quot;T BUY GASS!!! THATS HOW WE&quot;LL GET THEM TO LOWER THE PRICES&quot; People bought gas. Why? Because they had to go to work, and take their kids to school and go to the grocery store to feed their kids. People had emergencies, police needed to fill up their cars. And the people trying to organize it bought gas the day after and day before. </p>

<p>There is a plethora of data which explains how Walmart is detrimental to communities. In fact, the phenomena is so prevelant, there are entire economic studies based on the Walmart factor. </p>

<p>You can type lots of words in all caps, but it doesn&#39;t add anything to what you&#39;re saying. You can make round-a-bout correlations to gas prices, and cite hard working Americans, and still - you haven&#39;t touched upon the wage-slave-system that is Walmart. </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the <em>only</em> reason I can think of for you to defend Walmart is that you are either an employee of the brand or a paid poster. </p>

<p>Either way -good luck with that rhetoric. </p>

<p>In my town, Wal-Mart is considerably more expensive than Crest. It doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be big box stores. People can definitely hurt the big companies by buying off brand products.</p>

<p>Buy dollar tree soda instead of Coke, use Linux instead of Windows or OS X, buy books from bookstores like half price books. Buy video games used at stores like GameXChange instead of Gamestop.</p>

<p>I appreciate that, btw. You&#39;re openly admitting you&#39;re dying a little every day. It&#39;s better than lying and saying you have something to contribute. </p>

<p>Cheers, shill. Enjoy your meh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are a waste of words. You&#39;d rather hear some comforting half lies or half truths instead of the painful truth. Now THAT&#39;s what wrong with people today ... You remind me of those Occupy hippies stinking up parks and holding drum circles to end casino capitalism or those castrated wankers running &quot;for the cure&quot; benefits in wife beaters with a paper number safety pinned to their backs. Just massively delusional at best, engaged in exactly the kind of substitute behaviour that&#39;s completely harmless to the system and ineffective to elicit any sort of true change. </p>

<p>Quickly, go buy yourself a 4$ shirt and a jalapeno plant ... only to buy yourself a brand new Hugo Boss shirt 3 days later so you don&#39;t get treated like trailer trash anymore and a bag full of jalapenos that costed a fragment of the plant that&#39;s been half eaten by lice or snails by the time you realize you suck at bringing up the energy for something that was doomed from the get-go. </p>

<p>&quot;But, but ... At least I tried&quot; 
You tried trying, but you didn&#39;t do shit. Kumbayaah, mah Loawd, Kumbayaaah.</p>

Watch how you feel about that in the years as you watch it grow. The same is happening on this post. Unless someone comes along and cuts it down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take it you are 75? Can&#39;t disagree with you.</p>

<p>Every alternative idea and business ultimately gets bought by or incorporated into the psychopathic reality.  Most of the time these ideologues roll over at the first bone, as if that was their goal all along.</p>

<p>I have personally witnessed this in some big movements and it has left me thoroughly disgusted and without hope in anything human.</p>
