       I spoke with a mechanic today and he kept saying 'donald trump is asking russia to release hillary's emails'.  And I said, you know wikileaks has released most if not all in searchable form, right?  He just kind of looked at me like he didn't hear me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I missing something?  Maybe I'm turned around.  Are there even more emails that haven't been released by wikileaks that russia is hanging on to or does trump not know about wikileaks?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the latter, then it's clear there's a neocon news filter and a
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       news filter.  And everyone but
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is trapped in a neocon bubble where they are incapable of finding their ways to hillary's emails, that have already been released for a while now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it that wikileaks' emails just aren't trustworthy or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please let me know how I'm all turned around. Thanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       bonus question is assange a russian agent and that's why they can't kidnap him so easily by dropping blackop mercs into an ecuadorean embassy?

       Isn't Trump against Wikileaks? I seem to recall Trump calling Assange (and Snowden) traitors who should be tortured. Perhaps he doesn't think Wikileaks would appeal to the people he sees as his current followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, Trump doesn't seem to have a consistent policy. He goes back and forth on issues, and says whatever he feels like at the moment, contradicting himself, perhaps adjusting his message slightly for each specific crowd he's talking to, etc. The only predictable thing about him is his tendency to lie and be inconsistent. But hey, at least he's "anti establishment" ...

       He does think they are traitors. He supports the NSA and the patriot act and wants to lock down the internet, and he wants more funding for Israel.  H also supports the H1B program bringing in more foreigners to take american jobs and drive wages down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just don't tell any of his ignorant supporters that.  They still think he's got their best interest in mind.  In reality he just wants to give himself and other wealthy people massive tax cuts like George Bush did and wreck our economy.

       Yeah, I know. It's kinda funny how Alex Jones and most other "conspiracy theorists" support the guy. He might be a scarecrow the globalists are using to make people vote for Hillary. Compared to Trump, she'll look like the best candidate in the eyes of most people. Despite her obvious corruption and evil. (Glossed over by the MSM, of course.)

       How would tax cuts wreck the economy? You realize the US is the most taxed nation?... and people wonder why companies go offshore. Lower taxes and the money comes back in many different ways. Damn, people do not even understand basic business or economics. Now, what Bernie wanted to do and what Hillary will continue doing, will continue ruining our already devastated economy....

      <p>
       318,000,000 * .628 * .39 * 26695 = 2.0791283e+12 = 2,079,128,300,000 or 2.079T per year to IRS if everyone is average and honest

       make that 2 decades.  Hah, or at the rate of this country is going down the pooper, infinity

       I realize this doesn't include corporate taxes, which are probably on average negative, which means they get money from the government....and then cost the government in terms of environmental cleanup.

       I love how all the candidates talk about taxes like it's this dial they can turn up and down and that will fix things.  It's lunacy.  They never of course talk about the glaringly obvious most expensive thing we spend our money on and it's the security industrial complex we don't need, doesn't work, and never wanted, and never asked for.

       I'm not talking about what our tax dollars are being spent on (I think what they are is wrong). I'm talking about taxes and the inevitability of government to waste said money. This is something you, and others are not realizing. Fuck the federal government. Stealing is stealing. I don't care if my money goes to war or for a SAP who is leeching off the system. It's theft, and the government are the perfect thieves. Fuckin' hell. Stockholm syndrome.... They are stealing from us! Get it through your thick, heads. You were on here talking about Commie Bernie, look what he did buying his new mansion (You changed your tune - lmfao). You are being lied to and mislead.. Fuck...

       We pay out far more to private entities than would've been spent by people in other countries, but those aren't taxes- such as healthcare. Other countries get that as a natural right but we have one of the most expensive systems in the world.

       . Shows how little you know about what the grown ups are talking about.... Where do you get your money? Probably from a company... Well, US companies are taxed the most. Read up, and educate yourself on basic business and economics....

       Panama papers didn't prove shit (not surprising - if you are intelligent). Also, where there is a will there is a way. You think tax loopholes will end if you tax companies 99%? What about 100%? Do you think thieves care if a house has a lock and sign on the front door? No. Your childish understanding and thinking is what is wrong with this country. Less taxes == less people hiding money. It's basic human logic. God damn, this country is a fuckin' joke...

       If he was joking, then his adherents didn't get the joke.  Father and son mechanic have the tv on fox running all day and they were asking me like
       <em>
        I somehow knew
       </em>
       about trump.  I don't keep up with trump news, sorry.  I think he's a fool.  I think Hillary's a criminal.  I'm probably not voting unless something happens between now and then.  Dark horse of Bernie perhaps.

       No I wasn't mean to them, I just said I honestly didn't know but would find out. These are my friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       And whereas that's very true that it would cause problems with ecuador, kidnapping someone and extraordinary renditioning them is nothing new. I'm surpirsed they haven't poisoned his pizza or snipered him or exfiltrated him in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean if they really wanted him, they'd have him in a blackops site is my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats why I conclude there is something else.  Some extraordinary leverage he has on them as a dead man switch, or he's a hangout (I am on the fence on this---he was forced to grow up in a weird cult as a kid by iirc his stepfather or moms new lover or something... and I'm sure it screwed him up, made him want to lash out about it....to the types of people who create these cults...and yes they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       create the cults, usually as illegal human experimentation)
