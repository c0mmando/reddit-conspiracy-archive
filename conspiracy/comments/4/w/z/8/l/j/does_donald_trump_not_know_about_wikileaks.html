        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I spoke with a mechanic today and he kept saying &#39;donald trump is asking russia to release hillary&#39;s emails&#39;.  And I said, you know wikileaks has released most if not all in searchable form, right?  He just kind of looked at me like he didn&#39;t hear me.</p>

<p>Am I missing something?  Maybe I&#39;m turned around.  Are there even more emails that haven&#39;t been released by wikileaks that russia is hanging on to or does trump not know about wikileaks?</p>

<p>If the latter, then it&#39;s clear there&#39;s a neocon news filter and a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> news filter.  And everyone but <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is trapped in a neocon bubble where they are incapable of finding their ways to hillary&#39;s emails, that have already been released for a while now.</p>

<p>Or is it that wikileaks&#39; emails just aren&#39;t trustworthy or something?</p>

<p>Please let me know how I&#39;m all turned around. Thanks.</p>

<p>bonus question is assange a russian agent and that&#39;s why they can&#39;t kidnap him so easily by dropping blackop mercs into an ecuadorean embassy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t Trump against Wikileaks? I seem to recall Trump calling Assange (and Snowden) traitors who should be tortured. Perhaps he doesn&#39;t think Wikileaks would appeal to the people he sees as his current followers. </p>

<p>Anyway, Trump doesn&#39;t seem to have a consistent policy. He goes back and forth on issues, and says whatever he feels like at the moment, contradicting himself, perhaps adjusting his message slightly for each specific crowd he&#39;s talking to, etc. The only predictable thing about him is his tendency to lie and be inconsistent. But hey, at least he&#39;s &quot;anti establishment&quot; ... </p>

<p>Just don&#39;t tell any of his ignorant supporters that.  They still think he&#39;s got their best interest in mind.  In reality he just wants to give himself and other wealthy people massive tax cuts like George Bush did and wreck our economy.</p>

<p>318,000,000 * .628 * .39 * 26695 = 2.0791283e+12 = 2,079,128,300,000 or 2.079T per year to IRS if everyone is average and honest</p>

<p>make that 2 decades.  Hah, or at the rate of this country is going down the pooper, infinity</p>

<p>I realize this doesn&#39;t include corporate taxes, which are probably on average negative, which means they get money from the government....and then cost the government in terms of environmental cleanup.</p>

<p>ex: Putin, did you write to your congressperson and say, &quot;gee I would like it if at least 10 guys were trying to break into my computer and my iphone at all times, and I want to pay for it.  Because that will stop terrorism&quot;</p>

I don&#39;t care if my money goes to war or for a SAP who is leeching off the system. It&#39;s theft, and the government are the perfect thieves. Fuckin&#39; hell. Stockholm syndrome....

    <div class="md"><p>No I wasn&#39;t mean to them, I just said I honestly didn&#39;t know but would find out. These are my friends. </p>

<p>And whereas that&#39;s very true that it would cause problems with ecuador, kidnapping someone and extraordinary renditioning them is nothing new. I&#39;m surpirsed they haven&#39;t poisoned his pizza or snipered him or exfiltrated him in some way.  </p>

<p>I mean if they really wanted him, they&#39;d have him in a blackops site is my point.</p>

<p>Thats why I conclude there is something else.  Some extraordinary leverage he has on them as a dead man switch, or he&#39;s a hangout (I am on the fence on this---he was forced to grow up in a weird cult as a kid by iirc his stepfather or moms new lover or something... and I&#39;m sure it screwed him up, made him want to lash out about it....to the types of people who create these cults...and yes they <em>do</em> create the cults, usually as illegal human experimentation)</p>
