    <div class="md"><p>Neighbors don&#39;t have access to LFO / infrasound equipment.  First of all to make infrasound you need a massive speaker, like 3-5&#39; in diameter or larger, well bigger than a bass speaker.  I&#39;m sure you could have an alternative means, but it would require advanced geometry and some means of fabricating said advanced geometric form, something out of reach of even the most advanced cnc machinist or 3D printer guru.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In an exhaustive history of the rise of Hitler, it was written that Aldus Huxley&#39;s father worked for the Nazis with technology that can lower a crowd&#39;s discernment of factual data and greatly raise mindless emotionality and credulity. Before Hitler&#39;s speeches huge ultra low frequency bass speakers were installed at the rear of the auditorium. A 10 hertz hum was played, below hearing. Hysterical emotionality and lowered cognitive ability &quot;enhanced&quot; the message. It was proposed it was the single most effective method for galvanizing support of the Nazi party. They also introduced fluoride which further reduces critical thinking, a neurotoxin.</p>

<p>The introduction of the sub woofer to the home theatre surround systems, and its wide use in car stereo systems makes me sure that a &quot;plan&quot; is well along in its implementation. Movie makers have found, after outfitting their theaters with subs, that people will rave in awe over shit that wouldn&#39;t pass muster otherwise. (I dare you to watch an old episode of &quot;The Rifleman&quot; to see how far story telling has fallen compared to say today&#39;s Hawaii 50). Commercials and advertisers have a boost with product sell through by using the ominous physio-psychological frequencies.</p>

<p>Infrasonic decerebration is being held in reserve until such time as they need to <strong>control</strong> the masses during the next planned freakish 911. You don&#39;t even need one in your house to be effected, as you already know. Even your neighbors low rider sitting in his driveway can be utilized without power, remotely. </p>

<p>Infra sound even travels for miles under water so you can&#39;t even jump in a swimming pool to avoid its effects. Headphones won&#39;t work. Only advanced, high speed electronic DAC&#39;s can work if they are able to sample the incoming sound and phase it 180 degrees, effectively cancelling the effect. To do that you need a specialized circuit board multiple microphones and, believe it or not, your <strong>own</strong> sub speaker.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if pure willpower can overcome it, probably not. They can pulse frequencies that literally make you shit your pant or puke. Likely they will use it to administer pain and pleasure in a disgusting Skinnerian experiment and mass control. For now, I&#39;d say move away from that neighborhood, unfortunately  it only delays our eventual battle with this INSANE technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to also say reverse the phase 180 and it will cancel the frequency. A spectrum analyzer should be able to single the frequency out.  Once the frequency is identified - make your own frequency and crank it up. The frequency is comparable to a musical note as in A440. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you need a ULF microphone to detect and sample it in real time? What if they cycle between the anxiety, shit your pants, puke, and &quot;somebody is watching me&quot; as well as the 10 hertz of decerebration?

    <div class="md"><p>I may be wrong in this since I&#39;m no expert but I believe a microphone will pick up the frequency but the human ear will not. 
If you were using something like <a href="http://www.bluecataudio.com/Download/Products/">this</a> it will tell you what frequencies are present even if the frequencies are changing. 
I just googled the one in the link but I know there are rack mount units that pro sound men use to determine what frequencies ring in a given room so they can compensate on an eq on the way out of a sound system. Like I say I&#39;m not sure how low this particular analyzer will track but something like this should be relatively cheap these days as software for your computer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>10 hertz is pretty low. This software is probably in the range of human hearing, but I&#39;ll check and thanks. Perhaps we need something like a seismic wave detector, but then how do you convert that to frequency and then sound and then put it out of phase <em>in real time?</em> Think something like Bose Noise Cancelling headphones optimized for stuff you can&#39;t hear. Another question. Can one construct an anechoic chamber immune to super low frequencies?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have a source for 10Hz thing?  I wouldn&#39;t ask you to dig for no reason and I&#39;m not doubting you.  I ask because I did a post about the duga radar tower inducing a 10Hz EM wave (not sound) off our electrical grid  (&#39;the russian woodpecker&#39;), a conclusion deduced by intelligence physics researcher bob beck in the 80s.  &quot;reconstructing heterodynes&quot; he said, of a shortwave signal that was a harmonic of 50hz, meaning that 60Hz power grid would &#39;re-emit&#39; a 10Hz standing wave due to the differential of 60-50 and that the whole east coast US was affected, thereby &#39;weaponizing&#39; our entire electrical grid</p>

<p>Nice eh?</p>

<p>It ceased from chernobyl&#39;s meltdown (tower was adjacent AND responsible for the meltdown) until I believe 2013, when it resumed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stay in different hotels for a few days, and pay in cash only.  If they require a credit card, go to CVS and get a prepaid credit card (anonymous credit card) and use that.  If they don&#39;t accept tell them you have a non criminal reason to seek a temporary political asylum in their hotel, if they dont&#39; understand go to another hotel.  You could also look for &#39;love hotels&#39; in shitty areas where it&#39;s pay by the hour.  Tell them you want the whole night and you need it for sleep and not for sex.  If you are unaccompanied by a hooker they will get this implicitly.  These kinds of clerks you can bribe but only if you get desperate.</p>

<p>If the sound is not present in the hotel, then you&#39;ll have verified it&#39;s not psychological.  Many here in this sub immediately think you are a schizophrenic, so if you can verify that it doesn&#39;t happen elsewhere.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t actually stop infrasound as it penetrates anything but a thick concrete wall or several feet of earth, you go to a business extended suite hotel and stay there and &#39;wait it out&#39;; or you could move; or you could hire a private detective to figure out the source, or find a security person who deals with these kinds of TI attacks and will take your case seriously.  There are meters that can detect infrasound and other forms of attacks like microwaves, LFO radio waves (biological electromagentic low frequency waves like the 10HZ wave that&#39;s attacking us on the east coast all the time due to the now-resumed duga towers in russia)</p>

<p>I had believed that I had been attacked for a while by such a device (LFO) but it has ceased and I believe I ruled out attack.  I&#39;ve settled on these mid-night attacks to be a faulty component of my central heating unit that was causing a harmonic vibration to &#39;build up&#39; in my bedroom only, giving off sudden spikes.  The construction and layout of my place makes my room &#39;like a drum&#39; and the hvac is right above it, so literally I get such strong vibrations it wakes me up with a feeling that my whole body is giving off very strong vibrations....people had all sorts of other non-attack theories like symptoms of oobe&#39;s to parkinsons&#39; disease to .... you name it.  It was the hvac.</p>

<p>i&#39;m NOT saying that&#39;s your case, but it was mine and quite frankly, it scared the shit out of me because it would also put out some weird energy generally that would cause my inner ear to go crazy; i believe it was giving off ultrasonic sounds with that bad bearing also, metal to metal grating, it would cause my inner ear to twitch -- myoclonus exhibiting these kinds of sporadic inner ear pops sounds.  I of course thought it was anything from low pressure systems coming to sun activity, to wind over topographical features to directed energy attacks.  </p>

<p>These still happen, randomly, and I believe are associated with several things namely electrical equipment coming on (I can hear &#39;coils&#39;, &#39;solenoids&#39; and &#39;starters&#39;, so magnetic activity is not off the mark)</p>

<p>I hope some of this is helpful.  Good luck man.  You are probably not crazy so don&#39;t listen to any unsolicited diagnoses on this sub.  They LOVE to tell you that you&#39;re nuts.</p>
