       I mean, I can't figure out if this is a wager made between some powerful people to see who can lose this election, or if it's an experiment to see what it would take to get America to vote third party, but something is fishy here. It's like, whenever one of the candidates is in the news for something terrible (like, I don't know, subverting the democratic process) the other comes up with something equally bad/worse. Whenever you think "ok, there is no way in my right mind I can support a candidate like that, I'll have to support the other", the other one gives you a damned good reason not to vote for them either.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, here is my real conspiracy theory around this:
      </p>
      <p>
       I think something REALLY bad is going to happen between 2016 and 2020. I think it's going to happen no matter who is in power, and I think the power brokers of the USA know about it. Because of that, both parties are trying desperately to NOT be in power at the time, because they know the American people will blame the person at the top and vote them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is it? More than likely something impacting financial markets (since people believe the president to have more power there than he/she does). Maybe it's a shortage, or unemployment related to automation (automated cars for example), but it's something big enough that it will be very disruptive, and very bad. Once it happens, the American people will associate the event with the party in charge, and vote to replace both president and congress with the other party (and as long as the world gets a LITTLE bit better, the other party wins.

       I see this as Hillary's electoral charade. She's proven able to deflect attacks and keep the Clinton graveyard from generating any fuss on MSM. She's forged alliances and has the trust of the major players to sail the ship to their preferred route. So she pays or blackmails Trump to make fun of the GOP's base ruges, the racism and xenophobia, and end up as the ugly candidate that will keep spouting verbal diarrhea and nonsense so he remains the 'bad' choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       General public will keep venerating Hillary no matter what leaks and reports surface. For it, she's not a 'bad actor' at all. Plus, she's going to
       <em>
        make history...
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       What I fear is actual global armed conflict as the Hillary administration warms up. Would they be so crazy as to keep poking Putin? As long as the weapons contracts get paid, I bet they will.

       Seriously. If the republican choice was even remotely palatable to mainstream dems or Bernie or bust-types, Hillary wouldn't have a chance. So obviously they needed to choose someone that's semi-believable as a conservative, isn't afraid to "tell it like it is" and appeal to (entertain) the common denominator, but is ultimately pretty crazy. Like president-in-the-movie-Idiocracy crazy. There's no way enough Bernie people are going to be able to bring themselves to make a 180 and vote Trump.

       It's rather amazing the general populace is so ignorant and misinformed. Then again we have people like you, pushing the false narrative. Most people I know are going to vote for Trump. Some people don't like him because of the way the media portrays him. Very few "can't stand" him.

       Anyone who's paying attention knows your lying. What you're describing is the media intentionally portraying him that way. Every thing you mentioned, if you watch what he says in context, you know the media is lying.

      <p>
       Remember the 7-11 "gaffe"? Yeah that's right, he was referring to fire station 7-1-1, which is OBVIOUS if you watch his actual speech but the media took it out of context and tried to make him look like he was talking about 9/11. No one who is honest would run with a story like that.

       Most of the people I know are voting for Hillary and can't stand Trump, because I'm mostly friends with liberals.  That's why anecdotal evidence is bad for things like elections in large diverse countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the primaries Trump got 14 million votes and Hillary got 17 million, and that was with a record high turnout for Republicans and not great turnout for Democrats.  So based purely on the actual votes so far Hillary has more supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also pretty much every poll throughout the campaign.  He's been up by a bit a few times, but not often and not by much.

       I know a few people indirectly who will vote for Hillary. They are ignorant people who don't even understand the timeline of events for Benghazi, and certainly no idea or concern as to what the U.S. was doing there. They're the willfully ignorant type.

       Trump is actually an extremely good candidate.  "US Presidential Election" has been a reality TV show for about the last three decades.  Trump is the first candidate to fully embrace that reality and play solely to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for example saying ridiculous shit and trolling the media is a means of getting the news stations to talk about him all the time.  Saying I'll ban Muslims from entering the country is preemptively planting an idea in people's heads, so that whenever a terrorist attack happens in Europe or wherever they'll think Trump is the safety candidate without even consciously realizing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's using literal mind control techniques, hypnotizing all of us.  I understand there is plenty of not good about that, but in terms of a candidate who is playing to win, he's a good one.

       Allow me to take you one step behind your theory and reveal that the election itself a false reality of the truest form. The people you are choosing between don't make a difference. They are just the brand name behind only one continuous agenda. Neither party will change anything for the betterment of people.
       <strong>
        Everything
       </strong>
       that allowed these candidates to even get to the position they're in has undeniably allowed them to attain wealth, escape criminal justice, gain exposure to the mainstream media, and allow the masses to start arguments about who's "party" system is better for the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politics have always been divide and conquer since day one of our governing. They won't teach it to you, but government was put in place to control the people by splitting them in half.

       You are standing on the edge of a very high cliff.
Your left leg is Hillary.
Your right leg is Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       In one step forward and over the edge, which leg would you like to lead with?
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter which you choose, the same result will occur.

       Hillary is terrible, and she wants to win and has to have the public behind her when she does it, so they had to find someone even worse to make her look good. Trump is the perfect solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary will win, but it is right it does not matter exactly who is president because the military-industrial complex and the biggest banks have taken over our government, and the president has been a figurehead since the day JFK got shot for trying to withdraw from Vietnam and for beginning to expose these people in his speeches.

       It's a sad, sad, sad situation. We are on a train going down the tracks at 100 miles an hour, and this is the sub where we look down the tracks and realize we're headed off a cliff. We can try and find the brake, but most people are too busy looking out the window.

       Shadow banking, 300 trillion of derivatives, governments buying worthless paper so that the 1% rich don't lose a penny. Rothschild's BIS standing buy with "special drawing rights" to take over for the petrodollar, which will fail when people demand convertibility with gold backing, which, surprise, Rothschild has a plan for that too. They will decimate the dollar but convert your mortgage to the new money (again so the 1% can't lose a penny) and you

       so they take your house. Paper servers, repo-men, will within weeks just turn into assassination squads. Too late the neighbors will organize, be set-up by FBI informers, they too will be killed.

      <p>
       A year later the population of the former United States will be 80 million. A year after that after the bodies stop smelling, there will be 50 million, mostly Mexican and Muslim. The 1% will happily float over the land in gaily painted dirigibles and gather in compounds for cocktail, drug, and sex parties. Fashion will be the talk of the town.
