        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I mean, I can&#39;t figure out if this is a wager made between some powerful people to see who can lose this election, or if it&#39;s an experiment to see what it would take to get America to vote third party, but something is fishy here. It&#39;s like, whenever one of the candidates is in the news for something terrible (like, I don&#39;t know, subverting the democratic process) the other comes up with something equally bad/worse. Whenever you think &quot;ok, there is no way in my right mind I can support a candidate like that, I&#39;ll have to support the other&quot;, the other one gives you a damned good reason not to vote for them either. </p>

<p>So, here is my real conspiracy theory around this:</p>

<p>I think something REALLY bad is going to happen between 2016 and 2020. I think it&#39;s going to happen no matter who is in power, and I think the power brokers of the USA know about it. Because of that, both parties are trying desperately to NOT be in power at the time, because they know the American people will blame the person at the top and vote them out.</p>

<p>So what is it? More than likely something impacting financial markets (since people believe the president to have more power there than he/she does). Maybe it&#39;s a shortage, or unemployment related to automation (automated cars for example), but it&#39;s something big enough that it will be very disruptive, and very bad. Once it happens, the American people will associate the event with the party in charge, and vote to replace both president and congress with the other party (and as long as the world gets a LITTLE bit better, the other party wins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see this as Hillary&#39;s electoral charade. She&#39;s proven able to deflect attacks and keep the Clinton graveyard from generating any fuss on MSM. She&#39;s forged alliances and has the trust of the major players to sail the ship to their preferred route. So she pays or blackmails Trump to make fun of the GOP&#39;s base ruges, the racism and xenophobia, and end up as the ugly candidate that will keep spouting verbal diarrhea and nonsense so he remains the &#39;bad&#39; choice.</p>

<p>General public will keep venerating Hillary no matter what leaks and reports surface. For it, she&#39;s not a &#39;bad actor&#39; at all. Plus, she&#39;s going to <em>make history...</em> </p>

<p>What I fear is actual global armed conflict as the Hillary administration warms up. Would they be so crazy as to keep poking Putin? As long as the weapons contracts get paid, I bet they will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously. If the republican choice was even remotely palatable to mainstream dems or Bernie or bust-types, Hillary wouldn&#39;t have a chance. So obviously they needed to choose someone that&#39;s semi-believable as a conservative, isn&#39;t afraid to &quot;tell it like it is&quot; and appeal to (entertain) the common denominator, but is ultimately pretty crazy. Like president-in-the-movie-Idiocracy crazy. There&#39;s no way enough Bernie people are going to be able to bring themselves to make a 180 and vote Trump.</p>

<p>November will go exactly as planned. </p>

<p>You mean the media portraying him as a guy who just makes shit up as he goes along, insults parents of fallen soldiers, doesn&#39;t realize that Russia <em>already</em> has occupied part of Ukraine, can&#39;t specify how anything is going to be great again, doesn&#39;t understand why using nukes is a bad idea, and presumably would get jobs back  from China by manipulating America&#39;s currency even <em>more</em> than China does theirs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is actually an extremely good candidate.  &quot;US Presidential Election&quot; has been a reality TV show for about the last three decades.  Trump is the first candidate to fully embrace that reality and play solely to win.  </p>

<p>So for example saying ridiculous shit and trolling the media is a means of getting the news stations to talk about him all the time.  Saying I&#39;ll ban Muslims from entering the country is preemptively planting an idea in people&#39;s heads, so that whenever a terrorist attack happens in Europe or wherever they&#39;ll think Trump is the safety candidate without even consciously realizing it.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s using literal mind control techniques, hypnotizing all of us.  I understand there is plenty of not good about that, but in terms of a candidate who is playing to win, he&#39;s a good one.  </p>

<p>Allow me to take you one step behind your theory and reveal that the election itself a false reality of the truest form. The people you are choosing between don&#39;t make a difference. They are just the brand name behind only one continuous agenda. Neither party will change anything for the betterment of people. <strong>Everything</strong> that allowed these candidates to even get to the position they&#39;re in has undeniably allowed them to attain wealth, escape criminal justice, gain exposure to the mainstream media, and allow the masses to start arguments about who&#39;s &quot;party&quot; system is better for the nation. </p>

<p>Politics have always been divide and conquer since day one of our governing. They won&#39;t teach it to you, but government was put in place to control the people by splitting them in half.</p>

<p>You are standing on the edge of a very high cliff.
