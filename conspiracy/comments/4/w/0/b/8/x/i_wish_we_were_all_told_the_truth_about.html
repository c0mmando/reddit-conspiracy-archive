    <div class="md"><p>Gods of Eden notes:</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t the custodians make robots or lesser creatures without spirits instead of humans? All the cruelty and suffering leads me to think that there&#39;s another reason. Maybe robots are technology from a different group of gods?</p>

<p>So we were created by a group of assholes that look like us but are superior and have high technology (custodians), and using lies and instigator tactics have kept us down with war and pointless conflict. Because we&#39;re useful as slaves and nothing more. And a few throughout time in the brotherhood have been good people, the asshole custodians remain in total control.</p>

<p>Is human suffering some kind of power source?</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s information.  If it&#39;s a quick, two sentence power point that &quot;proves everything&quot; that people are looking for, then they&#39;re going to be sorely disappointed by me.  If it&#39;s a large amount of evidence siting a <em>lot</em> of sources that strongly indicate that things are by no means how TPTB and the MSM tell us they are, then I have that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m somewhat familiar w/Montauk.  Looked into it a bit a few years back...Stewart Swerdlow&#39;s a name that comes to mind.</p>

<p>Just noticed the ninja edit you made in your previous post.  I remember that&#39;s the video I saw quite a few years back.</p>

<p>Though the stuff in the book is not related directly to any of the stuff in the video, it at least covers the same concept of what the MSM says vs what&#39;s <em>really</em> going on behind the scenes...and how there&#39;s an absolutely MASSIVE difference between those two things.</p>

<p>This is a truly, truly magical world and universe we live in, but we&#39;ve had a SUPER powerful cover pulled over our eyes that makes us think that things are just &quot;normal&quot; and superficial and third dimensional and based only on our five limited senses and that&#39;s it/nothing else.  Very little could be further from the truth.</p>

The main two sources I&#39;ve been listening to are Preston Nichols and Al Bielek (and to a lesser extent, Duncan Cameron.)  To be honest, Swerdlow give me a weird vibe.  (edit: Oh right, he was in the <em>Montauk Chronicles</em> docu-drama, not these recordings from the 90s.  The VHS transfers are a far better source of info.)</p>

<p>That last paragraph of yours sums it all up, I just needed someone as left-brained as I am to get me to see it.  Thanks, Preston, you wacky genius.  If you&#39;ve got 40 minutes, he give a good overview of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbwvqVh-qWE">how he sees spacetime in this interview.</a></p>

<p>Fair enough.  Swerdlow must have been in some other talk I saw.  And honestly, he gives me a very strange vibe as well.  I listen(ed) to him, but I only did so with the perspective of taking in &quot;just another perspective&quot;.  I didn&#39;t and don&#39;t consider too much of anything he&#39;s had to say as any sort of &quot;definitive&quot; version of anything really.  Not saying that <em>everything</em> he&#39;s said is b.s.  No.  Absolutely not as a matter of fact.  I&#39;m sure some of what he&#39;s said is valid/decent enough.  However, I am indeed a bit circumspect of him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Preston...wacky genius.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  I found him pretty funny and quirky, and he didn&#39;t strike me as someone who was just making shit up just to troll or whatever.  He seemed like he was just recalling what he saw and experienced - giant reptilians and all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many psychopaths run the world and its means of operation?</p>

<p>The truth is unsettling, depending on context and kind.</p>

<p>Surmising, if the answer would be many, as to psychopathic individuals, and they&#39;ve risen to the top, then probably varying degrees of social chaos and collapse in the interim en masse, generating forms of panic, anxiety, fear enacted and felt broadly. There would also be anger (why the degree of control and suppression? Why the corruption, and why were those involved allowed to continue? Why weren&#39;t we told ETs and &#39;God&#39; - insert whatever is understood by this here - are real? Why have we been duped and manipulated? and so on). Governments and institutions like the military moving to contingency plans, various violent conflicts between differing factions of society taking place, like gangs for instance, armed and seeking resources. While there would probably also arise an equalisation of people after seeing through the falsity of social stratification, and various communities, ie., religious and otherwise, reorganising and gathering around commonalities of need, like food sourcing, resource distribution etc. </p>

<p>The economy as it functions now would falter and institutions supporting it would likely fall apart, however I suppose some aspects of it would continue to function. At a local scale, depending on localised effect, there would probably be a resurgence of bartering systems. </p>

<p>The sciences would be in varying degrees of confusion and reassessment (due to ET appearance and alterations of commonly held notions of human history, consciousness and so on, or due to something humans tend to call God becoming common knowledge as an actual something), the present dominant paradigms being made obsolete overnight and absolved towards reassessment. </p>

<p>Much death and increased illness would rapidly develop (if the economy stalls or falters, and distribution systems are effected, then medicine that people use to maintain health, physical and mental, would be effected), overt disturbance of emotion and acting out becoming a common feature of daily encounters. Hospitals and support services would struggle to cope.</p>

<p>Would the internet continue to function? Would social media, and the media in general, continue? I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>I imagine there would be an unprecedented increase in fear as wide populace state of being and perception, and various unpredictable results occurring thereof, but also concurrently, an increase in compassion, love, sharing, lessening of prejudices, as commonalities of need and circumstance dissolve boundaries sustained by the previous distancing and &#39;othering&#39; structures of social and community existence. Values such as compassion, nurturing, sharing, co-operation and the centrality of relationship and interconnectedness would likely become very important if not central to social organisation, ie. love and oneness, in contrast to competition, profit, exploitation, manipulation, partisanship, ideology as requiring force to impose, power as strength, and so on.Notions of what constitutes leadership would change. The real strength would be found through love, community, pooling of knowledges and resources. Systems that valued consultation and shared community processes of dialogue and addressing issues would become central and important, as &#39;lights&#39; on a darkened and obscured horizon of social cohesion.</p>

<p>All of this is contingent on everything falling apart in the advent of an occurrence such as you&#39;ve envisaged OP, but I&#39;m not sure it would be as totally disorienting as I&#39;ve laid out, maybe more localised effects? Perhaps it would partly be like the scenario played out in the series &#39;The leftovers&#39;? (strained, and strange, but not a total collapse)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m somewhat familiar w/Montauk.  Looked into it a bit a few years back...Stewart Swerdlow&#39;s a name that comes to mind.</p>

<p>Just noticed the ninja edit you made in your previous post.  I remember that&#39;s the video I saw quite a few years back.</p>

<p>Though the stuff in the book is not related directly to any of the stuff in the video, it at least covers the same concept of what the MSM says vs what&#39;s <em>really</em> going on behind the scenes...and how there&#39;s an absolutely MASSIVE difference between those two things.</p>

<p>This is a truly, truly magical world and universe we live in, but we&#39;ve had a SUPER powerful cover pulled over our eyes that makes us think that things are just &quot;normal&quot; and superficial and third dimensional and based only on our five limited senses and that&#39;s it/nothing else.  Very little could be further from the truth.</p>
