       9/11 and when I discovered all the meta data on global warming was 'deleted accidentally' by the university that kept the records while they were updating to electronic files.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I don't believe in climate change, I just thought it was crazy that all the data would be nonexistent.

       Honestly, with the whole 28 pages thing, we were CLEARLY fed bullshit from the get go. Keep digging around and have an open mind. There is a lot of crap, but there is also stuff that will make you question everything.

       It's bizarre to me because I was five or so when it occurred, so naturally I didn't comprehend what all was happening. As I grew older, I dismissed the theory that it was an inside job as lunacy, then after looking into it was shocked.

       I'm glad to hear (read?) this. For me, that event shaped some much of who I was and what I would become. I would suggest looking into the 2000 election if you want your mind blown open.

       The JFK assassination. Even though I was not born, as soon as I could comprehend what happened, the whole series of events got me thinking about a conspiracy taking place. Now that I am older and have opened my eyes, all the conspiracy theories have a certain amount of weight to them. When 9/11 happened I knew something was not right, and 9/11 demonstrated to me how deep the rabbit hole goes. Everything is controlled by the wealthy and what we are taught and what we believe is a fabricated fairy tale. Everything.

       Three events spring to mind. When I was about 8 or younger I watched a movie with my older cousins called
       <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097100/">
        Communion
       </a>
       . That inspired me to learn more about the universe and opened me up to the idea that we may not be alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       My grandfather gave me a book when I was about 12 called
       <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zolars-Encyclopedia-Ancient-Forbidden-Knowledge/dp/0139840893">
        "Zolar's Encyclopedia Of Ancient And Forbidden Knowledge"
       </a>
       . Which piqued my interest in the occult, secret societies and 'alternative' religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 occurred when I was a young teen. I watched TV all day and even then, as it was unfolding in front of my eyes, I didn't believe what I was being told by the media. One thing that sticks out - was the mention of a car bomb exploding at the state dept. on 9/11. It was mentioned a few times through out the day. Then basically never mentioned again - if it wasn't for a few news archives from that date, I probably would've concluded that I was hallucinating.

       I had never followed an election very close before Bernie ran. I couldn't believe what was going on. But after 4 months in this sub I get it. Everything is a lie.

       I too hadn't ever followed an election until this year (I'm 19), and I completely agree, the DNC emails should've been given much more coverage and there should've been far more consequences.

       When I was at a demonstration in France long ago, there were wounded and at least one death. The next day I bought about 10 newspapers and their explanations for some irregularities I noticed went from weird to contradictory.

       I think it was 9/11 that got me into it, probably back in 2007. Around 2002 I kept hearing that the CIA had helped fund Al Quaeda at some point, but I was still a bit young to care. Things have gotten so strange since then.

       Less than a year ago I heard the guys on morning talk radio laughing at "9/11 conspiracy theories" and thought, "wow, there must have been concrete evidence that I haven't heard of because I've been busy living my life, that's interesting I should read up on it."
      </p>
      <p>
       After finding no such evidence, and a few sleepless nights later, I felt my eyes
       <em>
        begin

       to open.

       On my thirteenth birthday a really cool person gave me two books: On the Road (Kerouac) and Brave New World. I preferred Kerouac so much more than Huxley. So I took drugs and enjoyed my youth. I spent my 21st birthday at the largest protest in human history (in Melbourne, S11). I got off drugs after that. On my 22nd birthday, I woke up to the rolling feed: sounds, explosions and a cloud of debris straight out of Revelations. I was audited at work that day too. Shitty day for everyone, the personification of physics included. Didn't make sense then, doesn't make sense now. But it makes oh so much money. Your money's money is all that money.

       It sounds so mundane, but for me it was government regulation of industries.  At work I was researching regulatory requirements for software that deals with health information.  In the course of my research it became clear to me that agencies such as the FDA and the EPA are more like PR fronts for the large players in each industry rather than being there to protect the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked at the historical timeline of a few substances (lead, asbestos, DDT, etc), seeing how they were used, when they were known to be harmful, the lobbying to maintain the status quo, the PR campaigns to keep the public misinformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early on I read 'Propaganda' by Bernays.  Reading about the techniques of creating public opinion made me realize that I could not simply take as truth the perceived consensus of the people around me.  I needed to reconsider a whole lot of ideas that I had previously dismissed and actively seek out ideas I had not yet been exposed to.
