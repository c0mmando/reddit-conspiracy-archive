Their line is part overhead, part underground. My own line is underground all the way and I&#39;ve never had problems with static.</p>

Sounds like a bad splice or line to me. Idk why the tech would check outside only but if he&#39;s right and everything is ok it outside it is probably a problem between the outside box to your inside phones.</p>

<p>Sometimes with corrosion the problem will be intermittent, explaining any clear calls.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had techs give the house and to the neighbors and to the street the OK 7 times.  It&#39;s clear that they are totally unaware of what&#39;s going on; and that when <em>they test it</em> their equipment gives an all-clear.  I dont&#39; think they are lying to me.  Nearly every tech has been super nice and friendly.  They are not the issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn i missed the part about lighting, i would say if they have been there multiple times and can&#39;t find anything wrong it is time to replace the lines. Lightning can damage anywhere it goes through and a lot of times it will be shorting under the jacket and not visible. This is at&amp;t uverse? I thought they had cable modems not dsl. 
I dont know your internet speeds but dsl through the phone lines is not really reliable anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who?  the NSA?   I wrote the list of confirmed conspiracies and 75% of those are CIA.  And I also made an <strong><em>exhaustive</em></strong> list of NSA mass surveillance news from 2010.  As a &quot;list solely of links&quot;...it&#39;s 15 pages.  FIFTEEN.  Think about that for a few seconds.  Let it sink in.</p>

<p>I basically pointed out that AT&amp;T is essentially the NSA; that google is essentially CIA; and the Facebook is working with nsa and fbi.  The most egregious company of all, though is AT&amp;T and their colocation facilities (discovered by room 641a on folsom in SF) that were discovered in the early 2000&#39;s I believe and were the basis of ongoing legal battles with the EFF suggest that that AT&amp;T and NSA are ultimately one company: the boundaries between public and private sphere are nonexistent post 911, because of continuity of government.  These are all things that CIA/NSA and the intelligence community generally doesn&#39;t like people talking about, so yeah, I believe I&#39;d be a target, </p>

<p>although I&#39;m not doing anything except exercising free speech; I&#39;m not inciting any crimes against the gov; and I&#39;m not giving anyone any &quot;new&quot; information.  I&#39;m a secondary consumer of information, I&#39;m never a primary source.</p>

<p>Basically I&#39;m acting as an unpaid journalist putting out decent quality material that is &#39;distilled&#39; from many sources.  People generally think it&#39;s pretty good here, judging from their comments</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m gang stalked.  I&#39;ve seen no gang.  I do however see a bunch of fucking AT&amp;T vans all over this area and YET....my internet goes out all the time (well the landline does too...static and such)</p>

<p>It&#39;s worthy to note, ever since I moved here 3.5 yrs ago that AT&amp;T&#39;s service has been bad, their landline has ALWAYS had noise (for my neighbors also, but they still get internet).  Their cell towers disappeared after I moved here (within 6 months), so cell is not an option.</p>

<p>I talked to AT&amp;T about the situation with an appeal to higher level people at AT&amp;T.  I offered them this:</p>

<p>To put a cell tower on my property for FREE x Forever.  I would expect nothing in exchange.  Nothing.  </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t take it.  That&#39;s how I know they are a bad company.  Average yearly lease is $45,000...you can live on hosting a tower in a real way.  If you have much property, you have a lot of leases.  So don&#39;t ever feel bad about farmers, they are getting subsidies from EVERYONE.</p>

<p>I complained to FCC about the situation after they didn&#39;t take it, AT&amp;T sent  FCC their response saying &#39;they would evaluate my offer&#39; (which they didn&#39;t, it was a &#39;silent no&#39;, and an inability for me to follow up with them because they would not return my 5 phone calls about it).  They lied to the FCC about the cell coverage by being very misleading...they said I &#39;would be able to get coverage at the street&#39;.. The street is 1/5 of a mile away.  Also, it&#39;s wrong.  There is no coverage at the street.  </p>

<p>UPS people complain all the time that they can&#39;t reach us from the street.  Ther&#39;es a difference between &#39;signal strength&#39; on the phone and the ability to call.  We can see 1 bar, but no one can call from anywhere on the &#39;street&#39; because &quot;economic downturn caused AT&amp;T to no renew their leases in this area&quot;</p>

<p>So...it&#39;s basically just AT&amp;T being pissed at me for making them an unbelievable deal and then when they wouldn&#39;t even fix my internet, complaining about them to the FCC.  </p>

<p>This is basically a power move from AT&amp;T.  They are essentially the worst company on the planet and if i had a nuclear bomb I&#39;d blow up their board members before I wasted it on like poor ole russia or Iran or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>complaining about them to the FCC. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s generally a huge waste of time.</p>

<p>Remember Mitt Romney? I was in the position of working for a company that had been targeted by his bastards. Now, ISPs offering wireless services, or anyone with a licensed point-to-point link has to pay the FCC for that license. We&#39;re talking million dollar licenses to be able to send data over certain radio frequencies.</p>

<p>So I discovered a &#39;deal&#39; where the person in charge of our licensing was being offered a job with a competitor. He left the information out, in such a way, that I was able to leak it to my superiors without repercussion. In the meeting, everyone was freaked, especially since renewal for that license was in 2 days.</p>

<p>So... when renewal comes up, we renew, everyone celebrates. The potential mole hasn&#39;t been at work all week, since the discovery... and then our link gets saturated... mid day. All of our customers start going down, one after the other. It turns out, the renewal was made in the name of our competitor, but we paid for it (The Mole was actually still working on this while he was MIA.) So our competitor is on our licensed frequency...</p>

<p>What happened next is horrifying if you can imagine how things could have turned out. It&#39;s a good example of how humans behave when they feel entirely justified in some action.</p>

<p>So we begin &quot;selectively targeting high value communications arrays by electronic bombardment.&quot; If we can&#39;t play ball, no one can play ball. Banks are going offline, defaulting to off-site backup locations, transactions are failing, no one can get online...</p>

<p>A hasty agreement was reached... that ended in my side going bankrupt (They kept the mole employed for another 2 months... so yeah...)</p>

<p>So I called the FCC and explained the situation to them... Maybe I misdialed a few times in a row... but the male latino that picked up the phone 3 times in a row, finally gave a cordial &quot;Fuck you!&quot; and hang up I have come to expect.</p>

<p>I tried for 8 months to get someone to hear my complaint, that an underhanded business practice had likely killed an ISP because of, what appeared to be, fraud. Never did they want any evidence of wrong doing, or any kind of statement, just kill the call. Always wanted my name (Yeah...) but never wanted any details about the businesses affected.</p>

<p>&quot;I noticed someone operating a pirate radio station in my neigh...&quot;</p>

<p>[Dialtone...]</p>

<p>&quot;... guess I&#39;ll call back.&quot;</p>

<p>The government overflows with incompetence, but I think there was conspiracy involved in what I witnessed.</p>

<p>In my case it was various public WiFi spots.  Doesn&#39;t seem to matter.  Continued off and on for a week or so, apparently in response to my having posted something particularly important.</p>

<p>&#39;Cause Stalking&#39; / &#39;Gang Stalking&#39; / &#39;Organized Stalking&#39; / &#39;Targetted Individuals&#39; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB-MlhPmXqk">does happen</a>.  Typically the objective is to intimidate or otherwise psychologically &#39;wow&#39; you into docility.  It doesn&#39;t typically last long, it&#39;s expensive for someone to do for a prolonged period of time and they have to assess that you&#39;re worth the money, time investment and manpower.  Additionally, purchasing a gun in response has been known to cut the duration short.</p>

<p>Tele-stalking as you&#39;re describing is cheaper and less manpower-intensive.  Evidently they didn&#39;t assess that your case is worth putting together a local crew to harass.  It should pass quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re gonna get caught.  And when they do it&#39;s going to cost them immeasurably. Because when I prove it with a camera/videocapture, people will see me pinging and see it stop the moment I try to do something.  This will then cause people to realize that--yes they do harass people and it can happen to YOU.  This will cause them to lose trust and credibility, which you can&#39;t even pay for.  It takes decades to get that back, if it ever comes back.</p>

<p>I hope they do continue this.  Because every time they do, they put themselves at risk being caught.  they are going tohave to realize I&#39;m running a videocapture and I&#39;m going to put up a youtube video if they keep this up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sort of thing is already known.  There are plenty of YouTube videos out there demonstrating that this happens.  The average citizen either doesn&#39;t know to look for it until it happens to them, refuses to accept that it does happen, refuses to do anything about it or just lacks an effective means of contributing to a solution.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to unnerve you, but it was just a few months ago that much of Reddit was investigating the murder of Fresno resident John Lang.  He was cause stalked for an extended period after discovering a lucrative profiteering racket being conducted by the Fresno PD.  Mr. Lang bought an expensive system of home surveillance, caught them out, and published on YouTube.  They managed to remotely deactivate his system whenever they liked.  The harassment and break-ins increased.  Eventually Mr. Lang feared for his life, contacted the public online in his area seeking their support... and in the process managed to correctly predict his own murder.  Forensics refused to find anything suspicious despite the bizarre evidence, and PD investigations were dropped.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to get these guys, I encourage you to consider working with <a href="http://nationallibertyalliance.org/">National Liberty Alliance</a> to restore our courts of law of, by, and for the People.  Without those, getting a conviction is very unlikely and They know it.  That lack of accountability to law is what enables these agendas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no bad line in the house.  There&#39;s only one line and one phone port and the box, and I&#39;ve had techs out here looking at it and giving the OK about 7 times now.  I shadowed one guy because he was super nice and was teaching me all about what they did.  We went the box that meets with my neighbors and said everything there was fine also; and that at the street it was fine.</p>

<p>The problem is between the street and the main junction box for the whole neighborhood. That&#39;s about 2.5mi away and it&#39;s like the pitfall game where there&#39;s a swamp, a jumping alligator, spikes, vines, monkeys and all sorts of other dangers for that line to cross over</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve fought with those evil bastards for two decades. I know for a fact that they will mess with you, because they know nothing will happen to them (It&#39;s our copper!)</p>

<p>Had a client disconnect 1 of 2 fax lines. When asked why, the client told the rep that they no longer needed that line. 4 months later, after both fax lines were added back to the account, they realized making changes costs them more money than paying extra (being extorted by) to AT&amp;T.</p>

<p>Had a client swap off of a T1 to cable, but they were keeping their voice T1. Can you imagine what happened with 3 months of planning and scheduled maintenance windows? 2 days before cutover, AT&amp;T sent a tech out at 8:47 pm, and disconnected both T1s, and removed the fiber feeding to the building... (That was our fiber, btw.) AT&amp;T then closed the ticket and stated that we would need to provide a cable to their demarc, so they could setup the new T1 service. That lawsuit is in it&#39;s 6th year...</p>

<p>Had a customer that was moving from a (Foreign telco provider AT&amp;T has never sold) digital phone system, to VOIP. Well, they weren&#39;t going to need any of their old phone lines either, so they tell AT&amp;T they are canceling service on a specific day. AT&amp;T shows up the Friday before cutover, cuts the lines at the pole (leaves them hanging, because Kwality) goes inside the customer premise (during business hours.) and removes the phone system, the 55 blocks, my ladder, and starts taking phones.</p>

<p>Monday morning comes around and everything related to a phone is gone. They even took the VOIP phones that were still in their boxes, and the test phones (which weren&#39;t the clients.)</p>

<p>They brought back the VOIP phones (left it in a box blocking the back door... yes, the fire door, and never said a word to anyone at the site.) but as far as I know, they kept the old digital system that wasn&#39;t theirs.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just &quot;Fuck everyone&quot; they are quite selective. In a city where I might have resided, a competing doctor&#39;s office (specialists in a field.) branched out and gave the finger to one of the city&#39;s &quot;Good ole boys.&quot; He was told to not compete with the &quot;Good ole boys&quot; in their city, but he had the money so he attempted to setup a competing practice.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been 4 1/2 years since the scheduled install date for internet service. It resides in a medical business park, the only location that &quot;can&#39;t seem to get&quot; internet service from any ISP servicing in the area. Surprisingly, they do everything via cellular service, and word of mouth. Their website still gets consistent updates, and they are in business, but you can&#39;t get any kind of service to the building because of local political corruption, which AT&amp;T assists in.</p>

<p>Ever since they were rammed by the fed, they have been infiltrated by the worst bastards on the planet. They are a consistent pain in the ass, and my go to for killing clients (for taking care of customers I want to never hear from again...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What kind of DSL modem do you have?</p>

<p>Can you log in to the web interface of that modem?</p>

<p>What are your current noise levels and other statistics on your DSL connection?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First the DSL interruptions, then I believe the line got struck by lightning on fri because I heard a loud pop and it fried my surge protector for the phone line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah... that&#39;s not good. Just had some work done because lightning struck equipment at the same site as a client&#39;s badge machine. The badge sensors and readers were all fried, but it acted fine. Lightning is amazing. I&#39;ve watched it make cheap Chinese FHSS P2P Omnis work at 180% capacity before they catch fire and become slag...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a visit from the AT&amp;T person saturday at 630pm and he reported no problems with the line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He walked out to the pole, disconnected your end, plugged in his tester, and it showed a green light. Done... He never tested the line going in because &quot;that&#39;s not our job.&quot; That line is your responsibility, and probably where the fault is. Also, based on your setup, you ARE using a DSL filter. I would bet a cup of coffee your DSL filter has been fried by lightning. Easy fix.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I were to make an educated guess, with your name on that video and your internet problems, I think we both know what&#39;s going on. The list everyone jokes about being on.... Well your on it. </p>

<p>What state are you in because the new video shows nuke strikes. </p>

<p>Perhaps they are stating your location will be where they will be dropping the bombs...</p>

<p>Just an idea.</p>

<p>If this is the case, consider yourself lucky you will die immediately.</p>
