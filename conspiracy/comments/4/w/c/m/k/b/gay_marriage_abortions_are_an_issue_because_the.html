    <div class="md"><p>I keep seeing ads that promotes gay and lesbian couples, interracial marriage and transexual &#39;acceptance&#39; all over the youtube front page and everytime I hear the radio playing at places I go to. I keep wonder who the fuck is paying for all of these ads. I don&#39;t even have a problem with anyones life choice, I assume everyone has control over themselfs. But a lot of fag SJW college kid act retarded and autistic from their over vaccinated fat acceptance diabetes riddled sugar fat bodies, act like even pointing out the obvious (RICH PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR ADS TO MAKE PEOPLE HATE EACH OTHER AND THEY DO IT BECAUSE IT WORKS.) assume &quot;ur raycist&quot; and literally start screaming psychopathically at you about some shit smeared swasitka on the bathroom stall...</p>

<p>Go to any college now a days and all you see is worthless degree chasing fat kids glued to their iphones playing pokemon go while racking up insane levels of debt for their shit classes that half of them will end up cheating in or failing anyways.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand the mind of these people, genuinely, I cannot concieve of concentrating such an inordinate amount of time and resources dedicated solely towards the bitterment and destruction of my fellow man merely because I had some fowl play enacted before me. It reeks if anti intellectualism (i.e. HURP DURP DEE DOOPITY BLOOP ITS NOT CENSORSHIP WERE JUST ADDING CONTEXT <strong>SAID THE MEN WHO WANT TO FUCK YOUR CHILDREN</strong>) and low life degraded psychosis of those who were the same as any other sick fuck but simply had the luck of born into the wealth and escaping real punishment, like how Epstien fucks kids and Trump and Clintons are both associates of him and nobody ever mentions it, nobody seems to care <strong>Our current two leading presidential candidates on mainstream media news stations are likely children rapers, and they are likely indebted to and handled by other even more degenerate children rapists.</strong></p>

<p>The same cabal group that pushes these agendas and false memes and campaign to destroy our education so they can hide in bunkers and eat GMO free organic until..... they die</p>

<p>Then we die.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s their end game, trillion-ares get bored and become so insane they literally just want to watch everyone else die. And it&#39;s because they feel like they want to die. Their minds make no sense. I am confused. This makes me angry so I wll start a coup againsta  foreign nations and use 10,000,000 year old hidden rape techonology to blow up thousands of children in a hellfire bombing because I like to masturbate to the film material. Babies melting to death gives me a woody. Don&#39;t worry my, my name is CIA, I live in USA, give me more children with to play.</p>

<p>I need to go vomit now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats what they do. indirect warfare. asymmetric psychology.</p>

<p>they are good at manipulating everyone. dont even know how they do it. tavistock and CFR shit i guess.</p>

<p>there are all sort of retards running wild in your everyday life. if you pay attention on it. ranging from deluded people who thinks you need their help, to plain fat ugly retards you mentioned.</p>

<p>probably a combination of vaccines and all the stuff they pour in processed packed food and our drink.</p>

<p>films, video games, news, reality shows, and whatever brainwash public figures spout making you believe in a cause. all of this helps you to detach from your reality.</p>

<p>everyone lives in their own heads. im not saying being an independent thinker is a bad thing. vice versa. but kids are naive and its very easy to mislead them.</p>

<p>im not saying the older you are the better either. some people remain backward no matter how much they age.</p>

<p>its just everything adds to the confusion. and its probably just to stall us. meanwhile they are preparing for the final solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m just breaking down mentally when I start posting things like that rant above. But it&#39;s nice to know I&#39;m apparently making sense to somebody. In my personal life there&#39;s about 2 people I can talk to about these things without being told to be quiet and go away or getting eye rolls. It wouldn&#39;t bother me so much if they would just at least give me a chance to present my evidence of argue my case but instead I get inundation and sighs, I&#39;d understand if I was talking about lizard people and when asked for proofs I could present nothing foundational. Everything I believe in when it comes to &quot;kooky conspiracies&quot; is documented on either video or on verified first party source papers e.g. statements from officials themselves talking about 9/11 and such. I really wish there wasn&#39;t so much gump from idiot shills like Alex Jones that just serve to make us all look insane. That&#39;s why Jones is pushing Trump so hard BTW, so that all of our theories become associated with &quot;insanity&quot;.</p>

<p>Even right now as I type on reddit I wonder what my reality is actually, when most of the input I&#39;ll receive mostly comes from automation and robots.  I went to the grocery store the other day and they had a computer kiosk that you could select the meat you wanted cut and it prints out the label and you hand it to the meat cutter. The kiosk was literally right next to the deli and the only real purpose it servers is to act as a social barrier between you and the person serving your food. You no longer have to say hello or interact with them, just hand them a piece of paper printed out from a computer. I don&#39;t understand the point of using all this technology to set up walls and separate us. I prefer to use the internet and smart phones to call and speak with people when they are too far to do otherwise, and to meet with other people and make real life friends. </p>

<p>Every time I grow into a part of a community I always become interested in the idea of having a real life meet up so I can actually physically interact with the people I&#39;m exchanging ideas with, including this sub (as disastrous as that would be) But then again maybe the only reason were able to divide and destroy so easiley is because we make it easy. It only takes and admin to press a ban button to completely destroy years of community building. without the physical we have no purpose being &quot;together&quot; digitally if we don&#39;t actuate anything. </p>

<p>Maybe if we all had to meet in person, it would be <em>very</em> easy to find out who&#39;s the real deal and who is just a troll party  crasher. Think about it, if we had a community meeting place for this sub, how long do you think the Shillary Trumpton bots would last for? Not more than a few hours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dont worry about it. most people are worse than you. they are just better at hidding it and pretending. not just that, they even tend to guard their ugliest secrets with their lives.</p>

<p>EDIT: its a fake world. most people are wagon jumpers and have no clue whats going on, TBH. theyre uninformed.</p>

<p>and its not just abortion and same sex marriage. but also gun control and many other topics.</p>

<p>maybe you should do that, meet up with them.</p>

Live your life, and don&#39;t try to live as someone else as well. We are not the true judgement, and we should not pretend to be. Don&#39;t live in gossip and idleness.

<p>If it were up to me those who couldn&#39;t afford children, but went ahead &amp; had sex, got pregnant because of a lack of self control would not receive welfare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right, and it is most certainly a &quot;distraction&quot; in that regard, but the slippery slope is real.</p>

<p>Once we&#39;re OK with excising the unborn we move on to debating selling off its body parts or engineering the child in the first place. Gay rights took us quickly from debating allowing them to get murdered on the battlefield as soldiers to marrying them in the house of God. We&#39;re seeing the same thing unfold with the transgender to transhumanism normalization.</p>

<p>With people following a <em>good</em> moral and ethical code many of these would be non-issues. They would not - could not - supersede real issues.</p>
