    <div class="md"><p>I guess this is as good a time as any to post this. I wrote it up on another site, but it’s relevant to this topic. It’s a response to an “article” (term used extremely loosely) about Trump in this regard, so please read that first to understand what’s being said. The most salient quote therefrom is the link thereto.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/C2Bvb">“Like any number of us raised in the late 20th century, I have spent my life perplexed about exactly how Hitler could have come to power in Germany.”</a></p>

<p>This person is supposed to have a fucking <em>degree</em>? She should get her money back and return her certification to the crackerjack box in which she found it. The author is perplexed because she is racist. She is racist against Germans. Probably against all people with white skin, as well. She has refused to place herself in the shoes of the 1930s German citizen, because she disdains them. She views them as both morally inferior and as material subhumans.</p>

<p>I have no love for socialism in any form. I disdain anything which rejects the free agency of man. Nor do I adhere to any sort of racialism, in which I favor or disfavor a person individually for their heritage. I focus on what they do. Though, the reality of demographic aggregates or statistics is simply that: the reality. And you’d be a fool to ignore them. But through this lens, racism is as clear as day to see when observing the attitudes of others, which is exactly what this is: anti-German, and now anti-white sentiment in its most pure form.</p>

<p>Once you do decide to place yourself in the shoes of a post-WWI German citizen and look at it from the inside, trying to figure out the emotions and fears of the day, it makes perfect sense. Just like they refuse to do right now, with people who don’t buy into the bullshit of progressive marxism and are terrified of what America is going to look like.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Men have penises, woman have vaginas. This is, apparently, “wrong” now.</li>
<li>  People like to associate with people who look and act like themselves. This is “evil” now.</li>
<li>  Being a man is evil. Being a woman means you are oppressed.</li>
<li>  Privacy is relative.</li>
<li>  You can have illegal thoughts.</li>
<li>  Producing children is lame.</li>
<li>  Murder is subjective.</li>
<li>  Free speech is the second biggest mistake ever made.</li>
<li>  The citizen’s right to material force is the first biggest mistake.</li>
<li>  Truth, beauty, and excellence are not only arbitrary, but now offensive concepts.</li>
<li>  Your children are not your own.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is western society <em>right now</em>. I dare not speculate as to the madness ahead. It gets to a point where those perpetuating this no longer want to talk, argue, debate, or are willing to change their mind. That point was somewhere in the ‘90s. These people are past that. They just want to disrupt, imprison, exile, or violently destroy those who don’t agree with the things I listed. People who are so upset over Trump they are <em>talking over public channels</em> about trying to assassinate him. The rules of discourse presuppose people are willing to talk at all. Right now, they aren’t. Which leaves us with one option, which can ultimately be summed up as:</p>

<p><strong><em>Fuck you.</em></strong></p>

<p>That’s Trump.</p>

<p>I hate to make comparisons here, because their ultimate goals are so fundamentally different as to be unable to make a genuine comparison. But there is one thing Trump and Hitler have in common: they were the only option a member of the body politic had to escape what was imposed on them.</p>

<p>Let me rewind to a paragraph above: what it felt like to be a 1930s German citizen. They were still recovering from the Great War. They were beaten physically, morally, and economically. Everyone still had fresh memories of loved ones dying (in one of the bloodiest and ugliest wars the world had ever seen). New technology existed that seemed to pop up for no reason other than to melt the lungs out of your friends. Horrible sickness (flu, typhus, malaria) was a constant, inescapable reminder of this conflict. Children flooded the streets as orphans, and you have no reason to know this, but a starving child is one of the worst things you can ever see. Never mind the prostitution.</p>

<p>Now imagine a world where you just survived your body losing 80 pounds from a blood parasite, seeing your friends heads split wide open on a distant shore, and then returning home to see streets of <em>children</em> starving to death and whoring themselves out for pocket change. The world is lobbying against you. Every other nation is having beautiful moments of solidarity and national triumph. Identities are being forged. Canada gets special mention here for its success in this area. There are Jews around the world that are lobbying for a Jewish state because they are scared Jews are going to support Germany herself, and this cannot happen. <em>That’s right, Jews were once Germany’s greatest allies.</em></p>

<p>The winners exercise their right as victors and demand tribute from the losers. But because the losers have nothing, save for one (Germany), guess who has to pay for everyone? Even in a situation like this, there can still be injustice. So now put yourselves there. You have very little. Many or all of the people you know or care about have died. You are surrounded by despair. You have to work but you keep nothing. Whatever is produced is demanded away. You don’t know to whom you belong, but are labeled all the same. There doesn’t seem to be any real future now. The world is recovering, but not your world. You’re working for a debt that you aren’t quite sure why you have.</p>

<p>You feel alone.</p>

<p>You feel frustrated.</p>

<p>You are in debt.</p>

<p>You are humiliated about something over which you have no control.</p>

<p><strong><em>Does this sound familiar yet?</em></strong></p>

<p>Then someone stands up and says, “No more.” They will stop the world from doing this. So many of these problems are entirely imposed and have no basis in any realistic necessity. Thus, they will be abolished. The problems which don’t need to exist won’t exist. Leaders which work against you will be replaced. That which can get better will get better. And you won’t be shamed for the things that can’t get better. Now tell me, can you still be perplexed why someone would choose this “strong man” over the status quo?</p>

<p>I venture the writer of the article would probably still say, “Well, yeah, I am still perplexed,” either out of forced ignorance, or simply because she doesn’t care. She can’t understand because this is the future she wants. She enjoys you being scared because she is weak. She enjoys you hating yourself for something you can’t control because she hates herself for things she can control. She wants you to work but gain nothing because when she works, she gains nothing. But hers is from personal, changeable foolishness, so yours must be imposed. She wants to destroy what is beautiful because she is ugly. If she makes excellence a sin, she is blameless. She wants to tear down God because she thinks herself one; to impose her own rules upon reality in which you are the evil one. She wants you to owe her something because she owes so much herself.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, she wants you to join the dream, because if you aren’t asleep, her reality becomes a nightmare.</p>

<p>So, I guess, all that’s left to say is: <strong>Vote Trump. Let’s shake the world awake.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>yea that&#39;s about how I feel, though I can&#39;t agree with you on everything. Honestly I believe Hillary is the bigger &quot;fascist&quot; this go-around if you buy into the lesser of evils stuff (big if). Just look at the ultra-nationalism and militarism now openly present at the DNC.</p>

<p>BUT, let&#39;s not pretend like the nazis weren&#39;t evil scumbags and that many Germans were manipulated into doing evil by them, and that such things are not hypothetically possible in modern times (not necessarily in the US- look at the potentials for complete chaos in Europe, though)</p>

<p>also, don&#39;t let yourself become naive/complacent and think that Trump has exiled all of the neocons, who overlap quite a bit (if not completely) with &quot;globalists&quot;/neoliberals, from his deconstruction of the republicans. Most of them have jumped ship to the dems, but his VP seems to be a neocon ffs. </p>

<p>Just as you can’t become president without fellating Israel, you can’t become president without at least paying lip service to the establishment RINOs and DINOs, yes.</p>

<p>-_- yes, that&#39;s me alright. </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing you sympathize with the Russians and the way they&#39;re being demonized in the bought-out media? Go get a broad sample of Russian popular opinion on the nazis: you might not win too many friends using pro-nazi rhetoric with them. To be clear, it&#39;s my opinion that there are many things that are distorted about WW2 history and the holocaust, but the interpretation of the nazis being &quot;good&quot; is definitely not one of them. And again, Wehrmacht does not equal nazi. I don&#39;t demonize the Germans for what happened, only their manipulators. Let me put it this way: I don&#39;t know what you <em>do</em> believe, but if it&#39;s that the nazis were the &quot;good guys&quot;, maybe you should actually <em>like</em> the so-called nwo</p>

<p>The media is warmongering for RINOs and DINOs. I don’t have to like Russia to see that.</p>

This is because all effort is concentrated on debasing and destroying the opposing party. Fuck Red vs. Blue politics, Gary Johnson has won my vote.

<p>-_- yes, that&#39;s me alright. </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing you sympathize with the Russians and the way they&#39;re being demonized in the bought-out media? Go get a broad sample of Russian popular opinion on the nazis: you might not win too many friends using pro-nazi rhetoric with them. To be clear, it&#39;s my opinion that there are many things that are distorted about WW2 history and the holocaust, but the interpretation of the nazis being &quot;good&quot; is definitely not one of them. And again, Wehrmacht does not equal nazi. I don&#39;t demonize the Germans for what happened, only their manipulators. Let me put it this way: I don&#39;t know what you <em>do</em> believe, but if it&#39;s that the nazis were the &quot;good guys&quot;, maybe you should actually <em>like</em> the so-called nwo</p>
