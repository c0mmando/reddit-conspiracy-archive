<p>LITERALLY the lines from the trailer:</p>

<p>&quot;Privacy is over, it&#39;s a whole new world now&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He hacks a plane and makes it fall out of the sky...</p>

<p>A text sequence in the trailer saying &quot;NOTHING IS SAFE&quot;</p>

<p>He hacks his car</p>

<p>&quot;The pictures you take, the things you put out there, they can be used to hurt ya&quot;</p>

<p>Am I crazy or do these movies have HUGE agendas?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny how they blame all that stuff on the IT guy, when the government is already doing all that stuff to everyone.  People should be freaked out at what their government is doing to them, not at the IT guy who actually has to follow strict rules and regulations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Privacy is over&quot; is a common response by shills to get people to stop trying to protect their privacy.</p>

<p>Hacking a plane IS possible if you are on the plane, but that&#39;s only because aircraft have rubbish security.</p>

<p>Hacking a &quot;smart/connected&quot; car is possible via Wi-Fi, but but that&#39;s only because cars have rubbish security. The IT technician would have to be near the car to hack it.</p>

<p>Hacking a &quot;smart&quot; house is possible via the internet, but you can&#39;t use it to kill the occupants.</p>

<p>&quot;The pictures you take, the things you put out there, they can be used to hurt ya&quot;: That&#39;s true if the people who want to hurt you are spy agencies. This is because some cameras attach your location to pictures that you take as metadata. However, a single skilled IT technician won&#39;t be able to do that.</p>

<p>The &quot;NOTHING IS SAFE&quot; line is definately propaganda designed to scare people.</p>

<p>I saw the trailer as mostly saying: &quot;Smart things are dangerous and we need to improve security on them.&quot;</p>

<p>However, the film is also anti-internet/anti-privacy propaganda because of the way the hacking was presented: it makes you think that this is easy over the internet. Hollywood has an agenda to stop the internet, both because it is controlled by the CIA and because the internet cuts into Hollywood&#39;s profits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know I don&#39;t, it was okay when the ratio of propaganda to real films was 90 / 10, but now its 10 / 90, and even the 10% has some small-time propaganda on the side just in case you forgot how great Jews are or how bad Terrorism is, or if you forgot how much you should agree with bombing Iran or how much Palestine wants to wipe Israel off the map! Every single fucking movie. I don&#39;t watch this garbage anymore, I&#39;m sick of being programmed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re spreading their agenda through Hollywood as usual. Take a look at War Dogs, only needed to see that commercial once before I knew it was written in Langley. &quot;See? War&#39;s actually pretty cool! You can earn a ton of money being responsible for millions of casualties! Don&#39;t mind the whole dead kids thing, look at Jonah Hill! He&#39;s so silly, isn&#39;t he Goyim!?&quot;</p>
