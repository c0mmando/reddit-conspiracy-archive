    <div class="md"><p>The supreme court ruled that the Florida Supreme Court did bot have legal authority to overturn a certified election result. Bush was certified the winner. I was present in person at the Florida recount / ballot review where literally all cards with no presidential vote were counted as votes for Gore, and some clear votes for Bush were counted as votes for Gore in cases where people had party line Democrat votes for local office but Bush votes for President. The opposite did not happen. After that extremely biased recount, Bush still won, by a smaller margin, but that&#39;s understandable considering the recount counted non-votes and even some Bush votes as Gore votes. I was there. I watched it happen right in front of me. Gore did not win Florida. He just came very close. He was closer in other states, but none had the bulk of electoral votes Florida had, and that&#39;s the reason there is so much talk about Florida. The only result saying he should have won was a biased media study that was nit scientifically based. Remeber, the same media and political party that told you Gore really won are now telling you the massive DNC corruption is the Russians trying to rig the election for Trump, that Hillary has never committed a crime even though facts and declassified documents say otherwise, that Assange and Snowden are dangerous criminals because they exposes crimes, and the TPP is what we need to fix our economy. On the other hand, in the current situation we have documented evidence of collision with the media to favor one candidate and discredit the other, exit poll deviations as high as 6-7x the percentages that indicate fraud, campaign money laundering, and a $7M online propaganda campaign paying people to lie to manipulate the general public toward a candidate. The current situation is unprecedented, at least in the mountain of evidence available to the general public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because most of the people worried about it this time only care because it might cause THEIR candidate to lose.  Last time it happened in a general it benefitted them so they have no reason to want to drag that up.  It gets in the way of the partisan &quot;the other side is cheating! Not fair!&quot; Talking points.  A lot of people this election became &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; but only as far as the theories benefit their candidate, they could care less about the bigger picture and will disappear after the election if their person wins and will whine incessantly if their candidate loses while still only admitting conspiracies in so far as they would prove their shitty candidate actually beat the other shitty candidate.</p>

The media collusion is the norm, I bet, but exit polls are usually close. I mean, it doesn&#39;t appear that the Republicans hacked votes like the Democrats did, and they were even trying to stop Trump just like the Dems were working to stop Bernie.

    <div class="md"><p>You talking about the Democratic primaries being rigged? I can only imagine, since although the Republicans rigged it against Trump as best as they could manage, he was able to win regardless. </p>

<p>People are more up in arms about the Dems because much of it&#39;s been exposed. Thanks to Wikileaks, we know without a doubt that the DNC was definitely undermining his campaign. Also, I&#39;m pretty sure that reported results of elections are usually not so far outside of the margin of error of exit polls too, so allegations of election fraud don&#39;t usually have as strong a statistical foundation to back up the claims (even though there&#39;s obviously been tons of fraud in the past regardless). And thanks to the advancements of Internet culture, all of this information is available instantly for everyone who wants it. Maybe past elections might have turned out differently if we were all communicating about evidences of fraud on the Internet like we do now? Combine all of this with the fact that Bernie is the first apparently honest politician many of us have seen in our lifetimes, and it&#39;s especially disheartening to have seen him cheated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Political</p>

<p>Election fraud is as old as elections.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only become easier as most people blindly trust machines, voting via ignorance of a thing that takes a lifetime to master. The general public is not allowed to look at the code of the voting machines. Even if they could, only a small percentage would know what they were looking at. Even less would be able to tell if something was off in the code. Might as well be a &quot;magic&quot; box that picks elected officials.</p>

<p>Rise of the machines is a metaphor first, then a reality.</p>

<p>You can relax though. Your votes never really mattered. It&#39;s all in the constitution.</p>

<p>So called Democratic Republic is the official description for the US government. Republic with a small democratic component is more accurate. Presidents don&#39;t have that much power, even in war. When presidents declare war or emergency, generals get the power. Presidents are figureheads meant to give 1/3 of a rubber stamp, or not.</p>

<p>The real power holders are those appointed by the elected, officially and openly, and especially the unofficially and secretly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ultimately a governments job to make sure you stay right where you are. Until real power holders decide it&#39;s time for new people to join the elite. Everyone below them gets to move up one notch. When people are able to move up economically it&#39;s a mistake on the governments part, that&#39;s why it&#39;s rare. Slightly more likely than winning the lottery.</p>

<p>Socioeconomic</p>

<p>We&#39;re slaves in reality. If you&#39;ve worked because you actually needed to at some point in your life, you&#39;re a modern slave. People know this, most of us have the money to drown out the facts with entertainment. The poorer you are, the more aware of this you are, the more you&#39;re blamed for things out of your control. The middle and upper middle class psychologically camouflages the power players. Most people are content being camouflaged, they&#39;ve made it to the top slave status.</p>

<p>Our peers formed deep and elaborate friend groups. Outsiders or new friends were treated very differently. This is social status. The people that run the world are not actually known to us. If they were, mobs of anyone with half a brain would kill them off. Government is designed as a layer of protection for the Absolutely wealthy, families and close groups that have not worked for generations, even centuries. They own nearly everything, even the idea of money itself.</p>

<p>Reality</p>

<p>Become self sufficient as much as you can, in every way you can. It does not require great wealth to create real community that helps each other. Little is needed to grow plants, clean and purify water, or to build shelters that protect us. Help all others to become self sufficient. Don&#39;t wait for anyone with the power to help you, to actually help you. You must act as if government does not exist in many ways. Of course doing this is obviously and sometimes not so obviously illegal in may cases, so be discrete. If there is going to be a real revolution we&#39;re going to need to have an alternative to government before we can eliminate it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like the extremes the Democratic Party went to this year usually aren&#39;t employed. I can&#39;t imagine they usually need to tamper with votes to such a degree. The media collusion is the norm, I bet, but exit polls are usually close. I mean, it doesn&#39;t appear that the Republicans hacked votes like the Democrats did, and they were even trying to stop Trump just like the Dems were working to stop Bernie. I think it&#39;s clear that the Dems stepped their game up this year. Hillary would have lost if they hadn&#39;t. </p>
