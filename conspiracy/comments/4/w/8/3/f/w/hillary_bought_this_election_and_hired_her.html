       Trump is a mad man.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's been a registered Democrat his entire life up until this election.  He's also been a major contributor to the Clinton campaigns over the years. Hillary is known to be behind extremely shady deals and to be involved with the election fraud that is taking place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two of them are undermining democracy and the American people. Trump's antics, especially as of late, since he got the nomination have only gotten crazier and crazier and he is now alienating the Republicans that nominated him; virtually handing the election to Hillary, since he can't just drop out because that would be too obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're working together. The KKK, who Hillary has very close ties with, are backing Trump as a way of ostracizing the rest of the people in hopes it will persuade them to vote for Hillary(see episode 512 of south park).

       I've had this fleeting thought in the back of mind since last year but now its coming out to the forefront. At first I was also mad, how can this guy be placed there? Hes CERTAINLY for the people with everything he says. But yeah it makes a lot of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does he know what he's doing consciously? Wouldnt it eat you up inside knowing youre playing this long con having to keep it secret from your  kids and family to keep anyone from spilling the beans?

       The Republican penchant for denigrating actual veterans while lionising fake war-heroes aside, the Purple Heart stunt was jaw-on-the-floor material. He seems to be going out of his way to offend one of the demographics that Republicans most covet.

       Basically, yes. Hillary will have to work within the framework of allegiances and cronyism that she has built over 40 years. Trump could potentially just do whatever the fuck he wants.

       He's not turning a blind eye to election fraud. He's already been talking about it at rallies, and according to Roger Stone the Trump campaign is working on a plan to fight it.

       So according to your response it makes no sense to you why Reagan wanted to become president. And apparently you also don't understand the will for power. Good luck in life not being able to grasp the reality of fundamental human desire for power.

       Trump also has been interested in politics much earlier than this decade. Also, why do you get to deem the timeline of authentic interest? Interest in political power is only authentic before a certain age? At least try to form a coherent argument.

       You made the same incorrect observation twice in a row. That is why you are an idiot. Also because of your supposed argument. There isn't even an argument here anyway. When you use a quote from 30 years ago that is nothing but opinion of that current moment, that is laughable. It's a fallacy in itself. There is no checkmate, just a shitty response that doesn't respond to the current situation.

       No. Your source of the man's sentiments are from 30 years ago. My source of the man's sentiments are the fact that he is the republican nominee for the current presidential election. Calling you delusional and an idiot isn't an ad hominem. An ad hominem is when you call out the person rather than their argument. I am calling out your flawed logic in your "argument" as well as calling you an idiot for making that flaw.

       This is not a matter of opinion. Is it my opinion too that he is the republican presidential nominee? You live in a world where a persons actions don't prove their actions. That is called delusional.

       Also people rarely look at the attacks he has against clinton.... like none, nothing. For the loudest mouth asshole on tv, he sure is being quite silent against clinton and focused on dumb policy instead. There is sooooo much dirt on Clinton right now but he never really brings up the emails, the DNC corruption, the Sanders campaign Sabbotage and so much more that is making her tank in the ratings. He stands clear of the really damageable attacks against her and just says bat shit crazy stuff to look bad. I think at this point people are too scared of the evil character they created to really notice how absurd this is.

       It's amazing people can believe hillary is a shill but not trump. People will say the voting system is useless, and then say that Trump is going to fix everything. It's all controlled opposition. But I will say that the_Donald is the most entertaining forum on reddit. Anyone who refers to a political figure as a "god" is absolutely brainwashed. You can bet on that 100% everytime. However. They are hilarious with the shit they come up with to troll hillary, I love it personally. Also the dank memes make me giggle.

       You need to do some research, he's been a democrat, yes, but since like the 80's he's been saying that IF he was to ever run, he would run as a republican. Why? Because someone like Trump understand the two party system is crap, so all he's doing is picking the side that will make it easiest for him to win. Someone like Trump doesn't do ANYTHING in life to lose, that is the mind of a weak person who is scared. He is a brilliant businessman and those that deny that don't have a single clue what running a business entails.

       He's not a brilliant businessman. He inherited somewhere around ~$500 million. If he took that and invested into the S&amp;P 500, it would be worth $20 billion.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says he's worth $10 billion. This is even giving him the benefit of the doubt, as his net worth is estimated to be only $4 billion.

       Losing a battle (the election) and winning a war (influence with the president, money in his pocket).... seems more like a Trump strategy to me.  And yes, he said he'd run as a republican. Because it would be easy to imitate their views and in essence mock them.

       That's a typical response. It's essentially saying, "your response angers me because it reinforces the notion that I'm wrong but I don't know enough to comment and defend my position."
