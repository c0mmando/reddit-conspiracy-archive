        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump is a mad man.</p>

<p>He&#39;s been a registered Democrat his entire life up until this election.  He&#39;s also been a major contributor to the Clinton campaigns over the years. Hillary is known to be behind extremely shady deals and to be involved with the election fraud that is taking place.</p>

<p>The two of them are undermining democracy and the American people. Trump&#39;s antics, especially as of late, since he got the nomination have only gotten crazier and crazier and he is now alienating the Republicans that nominated him; virtually handing the election to Hillary, since he can&#39;t just drop out because that would be too obvious. </p>

<p>They&#39;re working together. The KKK, who Hillary has very close ties with, are backing Trump as a way of ostracizing the rest of the people in hopes it will persuade them to vote for Hillary(see episode 512 of south park).</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s antics, especially as of late, since he got the nomination have only gotten crazier and crazier and he is now alienating the Republicans that nominated him; virtually handing the election to Hillary,</p>

<p>You have to believe everything the mainstream media says and never fact check them to think this.... Also the neocon and warmonger GOP establishment immigrating to Hillary&#39;s side is NOT a bad mark on Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also people rarely look at the attacks he has against clinton.... like none, nothing. For the loudest mouth asshole on tv, he sure is being quite silent against clinton and focused on dumb policy instead. There is sooooo much dirt on Clinton right now but he never really brings up the emails, the DNC corruption, the Sanders campaign Sabbotage and so much more that is making her tank in the ratings. He stands clear of the really damageable attacks against her and just says bat shit crazy stuff to look bad. I think at this point people are too scared of the evil character they created to really notice how absurd this is. </p>

<p>-Brought up the emails quite a bit. </p>

<p>-brought up how voting was rigged against sanders</p>

<p>-talked about how corrupt the dnc was against bernie</p>

<p>None of this makes the news though, they just knit pick shit he said and blow it out of proportion. Just go check his twitter feed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s amazing people can believe hillary is a shill but not trump. People will say the voting system is useless, and then say that Trump is going to fix everything. It&#39;s all controlled opposition. But I will say that the_Donald is the most entertaining forum on reddit. Anyone who refers to a political figure as a &quot;god&quot; is absolutely brainwashed. You can bet on that 100% everytime. However. They are hilarious with the shit they come up with to troll hillary, I love it personally. Also the dank memes make me giggle. </p>

Someone like Trump doesn&#39;t do ANYTHING in life to lose, that is the mind of a weak person who is scared. He is a brilliant businessman and those that deny that don&#39;t have a single clue what running a business entails. </p>
