<p>the cabbie admits the scene was staged.    easy enough to truck in a damaged light post - place it next to the car and smash the windshield..   I guess they didn&#39;t expect we&#39;d notice that the damage on the car is inconsistent, or that the cabbie would confess.</p>

<p>So, you didn&#39;t bother to listen to any of the 30 something eyewitnesses, nor read the hundred or so other witnesses?</p>

<p>Fascinating.</p>

<p>Facts and evidence aren&#39;t nearly as much fun as anti-truth disinformation like &quot;CGI planes&quot; and &quot;Space Beams brought down the WTC&quot; ala Judith Wood.</p>

<p>Shame.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not moving goalposts.  It goes to show that nobody saw the impact.   That&#39;s significant to me, if not you.  </p>

<p>If a commercial plane actually had hit the pentagon, it should have been VERY easy to show evidence of seats, baggage, tail section, etc.. instead they hid everything under tarps. . </p>

<p>it appears that you don&#39;t know the meaning of the word shame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is exactly moving the goalposts. It&#39;s the definition of moving the goalposts.</p>

<p>You asked for eyewitnesses - I provided them. Then you didn&#39;t watch them. Then you didn&#39;t read the other 100. The you claimed they all worked for the government. Now you want other witnesses to some other thing.</p>

<p>Moving the goalposts, refusing to argue in good faith, refusing to actually look at the evidence provided.</p>

<p>Typical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>read again.  I said impact the whole time.  It&#39;s an important distinction to make, and I understand why you refuse to acknowledge why.  </p>

<p>You think seeing a plane fly over a flight path implies that it impacted the pentagon.  That&#39;s faulty logic.   Find me a single witness of the actual impact.  You can&#39;t.  That is significant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, actually, it&#39;s not pretty obvious. The aircraft that hit the Pentagon was likely the same kind that hit the WTC. We have many, many eyewitnesses who saw what they thought was a plane hit the Pentagon.</p>

<p>In fact, the whole &quot;no plane hit the Pentagon&quot; seems to be an early form of disinformation meant to distract from the obvious controlled demolitions of the WTC buildings 1, 2 and 7.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>explosive charges timed to go off as the cruise missile passed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait - are you seriously suggesting that they planted explosives ... to blow up light poles ... in time with the Pentagon crash? That seems unlikely.</p>
