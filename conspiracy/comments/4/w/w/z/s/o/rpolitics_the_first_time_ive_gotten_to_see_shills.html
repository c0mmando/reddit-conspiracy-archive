        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Man it happened and it happened fast. The sub went from chatting about the DNC corruption to everything anti-trump with a few random articles sprinkled in seemingly over night(yeah, real subtle). Even all of the thumbnails to the articles have either pictures of Hillary smiling and looking all great or trump looking sad or making some other stupid face. I actually used to enjoy that community, seemed like I could finally leave this sub and see people waking up. </p>

<p>Now, you can&#39;t post anything that&#39;s negative towards Hillary or your going to be down voted due to your &quot;baseless attacks.&quot; You&#39;ll even earn a nice week long ban if you call any of these obvious shills out. If Hillary can change a whole online community with just a few million dollars, what&#39;s next?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would anyone want to karma whore for comment karma on an account with a username that directly admits to being a shill? That doesn&#39;t even make any sense. Does anyone anywhere even care about comment karma? What good is having a lot of karma on an account where the username admits that the user wasn&#39;t posting in good faith? I could understand maybe if it was only one user giving themselves a name like that, but it&#39;s a very obvious trend if you pay attention. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was banned from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> for talking about election fraud apparently (the message in my ban notice was a straight-up lie, got no response when I tried to appeal). If you ban legitimate users and support the CTR sockpuppets, it&#39;s not surprising they&#39;d be able to take over.</p>

<p>I will admit that it&#39;s strange going into a thread and not seeing ONE SINGLE comment that looks like it was from a real person though. I can only imagine the mods are banning pro-Trump people too? Or maybe everyone has just given up because it&#39;s impossible to fight the flood of sockpuppets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Barely anyone is actually a Hillary supporter. Most people who will end up voting for Hillary are actually just anti-Trump. They would vote for anybody who is running against him. The &quot;pro-hillary&quot; people out there are paid to fake their enthusiasm for Hillary for the most part. There are obviously a few actual supporters out there, but not like it seems on Reddit. This shit is fake. Go out and talk to real people. If you&#39;re lucky like me and your job requires you to talk with hundreds of people a day, you will realize that &quot;pro-hillary&quot; is largely a fabricated social media phenomenon, and I live in a Dem state. </p>

<p>As for why this sub does not seem to be very supportive of Hillary, CTR probably decided it would be a waste of their millions of dollars to fabricate a pro-Hillary vibe on here.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes Trump a little different are mainly two things:</p>

<p>He has never been a career politician.</p>

<p>And he hasn&#39;t taken near as many big donations.</p>

<p>So for his supporters the hope is he will be more honest than the usual stooges. Like the guy above mentioned Obama was for left wingers in 08. But anyone could just look at his donor list, and knew who he served.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure how effective it will be. I never had any interest in trump, so the &quot;dumb trump&quot; spam changes nothing for me. It&#39;s obviously being pushed to terrorize everyone into voting for Clinton.</p>

<p>The circle jerk in those threads is also just the worst I have ever seen on reddit; far worse than the anti Clinton and pro sanders. They&#39;re all narrative pushing commenters that look like bots with their range of vocabulary/talking points. How many real commenters are actually participating? And how many people have been banned? </p>

<p>And just look at the wording in most of the articles. Somthing like &quot;Trump will deregulate wall street!&quot; and Hillary won&#39;t??? (what speaking fees?) They all look like projecting. The weasel words make it obvious. Half expect somthing to pop up about Trump&#39;s private email server at this point. </p>

<p>The funny thing is even with all of this manipulation, I still don&#39;t see a real pro Hillary article that doesn&#39;t talk about polls. It&#39;s all &quot;Trump&#39;s is soo dumb, look how bad he&#39;s losing. Anyone who supports him is retarded.&quot; and with Hillary it&#39;s &quot;she polled ahead here there and there. YAY&quot;. </p>

<p>Right now they have the white noise machine on r/politics, so I&#39;m finding myself look at r/conspiracy to actually get updates on the leaks and corruption.</p>

<p>It bothers the crap out of me that this is our election. One candidate is investigated by the FBI and leaves a trail of dead people everywhere she goes, and the other is a loose-mouthed celebrity who nobody can take seriously and every day being made out to be the bad guy.</p>

<p>Trump is the fucking fall guy from day 1.</p>
