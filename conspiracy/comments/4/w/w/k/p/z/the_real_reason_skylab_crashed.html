        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So here’s a story I heard while working at Goddard Spaceflight Center in 1978-1979. It’s not a conspiracy, but there was an apparent conspiracy to keep it a secret.</p>

<p>Much of Goddard’s computer equipment was quite old at the time. The centerpiece was an IBM 360/95, which was a custom-built device that thought it was a 360/90 – or at least that’s what it would answer when asked for its model number. (It was somewhat faster than the 90, and it had no packed-decimal hardware.) This machine was based on transistors, rather than on integrated circuits. It went down several times a day for hardware board swaps. It was then 11 years old. The accountants loved it, because it was already expensed, but great strides had been made in speed and in reliability since its day. The 95 was responsible for tracking and maintaining just about all of NASA’s unmanned satellites. All of this, I know first-hand.</p>

<p>Long story short, one day the 95 went down for about three weeks, and the effects were felt long after. You see, the machine would calculate where the satellites were supposed to point their solar panels in order to recharge their batteries. If the batteries were ever to run down, the satellite was lost, because the panels could never be pointed again. </p>

<p>Many satellites were lost during the protracted outage (or outrage, if you prefer.). One such satellite was SkyLab, NASA’s first attempt at a space station. Skylab lost its stability control, and began coning – then tumbling through its low earth orbit. There was, of course, very very little air resistance up there, but with the coning, it mounted up over time. Skylab’s orbit consequently degraded, and the unit came plummeting back to earth. Pieces landed on Australia.</p>

<p>The official story was that sun spots interfered with communications, and that the reentry was at least partially controlled. That’s not what was being said at Goddard when it happened. (I was working at Goddard when SkyLab crashed, but not when the 360/95 crashed. The computer was still there, however.)</p>

<p>So… it’s been a long time. I may misremember part of this, and I may have been misinformed. Nevertheless, as I remember it, this is the story being told at NASA when SkyLab came down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool story.  I visited Goddard building 8 around 1981 and marveled at the few guys working CAD on cutting edge IBM 286 generation computers.  It seems comical now and I&#39;m sure it was a frustrating experience to use these workstations.</p>

<p>I also was inside the art department&#39;s airbrush and photo retouching lab as mentioned in The Disclosure Project testimony by Donna Hare.  I find her story credible.  Just down the hall were two or three rooms covered by photo mosaics of the lunar surface and there were always a small group inside studying these photos.</p>

<p>I also remember a young woman, maybe 18 or 19 years old, who ran one of the photocopiers in building number 8.  You couldn&#39;t make your own photocopies, you had to have the specialist do it for you. She was a black girl or mulatta resembling Halle Berry and among the prettiest women I&#39;ve ever seen.  There was always a crowd of guys following her around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always been interested in the cooling system on Skylab and the Apollo spacecraft. I have read (on Wikipedia) the cooling system/solar panels were damaged on takeoff and resulted in Skylab overheating. After learning that I realized how little I knew about the spacecraft. I had watched the Apollo 13 movie where they &quot;shutdown&quot; the lem and it cooled down. (supposedly) do you know anything about those systems?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bit off topic, but I was in a 727 flying from California/Burbank to Portland Oregon for my moms birthday. Midway through the flight the plane started to slow down quite noticeably and the pilot got on the com and said they were ordered to slow down because Skylab was entering the atmosphere. Kind of exciting at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Countless people believe that Astronauts in the Iss seem to be simulating space, ie faking it. On CBS, when asked to prove to conspiracy theorists if they are indeed in space? Scott Kelly does a twirl that looks like  it is a bungee cord pathetic harness flip. You may not believe it, but there are abundant clues that NASA is faking the ISS. I dont expect you to care one bit. But you asked me, so here is why I am convinced of this deception.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=naVA3bqMP3g">Jet engines</a>There are signs of zero gravity simulation: clear sounds of Jet engines of zero gravity plane can be heard in many Iss internal footages.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiments that would reveal the simulation are always pre-taped - even the simple ball and wheel experiments. Tim Peake could not perform the experiment live. Fanboys, didn&#39;t care. But those of us who see this deception knew exactly why: while he was bouncing on a harness to simulate weightlessness, the ball and wheel would give the NASA fake space set away. So they pre- taped it to solve this problem.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ_mhqw0-fw">Water sounds</a>Space walks appear to simulated in a deep pool. Sounds of water snorkeling, movements  of objects taking trajectory like moving in water, there are bubbles every where in those footages. More than once an astronaut has almost drowned in space, of course, these are signs of deep pool misfortunes. NASA fixed those problem by adding snorkels to their suits, go figure! </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jgVK7Gshw6w">Airlock doors to space</a>We never see the all important footage of an astronaut going from the airtight inside to the outside space: we never see it! 
We never this An astronaut from the inside iss chamber opening the hatch to do a space walk, from the inside view. Why? Cause this is impossible when you film space walks in a pool .You can never show that transition from iss internal set to water set without giving away your trickery.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_o_lTYJKA8k">Space hair</a>: Women on the Isis seem to have long pre-permed hair, why? Why would you have long locks in 6 months where you can&#39;t shower and why does their long hair stick up and never flow through the cabin air? Because when doing zero gravity plane scenes, they have to perm the hair in place to avoid any changes of hair shape when the plane is in normal gravity portion of the flight. This very clever trickery, otherwise the hair would fall rapidly and noticeably to an observing audience when the plane doesn&#39;t go up. So the hair is permed in place to pull off this fakery. It looks ridicules otherwise.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It is not what space simulation tricks they show but what they can&#39;t that we must pay attention to. I think I have watched more than 500 hours of original NASA videos. Space so fake, it makes me sick. Go head do your own research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CGI....so much CGI...it is extremely sad disappointing how much of our reality of our planet earth, and space is just animation.  when we have great camera technology in 2016. When Virgin Galactic failed my suspicions deepened. Elon Musk gets Billions from the US government and NASA, he is not to be trusted, his poor faking of spacex is hardly shocking. Google how much money Elon Musk gets in corporate Welfare money, your mind will be blown...in other news NASA just shut down it&#39;s iss Live feed after people complained, it is not continuous. Yeah fuck the people asking questions, eh?</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uWjdnvYok4I"> I watched a Don Petit lecture in 2013</a> where he talks of the &quot;tyranny of the Rocket equation&quot;. Possibly the most informative lecture I ever heard regarding space travel. The math for rockets gives away their inability to carry payloads, ie space travel.</p>
