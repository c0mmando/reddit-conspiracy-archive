       I think the people who are the real revolutionaries are not discussed often enough. Why do you want to focus on "famous" when we all have the possibility to be revolutionary. Standing up to injustice in ones daily life is far more effective than waiting for someone famous to save you.

       Check out this person's history... Yeah, it's an old account, but two spammy posts to "enough_sanders_spam" with the same text beginning with "my fellow hillary supporters" about being done with being nice to sanders supporters... Either this is a troll or pure ctr bs.

       Lurk for just a little while and you'll get more than a little bit of enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The TPP is about making international businesses superior to governments. They are demanding the right to sue governments that do anything that causes them to lose Potential profits. That will make the governments you now know just local jurisdictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The central bankers along with  the biggest international corporations  will then be the defacto  world government. They will not be benevolent.
      </p>
      <p>
       GMO's are rammed through to consumers  untested  because of bribery not science. You will consume any product  they can concoct as long as it is profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our leaders have no conscience and feel no remorse.  They make every decision based on personal greed alone. That's the basic problem for us all.

       I see where you are going with that, but it's a very fine line that's hard to see next to a very slippery slope to becoming one of their "useful idiots", like OP of they aren't getting paid. I mean, if I were shoveling horse shit, I would want to be paid, but that's just me.

       No no no no, not "useful TO idiots", "useful idiots". It's an old CIA/KGB/Cultural Marxist term for people that are unknowingly playing a propagandizing or manipulative role, or being used in some other way that they aren't privy to. Like of an organization wants to destabilize the economy of some foreign nation, so they carry out false flag operations on a small scale to incite racial tensions or something along those lines. The resulting civil unrest caused wouldn't require active participation from the original agents, because the revolting populace, based on their understanding of the events, would be justified... And the people that are being revolted against would also be justified in denying any participation in the initiating events, furthering the conflict. In the end, what would have been a unified populace organizing to effect change beneficial to the entire citizenry of the nation is now divided and expending resources to debate, argue, edify, accommodate, etc..  And the whole time the original agents that carried out the false flag doesn't care at all about either "cause", an the people revolting were just "useful idiots". As Yuri Bezminov put it, "these useful idiots, the Marxist leftists, the believe when they get their person into power, they'll receive some favor or love from the new leader, but they were only there to stir conflict and destabilize the nation and their purpose is served... They will be first to be lined up against the wall and executed"

       In many cases people have actual grievances that are going unaddressed. Who is the useful idiot?

       You aren't saying anything... Yes, there are all sorts of events that occur honestly and without contrivance or manipulation, but I wasn't addressing those. Just because some things are the product of manipulation doesn't mean all things are. And aside from that, a lot of people are opportunists and exaggerate small grievances, try to shape things so that a "grievance" that is really just a part of life and shared by all is worse for them than others, indulge in confirmation bias and bad science, manipulatively skewed data, or selectively sampled "polls".
      </p>
      <p>
       The useful idiots are the people that look only at the result of events and ignore the context and precursors that would prove those events to be ordinary but narratively unsupportive. The people who look only at events that happen to their subculture and completely ignore that those same events happen to all people independent of subculture. The people that build up straw men and then kafka trap anyone who demands evidence, and use all of this in the culturally marxist effort to tear down and destroy the status quo with no real end game or plan for resolution. They fail to see that the only result of their actions is further division and conflict and struggle while a very few people, almost always unscrupulous in character, reap the benefits because they know that it's all built on dishonesty and historical revision and manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why there's essentially no simple remedy or apology, the punishment is always extremely harsh for whatever transgression cause the "grievance" and almost always leads back to having to pay to take some class or seminar or donate to some non-profit or buy some book and all the money travels back to the same people that bitch about a culture they haven't been a part of for decades and the strawmen they have cried "harassment" or "oppression" when asked to point out

       Hahahahahaha.... Sorry for "insulting you"... Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your hugbox, or tumbler, or redefining this as hatespeech and asking for handouts to your patrion or some shit.... Quick, better delete your old posts talking all sorts of shit you'd like to leverage as "harassment" when the tables are turned.

       The TPP is about making international businesses superior to governments. They are demanding the right to sue governments that do anything that causes them to lose Potential profits. That will make the governments you now know just local jurisdictions.

      <p>
       The central bankers along with  the biggest international corporations  will then be the defacto  world government. They will not be benevolent.

       GMO's are rammed through to consumers  untested  because of bribery not science. You will consume any product  they can concoct as long as it is profitable.

       Our leaders have no conscience and feel no remorse.  They make every decision based on personal greed alone. That's the basic problem for us all.
