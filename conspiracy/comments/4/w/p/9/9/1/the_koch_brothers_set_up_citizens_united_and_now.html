    <div class="md"><p>Just wondering what the term One World Government means to people around here?</p>

<p>What am I getting at?</p>

<p>Well for one thing, a lot of us like to think that the government we see is just a front. If so-called &quot;elected officials&quot; aren&#39;t the people who are really in charge, then who actually is?</p>

<p>The simplest and most obvious answer is that it&#39;s the people who control the money. They can make or break any mere politician and their power can be passed on from one generation to the next.</p>

<p>So wouldn&#39;t a <em>real</em> One World Government be based on the ability for people with money to cooperate with each other (in an unhindered way) across any national borders?</p>

<p>If you look at the world today, you see huge transnational corporations doing exactly this. You see a class of ultra-wealthy people (who don&#39;t really live anywhere) that are able to influence and control events in a global fashion. You see international banking systems that allow for the instantaneous flow of capital between one location to any other location in the world.</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m suggesting is, it&#39;s already here. The people who control the central banks and the money supplies of nations, the ones who &quot;care not who makes the laws&quot;... they have already formed a real One World Government.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re seeing now, with TTP, TTIP etc. are just the finishing touches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One world is yet here. One world means there is no more war. That we all fall in line and start focusing on space ship earth and not what one dictator or president has done. That the world population is under 500million and there is no longer starving and the serf know their place. We have got to unity to bring humanity forward or fight over WalMart deals.. We fear what we dont know, and not everyone can engineer and build a bridge, yet everyday we trust the right people did engineer it and build it. There will be only three sovereign cities/states in this one world. 1st is the moral compass and that is Rome, second is the financial backing which is London, and the enforcement of these doctrine will come from the third and most powerful district of Colombia.

<p>How so? </p>

<p>There is plenty of money to be made staging small but expensive wars. The only way a OWG eliminates war is if none of the businesses in the military industrial complex are part of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be all for a One World Government if a few conditions were met. </p>

<p>One would be an end to national borders. Let people come and go wherever they please.</p>

<p>Another thing would be an end to war. No more nations, no more armies, no more leaders scheming against their neighbors.</p>

<p>Maybe the biggest one of all, no more rich against poor. Or maybe a better way of saying it... no more ruthless exploitation of other people for unlimited personal gain.</p>

<p>IMO this last characteristic is mankind&#39;s biggest problem. Too many people who prefer to try and fuck someone else over if they think it will help them get ahead. Game theory calls this negative or zero sum outcomes.</p>

<p>When the preferred mode of operation is negative sum, the overall group benefit has to decrease in order for a small number of players come out ahead.</p>

<p>As long as our leadership is made up of people who think this way, the world will always be a way shittier place than it needs to be.</p>

<p>Great video on exactly what you just said, how the bankers and corporations had their hands in the TPP more than the countries involved in the TPP did. And how it allows corporations God powers over countries, and has for instance allowed a nuclear power company sue a country for making regulations against nuclear power. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly it, the real NWO stuff I&#39;ve been talking about. It&#39;s not going to be some kind of formal political alliance. It&#39;s about making the nation state obsolete.</p>

<p>The TPP will help accomplish this by giving transnationals power that supersedes that of the nations in which they operate. Right now, this is only under certain circumstances. </p>

<p>This is a big deal because &quot;corporation&quot; is really just a way of saying &quot;a bunch of rich businessmen&quot;. So the world is their backyard, they can move their money around at the speed of light... and now they won&#39;t even have to bribe/lobby politicians to get inconvenient laws changed. Just threaten them with a court case and steamroll anyone who tries to resist.</p>
