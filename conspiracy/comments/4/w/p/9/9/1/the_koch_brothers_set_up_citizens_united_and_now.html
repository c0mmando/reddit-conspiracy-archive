      <p>
       Just wondering what the term One World Government means to people around here?
      </p>
      <p>
       What am I getting at?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well for one thing, a lot of us like to think that the government we see is just a front. If so-called "elected officials" aren't the people who are really in charge, then who actually is?
      </p>
      <p>
       The simplest and most obvious answer is that it's the people who control the money. They can make or break any mere politician and their power can be passed on from one generation to the next.
      </p>
      <p>
       So wouldn't a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       One World Government be based on the ability for people with money to cooperate with each other (in an unhindered way) across any national borders?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the world today, you see huge transnational corporations doing exactly this. You see a class of ultra-wealthy people (who don't really live anywhere) that are able to influence and control events in a global fashion. You see international banking systems that allow for the instantaneous flow of capital between one location to any other location in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what I'm suggesting is, it's already here. The people who control the central banks and the money supplies of nations, the ones who "care not who makes the laws"... they have already formed a real One World Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we're seeing now, with TTP, TTIP etc. are just the finishing touches.

       For the most part, I'm with you. I think there is still a lot more work to be done on that front. Decades worth, even without resistance. They have to eliminate nationalism. That will be a tall task.

       Nationalism has already been defeated on the day America become a corporation and the ssn became employee numbers. Nationalism is bigotry just as species'ism is practiced daily. We are earthlings not Mexicans, British, or Chinese. Only the ignorant see their neighbors as the only earthlings that matter. As humans we have a obligation to care and foster this planet to a higher level of creation and frequency that saves spaceship earth. Who do you want in your spaceship?

       There are more countries in the world than the United States. Nationalism is certainly not defeated currently among the billions of people in the world. Example A) The 2016 Olympics. Example B) Soccer/Futbol games. To ultimately overcome nationalistic fervor, some nations may have to crumble also.

       One world is yet here. One world means there is no more war. That we all fall in line and start focusing on space ship earth and not what one dictator or president has done. That the world population is under 500million and there is no longer starving and the serf know their place. We have got to unity to bring humanity forward or fight over WalMart deals.. We fear what we dont know, and not everyone can engineer and build a bridge, yet everyday we trust the right people did engineer it and build it. There will be only three sovereign cities/states in this one world. 1st is the moral compass and that is Rome, second is the financial backing which is London, and the enforcement of these doctrine will come from the third and most powerful district of Colombia. 
Once the simple minded are identified and the poor are killed we can rebuild. . : : .

       Definitely.

      <p>
       I'd be all for a One World Government if a few conditions were met.
      </p>
      <p>
       One would be an end to national borders. Let people come and go wherever they please.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing would be an end to war. No more nations, no more armies, no more leaders scheming against their neighbors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the biggest one of all, no more rich against poor. Or maybe a better way of saying it... no more ruthless exploitation of other people for unlimited personal gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO this last characteristic is mankind's biggest problem. Too many people who prefer to try and fuck someone else over if they think it will help them get ahead. Game theory calls this negative or zero sum outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the preferred mode of operation is negative sum, the overall group benefit has to decrease in order for a small number of players come out ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as our leadership is made up of people who think this way, the world will always be a way shittier place than it needs to be.

       Great video on exactly what you just said, how the bankers and corporations had their hands in the TPP more than the countries involved in the TPP did. And how it allows corporations God powers over countries, and has for instance allowed a nuclear power company sue a country for making regulations against nuclear power.

        TPP ... it allows corporations God powers over countries,

       This is exactly it, the real NWO stuff I've been talking about. It's not going to be some kind of formal political alliance. It's about making the nation state obsolete.
      </p>
      <p>
       The TPP will help accomplish this by giving transnationals power that supersedes that of the nations in which they operate. Right now, this is only under certain circumstances.
      </p>

       This is a big deal because "corporation" is really just a way of saying "a bunch of rich businessmen". So the world is their backyard, they can move their money around at the speed of light... and now they won't even have to bribe/lobby politicians to get inconvenient laws changed. Just threaten them with a court case and steamroll anyone who tries to resist.

       Except for the fact one candidate has repeatedly brought up the "false song of globalism". If electing Hillary/globalist were the plan, trump wouldn't have ran. The GOP would've been led by a globalist unwilling to hit Hillary like trump is everyday. Just taking about these issues that trump brings up is more than the globalists want, they prefer to be kept secret like the TPP

       Isn't it interesting how the "progressives" support the same open-borders mass immigration globalist policies that the "right wing Koch brothers" and the "Wall Street 1%" do.

       Progressives are controlled opposition.

       Except the Kochs are libertarian, and extreme ones at that. How does that play into the totalitarian conspiracy?

       I wouldn't consider making Right to Work states libertarianism, or making superpacs to undermine democracy. No, the Koch brothers are as corporatist as the companies that wrote the TPP.
