      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What the Clinton campaign is doing at the moment is trying to say, "Well, OK, yes, maybe we’re connected to arms dealers and to Saudi Arabia, and, yes, maybe we subverted the integrity of the Democratic primaries, etc., etc., but you will just have to swallow that. You will just have to swallow that, or else you will get Donald Trump." That’s a form of extortion. And—well, it is. It is a form of extortion. And—
       </p>
       <p>
        And you can’t—you can’t permit—it’s very important not to allow the political process to suffer from extortion, or even yourself to be susceptible to extortion. One says one has certain principles. If these principles are not followed, then there is a price to be paid. And that creates a standard and a general deterrent. And I think it is important for those people who feel that their principles have been violated, in the way that the Democratic primary process has been run, or how Chelsea Manning has been imprisoned for 35 years and tortured, or the Espionage Act crackdowns, or many other things, to go, "OK, well, there’s a cost to violating principles," even if—even if there’s also a cost to yourself, even if you don’t like the risk, which seems to be getting very small, but the risk that Donald Trump becomes president, that one has to have a line somewhere. Otherwise, as each election cycle proceeds, you are pushed further and further into the corner.

       "Military intervention" is a euphemism for
       <em>
        military coup
       </em>
       which is a license for murder without trial.  Which, I'm guessing, is your goal anyway, as it is with anyone who advocates "military intervention" and especially using that euphemism.

       how would it be different from now, where murder without trial is routine?  because it's overt?

       military intervention could mean a lot of things, including leaking information through someone like Snowden - who incidentally is/was in Special Forces.

       I'll play your sly game:  "That could mean a lot of things."  Bet you'll enjoy the difference when the state of "emergency" really invades every street and your loyalty to the coup government doesn't prevent you from catching a bullet.

       But there isn't extortion.  Assange is just saying that telling people to vote for Clinton or Trump becomes president is "a form extortion", which it obviously isn't.  It's just a simple statement of fact.

       Its the population that thinks voting for the lesser of two evils is their fate.    They have been doing it for a long time.    Jill Stein has the right idea with "instant runoff voting",  but the two main parties are rackets,  designed,  through corruption and criminality,  to keep any other parties from participating.    There is no provision for the duopoly extortion to be favored in the constitution.    Assange is right.

       It's only extortion if you believe Trump is legitimately a danger to the republic, and even then it's hardly extortion.  She's not threatening to do something.  If that sort of rhetoric works it's only because the Republican's picked a shit candidate that the majority of Americans are afraid to have as President.
