        Lyme Cover-up
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the Lyme surveillance system, you always have at least a tenfold under-reporting. And the CDC even admits Lyme is an epidemic. At least 300,000 people are infected with Lyme disease each year in the United States and that number is grossly underestimated; 10 times than what was first reported! That is 25,000 new cases per month. It is more prevalent than HIV, breast cancer and AIDS. The CDC in their own words states that it is the FASTEST GROWING INFECTIOUS DISEASE in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Multinationals decide which researchers get the cash. Researchers wanting to test the postulation of bacterial etiology of MS are shunned as if they were crackpots. Big Pharma makes billions a year on MS symptom relievers and they trickle millions down to their footsoldiers, the “MS experts”. A cure would be a severe financial blow. Even more so, because there is strong evidence that many other neurological illnesses are caused by germs as well. Because due to the phenomenon of immune privilege there is an inadequate immune response in the brain and spinal cord, making these organs the ideal place for certain slow-dividing spirochetal bacteria to entrench, multiply and cause lesions. The entire concept of antibiotic-resistant, hard-to-test-for chronic CNS infections leading to a plethora of neurological syndromes has to be suppressed and what can’t be suppressed will be craftily discredited. Better to give every expression of a neurological infection its own name such as “MS”, “Alzheimers”, “Parkinsons,” “ALS” and “Fibromyalgia”. And fund armies of ignorant “experts” to obfuscate the issue, whilst boycotting, firing, censoring, smearing and suing those few real experts that refuse to stay in line. Big Pharma is in business to make money, and money is made when people are ill, not when they’re healthy. Anyone standing in their way is relegated to the sidelines. Patents are being bought and shelved so that cures will never see the light of day.

       Even Publications trying to debunk the spirochetal etiology of MS had to face the inconvenient facts; Read here:

      </p>
      <p>
       Synopsis: In MS, the plaques have their origin around veins in the central nervous system. This corresponds with the lesions found in neuroborreliosis. The geographical spread of MS correlates strongly with mean annual temperature. The geographical distribution of the ticks that transmit Lyme disease have a similar geographical distribution. There have been MS “epidemics” in the past where 40 times more cases of MS occurred than normal. Those epidemics appear to correlate with the large-scale introduction of dogs or other animals that are hosts for ticks. Postulates that Borrelia spirochetes may be acting as the trigger in MS, setting off an autoimmune reaction in which patients produce antibodies that attack their own nerve fibers. Mentions that Borrelia eat myelin as well. Notes how many particular and peculiar Lyme symptoms are shared with MS symptoms. Mentions a small study in which two out of eight MS patients tested positive for Lyme disease.

       2000 (Poland): Lyme borreliosis and Multiple sclerosis: Any Connection? A Seroepidemic study. Ann Agric Environ Med. issue 7, 141-143
      </p>
      <p>
       Synopsis: 10 out of 26 MS patients tested positive for Lyme borreliosis. Notes how it is virtually impossible to make a distinction between late stage Lyme disease and Multiple sclerosis, not even with MRI. Diagnosis of MS vs. late stage neuroborreliosis are guesswork – there are no reliable tests for either. Conclusion: Multiple sclerosis may often be associated with Borrelia infection.

       2001 (Norway): Association between Multiple sclerosis and Cystic Structures in Cerebrospinal Fluid. Infect 29:315
      </p>
      <p>
       Synopsis: Borrelia cysts were found in all ten out of ten patients diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. No bacteria were found in a control group. The most modern methods such as a transmission electron microscope were used by a specialist in this narrow field – this may explain why a 100% infection rate was found by Brorson, as opposed to lower rates in other research. The cysts turned into spirochetal bacteria when cultured. Remarks that the bacterial infection theory of MS was abandoned because antibiotics did not help. Remarks that Borrelia bacteria have mechanisms to evade the immune system and survive antibiotics, and offers research evidence for that. Concludes that all ten MS patients have been infected with a spirochete. Dismisses the common criticism that “all those MS patients were also infected with an unrelated Lyme disease” by pointing out how unlikely that is, especially seen the ample research evidence for a spirochetal cause of MS. Concludes that MS could very well be a chronic infection. Points out that there is microbiological and clinical evidence that spirochetal bacteria could be the cause of MS. Notes that the spirochetes may not necessarily be of the genus Borrelia burgdorferi. The chance that 100% of MS patients would also have Lyme neuroborreliosis is astronomically small – about one in 100010, a smaller chance to find a speck of dust lost in the Universe. Epidemiologically speaking, Brorson’s findings are near-absolute proof that MS is caused by spirochetal bacteria.

       2004 (Switzerland): Chronic Lyme borreliosis at the root of Multiple sclerosis – is a cure with antibiotics attainable?
      </p>
      <p>
       Synopsis: Notes that worldwide, MS prevalence parallels the distribution of the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi, and in America and Europe, the birth excesses of those individuals who later in life develop MS, exactly mirror the seasonal distributions of Borrelia transmitting Ixodes ticks. No other disease exhibits equally marked epidemiological clusters by season and locality. Cites research whereby spirochetes were found in the brains of MS patients as early as 1928, and that in over 250 control cases of diversified diseases there never were spirochetes found. Notes that this research has been successfully replicated decades later by different scientists. Points out that a considerable body of clinical evidence supports the concept that cystic L-forms of Borrelia Burgdorferi may cause MS. Dismisses skepticism towards this concept with science-based arguments. Dismisses the hypothesis of genetic origin of MS using scientific research data. Includes graphs showing a direct correlation between the number of MS patients and the number of ticks transmitting Lyme disease. Dismisses the “environmental toxin” hypothesis of MS using scientific research data. Explains how Borrelia could cause all MS symptoms. Recommends trials with antibiotics for MS patients.

       There are many case files and studies as of recent that provide evidence that the Lyme Spirochete can hide from the immune system and engender chronic morbidities; that mimic that of other neurological disease and in fact are the causative reason for the existence of these diseases.

        Criminal Charges; Falsifying diagnostics and Patents
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I would like to talk about the criminal charges of the CDC, Yale and falsifying of the diagnostics. Yale has patents on diagnostic tests that are far more accurate than Lyme Deadborn test (15%) and even then they knew that Lyme disease should be perceived as a relapsing fever organism, undergoing antigenic variation. Hence, sufferers will only produce new igM bands if the Lyme spirochete is still alive and not killed by antibiotics or what ever else you use for eradicating bacteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allan Steere also wrote in that same 1986 report, basis of the 1990 CDC case definition
      </p>
      <p>
       band 41 to diagnose Lyme;; just rule out syphilis: That is important to remember: You only need band 41, or the anti flagellar antibody and the triad of symptoms to diagnose Lyme with common sense rule. Molecular characterization of the humoral response to the 41-kilodalton flagellar antigen of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme Disease spirochete.
      </p>
      <p>
       The earliest humoral response in patients infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, is directed against the spirochete's 41-kDa flagellar antigen a SPECIFIC band in the Western Blot Lyme test. In order to map the epitopes recognized on this antigen, 11 overlapping fragments spanning the flagellin gene were cloned by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into an Escherichia coli expression vector which directed their expression as fusion proteins containing glutathione S-transferase at the N terminus and a flagellin fragment at the C terminus. Affinity-purified fusion proteins were assayed for reactivity on Western blots (immunoblots) with sera from patients with late-stage Lyme disease. The same immunodominant domain was bound by ser a from 17 of 18 patients. This domain (comprising amino acids 197 to 241) does not share significant homology with other bacterial flagellins and therefore may be useful in serological testing for Lyme disease.
      </p>

       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1894359">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       US patent 5, 618, 533 - Yale: detects, early, late, neurological, and every other possible kind of Lyme outcome and that it detects 94.4% of the cases , which means it is the closest possible method we could possibly have to detect Lyme ("should be 100% of the 57 cases," says the FDA, verbatim), and it should be noted that this was a specific method and does not test any other flagellins. When the FDA says "sensitivity," they really mean "LIMIT OF DETECTION" and refer to the METHOD and not the "CASES." “Accuracy” addresses cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yale and their patent would solve these problems, however they did not use this method to qualify LYMErix, their other patent, which is the essence of this False Claims Act. Moreover, the other Borrelia in North America and Europe, at least, such a method should be developed and the NIH agrees with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CDC needs to fund the right people willing to research Lyme and all of its forms. However, they still deny that cyst form of the Lyme spirochete exists because it would then be much easier for Lyme to evade immune response and their antibiotic guidelines. Lyme gets about $20 million/year in funding? That may sound like a lot but to put it in prospective: Cancer gets over $6 BILLION/year. Sleep Research gets $235 million/yr. AIDS gets $3.5 BILLION/yr. Smallpox $31million/yr. And that's just in taxpayers' NIH funds. Smallpox, which the CDC declares is eradicated (no cases since 1977) still gets $30 million/yr in funding. A disease that doesn't even exist anymore gets more research funds than Lyme. And LYME is more prevalent than AIDS and the fastest growing infectious disease in the world! The NIH website can verify each of these numbers. And that's just in taxpayer money. Privately, OHSU just received a $100million gift for cancer research. Bottom line, until there's REAL MONEY in Lyme, NOTHING will be done. Seems to me that the CDC and the IDSA are evading and whitewashing much of Alan MacDonald's research. Why the unwillingness to fund?

       The CDC and Allen Steere knew that Lyme was a relapsing fever organism. It has largely been known since the 80's. It means that the spirochete undergoes antigenic variation. They knew that sufferers would only produce new iGM bands if the spirochete was still alive in the host. They even said that all you need is band 41 to diagnose Lyme (Mentioned Above); just rule out syphilis. They knew this and then labeled Lyme as largely undetectable, hard to get and easy to treat!
      </p>
      <p>
       The CDC conducted fraud regarding the Dead-born diagnostics and are reluctant to fund projects that jeopardize their ridiculous guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Initially: Lyme - Relapsing fever organism; causes various illnesses. Later on: Vaccine candidate; early set of trials; now a non-disease, easily treatable. They then took it off the market and the FDA sued for anti-trust. They simply redefined Lyme to pass off their vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, the Infectious Disease Society of America and the CDC have committed research fraud to falsify the current, Dearborn case definition. And in order to falsify the outcomes of the OspA Vaccines; Lymerix Vaccine, which was pulled not because of the simply trivial statement of anti-vaccine but because of the FDA ultimatum to the manufacturer. Steere and the CDC wanted substantial financial rewards from a monopoly on all tick borne diseases, vaccines and test kits. Their falsification of the case definition and treatment guidelines have left 85% of actual Lyme sufferers unable to obtain diagnosis, treatment, or insurance coverage for their illness. They had significant conflict of interests and looked to collude with various organizations namely the ALDF where they would use their fraudulent recombinant kits.
      </p>
      <p>
       THEY CLAIMED Lyme was not a relapsing fever organism, when they KNEW it was and whistle-blowers and documents in the public domain have showed that these people knew it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the made Lyme largely undetectable despite the obvious test patents that are very accurate and sensitive to various strains. No matter how crazy this sounds these people sought to profit off of these vaccines. People have gotten terribly sick off of the Lymerix vaccine and it is well documented. If you have a test that is only 15% accurate (detects 15% of cases), the defendant would have an 85% effective vaccine!! They also used propagandizing tactics and discredited anyone who became sick and suffered from Lyme symptoms after getting the vaccine.

        Diagnostics
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of all bands on the Western Blot Lyme test as Antibodies, some are highly SPECIFIC for Lyme, others cross react with various infections, while still others are not that important. A patient can be positive or quadruple positive for an antibody on the Western Blot test, namely band,
       <strong>
        18 kDa
       </strong>
       , 21 kDa,
       <strong>
        23 kDa
       </strong>
       , 28 kDa, 30 kDa,
       <strong>
        31 kDa
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        34 kDa
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        39 kDa
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        41 kDa
       </strong>
       , 45 kDa, 58 kDa, 66 kDa,
       <strong>
        83-93 kDa
       </strong>
       . Bands in Bold are HIGHLY SPECIFIC Lyme Antibodies. THe Western Blot features an IgM test (Acute infection) and IgG test (Chronic or Long-term Infection).
      </p>
      <p>
       The IgM response, +, ++, +++, or ++++ for Band 41 on the Western Blot test before the 1994 case definition is all you needed to diagnose Lyme and get the appropriate treatment because it was easy to rule out all the other infections that cross reacted with this specific band.
      </p>
      <p>
       During arthritis from Lyme a new IgM response most likely develops into band 31, which I was positive for. But the new case definition based on research fraud and falsification of diagnostics that is still CURRENTLY BEING USED recommends that an IgG immunoblot be considered positive if five of the following 10 bands are present: 18 kDa, 21 kDa (OspC)*, 28 kDa, 30 kDa, 39 kDa, 41 kDa, 45 kDa, 58 kDa, 66 kDa and 93 kDa.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tested positive for IgM 18 kDa (Specific), 31 kDa (specific), 39 kDa IND (specific); IND means highly likely a single positive, 41 kDa ++++, 83-93 (Specific) IND. I was NEGATIVE by CDC/NYS results, Positive by IGENEX IgM Rsults.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tested positive for IgG 31, 41 kDa ++, 58 kDa +. I was CDC NEGATIVE, IGENEX RESULT IND.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had highly specific Lyme bands, symptoms that classically represented Lyme, a tick that I knew I was bitten by and yet even with a positive result for IGENEX I was refused coverage and treatment. Remember prior to 1994, all that was needed was 41 kDa band to diagnose.
      </p>

       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion, there is growing scientific evidence that chronic Lyme disease does exist, and that this clinical condition is related to persistent infection with B. burgdorferi as shown by microbiological and molecular studies. Persistent infection occurs in animal models and humans because the Lyme spirochete is able to evade both the host immune response and short-course antibiotic therapy to establish chronic infection in protected tissue sites, much like TB. This chronic infection leads to persistent musculoskeletal, neurologic and cardiac symptoms that are the hallmark of chronic Lyme disease. By contrast, the leading theory for persistent symptoms owing to 'post-Lyme syndrome', namely an autoimmune response triggered by the eradicated spirochetal infection, has not been supported by scientific evidence.

        Quote from Alan MacDonald
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We live in an arena where there are political, as well as scientific and medical discussions. And I think that scientific and medical discussions are important, and political discussions sometimes prevent us from getting very far with our science and our medicine. As long as people enter an opportunity for discussion and dialog with preconceived notions about what they will and will not embrace as an idea, you have a political weight that is dragging down the level of the opportunity to learn from discussion or from listening to patients.
       </p>
       <p>
        If people decide that there is no such thing as maternal fetal transmission in Lyme disease, then they can't learn very much when they read my paper, because my paper does show that there is tissue evidence of the infection in newborns that were stillborn, or fetuses that didn't make it to full term.
       </p>
       <p>
        And there are opportunities to read other papers and not understand how dormant conditions can exist for twenty or thirty years, such as the ACA model in Europe. If you enter the discussion with a preconceived notion of what you will or will not take away from the discussion, you can't learn. So politics is an unfortunate mindset, where the mind is closed before the discussion begins. And that's where a lot of, I think, the politics of discord come from in discussing this, or any other infection.
       </p>
       <p>
        You know, in the early days of HIV infection, there was a certain reluctance to see it as a public health problem that we know now HIV infections are, in a worldwide basis. But back in the early eighties, when I was beginning my practice, there wasn't a lot of open mindedness about the need to treat HIV as a medical problem. It was a political problem for people who came from Haiti, or for people who lived in San Francisco who happened to be gay. It was a political problem.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, we have gotten past that and we see that HIV is a chronic infection. It's a medical issue, not a political issue anymore. Sometimes it takes a long time for politics to exit, and for medicine and science to get back on an even keel."

       I'm sorry to hear that. Lyme is just so prevalent, I'm suffering with it at this very moment, I have markedly long story of who I was and what I've become after contracting Lyme and Co-infections. It is the worst feeling in the world when your doctors yell at you, kick you out and the medical establishment deems you psychologically impaired. Countless times they tried to prescribe me anti-psychotics and I refused, only later on did I test positive for neuro-Lyme, something the doctors told me I didn't have. If I had it treated at the appropriate time, I wouldn't be sick today, so I blame my suffering partly on the CDC and their cover-up.

       That sounds exactly like her story, and neuro Lyme is what she has as well. Countless doctors refusing to believe her and telling her she was lazy or making it up. Luckily her parents were friends with a doctor and he believed her but still took years to figure it out. Do you have pic line and are taking the injection antibiotics as well?

       Okay yeah the pic line seems to be working decently, but herxing is no fun. But overall she's having more good days than than she was five months ago so it's promising. Hope everything goes well with you and your new treatment.

       What are the major symptoms of Lymes Disease?  What is the best way of going about getting tested if you think you may have it?  Your diagnostics section is too complicated for me.  Can you ELI5 the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment or direct me to a source?
      </p>
      <p>
       As an aside do you think Lymes was created as a bio weapon?

       The signs and symptoms of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi) in its acute stage
       <strong>
        (Stage 1)
       </strong>
       can include a small bulls-eye rash, that may or may not develop. Most people who contract Lyme, never see a rash. Flu like symptoms 5 to 10 days after contracting Lyme. Some people do not experience any flu-like symptoms, others experience extremely high temperature fevers; however this can manifest years later.
       <strong>
        Stage 2
       </strong>
       of Lyme is a period of calmness, the bacteria disseminates throughout the body; central nervous system, bones and heart. In this stage, for me personally I felt okay, until I had a relapsing fever, as the Lyme Bacterium is a relapsing organism, despite what the CDC claims now. They too believed it to be a relapsing organism before the falsifying of the 1994 case definition.
       <strong>
        STAGE 3
       </strong>
       , occurs a year or two after the contraction of Lyme. Chronic arthritis most likely develops, fluctuating neurological complications develop; including anxiety disorder, bi-polar disorder, autism like symptoms, derealizaton, depersonalization, feelings of detachment, sleep disorders, alzheimer symptoms, memory lapses, epilepsy, suicidal tendencies due to high levels of ammonia and quinolinic acid in the brain, in part because of the infection. In almost all suicides or persons with suicidal tendencies quinolinic acid is elevated. Diet and certain drugs help to inhibit quinolinic acids production. For some people Lyme can hide and remain dormant from the hosts immune system, which is why oftentimes and more times than not a sufferer will test negative for Lyme and be misdiagnosed.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        (Testing)
       </strong>
       The most accurate test for Lyme, other than a culture from a sufferers blood, which is expensive and time-consuming but nonetheless, very accurate is the iGeneX Western Blot test. Most people have to pay out of pocket, some insurance plans will cover it. It tests for the most specific Lyme antibody bands and comes with a immune-fluorescence test, which is preliminary for diagnosis. Lyme however, is a clinical diagnosis.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Stay away from the ELISA test, stick with iGeneX, however, IT IS IMPORTANT that you understand how to interpret the iGeneX test. As I've said before the CDC falsifyed diagnostics to make it harder to test positive. Remember, if you test positive for band 41 on the iGeneX test and have Lyme like symptoms, you are positive. A doctor just has to rule out a few other infections that have much different symptoms. The CDC will say your negative though, and insurance companies will not cover the cost of treatment, however, if this test was taken prior to 1994 the CDC would acknowledged that you had a disseminated infection.

       You can even order the iGeneX test and take it to a blood drawing area; it does need to be signed by a MD or neurologist though. Some doctors will refuse. Also, keep in mind that Co-infections from ticks can come with Lyme including Babesia and Bartonella.

       Bio-weapon? As of recent there has been emerging genospecies that cause Lyme. In my understand, a particular strain has existed for thousands of years. However, after World War II, pardoned Nazi's under the name of Operation Paper Clip worked on Plum Island in anti-animal biological warfare (BW) research. The United States pardoned certain Nazi's because they held a plethora of information regarding biological warfare. In the book Lab 257 and declassified documents, they were experimenting on weaponizing ticks against the soviets; just like many other countries were doing at that time. It seems highly likely, based on poor practice at Lab 257 Lyme made it's way to Lyme, CT, on hosts. These hosts being birds, which were not to be shot on Plum Island because it was a bird sanctuary. However, every other animal was to be killed. Hence, there's a possibility that they unintentionally released Lyme and it proliferated throughout the eastern portion of the US or they deliberately released Lyme, in the intention of observing how it would proliferate throughout the public. It wouldn't be first for the Nazi's or the US to do such a thing. It becomes even more odd, when we understand that the Plum Island facility was researching ticks at the exact time that hundreds of school children in Lyme, CT developed Arthritis and flu-like symptoms. Read the book Lab 257, it's awesome.
