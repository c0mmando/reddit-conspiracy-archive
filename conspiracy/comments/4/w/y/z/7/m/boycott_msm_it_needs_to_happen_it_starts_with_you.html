       How can we make it happen? Mainstream media is easily the downfall of America. How can we promote a global boycott of the mainstream. I mean even if it is just CNN and FOX. If their ratings drop down to next to nothing what will they do? I know I havent watched television let alone MSM for decades. We truly need to wake folks up to the lies and encourage people to turn off their televisions. It is basically the driving force of corruption. Propaganda has always been a powerful tool but it has been taken to another level this election cycle. It NEEDS to be stopped. I dont see any other way of anything changing if people are constantly being fed bullshit information that is in line with our oppressors agenda.

       Thoughts? Does anyone agree this is the #1 problem in America today? How can we change this? BRAINSTORM! No idea is a stupid idea. Lets hear it folks.

       Fake viewer numbers are meaningless if nobody is actually watching. MSM is all about having an audience. An artificial audience does nothing for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would fake viewer numbers manufacture consent? You need viewers to manufacture consent no? Like if nobody is watching, who is consenting? Who's views are being manufactured? I thought that was what manufactured consent was all about. Changing peoples views through MSM propaganda

       They manufacture thousands of astroturfers here and other sites.  All the news and comments are gamed.    If there's little actual audience it's only incidental.  The message will prevail.

       I definitely dont have all the answers but as my OP stated, it starts with you and me. I am doing my part. I am trying to get others around me to do their part. That is why im posting this, trying to encourage others to not only boycott but press for their friends and family to also boycott. We need to remember MSM operates for profit and if there is no profit through advertising they will be forced to change. Or maybe the elite will 100% subsidize? idk. But we need to start somewhere.

       I can only assure you that their system is inherently self destructive, and doing anything to push it one way or another plays right into its hands..  Like a virus, we can only hope to either isolate ourselves from it, or strengthen our immune systems.

       Fake viewer number are not meaningless. They do not care if anyone actually watches, only that they can show to advertisers that viewership is at high enough levels to sell ads. I hear you saying people watching and viewership are the same thing. They are not in the eyes of selling ads. Viewership numbers can be fudged. Have you wondered why certain networks allow there conte t to be seen online for free? The pushes their numbers up. For example CNN auto plays a video when you click on any article and will then to play videos after that. That is one method. The other side to that is advertisers really don't care. They have a budget and need to spend it. I have seen it personally and it amazing that they will literally throw money away.

       Fake viewers trick the sponsors of course. But fake viewers are not being brainwashed is my point. My whole issue is real people watching this bullshit and real people thinking it is real news.

       For the younger tech savvy crowd i agree. The people we need to reach are the older folks (40+) And the neanderthals (dumb cunts). I can only speak for myself, I have awoken many many people over the past few months. Two just recently as i spent the weekend with a few long time friends that had no idea what was going on in the world. I effectively convinced them to cancel their cable subscriptions and only watch what they want to watch and not what they are told to watch, which to me is what television and radio is all about, Force feeding people information.

       T.V. is a one-way form of communication controlled by very wealthy, powerful interest, your local cable access station the only exception. Anyway, that should give some people serious pause. After all, whose message is it anyway?

       My most recent suggestion is for folks to convince their family and friends to cancel their cable subscriptions and tell the providers why. I think it is a GREAT fucking plan and I intend on pushing everyone i know to do it. Id cancel mine but i havent subscribed to cable television in decades.

       I get that. I think what you are getting at is people waking up. In that case it is not only the news bust just about everything any network puts out.

       Btw if you get a chance Google Newsweek covers. The American versions are always different and dumbed down. It is pretty sad.

       If you can't get them to stop consuming MSM (for lack of a better term) maybe you can show them various alternatives to the status quo narrative like Howard Zinn's
       <em>
        A People's History of the United States
       </em>
       which focuses on the history of ordinary citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or George Orwell's
       <em>
        Homage to Catalonia"
       </em>
       which shows an alternative society and goes deep into how the media manipulates or omits news:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The thing that had happened in Spain was, in fact, not merely a civil war, but the beginning of a revolution. It is this fact that the anti-Fascist press outside of Spain has made it its special business to obscure."
       </p>
       <p>
        "What was more important was that once the war had been narrowed down to a 'war for democracy' it became impossible to make any large scale appeal for working class aid abroad." -- George Orwell, Homage to Catalonia

       I don't think it would work. Even with dismal ratings they would still continue on as before. The ones which need to boycott are the advertisers. They are the ones who call the shots.  Everything on the news is paid for. Why else would they feature prominently a new sandwich from McDonalds for example while completely ignoring significant actual news. So long as the news says hillary is in the lead she is. Even if nobody likes her. Same with Trump.

       I like it! How can we start something like this? A lot of people i know are already doing this. I am doing my best as well. But how do we go about reaching the people who are content with their lives? To me this is the toughest part. Reaching those who dont feel there is anything wrong with the system. These are the people we need to reach! But how?!

       This is not complicated. Stop calling it MSM and start calling it what it actually is: ratings-based infotainment product. They are not news channels. Also note that the conservative versions always win the ratings wars because they appeal to the lowest common denominator. The Bell Curve tells us that ignorance is the norm; this is who watches this dreck. They are not smart enough to understand your appeals to reason. Meanwhile, neocons complain about bias because they don't understand the difference between being fair and being balanced. Fair is good; balance is bad. Tbeir ideas are not promoted in a balanced fashion because they are just fucking bad ideas, most of which have been proven failures over the last 40 years (I can't think of one single thing that they were right about, and I used to vote for them).
  On the up side, Rush Limbaugh has driven his employers into bankruptcy while claiming to be worth every penny of his ridiculously expensive contract. This was done by boycotting advertisers. Perhaps that's the way to go, since Neilson boxes will continue to bedazzle morons.

       Okay, so, here's the thing: The 2013 version of the NDAA repealed a law from 1948 that outlawed government propaganda directed at the American public. So for the last three years, government-disseminated propaganda has been legal. News story here:
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5">
        http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, we should assume this propaganda is being disseminated all over MSM, as well as on social networks, including this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       More legit debunking sites is great, but you have to convince a mainstream audience that what you're saying is true. That's not easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politicians regulating it wouldn't happen; it'd just get vetoed. Writing sponsors won't work; they don't care what you think and they're probably in on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boycotting sponsors is a good idea, because they all produce shit that's not good for you to begin with, so stop spending your money on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to combat this is to just turn off your TV. Cancel your cable plan. Stop logging on to their websites. If ratings and web traffic go down, no one is seeing this propaganda. Hell, I'd say cancel your internet plan too, but it's too powerful a tool to give up at this point; we need it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my point is: vote with your lifestyle. As long as we live in a system fueled by greed and money, choose to spend what you have on clean water and foods and household products that are sourced and produced sustainably. Get healthy physically and mentally that way you're not dependent on any "medicines". Educate yourselves on the system; read up on Austrian economics and fiat currency. Invest in precious metals and maybe some cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Take whatever money you can and invest it in yourself. This society is built to take power away from the individual, so take your own spending power back. MSM is just a cog in the machine.

       Agree 100% but we need to start somewhere and to me canceling our cable subscriptions while informing the providers the reasoning is a perfect start.
      </p>
      <p>
       And honestly, who the fuck needs TV anymore? I havent had it for decades and havent missed a show and havent seen a commercial interruption. Not only is cable television a powerful propaganda tool, it is fucking outdated and useless in the age of the internet.

       Start small my friend. Cancel your cable television subscription and inform your provider the reasoning. After you do this convince others to do the same. It is a multi-billion dollar industry that will crumble if enough people cancel.

       MSM is ruining my familial relationships. Anything we can do to stop it is ace.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll note, however, that canceling cable won't do it. Family that consumes only Internet and radio is just as misinformed/fearful/hateful as family that watches MSNBC or FoxNews all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to teach people to question sources and do some basic common sense-checking. I know so many intelligent people that look to their sources as some kind of God - they believe the text on faith.

       i know one single suggestion wont do it. But you have to start somewhere. Convince them to cancel for other reasons whatever it is. Even maybe watch it with them and point out how flawed and biased/bullshit the network is.

       Yes but I wouldnt care what "they" think. For more people to engage their critical thinking this would work wonders. But it needs to be accessible to dumb cunts. So maybe like a Mythbusters style show but about the Mainstream Media. Basically an "ELI5 Fake News"

       We also need to remember part of waking people up is stopping them from feeding into the lies. Part of that is stopping them from seeing the brainwashing MSM. I think only good can come out of encouraging people to stop watching.

       I think Facebook is a huge issue as well. I cut the cord a long time ago and it's been nothing but healthy. Also, I listen to
       <a href="http://www.noagendashow.com/">
        podcasts like No Agenda
       </a>
       that deconstruct media so I know what those jokers are up to.

       Won't work. People would never give up their pacifiers unless they truly understood whats going on around them.

       It's important to understand, many people who participate in this sub, are exceptions to a rule. Look at our numbers compared to r/politics or r/aww. Granted, they have been recently overtaken by shills and fake accounts but our numbers have never been comparable. Read some of the posts on this sub of people who are "snapping out of it". It takes a hell of a lot to make that happen. Making it happen is the first step we need to take. If not, any move we try to make will fail.
