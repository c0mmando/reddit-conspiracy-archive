        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Received a compelling email (below) which makes some bold claims. While I don&#39;t necessarily agree with the claims, I do agree there&#39;s something being hidden here.</p>

<p>If this is true, the DNC is actively trying to push a candidate with a disease without disclosing that disease to the American public. </p>

<p>Email:
Hillary Clinton has Parkinson&#39;s Disease.</p>

<p>Here is her trained body man seen carrying a diazepam auto-injector after her DNC speech:
<a href="https://i.sli.mg/9cSYuQ.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/9cSYuQ.jpg</a></p>

<p>Here she is exhibiting involuntary facial movements, tremor, and rigidity, when interrupted by hecklers. Notice how her body man (not a SS agent) gets to her immediately, and tells her to &quot;keep talking&quot; and she immediately snaps out her trance and says &quot;I&#39;m going to keep talking&quot;.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Sty0Bqzjs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Sty0Bqzjs</a></p>

<p>Here she is experiencing diskinesia when startled by a sudden question.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gYplpPmbXI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gYplpPmbXI</a></p>

<p>She plays it off as a joke, but her body keeps moving. People are wrongly calling this a &quot;seizure&quot;. This is not a seizure. This is diskinesia. It is a symptom of levodopa treatment for Parkinson&#39;s disease. The diazepam auto-injector her body man carries is a rapid but temporary treatment for the diskinesia if it happens in public. The side-effects of the diazepam treatment are fatigue, muscle weakness, confusion, and difficulty walking.
<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/08/unstable-hillary-gets-help-climbing-stairs/">http://www.wnd.com/2016/08/unstable-hillary-gets-help-climbing-stairs/</a></p>

<p>Were you wondering why hecklers at a rally are a major security concern? It&#39;s because anything startling can trigger her episodes. That&#39;s why her handlers immediately rushed on stage when they saw her freeze up and start making involuntary mouth movements.</p>

<p>Hillary has forbidden press from taking video or photos of her getting on or off her plane. This rule has been in effect for years, even going back to when she was heading the state department. The reason? She often needs to be assisted or even carried up and down the stairs. This has been stated by numerous whistle-blowers, including former SS agents.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re wondering why there aren&#39;t more examples, I will point out that Hillary has held only one press conference (one!) in the last 260 days -- unheard of for a presidential candidate. She has made no public appearance that was not under 30 minutes, and entirely scripted, down to the questions asked, since her last debate with Bernie Sanders -- during which she took an unscheduled 45 minute &quot;bathroom&quot; break in the middle.
Hillary Clinton is a very sick woman, and is likely dying. She has at least one degenerative disease, and is receiving regular treatments that affect mood, personality, energy level, and the ability to think and reason clearly. She is taking levodopa, valium, and possibly other drugs as well in order to appear normal in public. She is also concealing all of this from the public.</p>

<p>She may in fact be taking so much valium to offset the levodopa treatment that she is experiencing periodic withdrawals, which would explain her horrible temper and the episodes of rage which have been described by former staffers, SS agents, and assistants.

<p>Anyways, here&#39;s Martin Shkreli, former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, speaking to the point.
<a href="https://twitter.com/1080p/status/762430843520360448">https://twitter.com/1080p/status/762430843520360448</a></p>

<p>Some people have commented on her &quot;coughing fits&quot; and that she might have cancer or something else.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o7FIsd8XGw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o7FIsd8XGw</a></p>

<p>Personally, I think this is also involuntary movement. That crater in her mouth isn&#39;t a chancre caused by stage 2 syphilis, as some have suggested. It&#39;s a lozenge. She has coughing fits. Specifically, involuntary upper respiratory spasm, difficulty swallowing, and inefficacy of normal coughing. These symptoms are consistent with Parkinson&#39;s disease.

<p>Hillary Clinton has Parkinson&#39;s Disease, has had it for a while, is undergoing treatment for it that involves the use of mood-altering drugs, and she is concealing all of this from the public.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this question:
In a free country with a free media, with free elections, where an important possibility exists that has actual evidence to back it up, evidence that people have already presented, that has been available for months, and that I was able to find and accumulate in twenty minutes...</p>

<p>Why haven&#39;t you at least heard about this?</p>

<p>It seems her last physical was in Spring 2015. She does have thyroid issues and takes Coumadin to prevent blood clots.</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/3980454/hillary-clinton-health-doctor/">“In summary, Mrs. Clinton is a healthy female with hypothyroidism and seasonal allergies, on longterm anticoagulation,” Bardack concludes. “She participates in a healthy lifestyle and has had a full medical evaluation, which reveals no evidence of additional medical issues or cardiovascular disease. Her cancer screening evaluations are all negative. She is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as President of the United States.”</a></p>

<p>I think whoever that handler is, is where the real story lies. Someone needs to do some research on who that large black bald male is (for descriptive labeling only).</p>

<p>Edit: Oh Jesus, throw me in the well <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/08/08/is-this-hillary-clintons-medical-handler/">for presenting this as a valid source</a>, but today someone did a pretty good job of bookending your proofs here with some possible info on the handler/doctor/security man. It seems he is an expert in.....</p>

<p>It&#39;s a classic technique to manipulate people. Now there will be people all over the country/world who want to believe an idea and will find &quot;proof&quot; of its existence. Believers will swap stories, ideas, etc all because a select few people they consider trustworthy set it all in motion.</p>

<p>We&#39;re /conspiracy here - we should question the stories pushed around by people in power and not just the people in power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah. So a secret service agent is carrying something in his hand and people just assume it is a medical device? You would think if she had issues, is rich, has SS protection, etc that there would be a doctor standing close by. </p>

<p>Now, I could see the SS having medical devices on hand to counteract possible attacks (anti-venom/etc). Overall - I think people read way too much into things (and why carry it in hand? The guy has pockets). </p>
