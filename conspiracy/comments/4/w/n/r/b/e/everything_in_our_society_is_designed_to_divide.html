        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>People, we are in trouble and it&#39;s our own damn fault for letting it happen.  <em>How did the world get so crazy?</em> One small, carefully-planned step at a time.  Who do we have to thank for this mass hysteria?  Dogs and cats?  Afraid not, it is in fact our old friends the Illuminati.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been trained to treat that as a &#39;crazy&#39; word.  <em>Oh, he said Illuminati, he&#39;s crazy.</em>  Is it really hard to realize that there&#39;s a handful of families at the very top of our global capitalism food chain and that they control a disproportionate amount of assets and wield too much power?  That&#39;s not speculation, that&#39;s how our system works.</p>

<p>These people control our media and through it, our global dialogue.   And they want you scared.  From JFK to 9/11 to (quite likely) the recent Dallas shootings, they orchestrate and televise these events.  And then they keep reminding you of them.  <em>Look how terrible some of your fellow man can be!  Be scared!  Be scared!</em></p>

<p>When they can&#39;t be bothered to commit a war crime, they&#39;re filling our time with stories designed to do one thing: give you an opinion.  Put you into Group A so you argue and fight with Group B.  News, sports, and far too much of our art is broadcast out solely to divide.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the rest of that phrase?  Divide and.. divide and.. uhh.. ah right, <em>conquer</em>.</p>

<p>Everyone, coming real damn soon is something big to remind us how terrible things are once again.  It will happen in the middle of the day, on live TV, and the reality of the situation will be obfuscated with the same lies.  It is highly-likely to happen in America.  I&#39;m not informed by any source here, this is just my hunch.</p>

<p>These people have alien technology and <em>I am very, very serious</em>.  Almost everything that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a3IXw1nGCw">Bill Cooper told us a long time ago</a> about Eisenhower making first contact and how the Illuminati managed to take control is entirely true.  Bill was a ex-Navy whistleblower who had not only seen an alien craft but worked in the office that handled the related paperwork.  Please give him 10 minutes and if you think he&#39;s not telling the truth, you&#39;re welcome to that opinion.</p>

<p>If we do not start talking about these things all the damn time to every damn one, <em>we are doomed</em>.  We are in serious, serious trouble and it is only going to get worse as their master plan continues to unfold.  We have to &#39;wake-up&#39; the people around us, the people we know, and we have to keep telling them about it until they listen.</p>

<p>I love each and every one of you people who got lost on this space-rock called Earth.  I am so very sorry that I let this very small part of our society convince me that we were all so terrible for so long.  </p>

<p>Good news everyone!  People are inherently good!  Being altruistic is good for our survival, it&#39;s in our genes.  We live in a <em>magic</em> universe, so far more magic than we&#39;re currently allowed to see and what comes next is nothing short of wonderful.</p>

<p>It is time to stop fighting amongst ourselves.  It is time to start loving every single goddamn being without malice in its heart.  <em>We are losing a secret war</em> and we first have to prove it&#39;s there before we have the slightest chance to win.</p>

<p>Everyone, it&#39;s time to awaken.  It&#39;s time to talk.  It&#39;s time to remember love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe we should start calling the illuminati the aristocracy again. Are they not the same? Only this time they dress it up with elaborate symbols and also have extra tech, making us extra-superstitious meanwhile they are the same same old vultures who look down at us.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, on second thought, I think it <em>is</em> important that we call them the Illuminati.  These people operate like a religious cult.  There is symbology absolutely everywhere in their organizations.  They gather at Bohemian Grove and perform distinctly-pagan rituals.</p>

<p>I think the Illuminati shoe best fits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Calling them &quot;the Illuminati&quot; would be a compliment they don&#39;t deserve. It would be calling them &quot;the enlightened ones&quot;, which they are clearly not. Enlightened individuals do not mettle and engage in such activities that are self-serving and malevolent to the world as a whole. Enlightened individuals have no interest in such petty things like money and dominance. They would seek things like ascension and growth, and the growth of our species would only come through co-operation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That inversion of meaning is part of the game. They were never the illuminati. They just absorbed that name and turned  it into this parlor game by using Egyptian and other occult iconography to keep us bewildered about what&#39;s going on. And you go on these wild goose chases trying to find the meaning of it all. All the while they use their aristocratic esque secret societies to recruit, think tanks to lock in agendas, and multinationals to continue to maintain power and control in the present. Meanwhile all the average person can do is see a hand symbol or triangle and say &quot;illuminati&quot; which is worthless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;m with you on the global cabal of a small-ish group of families who use war, policing, terrorism, false-flag events, media, and pop culture to keep people divided, busy, and afraid of change. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if you call them Illuminati. I call them capitalists. Bilderberg Buddies. The elites. The aristocracy. Anderson Cooper&#39;s family. Whatever. </p>

<p>BUTTTTTT, why do they need alien technology to do any of this? </p>

<p>AND it seems like a small group of people has always been in control of complex societies, and globalization has only intensified this trend. </p>

<p><strong>So are we worried about agenda 21 or some sort of aliens are getting ready to invade scenario here? Or are we just worried...like they want us to be!!!!</strong></p>

<p>Heeeeeeeeey, r/conspiracy, what if we spent all this time imagining ways to change things for the better rather than trying to imagine horrible outcomes and piece together conspiracies. What if we actually went out and did things to make the world better, r/conspiracy?</p>

<p>OP, I like your message at the end. We do need more unity and love for each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that they <em>need</em> alien tech, it&#39;s the fact that they <em>have</em> it and they&#39;ve used it against us.  Seriously!</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yri3ZSVjjnA">this interview with Dr. Judy Wood</a>.  She&#39;s a forensics engineer who spent a decade analyzing the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.  She never comes right out and <em>says</em> that it&#39;s alien tech-- because she knows that might just get her killed-- but she does support my &quot;free energy is real!&quot; claims.  How did the building fall so fast (and where did the debris vanish to)?  They literally destabilized it on a molecular level from the top-down.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a thought experiment: find a vid of one of the WTC towers falling.  Mute it.  Tell me what movie first comes to mind.</p>

<p>And yes, it&#39;s not entirely-related to the point I was trying to make with this post, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/predictions/comments/4wkjap/we_will_see_a_false_flag_alien_invasion_this_year/">I do think we&#39;ll see a false flag alien invasion very very soon.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe we&#39;re being visited by real aliens and interdimensional beings, and that most of them are benevolent (and way beyond our technological capabilities). </p>

<p>Certain parts of the &quot;government&quot;/MIC may be planning to stage a false flag alien attack, <em>or</em> they could stage a benevolent &quot;alien takeover&quot; and use that to impose the NWO. Like John Lear says, these &quot;benevolent aliens&quot; might demand that people hand over their guns, since &quot;guns are bad mm&#39;kay&quot;. </p>

<p>However, with the whole &quot;war on terror&quot; still raging and still lots of milk in the udder of the &quot;Jihadist Cow&quot;, it would seem rushed if TPTB staged their alien attack right now. It would rush the narrative too much, and be bad storytelling. The Illuminati are storytellers, after all. I think they&#39;re gonna keep milking the &quot;jihadi terror&quot; cow for a while, and then introduce the &quot;aliens&quot; when the udder is dry. Perhaps seven years from now? </p>

<p>But I&#39;m still willing to entertain the notion that I&#39;m wrong. That&#39;s why I like reading <a href="http://www.redefininggod.com">www.redefininggod.com</a>, where the &quot;benevolent alien&quot; NWO takeover is explained in great detail. The arguments of that guy are actually very good. Everyone should definitely read &quot;NWO schedule of implementation&quot; and &quot;End times programming&quot;. Very entertaining stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny you should say that.</p>

<p>It was Nikola Tesla who first made contact with the aliens.  He&#39;d already been involved with the Philadelphia Experiment, so the gov&#39;t was well-familiar with his work.  This was around 1952 under the presidency of Truman, however it was under Eisenhower that most of them came.</p>

<p>We were first contacted by a race hovering well-above our equator.  They offered to assist us with our spiritual development, but only if we were willing to destroy all of our nuclear weapons.  They were not interested in exchanging technology; they didn&#39;t feel we were ready for it as a species.</p>

<p>We told them no.  I&#39;d like to say I think that was a big mistake, but considering this was their very-first encounter with another intelligent race and nukes were our best hope if they became hostile I can&#39;t really blame Truman for the decision.</p>

<p>Next came the shit-smelling Greys.  They were happy to share their tech in exchange for permission to carry out genetic experiments on humans.  These foul things have been feeding on us ever since.  <a href="https://youtu.be/AGglyC8QEnk?t=1h27m31s">Apparently you can get them drunk by spraying them with Lysol.</a></p>

<p>...I know way too much about this, but I needed to in order to believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the vid. Watching it now. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not surprising that Tesla would be the first to make contact, btw. I guess the really advanced aliens, the ones who contacted us first, are monitoring all human consciousness. They probably have direct access to the Akashic records, and saw that Tesla was the most &quot;evolved&quot; human being alive at the time, so to speak. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That vid is just the most amazingly out-there thing I&#39;ve ever seen.  I certainly didn&#39;t believe it was all true when I first watched it; not until I&#39;d seen how it fit into a much larger picture.</p>

<p>An interesting tidbit about Tesla:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions.  Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he would be able to envision it in realistic detail. </p>

<p>Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Physical manifestation from thought (and EMF) is one of the things you&#39;ll hear mentioned in relation to Montauk.  It&#39;s possible that (some of) Tesla&#39;s inventions where psychically &#39;sent&#39; to him by these very aliens so we could communicate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s not hard for me to believe in aliens, since I suspect I&#39;ve been in contact with the more advanced kind myself. I.e. the kind with admin access to our reality simulation. I actually suspect they created the whole thing, but it&#39;s hard to tell. They haven&#39;t told me so directly. They did tell me that a global disaster is coming though, without specifying what kind of disaster or when it would occur (even though I asked). I think we&#39;ll see the disaster(s) this September, at the latest. </p>

<p>The people in the interview seem genuine enough to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I know about Tesla and the initial contact is from Al Beleik, linked in the post.  All the magic is a product of electromagnetism and running interference patterns through a field.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Qkq1IzEQaM">Preston Nichols covers some of the details here.</a></p>

<p>edit: <a href="https://youtu.be/dVsRzLBc4tg?t=26m59s">Bill Cooper also talks about the first contact</a> and how we told the first group &#39;no&#39;.  Link starts at that part of the story.</p>

<p>We are electrical creatures, it powers our minds and our nervous system.  We basically amount to nothing more than a unique universal vibration.  Find the vibration (which includes the quantum data, all the way down to the subatomic level) and it&#39;s just a matter of copying the disk.  (Yes, you can make clones but you cannot let them affect each other causality-wise.  Not sure why.)</p>

<p>The only proof I can offer is the eyewitness reports of others.  Well, and a weird childhood experience you&#39;d chalk up to sleep paralysis.  There are pictures out there but many of them are indeed fake.</p>

<p>I know a lot about this, do ask if you have questions.  I&#39;ll cite sources when I can but I&#39;ll warn ya it&#39;s all VHS transfers: the ancient tomes of the 21st century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are much more than a vibration, or at least anything representing the entirety of our bodies would be one hell of a long vibration pattern. After mapping our electrochemistry, there is technology which reproduces the exact layout of energy and matter in our minds, from the subatomic level? How? We know you can&#39;t even observe things on this level without changing their location, much less build complex things, with whatever sort of fields or microtechnology.

<p>I’m going to say yes on principle, simply because when you take the various groups and subsections of humanity, left to their own devices, you’ll find only a handful that would actively work against their own group (or “group”, as the case may be) like our current elite do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to then question why? Pretty sure they ain&#39;t doing this for fun. So you can take 2 views, that they&#39;re simply doing this for the sake of it. You accept the atheistic narrative that they&#39;ve pushed on us to make us think were insignificant, Don&#39;t matter and we&#39;re here by chance.</p>

<p>Or you can take the other option in which they&#39;re lying too us about basically every nature of our reality. I mean with the tech they have they obviously know what&#39;s going on at this point. And if their is a God they know whom he is. Because these guys probably have access to every single religious text and historical manuscripts in existence.</p>

<p>Hence to me it makes no sense why they&#39;d be doing this shit for fun if it had no truth in it. Either way time will tell whats going to happen. But for me personally it&#39;s pretty obvious their&#39;s more to our reality than us existing due to abiogenesis.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES.  Did I mention.. yes?  We live in a magic universe!!  We are creatures of spirit, &#39;psychic&#39; powers are quite real, and there are secrets about electromagnetism hidden from us.</p>

<p>There is an entire secret part of the universe that we are told over and over isn&#39;t really there.  That is the biggest tragedy of any of this.  We&#39;re told it&#39;s not there until we start telling it to ourselves.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, no.  God exists in the quantum too.  Even with alien tech, I don&#39;t think you can dial him up.</p>

<p>Preston Nichols, who&#39;s just become my favorite geek, says that God is a self-aware computer of sorts.  I personally just view God as &quot;the force behind the parts of the universe we can never explain&quot;.  In other words &quot;the reason there&#39;s something instead of nothing.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my Biblical view. God is like a spirit. Can&#39;t really explain it because I cant fully fathom him. I don&#39;t think we could really truly understand his nature. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like your analogy of a super computer type of thing. Plus it sounds kind of like that trans humanism new age thing where they want everyone to plug into a super computer called the singularity or something haha.</p>

<p>Well personally I think God communicates with us constantly. I mean when I first got into this conspiracy stuff and started questioning God and the Bible I had a lot of odd things start happening in my house. </p>

<p>Like coming home from a midnight walk after just thinking about God on my walk and I get home, the radio is on at night downstairs quite loud and a song is singing about revelation. And I&#39;d actually being thinking about some of that stuff in the book. So yeh whatever the true nature of this universe is. They&#39;re hiding it and making it seem too us like its got nothing of the spiritual side.</p>

<p>But then they&#39;ll happily do all these occult ceremonies like the Switzerland tunnel ceremony with the dancing Goat,fallen angels etc. Then just look at the road lay outs of some city&#39;s. and the numerology/gematria they use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>personally, I think that there was a civilization of sorts, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, if you will, that existed prior to us and that it destroyed itself in a war and that modern humans are byproducts of it, and that the masons represent a power structure that is aware of it, and are possibly in communication with a survivor from that civilization that we would think of as being satan, but they think of as being their god, because he showed them knowledge. This entity helped them write the koran, the bible, and the torah, and has been guiding their leadership as they &quot;rebuild Atlantis&quot; for it and themselves. Egypt was the first time that this priesthood really coalesced back together, and that&#39;s why they love egypt so much. Teh book of revelations is just this entity telling us about the world it&#39;s creating for us and what&#39;s been planned. </p>

<p>Which of these best explains the destruction of all <em>seven</em> WTC buildings to you?  Remember we&#39;re talking about a combination of at least 300 stories of steel and concrete.</p>

<p>1) Two planes destroyed seven buildings with fuel and fire.<br/>
2) All seven buildings were demolished with explosives.<br/>
3) The buildings were destabilized on a subatomic level.</p>

<p>I personally believe a combination of #2 and #3 is the answer.  It&#39;s part of how they got away with it, no one will suspect a technology they don&#39;t know is out there.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve gathered from listening to things about Montauk is that EMF starts do all these crazy things when you start running interference through it.  Dr. Wood suggests that a hurricane that strangely-travelled up the coast towards NYC, stayed near during the day of 9/11, and then turned away after WTC7 fell would be one possible source for extra electromagnetic energy.</p>

<p>Capitalism is nothing more than the exchange of a product or service between two people free from force, fraud and coercion.</p>

<p>The problem, therefore, is not capitalism, but <em>crony capitalism</em>. Also known as fascism. It&#39;s the marriage between captialism and government. The only possible solution (if you value freedom) is to limit the power of government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>UFOlogy is nowhere close to an answer to anything.  UFOlogy is a cottage industry; a talk show circuit where fraudulent cranks make money from the gullible and those seeking entertainment, and not really anything more.  I don&#39;t claim to know one way or the other whether or not Bill Cooper was one of said cranks.  I do know that he is a hero among the Disclosure demographic, but by itself that proves exactly zero.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Divide and.. divide and.. uhh.. ah right, conquer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unity works just as well for conquest as division; it could more accurately be said that conquest represents the end state of unity.  The only thing unity ultimately means, is that <strong><em>someone else</em></strong> is making the important decisions in <strong><em>your</em></strong> life.  As long as said other person is making said decisions in such a way that you could not do it better yourself anyway, then that is fine; but when said other person is an unaccountable psychopath, then that is a serious problem.</p>

<p>If I had benevolent, competent government, then of course I am going to let them make all the hard decisions.  Why wouldn&#39;t I?  I get to go and sit and meditate and get stoned, and they get to deal with the pain and suffering.  Yet if government consists of psychopaths and/or morons, then I am far better off making said decisions for myself, because psychopaths only make decisions to benefit themselves, not me.</p>

<p>This is what proves that, while the sovereignty movement has good arguments in some respects, in one aspect they are very silly.  They do not realise that the very fact that we <strong><em>have</em></strong> bad government is the only reason why their movement exists at all; because if we had good government, we would have no need to govern ourselves seperately, and most likely no desire to do so, because things would be fine.</p>

<p>Anarchy is not the answer.  The answer is a combination of good government, and judiciously sending the psychopaths to the woodpile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite literally.  First you hide a rabbit in a hat and then you.. wait, no.</p>

<p>All my life I&#39;d believed that aliens must be out there &quot;somewhere&quot; but I never thought they&#39;d be here because I&#39;ve always been told that FTL travel was impossible.  Well, hey hey, turns out it&#39;s not!  Every point in spacetime has a corresponding vibration and opening a portal to it is as simple as finding the vibration (and sending phase-interrupts into a powerful electromagnetic field.)  The U.S. government was secretly doing just that at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGglyC8QEnk">Montauk Project</a> in the late 70s/ early 80s.</p>

<p>M-Theory, the current leading successor to string theory that tries to explain the interactions of particles, says that there&#39;s 7 extra dimensions curled up upon themselves within our standard 4.  <em>We can draw energy from them.</em>  Seriously!  It&#39;s a very similar mechanic (I&#39;m assuming with my layman&#39;s knowledge of physics) to how dark energy causes the empty space between galaxies to forever expand.  Neither breaks the second law of thermodynamics (&quot;energy cannot be created or destroyed&quot;) because the energy comes from quantum fluxuations.</p>

<p>We are quantum creatures.  Our consciousness stems from that subatomic realm; if it didn&#39;t we could build a big machine, turn it on, and call it Mike.  At our essence, we exist in a realm that quantum physics tells us is less &#39;real&#39; like the things we see and more <em>probabilistic</em> in nature.</p>

<p>If I had to sum that all up in a word?  <em>Magic</em>.</p>

<p>A Harvard study done for ten years involving over 26,000 people.</p>

<p>Harvard professor of political science Robert D. Putnam conducted a nearly decade long study how multiculturalism affects social trust. He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that–when the data were adjusted for class income and other factors–the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust. People in diverse communities “don’t trust the local mayor, they don&#39;t trust the local paper, they don&#39;t trust other people and they don’t trust institutions,” writes Putnam. In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that “…we hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it’s not just that we don’t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don’t trust people who do look like us.</p>

<p>Even Halyard knows this is all a pile of “feel good” shit. Like a religion, it relies on persecuting those who don’t agree to keep itself mainstream thought.</p>

<p>After the study was released, Putnam was intimidated and harassed because he was accused of helping racists. He later came out and gave a very vague statement saying diversity “had problems but was worth it in the long run” to keep these morons appeased. This statement gives no indication of the “long run” and, in fact, is not quantified by anything. </p>

<p>~:~</p>

<p>According to conflict theory, distrust between ethnic groups rises with diversity, but not within a group. Putnam describes people of all races and socioeconomic statuses, ages, and both sexes as “hunkering down,” avoiding engagement with their local community–both among different ethnic groups and within their own ethnic group. Even when controlling for income inequality and crime rates–two factors which conflict theory states should be the prime causal factors in declining interethnic group trust–more diversity is still associated with less communal trust.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Lowered trust in areas with high diversity is also associated with:</li>
<li>  Lower confidence in local government, local leaders, and the local news media</li>
<li>  Lower political efficacy–that is, confidence in one’s own influence</li>
<li>  Lower frequency of registering to vote, but more interest and knowledge about politics and more participation in protest marches and social reform groups.</li>
<li>  Higher political advocacy, but lower expectations that it will bring about a desirable result</li>
<li>  Less expectation that others will cooperate to solve dilemmas of collective action (e.g. voluntary conservation to ease a water or energy shortage)</li>
<li>  Less likelihood of working on a community project</li>
<li>  Less likelihood of giving to charity or volunteering</li>
<li>  Fewer close friends and confidants</li>
<li>  Less happiness and lower perceived quality of life</li>
<li>  More time spent watching television and more agreement that “television is my most important form of entertainment”</li>
</ul>

<p>Putnam’s study was published in 2001. Genetic cluster analysis of the micro satellite markers produced four major clusters, which showed near perfect correspondence with the four self-reported race/ethnicity categories. Of 3636 subjects, only 5 (0.14%) showed genetic cluster membership different from their self-identified race/ethnicity. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15625622">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15625622</a></p>

<p><strong>Good Fences: The Importance of Setting Boundaries for Peaceful Coexistence</strong></p>

<p>Alex Rutherford, Dion Harmon, Justin Werfel, Shlomiya Bar-Yam, Alexander Gard-Murray, Andreas Gros, Yaneer Bar-Yam</p>

<p>We consider the conditions of peace and violence among ethnic groups, testing a theory designed to predict the locations of violence and interventions that can promote peace. Characterizing the model’s success in predicting peace requires examples where peace prevails despite diversity. Switzerland is recognized as a country of peace, stability, and prosperity. This is surprising because of its linguistic and religious diversity that in other parts of the world lead to conflict and violence. Here we analyze how peaceful stability is maintained. Our analysis shows that peace does not depend on integrated coexistence, but rather on well-defined topographical and political boundaries separating groups. Mountains and lakes are an important part of the boundaries between sharply defined linguistic areas. Political canton and circle (sub-canton) boundaries often separate religious groups.</p>

<p>Where such boundaries do not appear to be sufficient, we find that specific aspects of the population distribution either guarantee sufficient separation or sufficient mixing to inhibit intergroup violence according to the quantitative theory of conflict. In exactly one region, a porous mountain range does not adequately separate linguistic groups and violent conflict has led to the recent creation of the canton of Jura. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that violence between groups can be inhibited by physical and political boundaries. A similar analysis of the area of the former Yugoslavia shows that during widespread ethnic violence, existing political boundaries did not coincide with the boundaries of distinct groups, but the peace prevailed in specific areas where they did coincide. The success of peace in Switzerland may serve as a model to resolve conflict in other ethnically diverse countries and regions of the world.</p>

<p>preferring to be in the presence of other minorities is not a solely Jewish trait.</p>

<p>Um, what do Jewish people have to do with it?</p>

<p>minorities can find safe haven in each others presence in diversity tolerant societies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is rather absurd. Ethnic diversity leads to ethnic conflict. Minorities do NOT find &quot;safe haven&quot; with each other - they usually conflict with each other. See - Los Angeles.</p>

<p>In fact, the only time two different ethnic groups can actually cooperate is when they are ganging up on a third ethnic group.</p>

<p>Better just let everyone have their own territory. Good fences make good neighbors - ask the Israelis (speaking of Jews.)</p>

<p>I mentioned it initially. There’s a published quote somewhere; I’ll try to find it again.</p>

<p>AHA! This isn’t even what I wanted, but it’s someone else <a href="http://www.jpr.org.uk/news/detail.php?id=116">saying</a> the same thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Göran Rosenberg recalled that historically, Jews had always thrived in nations and empires with multicultural, pluralistic and tolerant environments, while they fared badly in strong ethnic or nationalistic societies. European Jews have always been the emblematic stranger or ‘other’. Therefore, by definition, a society where the stranger is welcome is good for the Jews, although they have not always appreciated this link.[…]The future of European Jewry is dependent on our ability to shape a multicultural, pluralistic and diverse society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The link seems to have broken; it’s from a speech in 2008. If you want pretty much the definitive source on this, chapter 2 of <em>The Culture of Critique</em> should be read.</p>

<p>The original comment said that Jews prefer living among a lot of minorities. I&#39;m a minority, non-Jewish, and people in my minority community express a similar desire to live in safe spaces, which tend to be where cultural diversity is common. </p>

<p>So, I sought to correct this misunderstanding because I think there are a lot of Jew-hating folks on the board who don&#39;t have the capacity to understand what it&#39;s like, for Jews and other minorities, living as a minority in a hostile majority culture. </p>

<p>My point is that this isn&#39;t a Jewish opinion alone. </p>

<p>So, what you mean by &quot;Diversity&quot; is actually &quot;lots of people like me and fewer white people.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words - you prefer to be among your own kind.</p>

<p>When whites do it it&#39;s called &quot;racism&quot; and when non-whites do it it&#39;s called &quot;diversity.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you got a really important point although it&#39;s not the point of your post, so i feel like outlining it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s, at a basic level, an emotional war.
&quot;the purpose of propaganda is to make a human segment forget another segment is human&quot;
They want you to feel guilty for their crimes (you know your state did this and this! you are in too!) and to be wary (well, TOO wary) of other humans aptness for evil. They may be, but for the very same reason usually (aka, they are really wary). True evil is an outlier.</p>

<p>FUCK THAT</p>

<p>Keep trusting and refuse to feel guilty just for being born in the &quot;wrong age&quot; (to me, this age is ok, but i had a lot to adapt emotionally to welcome the challenge).
Do the opposite. Live feelin like a king and try to get your pals to do the same. Open a positive cicle of energy. Live laughing of these cocksuckers (illuminati). They are a joke upon the crown of consciousness.</p>

<p>They are &quot;lucifer&quot; the tester of human consciousness for &quot;god&quot; to judge. They are that way because they lack judgement themselves. Do not submit to their faulty judgement. Develop yours in a way that defy theirs.</p>

<p>We need to learn to come from above upon this world. Christ had a lot to say about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually i&#39;m studying Torah and hebrew and it seems beautiful.
Torah is all code, every hebrew letter is made from it+something else.</p>

<p>Example: letter r.
R symbolizes the head, and it has a name on its own: Resh. Resh is R+esh. Esh is the word that symbolizes fire. so Resh means &quot;fire in the head&quot; which, to the ancient jews, was the true meaning of head.
It&#39;s highly disconcerting when you start seeing it this way. Old bible is full of hermetic code that you cannot read if you don&#39;t get to know the language.
Actually, jesus came out of the ancient jewish school of the torah. What he knew, was all buried in the torah code. He just knew how to get it out.</p>

<p>And yes, as a true teacher as he was, he would never have his personality to corrupt his teaching. </p>

Dr. Wood suggests that a hurricane that strangely-travelled up the coast towards NYC, stayed near during the day of 9/11, and then turned away after WTC7 fell would be one possible source for extra electromagnetic energy.</p>
