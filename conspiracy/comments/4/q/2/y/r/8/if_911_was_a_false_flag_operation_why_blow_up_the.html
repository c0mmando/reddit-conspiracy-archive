       9/11 truthers vs... well, I guess everyone else argue that it was orchestrated by the US government (or whoever) and often use the way that the buildings collapsed as proof because that's not how buildings collapse when hit by planes/metal melting temp/whatever... My question is why would they need to demolish the building? Lots of people would die from the initial impact/subsequent fires, the "attack" happened and regardless of the casualty count the justification for retaliation is met, so why would they need to set off explosions to control the demolition? Worried about extra loss of life or $$ doesn't work, it's clear (in this scenario) that the government doesn't mind spending either with free abandon so I'm left wondering what reason there would be to go to that much extra effort?

       Maximum psychological impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the towers don't come down, it just wouldn't be the same. Remember that someone blew up a van in the parkade under one of the towers back in the early 1990's.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the explosion had been a little bit bigger, the tower might have come down. I'm not sure how many people got killed but there must have been a few. The thing is, it was a big story for a few days... and then it faded away pretty quick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go out and ask most people about the
       <em>
        first
       </em>
       terrorist attack on the WTC, you'll get a lot of blank stares. It's plausble that, if the planes had hit and just made some big smoking holes, it would have been a lot less of a psychological impact on the public. Take the Pentagon for example, ask about 9/11 and everybody remembers the WTC. Mention the Pentagon (which got hit but no collapse) and people go "Oh yeah, they got hit too."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, from the perspective of whoever did this, the WTC
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       to go down. You want to get the public to back the whole "War on Terror" thing, you want some max level Pearl Harbor type of attack.

       I've also heard a very good theory about a stock market investigation where the investigation itself (and many of the investigators) was based in one of the WTC buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 9/11 attack killed the investigation literally as well as figuratively. So a) it was most likely an inside job and b) was carried out for more than one reason.

       hey, i get trying to cover one's ass, but when your options are as follows:
a) bribe/threaten/kill person X; or
b) blow up a bunch of buildings and kill several thousand people... I'm just saying it seems to me it'd be easier to fake a car crash

       My theory is that most, if not all, countries have their fair share of corruption. In 3rd world countries, the corruption is evident at lower levels and gets experienced by ordinary people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the West, the biggest corruption is really only found in the upper levels of society where the average person doesn't experience it. So a lot of people are able to fool themselves into seeing their own society as being much more honest and decent than it really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does this have to do with 9/11? Well, if my assumption is correct, it would mean that a fairly small number of very rich people got together with a few of their top-level crooked government friends. People like Bush, Rumsfeld and Cheney along with Silverstein and some of his close buddies. Then throw in a few people in the military industrial complex, the Pentagon and the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       They get together for a few meetings here and there. What happens? Everybody's got their own problems, so everyone has their own idea of what they'd like to see happen and how they'd like to play it. One group needs a Pearl Harbor level terrorist attack, another group would like a huge media diversion, maybe someone else wants a disaster they could use as a cover-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's why there are so many different theories. A bunch of people got together and worked out a deal and 9/11 was the result.

       If they really did want to put an end to that SEC investigation, killing a bunch of the investigators would have been way too obvious. There would also be the problem of all the documents and information they would have accumulated. But if 8 out of 10 investigators got killed and all of their files and paperwork got incinerated and buried under a mountain of debris...

       I see your point, but I disagree. It was around 11pm for me when I saw the news report about what (at that time) seemed to be a terrible accident - I can't remember what time the second plane hit, but I remember thinking 'wow, someone has just attacked the US' and in fact even rang my mother to let her know what had happened :D
The short of it is that even as a non-US citizen, I realised the significance of the event, the collapse of the buildings was horrific, but not needed

       For one, insurance payouts. Second, for the sick fucks that orchestrate this shit, it's a fucking ritual.  It's no surprise to me that two towers fell and a ONE WORLD trade center was put in its footprint. Making sense yet?

       ... no. I would imagine if all the poeple who died had life insurance policies made out to the same few people, alarms may have been raised. As for enjoying the killing, sure, I get that, but why go to so much effort and risk to blow up the building - on top of flying a plane into it - to kill a few extra people when the war itself will/has killed.. hundred's of thousands? ten's it doesn't matter on the exact number, it's still more, so why, if that's the goal, do that one thing that might make people question when the planes were enough?

       sure, but they don't all have a bunch of people screaming 'down with your empire' on board. The claim that it needs to be terrible only makes sense when the government listens to the will of the people. Does anyone here think the government listens to the will of the people??

       that is true, so why not let them collapse by themselves? in fact, as the argument seems to be 'it collapsed on itself' as proof it wasn't natural, wouldn't it be better if the buildings fell to the side? so much more damage, so much more death.. controlled explosion makes even less sense

       I don't think the planes would have been enough to justify a war in Iraq. The buildings were designed to take hits from airplanes so although it would have been horrendous, I don't think it would have been enough.

       I also think they wanted to take wtc 7 out and needed the the towers to fall to make that happen.

       It wouldn't have had nearly enough of an impact on the public consciousness to prompt the dramatic changes that occurred after the event. Those buildings were iconic, they were practically monuments, a source of American pride. Damaging them and repairing them would have only strengthened America's belief in its own indomitable strength. Destroying them in front of the world for all to see was of utmost importance. It wounded the American identity so effectively that it was made malleable.

       Sorry to quote a movie but the John Doe character in the film "Seven" does a good job of explaining it: "Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer, and then you'll notice you've got their strict attention."

       Yeah those things needed to come down but they couldn't legally be demolished given their location.  In order to take them down they were to be disassembled which would have taken years and cost billions of dollars.

       If you read the history of the Towers you find they have needed torn down since the 80s. On top of the asbestos, the cast aluminum fasad of the building was directly bolted to the steel frame creating electrolysis and bad corrosion where they contact. Parts of the outer fasad would eventually fall off.  In the 1980s a team of engineers was employed to work out the details of demolition. Their findings were that it would cost an astounding $8 billion (in 1980s money) to demolish following all the rules and safety guidelines. The engineers were laid off and nothing was done until 2001.
