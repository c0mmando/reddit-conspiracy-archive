<p><strong>Thanateros of Shiva-- Love of Sex &amp; Death</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s a very uncontroversial thing to say that the illuminati is obsessed with sex and is integrated with both hollywood and porn.  A casual perusal of xvideos.com will quickly inform anyone with an IQ above room temperature that the production value and editing skill for the types of videos there are obviously culled from Hollywood.  &quot;Deep Slut Puppy&quot; is a fine example (also happens to be very well crafted videos).   Anyone who has tried posting videos on youtube knows the dreadful DCMA takedowns of many videos, yet this never, ever seems to happen on xvideos that use pop songs with abandon. If it happens it&#39;s vanishingly rare.</p>

<p>This hollywood-porn connection is especially evident when you consider how these videos don&#39;t make any money on xvideos (do the math...they don&#39;t), and cost dozens of expert hours to achieve.    It begs the question, why make them?</p>

<p>I just have to jump in and say, I&#39;ve never, ever paid for porn online.  Not a dime from me.  Yet I can consume as much as I want x infinity.   Why is that?</p>

<p>It&#39;s because this cult of the illuminati is obsessed with sex and death<sup><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4i6kom/btw_america_is_a_death_cult_decoding_322_lady/">[1]</a><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4ceafm/the_empire_of_the_citys_knobelisks_have_origins/">[2]</a><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/4kkews/st_peters_basilica_is_a_cityscale_shiva_lingamyoni/">[3]</a>...and</sup> they want you to be also.  People have hypothesized that they want you to be obsessed with sex, &#39;demoralized&#39; by not getting that level/quality of sex, to become vulgar and perverted; one could say that they want to feed on your sexual energy for their archontic masters; or that they want to break up your family (ie: watching porn instead of sexual relations with wife); or something even worse (below).</p>

<p>You will also notice there is a lot of straight anal porn.  Why is that? Is it really something people like that much?  Perhaps, but I think there is a disproportionate amount but my preferences is not a very good argument, so table this for now.</p>

<p>Anyone who clicks on a <em>youtube conspiracy video</em> doesn&#39;t have to cmake many hops along the related videos to find &quot;illuminati pop stars&quot; type videos such as Mark Dices&#39;s and &#39;exposes of cultish hollywood imagery&#39;.  Likewise on xvideos the porn stars have either a certain uniformity of occultish tattoos suggesting astrology, satanism, dragonism (is this a word?), and sometimes downright gnostic motifs (ex: ouroboros, serpents 777, 88, &#39;libertas&#39;, quetzalcoatl), triangle or lightning (sigrune) earrings, diamond eyed owl necklace, etc.  One dismisses these as iconography that &quot;is a cool part of the DJ -- EDM music / music video industry or scene&quot; that pornographers and porn stars like.  This is a valid excuse but in a way, we&#39;re saying the same thing but about the EDM industry, aren&#39;t we?</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that music industry and porn industries are merging through the device of this new &#39;evolution of porn&#39; called the &#39;PMV&#39; or porn music video, which is popular pop songs played during a syncopated montage of fast-cut edits of various related porn.  So for example &#39;brittany spears gimme more&#39; juxtaposed with creampie compilations.  This kind of thing.  In some non-vanilla areas, there seems to be a trend of transsexualizing videos<sup><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4c3g7p/gender_fluidity_transgenderism_gender_bendingwhat/d1ezhvr">[4]</a></sup> that are strangely popular these days.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Third Eye or Third Opening</strong></p>

<p>Illuminati / Freemasons / Deists (&quot;John Dee&quot;-ists) are responsible for the eye-pyramid on our reserve note dollar bills.  Freemasonry is traditionally all-men.  The worshipful masters order female dancers all the time--we&#39;ve seen the videos.  They are the original pimps, but sitting there calmly, gentlemanly--this is clearly a demonstration of power and will, not about sex.  The sex comes at the exclusive club of high level masons within the order of the jesters<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtgBdUtw26c&amp;index=2&amp;list=FLgTUpYJo7XGadV6F3VImOPg&amp;ab_channel=michaelrose93">[5]</a></sup> in which they hires hookers, do drugs and have hired crooked cops stand guard.  Activities that invert and undermine the &#39;high morality&#39; of a gentleman initiate.  Like they say, I guess you gotta go to the top to get to the bottom of a tushie hole.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to read that last sentence like Sarah Silverman, for so so many reasons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Point 1</em>.  Now some would think that Eye of Providence is the Eye of Horus or some noble thing like this.  That is because freemasons have a remarkable tendency to lie, misdirect<sup><a href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry08.html">[6]</a></sup> and abuse the authority of their influential members to generate excuses for their activities.  (the lying here is because gaotu is gnostic, but that grand lodge link says freemasons are not gnostics--every answer there is a total lie and their disinfo can be proven from albert pike and other masonic texts)</p>

<p>People just &#39;buy it&#39; because antimasonry is virtually nonexistent, and everyone just assumes they just a bunch of old white protestant men who meet at lodges in private to smoke cigars and talk about racetrack earnings.  And that once every few months, drive around in small toy cars with ridiculous hats on to raise funds for children&#39;s concerns.  These things are true, but it&#39;s far from the whole story.  They did 9/11.  They did Italy&#39;s 9/11, the Bologna Massacre 4 decades ago during P2 and the <em>years of lead</em><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_Lead_(Italy)">[7]</a>.</sup> They are a mafia.  They have a master plan, outlined in a &#39;hoax&#39; letter to mazzini in the late 19th century.  Called a &#39;hoax&#39; and yet it&#39;s all come true.  But people don&#39;t like admitting they are complete failures at life for being fooled so many times and having such profound loss of limb, money, time, sanity, family members...to needless wars orchestrated by shadowy mafias of international pirate profiteers.</p>

<hr/>

<p><em>Point 2</em>.  The G in freemasonry.  You can never get a good answer.  Something like</p>

<ul>
<li><del>God</del>~ Nope it&#39;s definitely not this one</li>
<li>Grand Architect of the Universe (gaotu) -- demiurgos / lucifer</li>
<li>Geometry</li>
<li>Gnosis</li>
<li>Gold (alchemical)</li>
<li>Generative principle (penis/vagina)  -- code for various &#39;trinity&#39;ies</li>
<li>Global / Galactic  (GEO)</li>
<li>7</li>
</ul>

<p>Who&#39;s to say it&#39;s not ALL those things?  If G is a symbol, not a letter, then it can mean many things.</p>

<p>So this got me thinking.  And exploring. Finding that Gnosticism&#39;s <em>&#39;secret / hidden doctrine&#39;</em> is about...drumroll... <em>sex</em><sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USE7NoXXjaU&amp;ab_channel=Mr.Soares">[8]</a>.</sup>  The so-called &#39;union of opposites&#39; or <em>coincidencia oppositorum</em>.  It&#39;s about sex, ya&#39;ll.  That&#39;s it.  Well no, but for our purposes.</p>

<p>And of course it led me to Henry Makow&#39;s blog about a special form of sex in his article, <a href="http://www.henrymakow.com/the-best-kept-secret-of.html">Freemasonry&#39;s best kept secret: Ritual Sodomy</a>.  Through the magick of being a crazy person, this leads me to the study of sex magic, specifically Seiðr and the use of a phallic distaff or &#39;dildo&#39; as we call it.  Which again led me to understand that Odin was a practitioner of a type of shamanic sex magic involving being anally penetrated with a dildo.  You cannot make this stuff up.  Unless you&#39;re wikipedia.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sei%C3%B0r#Freyja_and_Sei.C3.B0r">[9]</a>.</sup>  </p>

<p>Why norse?  Germanic influence and mythology cannot be ignored because freemasonry derived from germany&#39;s bohemia in the province from whence Trumps grandfather came, Heidelberg or thereabouts.  The epicenter of rosicrucianism in a prealchemical europe.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In this next part I will assume that &#39;as above, so below&#39;, that the morality of freemasonry is inverted at the top knowing what we know about them (beyond scope of this). Since morality is inverted, then the fundamental meaning behind their pyramid&#39;s message must be inverted too.  </p>

<p>The exoteric meaning is that &#39;god&#39; is at the top of their organizational structure.  Everyone gets that and believes it to be true.  Because that&#39;s the cover story and most people are ignorant. </p>

<p>If you know anything about masons, you know it&#39;s just not true.  Or that their &#39;eye&#39; is the &#39;eye&#39; of sauron, aka lucifer or &#39;the grand architect of the universe&#39; or gnostic &#39;demiurge&#39;.  I&#39;ll buy that.</p>

<p>Or that the eye is the panopticon, the mass surveillance system that they&#39;ve managed to set up, right under our noses.  Yes, it&#39;s that also.</p>

<p>But I propose a new &#39;meaning&#39; of the eye, something that just came out at me in a flash, in a manner of speaking, while I was watching a girl get plowed from behind by a bbc.  That if their whole organization is an absurd joke on religion and morality generally, that the pyramid must also be a joke.  And that their pyramid / upright triangle is the backside of a vagina between the legs, with the anus perched atop as the eye of providence.    </p>

<p>So then by Euclids first axiom of transitive equality, providence therefore is buggery. And the dollar is a tribute to anal.</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Need more evidence?  Odin was an Ass-Shaman (proof)</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m looking for a particular link that made it all clear to me.  I remember looking into sex magic, leading to crowley, leading to anal sex magic, leading to seior / asscraft (I made that last one up), leading to nordic shamanism, leading to an article that said something like &quot;Odin&#39;s sorcery practices were considered repugnant by many and he was ostracized for them&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Ok found it.  I&#39;ll lead you through it:</p>

<p>I thought, hmm.. repugnant eh?  Then found he practiced seior which was a type of magic involving a dildo (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distaff">distaff</a> + spindle used in &#39;weaving&#39;).  Witches practice a &#39;craft&#39;, witch comes from wick which is wickers which is twigs or more specifically bending and weaving twigs--ie: basketweaving; it&#39;s not inconceivable that their broomsticks were actually distaffs used in traditional weaving and that properly employed as dildos with flying ointments made them &#39;fly&#39;--a different take on the whole lubed broomstick.  </p>

<p>I mention witches because it sounds like Odin was a male witch, soceroror or as I prefer: <em>shaman</em>.  </p>

<p>We find this out by traveling to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lva"><em>Volva</em></a> page, which discusses the proto-germanic, old norse origins of wtiches as &#39;female shaman&#39; &#39;carriers of a magic staff&#39;, practititioners of &#39;sex magic&#39; or  ‘<em>&quot;seiðr&quot;</em>, but it also mentions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lva#Male_practitioners"><strong><em>male practitioners, seiðmaðr &quot;seiðr-man&quot;.</em></strong></a>.  There&#39;s also a mention of wands and weaving in this article...theorizing that the word <em>&quot;seiðr&quot;</em> has origins in &#39;thread spun with a distaff&#39;, and that magick involved weaving spiritual energy.  It mentions in the sex rites and drugs section that distaffs represent a phallus and are used in the sex rites.</p>

<p>It mentions *<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergi">Ergi</a>, which is being a &#39;bottom&#39;, anally penetrated during intercourse with connotations of being a sorceror and performing this act as &#39;sex magick&#39;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The practice of seiðr (sorcery) was considered ergi in the Viking Age, and in Icelandic accounts and medieval Scandinavian laws, the term argr had connotations of a receptive, passive role of a freeborn man during homosexual intercourse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is more on this, specific to Odin as a practitioner of <em>&quot;seiðr&quot;</em>, ergi, and shamanic thirdgenderhood.  Kind of explains the whole goth-wicca-passivegothboy thing</p>

<p><strong>Nazi SS is a Cult of the Anus</strong></p>

<p>Ok so I think we just figured it out.   Nazi SS were formed around Heidelberg, which  happened to be the same area which was the epicenter of Rosicrucianism many centuries earlier; and was the foci of the failed &#39;alchemical revolution&#39; of the King Frederich V, Winter King of Bohemia, whose wife was the target of the failed Jesuit Gunpowder plot<sup>[[references]].</sup>  </p>

<p>SS were obsessed with black magic, shamanism, travelling the world for &#39;magickal&#39; artifacts--in a way Indiana Jones was more history than fiction, which many surprise many.</p>

<p>Magick and anal sex were linked through OTO and Crowley.  Crowley reappropriated, refined and reexplaned Nordic sex magic, including anal sex; which seems was integral to nordic shamanism or what some would call <em>&#39;witchcraft&#39;</em>, and yes it does seem to have included the use of the distaff or dildo--so the broomstick + flying ointment + jammed up the hoohah, has been <em>historically validated</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore I can conlude that Nazi SS were a sex magic cult that just took over the world in 9/11/2001, and that the browneye of Providence is a sex magic sigil cast on the whole world by nazis.</p>

<p>It stands for Golgotha.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In some Christian and Jewish traditions, the name Golgotha refers to the location of the skull of Adam.[3] A common version states that Shem and Melchizedek traveled to the resting place of Noah&#39;s Ark, retrieved the body of Adam from it, and were led by Angels to Golgotha – described as a skull-shaped hill at the centre of the Earth, where also the serpent&#39;s head had been crushed following the fall of man. This tradition appears in numerous older sources, including the Kitab al-Magall, the Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan, the Cave of Treasures, and the writings of Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria. It is also suggested that the location&#39;s landscape resembled the shape of a skull, and gained its name for that reason.[3]</p>

<p>Honestly, as entertaining as your post was, it doesn&#39;t sound too far off of the truth. Here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/sodomy_q.html">link</a> with a bunch of related quotes on the subject of sodomy and it&#39;s association with mind control. It was a big thing in the SS of the Third Reich.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now that I think of it, you&#39;re missing Isis, too.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Incestuous siblings Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nepthys bring civilisation to Egypt.</p></li>
<li><p>Osiris wanders off to spread civilisation to other lands. In his absence, Set starts getting ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>Osiris returns to Egypt. Set holds a welcome home banquet with a mystery prize for whomever can fit in the treasure chest. Osiris fits. It&#39;s a surprise coffin.</p></li>
<li><p>Set lets the coffin float down the Nile and rules Egypt in his place.</p></li>
<li><p>Isis goes on an adventure and finds the coffin in a tree in Byblos.</p></li>
<li><p>Isis returns to Egypt with her husband&#39;s corpse. Set seizes Osiris&#39; body and dismembers it.</p></li>
<li><p>Isis goes on another adventure and finds thirteen of the fourteen body parts. </p></li>
<li><p>Isis returns to Egypt in secret and, with the help of Thoth, puts the body back together again, using a golden <del>phallus</del> dildo in place of the missing penis.</p></li>
<li><p>Isis finally gets to scratch that itch and does the nasty with a corpse, resulting in the birth of Horus. She goes into hiding for oh-so-very many obvious reasons.</p></li>
<li><p>Somehow, nobody seems to really care that Isis copulated with a cadaver. </p></li>
<li><p>Horus grows up and starts a war, reclaiming Lower Egypt.</p></li>
<li><p>With neither side decisively victorious, Horus and Set get together for some casual buggery and cum-swapping.</p></li>
<li><p>Horus catches Set&#39;s load and throws it in the Nile before blowing his own on some lettuce.</p></li>
<li><p>Set likes soggy lettuce.</p></li>
<li><p>Set claims before the other gods that he creampied Horus and is therefore the most dominant of the contenders for the throne.</p></li>
<li><p>The other gods ask the semen to speak, because apparently jism talks.</p></li>
<li><p>A voice from the Nile says &quot;Nope, I&#39;m over here&quot; while a slightly muffled voice comes from Set&#39;s stomach saying &quot;Surprise! I&#39;m in here&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>The gods decide that Horus is thus the dominant contender. Set is humiliated, never again being much more than a nuisance.</p></li>
<li><p>The Two Lands are re-united as one and the order established by Osiris is restored under the benevolent rule of Horus.</p></li>
<li><p>Victorian Egyptologists are mortified when they finally find out what those hieroglyphs are really talking about.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That said, as always, appreciate the contribution to the puzzle. And to end it on a tasteless note, a few rape jokes: </p>

<p>Honestly, if there is nothing funny about rape, then why does every rape victim get so hysterical bout it? Nothing is funnier than a good rape joke: separates the men from the boys bleeding from the arse. </p>

<p>How many rapists does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
Only one, but they prefer coke bottles. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all fucked. Proper fucked. </p>

<p>EDIT: All the jokes were ripped from Jim Goad. There is no sarcasm font, so I wish to make it clear that such expressions are solely the result of defusing and dispersing the stress caused by such ideas and their nauseating reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freemasons have &#39;G&#39; explainations for every level.  They say Grand architect for everyone, then geometry for initiates, then generative principle for mid level drones, then gnostic for deeper V.I.T.R.I.O.L. believers, then galactic/global for the innermost, because that&#39;s revealing their grand global game (ggg) plan and big ambitions.  Of course they are a gay mafia, so the highest level people are gay fascistas who run hollywood, music industry, movie industry and porn.  </p>

<p>As a male, to do straight porn, you are required to do gay porn first.
As a (black) actor, you&#39;re nearly required to dress as a female and act gay.  Chapelle and Kat Williams blew the whistle on this</p>

<hr/>

<p>I don&#39;t think rape jokes are that funny but I also don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with consentual buttsex.  The only psychological damage from that kind of sex is from defiance of culture and from being &#39;dominated&#39; in a power way.</p>
