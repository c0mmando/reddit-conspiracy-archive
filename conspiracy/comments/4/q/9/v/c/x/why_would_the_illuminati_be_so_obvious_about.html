<p>So the Illuminati, if it even still exists, went underground back in the day, and supposedly stayed a secret organisation from then on, yes? If they&#39;re a <em>secret</em> organisation, why would they be so obvious about their existence, with the symbolism, the subliminal messages, and all that other nonsense? Don&#39;t you think they&#39;d just keep controlling from the shadows if <em>secretly</em> creating a New World Order is what they want? They&#39;re supposed to be the &quot;Enlightened&quot;, so surely they&#39;re smart enough to realize that humans won&#39;t simply bend down to their will if they just declare themselves, so then what is the point in subtly letting people know that they do exist, in such a way that you&#39;ll still have doubters who will call the believers &quot;crazy conspiracy theorists&quot;? Division, perhaps? Do they want to create a gap between the people so that they can rise from a possible ensuing chaos? Is their agenda even really to transform the world to their views? Do they even exist? What if this is all just a long-running gag by the entertainment industry to fuck with us all, since they know how gullible we are, especially when things seem mysterious?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO - The Illuminati worship dark forces, and the devil likes to hide in plain sight. Since they are in control of a lot of things, I think they like to flaunt it knowing they are going to get away with it. If questioned they make you out to be crazy. Almost all music videos and movies have Illuminati cult symbolism all over the place. Also by hiding in plain sight, they make others participate in their rituals such as the Gotthard Base Tunnel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except if you did some research on the Illuminati, you&#39;d know that the Illuminati never worshiped any kind of deity. Instead, they were <em>against</em> any kind of superstition, so that would be kind of contradictory. A lot of people seem to be mixing up Freemasonry, Luciferianism, Satanism and the Illuminati. There are differences between them all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well all I know is that a lot of big wigs go to Bohemian Grove where worship happens. I do know they don&#39;t worship a specific deity, as long as they believe in a higher power, it doesn&#39;t matter what their &quot;religion&quot; is. Would you say that they people in Hollywood and the music industry are part of the Illuminati? Because both those industries are definitely bring Satan symbolism into all their work and are considered Illuminati.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you can&#39;t simply &quot;consider&quot; people Illuminati just because they bring symbolism (of any deity) into their work. However I <em>have</em> seen symbolism in their works, not necessarily Satanic but a lot of Pagan symbolism for sure. So for all we know they could just be part of a Pagan cult of sorts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can search almost every music performer and find an image of them covering one eye. So the one eye symbolism is everywhere. Justin Bieber, Madonna, Rihanna, and tons more have what I consider satanic symbolism everywhere. Maybe it&#39;s Pagan but Paganism also can cross over to be consider satanism. I have tons of things I could show you. Movies, music, advertising, if you have an eye for it you&#39;ll see there is a lot more symbolism being used. The Gotthard Tunnel Ceremony was all about satanic rituals...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t just <em>consider</em> things to be something, man. Can I <em>consider</em> Christianity to be the same as Hinduism, just because they both believe in a deity of some form? There&#39;s Paganism, and there&#39;s Satanism, they&#39;re two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism">completely</a> different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanism">things</a>. </p>

<p>And you don&#39;t need to show me anything, I was in the phase of &quot;<strong>THE ILLUMINATI IS TAKING OVER!!1!</strong>&quot; once, too, so I have seen a <em>lot</em> of them. I just can&#39;t be sure of what these symbols, which <em>are</em> clearly there for everyone with a good set of eyes to see, actually mean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you research the symbols you&#39;ll get a good idea what they mean, like the pentagram or the Masonic Compass and Square. Don&#39;t you think that these symbols have a specific use?!? You say you see all these symbols but don&#39;t believe they mean anything? I know for a fact movies only show you what they want you to see, the random pentagram wouldn&#39;t be there unless it has meaning to them. I don&#39;t think the Illuminati are taking over. I think a huge amount of people are worshiping Satan. What I do know is my gut feeling says something is wrong with this world. It is controlled by a small group of people, that will step on us in an instant.</p>

<p>Paganism: a term to describe religions other than their own. Therefore Satanism could be consider Pagan (I was just saying some people do think Paganism is worshiping the devil)...Just saying.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LordChelon.html">LordChelon</a> 2016-06-28</p>
    <div class="md"><p>The Masonic Square and Compass have been their symbol because those are architects&#39; tools, and the Masons started out as Stonemasons, or, architects. There&#39;s also the G inside the Square and Compass, which stand for both God and Geometry (different interpretations), God being the Great Architect of the Universe, and Geometry being the noblest of sciences. Plus, even in Masonry, as far as has been documented, they have never worshiped dark forces of any kind. Their main focus is science, and an important requirement for joining a Masonic lodge is that you <em>must</em> be religious, whether it is Christian, Muslim, whatever, but you have to believe in God. They&#39;re not Satanists, and do not worship Satan. I actually know about this because my grandfather is in the local Masonic lodge here, and he&#39;s pretty open about it.</p>

<p>As for the Pentagram, it has <em>so</em> many uses, linking it only to Satanism is downright ignorant and might just be a bit disrespectful. One of the first uses of the Pentagram was by the followers in Pythagoras, as the symbol for health. Then it was used by the Christians themselves, as a symbol for the five senses, or of the five wounds of Christ. There&#39;s also the five joys that Mary had of Jesus, and the five virtues of knighthood. Then, all of a sudden, some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliphas_Levi">writer</a> said that although the pentagram was a good sign, if it was turned upside down, it was <em>evil</em>. However, if you check all these entertainment media, they commonly use the pentagram with the good side up. I can&#39;t remember them ever having used it upside down.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the all-seeing eye, inside the triangle. Called the Eye of Providence, by the way. Where did that start showing up? The Christian era, where the triangle was depicted as the holy trinity, and the eye was the eye of God, who sees everything. Eventually, it was adopted by the Freemasons, but guess what? It held the same meaning. It was their reminder that God looks upon everything they do, everything they think.</p>

<p>So far, it all sounds pretty light-hearted and even quite <em>Christian</em> if I interpret it like this.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t think Satanism would be part of Paganism, since Satan supposedly comes <em>from</em> Christianity, right? I might be wrong there, though. No one really know what the true definition of Paganism is, probably because the Christians just made it up to discriminate everyone that did practice the same beliefs as them. They&#39;ve done that quite often.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either you were just being very sarcastic (in a terrible way) or you simply don&#39;t realize that what you just said makes no sense. The Swastika does not mean something completely different. The Hindus, among others, still use it for its original use, a symbol of good fortune. The fact that you&#39;re willing to only follow its modernly most-known use says something about yourself, and it might have something to do with the irony of you calling me a sheep for actually <em>thinking</em> about what I say before I say it.</p>

<p>And <em>if</em> that <em>was</em> sarcasm, then I&#39;d suggest that instead of pathetically acting like you know better, you should actually put that &quot;knowledge&quot; of yours that you so deem as would not make you a &quot;sheep&quot;, to use by trying to make me stop &quot;sleeping&quot; like the &quot;sheep&quot; I am. Because it&#39;s funny, you claim that they are showing us these symbols for a reason, but you can&#39;t even tell me what this &quot;reason&quot; is. But of course, that&#39;s beyond your reach, because you simply don&#39;t have any arguments except for a baseless conspiracy theory that you probably only heard about by watching too much TV and Youtube videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that would be the position of the pro-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> and notoriously subversive however largely secular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati">Bavarian Order of the Illuminati</a>, which was not the first nor last to be known as the Illuminati (historically). </p>

<p>What people refer to as the Illuminati today is likely to be closer related to (though independent of) the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Templi_Orientis">O.T.O. / Ordo Templi Orientis</a>, one of its founders previously involved with the <a href="http://parareligion.ch/illumin.htm">Illuminati Order  / Orden Illuminatum</a> which was in itself an effort to &quot;revive the Illuminati&quot; <a href="http://oto-usa.org/oto/history/">according to the man himself</a> (an initiate of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedenborg_Rite">the Swedenborg Rite</a>), descended from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Brotherhood_of_Light">Hermetic Brotherhood of Light</a> (itself derived from the <a href="http://www.hermetics.org/brc-18.html">Fratres Lucis / Asiatic Brethren / Brotherhood of Light</a> which arose from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Golden_and_Rosy_Cross">Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross</a>) fusing with it high-degree (ninety-seven degree) esoteric / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_Memphis-Misraim">Egyptian Rite / Memphis-Misraim Masonry</a>, elements of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a>, and eventually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema">Thelema</a> (introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>), along with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4">A∴A∴ / Argenteum Astrum / Order of the Silver Star</a>. When you see celebrities and the like who flaunt all-seeing eye symbolism they are more likely initiates into these outer orders (if not oblivious to them), often using the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ml5XU4n.gif">Sign of Philosophus / Fire</a> corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4#The_Order_of_the_G.E2.88.B4D.E2.88.B4_.28Golden_Dawn.29">their grade within the Golden Dawn section of the A∴A∴</a>, with others being <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Fn4bvNX.jpg">initiates of the O.T.O.</a> for example. I would like to point out these orders are not explicitly (or directly) Luciferian as some claim, however one order which was derived from the O.T.O., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternitas_Saturni#Founding">Fraternitas Saturni / Brotherhood of Saturn</a>, is itself a Luciferian and Thelemic order.</p>

<p>Curiously, one of the founders of the <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_skullbones11.htm#CONTENTS">Skull &amp; Bones Society</a>, General William Huntington, Russell was said to have ties to the remnants of the Bavarian Illuminati after their offical dissolution in 1787, hence the designation as the Yale chapter as &#39;Chapter 322&#39;.</p>

<p>Some degrees / grades within contemporary initiatory esoteric orders corresponding to their respective version of the Illuminati: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Templi_Orientis#Initiation_and_teachings">Hermit Triad / Illuminati degrees</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Templi_Orientis">O.T.O. / Ordo Templi Orientis</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4#The_Order_of_the_S.E2.88.B4S.E2.88.B4">&#39;Secret Chiefs&#39; in the Third Order of the Silver Star (the S∴S∴)</a> within the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4">A∴A∴ / Argenteum Astrum / Order of the Silver Star</a>, the three grades corresponding to the &#39;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121011005126/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucian_Monographs#Illuminati_section">Illumianti section</a>&#39; of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucianism">Rosicrucian</a> order known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Mystical_Order_Rosae_Crucis">AMORC / Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis</a>, and speculatively the &#39;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Chiefs#Occultism">Secret Chiefs</a>&#39; of the &#39;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_Brotherhood#History">Great White Brotherhood</a>&#39;. </p>

<p>Examples of initiatory orders and movements regarded as Illuminati pre-dating the Bavarian Order: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alumbrados">Alumbrados / Illuminati of Spain</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumin%C3%A9s">Illuminés of France</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedenborg_Rite">Illuminati of Avignon / Swedenborg Rite</a>.</p>

<p>Other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_organization">initiatory orders</a> and secret societies alleged to be related to or comprise the contemporary Illuminati (by supposed former initiates): the Committee of 300, Council of 13, Council of 33, and Palladian Rite. </p>

<p>And then you have the countless imitators, those who call themselves an Illuminati Order simply to scam would-be initiates out of their money.</p>
