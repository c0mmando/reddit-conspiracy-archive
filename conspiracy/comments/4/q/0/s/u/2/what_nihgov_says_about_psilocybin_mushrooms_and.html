<blockquote>
<p>The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, NIH, our own National Institutes of Health, either oversaw or published peer-reviewed studies demonstrating medical merit of nearly ALL psychedelics, but these psychedelics remain as Schedule 1 per the UN&#39;s convention on psychotropic substances which informs our laws and those of other countries.  Given the compelling national dialogue regarding failed promises of pharmaceutical companies pushing psychiatric medications such as <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3v4ags/herbs_dont_work_except_when_they_do/">antidepressants that have been demonstrated to perform no better than placebo</a>, the questions of &#39;how to deal with mental illnesses&#39;, &#39;how to fix spiritual disorders&#39; will force us into another national dialogue of how to deal with the psychedelics such as mushrooms that are increasingly revealing themselves to be superior medications for these disorders.  </p>

<p>In other words, mushrooms are medicine, so why are they not immediately removed from the DEA schedule? And what can we do about it?  (one possible answer below)</p>

<p>Here are the studies:</p>

<hr/>

<p>It is time to federally decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms.  But we need the UN to retract the mushrooms from the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic substances.  Until then, the DEA may not be able to<sup><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bpkiw/the_us_cannot_federally_legalize_cannabis_or_any/">[1]</a><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/28b25n/un_drug_treaties_or_why_the_dea_cant_really/">[2]</a>,</sup> unless it wants to defy the archaic and discriminatory drug convention the US helped craft, making the UN look weak.</p>

<p>Forum spies are welcome to come up with fracture points <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3sodlc/magic_mushrooms_are_medicine_for_patients/cwzenms">like this nsafag&#39;s</a> in the original post.  I mean, if you didn&#39;t,  how else will we know you care and are listening to us? With that I leave you to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Erowid is my favourite <a href="https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtml">Magic Mushrooms Resource</a> it contains a lot, not all science, but a great trove of experiences of people who take it. There are some good reads there, and I agree it shouldn&#39;t be Schedule 1, but certainly medical use should be monitored, since recreational use needs a &quot;Trip Sitter&quot; as in a designated driver kinda person; obviously if recreational use needs supervision so will medical usage right?</p>
