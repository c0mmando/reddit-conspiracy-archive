        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">31</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-06-27 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/911bodysnatchers322.html">911bodysnatchers322</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Because they really don&#39;t understand what&#39;s <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4q0ut3/sickos_leftists_seek_to_make_pedophilia_the_next/">truly going on</a>, <em>nothing that is said in articles whining about</em> <strong><em>the constitution</em></strong> <em>such as the following, should be worthy of your consideration</em>, :  <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/9/4507088/no-more-secrets-an-important-case-against-nsa-spying-takes-a-big-step">No more &#39;secrets&#39;: an important case against NSA spying takes a big step forward</a></p>

<p>The reason is that on 9/11, a neocon, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/guns-and-butter-1/continuity-of-government-planning-peter-dale-scott-207">cryptofascist coup d&#39;etat initiated a Continuity of Government plan</a>.  That plan and its yearly renewal, by Bush and Obama, meant that our government has been run by the CIA/NSA since 9/11--fifteen years.  This COG plan relinquishes governance to the deep state, and so all laws (<em>including constitution</em>) are void.  And any new laws are assumingly only aimed at citizens, not the alphabet agencies.</p>

<p>That&#39;s <em>precisely</em> why the intelligence community does whatever it wants and cannot be stopped.  Congress isn&#39;t even allowed to talk about it.  The re<em>cuck</em>licans and <em>cuck</em>licrats both have their heads in the sand, while their pants are down around their ankles.</p>

<p>Because they waterboard people.  They wage illegal wars.  They occupy lands.  Steal resources and gold.  Using agents provocateur, <a href="http://getoffthebs.com/fbi-agents-posing-as-islamic-terrorists/">they create false flag events and hurt people</a>.  They wage psychological campaigns against americans and europeans.  They spirit people to blackops prisons where no one knows if they are alive or dead.  They forced iraqi male children to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/10/23/iraq-wikileaks-documents-describe-torture-detainees">perform oral sex upon iraqi male prisoners</a> (read the wikileaks cables).  </p>

<p>They spread propaganda and disinfo on reddit.  They manipulate voting in elections.  They use software programs to suppress/harass users on social media and especially in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  They <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgbiGsQq7uA">blackmail congressmen for their crimes</a> instead of sending them to <em>fucking</em> jail where they should have been, instead of writing laws for innocents.  They incarcerate black people for selling drugs--drugs which they themselves secured through the <a href="https://m.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/43xrjd/the_straight_dope_on_painkillers_heroin_gateways/">marines guarding poppy fields in afghanistan</a>; poppies they shipped to processors in various countries; opiates imported in through mexican cartels (ironically enough: &#39;the knights templar cartel&#39;) they work with; to be cut with <a href="https://m.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/43xrjd/the_straight_dope_on_painkillers_heroin_gateways/">fentanyl</a> and given back to said black communities to sell or die from highly dangerous fentanyl intoxication.  </p>

<p>Now, if people really understood COG and why it&#39;s important, they&#39;d understand <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4pda3j/nonindictment_of_hillary_clinton_will_reveal_cia/">why Hillary is not in jail</a>.  They&#39;d understand why the war on drugs is still a <em>thing</em>, even if unlike most intelligent, well-read people who understand that the <em>government itself</em> (intelligence community and mafias) has been running the drug trafficking since even before the opium wars, they would at least clearly see the pictures of marines guarding poppy fields.  And if there were a single light bulb on up there, they&#39;d say, &quot;hmm.  Isn&#39;t that somethin&#39;</p>
