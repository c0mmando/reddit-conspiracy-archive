So I&#39;d seriously look at this as more agenda-driven divide and conquer agit-prop meant to rile, disrupt and divert us all from uniting against a common enemy. Just toss it straight into the rubbish bin and move on, why bother giving this crap any attention? Propaganda is propaganda and there&#39;s myriads of flavours for people of all stripes to have them move in desired manners. PSYOP 101.</p>

I blame almost 100% of the collapse of race relations in this country on the mainstream media.  They are the true race baiters, and are now all fawning over this obvertly, socially accepted racism that was spewes out of Jesse Williams&#39;s mouth last night.  SMDH</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;this invention called whiteness&quot; is referring to the fact that there was no concept of whiteness before. There is a lot of diversity amongst people with light skin (i.e. Russia, Italy, and Ireland are very different) however, they were eventually grouped into a single group called &quot;white.&quot; This has been used to pit people with lighter skin against black people resisting their oppressors. I think you&#39;re just misunderstanding most of what he is saying.</p>

<p>I mean as far as internet forums go, I&#39;ve seen on a yearly basis communities switch from being up in arms about the latest police shooting, to complete denial of any existence of racism in the government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean you simplified the issue to idiocy. How is anyone suppose to respond to that? You surely know the problem is the percentage within the population of blacks that are <a href="http://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-sheet">imprisoned</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/final-tally-police-shot-and-killed-984-people-in-2015/2016/01/05/3ec7a404-b3c5-11e5-a76a-0b5145e8679a_story.html">shot</a> and the way they are treated, but you&#39;d rather negate the obvious for <em>your</em> narrative.</p>

<p>I doubt you are this heated about the injustices that <em>are</em> comitted against blacks and clearly documented, but you&#39;re quickly concerned about their own resistance to said injustice. Why would anyone care about your opinion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you have to understand is the invention is not &quot;whiteness&quot; but the social superiority of &quot;whiteness&quot;. You so easily get caught up with this idea that whiteness and blackness are strictly these naturally occurring genetic traits without understanding that the true problems of racism are rooted in arbitrary social classifications that stem from these physical attributes. </p>

<p>Russians, Brits, and Scots are nationalities. Yes the populations of those countries consist of a majority of white skinned people. That majority does not make them socially, morally, intellectually, or physically superior to anyone else. Unfortunately through the course of history we came to identify blackness as inferior and we&#39;ve not been able to separate skin color from this classification. So yes whiteness is an invention but only in relation to the invention of blackness and it&#39;s perceived inferiority.</p>

<p>The audience for the BET awards is actively being propogandized into believing that black people are still victims in society. That personal responsibility is secondary to having a victim roll.</p>

<p>You cant use facts to convince these people, you cant use reasonable arguments, all they understand is emotions or feelings and that it feels good to still be a victim in 2016 when we have a black president and Oprah is rich enough to buy most small countries. </p>

<p>This is the reality of the western world. The sooner you get rid of your TV, facebook, social media, and stop consuming this nonsense, the better.</p>

<p>But you are right, &quot;Black&quot; people should not make stupid statements that are not founded in fact, but whites, asians, mexicans are allowed to practice nepotism and favoritism. (Stop acting dumb too-- The Clintons, the Bushs Mexican and Chinese restaraunts all practice it). </p>

<p>And what white people think is fact or science is not necessarily what AfroAmerica thinks is a fact. </p>

<p>These things are just a natural karmic response to the failure of civility and equality in the US. What you are seeing is probably/hopefully the beginning of a paradigm shift in the thinking of AfroAmericans and largely a reaction to our unfair treatment in the US. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously went into that video trying to disprove everything he is saying.</p>

<p>However, it is true that people who live in homogeneous communities are susceptible to racism (possibly more so than people in diverse ones). It is also true that American media reinforces racist stereotypes. </p>

<p>White people have created many things, but what he&#39;s challenging is the notion that other races don&#39;t have as much to offer. Also, he&#39;s paying credence to the <strong>fact</strong> that black America has been integral to the building and maintenance of America. Which is a fact that you will often find being disputed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously you are not a hater. I like that. So let me explain. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact black people think they can&#39;t be racist because of racism has to be &quot;systematic&quot; 
THERE IS NO BOOGIE FUCKING WHITE MAN. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are right in that AfroAmerica almost as a whole <strong>mistakenly</strong> equivocate <strong><em>White People</em></strong> with <strong>Systematic Racism</strong>. But with the KKK and all the hate groups <em>White People</em> have I am sure you can almost understand, right? </p>

<p>This is actually a problem IMHO but I do not know what we can do about that. There is lots of evidence of slaughterings, genocide, pogroms that we have suffered in the past and the present that would put blame on any single white person. And seeing that you white people have more solidarity we tend to throw you all into the same group. </p>

<p>But white people do this all the time. It is called racial profiling. We get thrown into the same bucket all the time by whites. Same difference with white racial profiling as AfroAmerican racial profiling. And just because you have socio-economic power doesn&#39;t mean whites can control our minds. </p>

<p>Having said that though, what you mention is a problem. Honestly, there are few AfroAmericans that are willing to say that it is not white people per se, but the controlling elements of US society. Most whites side with the controlling elements anyway, so they kind of go hand in hand. White people enforce racist pogroms to keep AfroAmericans second/third/last class citizens to maintain their own pseudo status. (I hope that is not what kind of person you are)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being a PROUD BLACK PERSON has absolutely nothing to do with putting down white people. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I totally agree. But that is a hard sell right now. 
Right now all most black people see is a skin color in a uniform. And selective dissonance allows them to block out the Negro fascist in the same uniform. </p>

<p>Personally I tried. I tried to sway the AfroAmerican community. I had several subreddits and nowhere will you see that I associated the racist system with the white stereotype. But I think AfroAmerica is so depressed right now that they are not willing to look into the details for the real devil. (Nor are they willing to look inward for self-improvement --but that is another debate for another time)</p>

<hr/>

<p>tl;dr: Anyway, it is what it is, and <em>white people</em> are largely to blame, so that&#39;s what it is now. I hope you understand.</p>
