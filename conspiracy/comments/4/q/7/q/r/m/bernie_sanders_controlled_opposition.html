<hr/>

<p>Bernie is funded by a man who goes by the name of George Soros. No conspiracy here its just hypocritical to take donations from a man who is part of the tip top 1%. And now it has come to our knowledge that he will vote for Hilary Clinton, someone he supposedly fundamentally disagrees with.</p>

<hr/>

<p>NDAA: Bernie Sanders: YES, Appropriates $80.71 billion for overseas contingency operations for fiscal year 2014 (Secs. 4102, 4202, 4302, 4402 &amp; 4502). As well as removing due process giving the government total control over who gets due process &amp; who doesn&#39;t. It permits the military to detain individuals indefinitely without trial. Bernie sanders voted yes on this, not to mention the increase in defense spending?Source: <a href="https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/46311">https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/46311</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Cyber Security Act: Bernie Sanders: YES, this bill is very simple to understand, tt literally destroys net neutrality. Generally speaking, net neutrality means that an Internet service provider such as cable or phone company treats all content equally. For example, it doesnâ€™t offer faster transmissions for Netflix videos than it does for those from Amazon Prime. Bernie sanders voted yes to passing this bill.... Had that been passed internet would have been utterly destroyed as we know it.Source: <a href="https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/41957S">https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/41957S</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Amdt 2372: Bernie Sanders:NO, This bill is simple to understand why it is needed. It Prohibits the EPA from spying on farmers. And it adds better regulation to school meal programs &amp; provides better healthier food for the kids. It also provides better regulation on what chemicals are put in our food. Bernie sanders voted no on this decent bill. Source: <a href="https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/40805">https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/40805</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>USA FREEDOM Act: Bernie Sanders: YES, this bill is also very simple to understand, it extends the patriot act (implemented by bush), The patriot act is a bill that expands federal law enforcement power. It erodes our freedoms by, allowing the government to watch &amp; monitor our phone calls, emails, texts, etc. Basically eliminating the right to privacy in your own home. The fact this bill extends the patriot act is horrible &amp; Bernie Sanders voted for it. Source: <a href="https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/50592S">https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/50592S</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Amdt 139: Bernie Sanders: NO, this bill again is simple to understand. This bill prevents the UNITED NATIONS from taking away our fire arms. It basically strips the UNITED NATIONS of any law enforcement in America period. Source: <a href="https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/43297S">https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/43297S</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Amdt 1491: Bernie Sanders: NO, again this bill is very simple to understand as well. It extends the STOCK Act to ensure that the reporting requirements set forth in the STOCK Act apply to the executive branch and independent agencies. It prevents companies from evading taxes.

President George W. Bush later used the Iraqi Liberation Act to provide justification for military action for the 2003 invasion. <a href="https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/8577#.VmSrar9oF-A">https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/8577#.VmSrar9oF-A</a></p>

I served as a support person for a dozen or so Vermonters who sat-in in his Burlington office a couple weeks into that war. Not only did Sanders refuse to talk with us via telephone (unlike his Vermont counterparts in the Senate-Leahy and Jeffords), he had his staff call the local police to arrest those who refused to leave until Sanders spoke with them. The following week Sanders held a town hall meeting in Montpelier, VT., where he surrounded himself with sympathetic war supporters and one university professor who opposed the war and Bernie&#39;s support for it. During the question and answer part of the meeting, Sanders yelled at two of the audience&#39;s most vocal opponents to his position and told them to leave if they didn&#39;t like what he had to say.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2001, Bernie supported HR 1954, which extended the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1996.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Following the 9/11 attacks, Bernie voted in favor of H J Res 64 - Authorization for Use of Military Force, which allowed President Bush to use the United States Armed Forces against anyone involved with 9/11 and any nation that harbors these individuals.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2002, Bernie voted against H J Res 114, which authorized President Bush to use military force against Iraq. However, he would continue to support bloated military defense bills that would ultimately be used to sustain the war he allegedly disagreed with.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2003, Bernie supported HR 5010, which provided $355.1 billion in appropriations for the Defense Department for fiscal year 2003 - an increase of $37.5 billion from 2002 - as well as: $71.6 billion for procurement of aircraft, missiles, weapons, combat vehicles and shipbuilding; $7.4 billion for ballistic missile defense; and $58.4 million for foreign aid, which includes humanitarian assistance, foreign disaster relief and de-mining programs.</p>

<hr/>

<p>He also voted in favor of HR 2800 - Foreign Operations Appropriations, FY 2004 bill, which granted $1.8 billion in military and economic assistance to Egypt and $2.2 billion for Israeli military assistance.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2004, Bernie supported HR 4613, which allocated $25 billion for emergency defense spending for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and $77.4 billion for the procurement of new weapons.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2005, Sanders supported HR 2863 - Defense Department FY2006 Appropriations Bill, which provided $50 billion for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2006, Bernie voted for HR 5631, which provided $70 billion for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2007, he supported HR 1585 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which granted $187.14 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan operations.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2009, he voted in favor of HR 2647, which authorized $309 million for research and evaluation, procurement, or deployment of an alternative Missile Defense System in Europe, and also allowed the Secretary of Defense to increase the active-duty number for the US Army to a number greater than otherwise allowed by law up to the 2010 baseline plus 30,000 troops. During the same year, he called closing the torturous gulag at Guantanamo a &quot;complicated issue&quot; and ultimately rejected a proposal to shut it down.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2011, Bernie co-sponsored S. Res. 85, which urged the UN Security Council to take action to protect civilians in Libya from attack, including the possible imposition of a no-fly zone over Libyan territory.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2014, Bernie came out in favor of levying economic sanctions (an act of war) against Russia: &quot;The entire world has got to stand up to Putin,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;ve got to deal with sanctions.&quot;That same year, Bernie didn&#39;t object to having his name included - by unanimous consent - in S.498, which backed Israel&#39;s brutal, summer-long military assault against Gaza.Most recently, he vowed to continue Obama&#39;s murderous international drone war.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Bernie also supports funneling weapons into Iraq to fight ISIS as well as airstrikes, and he continues to spread the myth that Iran seeks to build nuclear weapons.</p>

<hr/>

<p>All of this information is publicly available and verifiable with a Google search. But hes for the people right? Bernie Sanders has a terrible voting record that tramples on the constitution and wastes billions of dollars. Sanders is proof that if you speak with a gravely, authoritative voice and tell people what they want to hear, you can gain national attention. Only once every several decades does someone come along who is so cunning, manipulative and masterful at combining nationalism, authoritarianism, propaganda and hatred into one slick campaign. Not sure what is more amazing, how brilliantly he is executing this strategy while working to appear folky or how many people are falling for it. It&#39;s really stunning. Please Bernie is not the savior you are looking for. Read some books about high level manipulation techniques and carefully analyze the lack of substance in what he says.ï»¿</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that they can still be elected, but if they are a true threat to the ruling class, they typically dont remain in power for very long.  Paul Wellstone and JFK are pefect examples of politicans who genuinely posed threats to the ruling class and their money amd power.  </p>

<p>Both of those men were killled because of the threat they posed.  If Bernie Samders had teeth to back up his bark, they would have already killed him by now.  I think however, the ruling class probably thinks the same thing about Sanders like they do Ron Paul, and that is that both of them at their ages have trouble getting an erection, and hardly pose a real threat to them, their power or their money.</p>

<p>But after reading OP&#39;s post, my opinion of Sanders has done a 180. In fact, he&#39;s even worse than Trump or Clinton. At least everyone with half a brain knows Clinton is a crook. Sanders has most people thinking he&#39;s some sort of kindly old uncle type who has our best interests in mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really, I don&#39;t think anyone is going to &quot;get elected&quot; (whatever that means these days) unless TPTB wants them to win.</p>

<p>I also think that the political leadership is really two or three levels down from whoever&#39;s <em>really</em> in charge. It&#39;s like some anonymous rich people are letting us vote for one of their servants. Don&#39;t matter which one we vote for, or which one wins... it&#39;s still gonna be one of their servants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not on this sub he&#39;s not.  This is clearly a Trump sub.  Which I think is so typical, since people conveniently forget so many things about his past also.  Or that his family built their business on obvious funnelled money (grandad was a nazi draft dodging &#39;too weak for the fields&#39; kid who came to america as a barber, somehow managed to get a restaurant on a barber&#39;s salary...then bought a hotel chain...their family story has more holes than swiss cheese) from a place within walking distance of heidelberg, the epicenter of rosicrucianism AND the cauldron of the Nazi SS.  People don&#39;t want to speak to that.  But considering that our society has become <em>exactly the kind of preconditions of nazi germany</em> in the last 7 yrs, and that many of Trumps ideologies are clearly fascist in nature,  I think it bears pointing out.</p>

<p>The truth is, there&#39;s no good candidate.  I think people will answer to that and Obama will have a 3rd term after the mass rioting dies down and many are dead this november</p>

Doubtful.. but there is a small chance.  And personally, I would rather see a Trump White House and watch the funny shit-show go on and have a good laugh or two rather then see a Clinton aka Obamo 2.0 White House.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal theory is that the &quot;election&quot; is similar to a reality show. It&#39;s mostly scripted. There are off the cuff moments, but then they just adjust the script. I think every candidate is in on this and they see it as fair somehow. Maybe the fundraising is real, and that&#39;s were they see it as fair, because it&#39;s basically a fundraising game. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know though. It could be real. I&#39;m open to that. This is just one of many possibilities for the artificial nature of our election and politics.</p>

<p>NDAA: Bernie Sanders: YES, Appropriates $80.71 billion for overseas contingency operations for fiscal year 2014 (Secs. 4102, 4202, 4302, 4402 &amp; 4502). As well as removing due process giving the government total control over who gets due process &amp; who doesn&#39;t. It permits the military to detain individuals indefinitely without trial. Bernie sanders voted yes on this, not to mention the increase in defense spending?Source: <a href="https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/46311">https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/46311</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All I see are references to enemy combatants detained at Guantanamo Bay.  And opens the door to further litigation against sex offenders in the military along with the budgets.  Also wasn&#39;t this the big &quot;we&#39;re going to shut down the government unless we agree to pass the bill?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am pretty sure that they were trying to shutdown the government over Obamacare, a d not the NDAA.  The thing is though, by Bernie voting yes, he&#39;s not only voting yes on that years amendments (which I found a full list of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1197">here</a>, but also every admendment and statue that has ever been attached to the bloated NDAA bill in the past.  </p>

<p>So whereby unwarranted seizure, and execution even of American citizens without due process was not brought up in this years NDAA, Bernie voted to renew all prior NDAA statues by voting yes for this bill.</p>
