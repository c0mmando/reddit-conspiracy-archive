        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>INTRO: For any who don&#39;t know, a week ago (June 19th, 2016) 27 year old Anton Yelchin -- a skilled and talented actor with over 40 credits to his short career, who was by all accounts, a universally beloved and highly intelligent individual-- died in a freak accident at home.
I&#39;ve been following his since day one and it makes <em>no sense</em> to me. I don&#39;t know why but to me the official story just didn&#39;t add up. I don&#39;t even believe in most conspiracy theories (no h8), but this is just...<em>wrong</em>. I came here hoping to get feedback because I&#39;ve never researched a potential conspiracy/plot/whatever-in-the-Gods&#39;-names-this-is before, and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m overlooking something or maybe missing connections.. Below is what I have so far, and maybe if anyone can add to it (<em>especially</em> if anyone can do the math where my skills gap) or help analyze it and pull some kind of meaning out, I&#39;d appreciate it. 
Please understand, I know some will consider it disrespectful to be looking into this so soon, but I need <em>proof</em> one way or the other, so I can move on. I didn&#39;t want this to be a &quot;thing&quot; for me, this is not the sort of thing I&#39;m into, this isn&#39;t &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;exciting&quot; for me, it&#39;s honestly just sad. It started off as denial fed with doubt, then skepticism and maybe a little hope (literally the only thing the <strong>hard</strong> evidence shows is <em>a dented fence</em>, everything else is heresay and that gives my desperate mind a tiny ember of frantic hope that maybe he&#39;s not really dead?). The inconsistencies in logic and facts spurned research to get the <em>truth</em> just for some damn closure and I&#39;m frankly sick over it, but at the same time, I feel like <em>not</em> looking into this properly would be even worse.  I swear, I don&#39;t think every person who dies is a secret society victim or something, I usually just feel sad for a little while and move on because at the end of the day these people are, <em>though beloved entertainers</em>, total strangers to me. This <em>was</em> no different at first. I&#39;ve tried to accept his death, and tried multiple times to let this go, but I can&#39;t even sleep. It&#39;s been a week and he&#39;s haunting my dreams, I&#39;m hoping that if I just get this out of my head, put it <em>out there</em>, then at least I&#39;ll be able to get some rest.</p>

<p>THE OFFICIAL STORY: Anton was leaving his house, on his way to a rehearsal with friends in the late evening/early morning. He stopped in the front of his security gate in the driveway and then end up crushed to death when it rolled back and pinned him to the brick pillar/fence. The vehicle was found, on, in neutral, with him at the back, passenger side by friends at some point in the morning and he was pronounced dead from &quot;Blunt Force Traumatic Asphyxia&quot; later the same day. According to all public stories, he died &quot;within 60 seconds&quot; of impact. There are currently lawsuits against Fiat-Chrysler (prompted by this) because there was a known issue with the electronic shifter that habitually caused drivers to think the car is in Park when it is actually in Neutral, at this point (6/27/16) he tox report is not back yet (though he wasn&#39;t known to partake in/abuse any drugs or abuse alcohol) and it hasn&#39;t yet been confirmed or denied that his specific car had said defect. Them&#39;s the official facts.Here are my doubts and concerns:</p>

<p>VISUAL PROOF VACCUM: Hollywood is heavily populated by vultures and our culture is fascinated with the shocking but, as yet, there hasn&#39;t been a single picture of anything involved in this case <em>except</em> the gate. 
Not <em>one</em> picture of Anton&#39;s body, at the scene, on a stretcher, in the morgue. No memorial service or funeral has been announced at this time. (EDIT: Today, 6/27/16, it was reported that a private funeral took place Friday) There has not been one single picture of his Jeep, at the scene, at the police station/inpound- nowhere. Not even the damn Enquirer. Also, and possibly most damning, it had been mentioned early on that: 
<em>&quot;Det. William Bustos said the crash was partly captured by a surveillance camera and that he is working with the security company to obtain more evidence.&quot;</em>
but that was the <em>last</em> word about said footage. I saw very few articles (Admittedly I didn&#39;t read every single article) that even mentioned the footage, let alone included the quote, and that was within the first day or two of the event. Since then- nothing about it.  It seems to me that would be worth mentioning by most people? And worth following up on?
About the footage itself.. If it was an internal system, why do they need to go to the security company to get it? External, then- ok so if the only copy was stored on file <em>at</em> the security company, why are they waiting? They&#39;re cops, they can just go claim it as evidence. If it was one of those live-monitoring situations, why was the accident only reported when his body was discovered by his friends and not by the security company?
Where is this footage? Why is no one even <em>asking</em> about it?
(<a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-anton-yelchin-jeep-rollaway-20160620-snap-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-anton-yelchin-jeep-rollaway-20160620-snap-story.html</a> - Bustos quote article)</p>

<p>MISDIRECTION?: This case <em>very quickly</em> became about the shifter, which makes sense but not to the exclusion of everything else, imho. In the beginning, it was bizarre how much of a point articles made of mentioning the weight of his vehicle. We all (well, the majority) know about how much a car/suv weighs so, to my mind, mentioning &quot;5,000 lb or TWO AND A HALF TON&quot; every time you write &quot;Jeep Cherokee&quot; seems like layering it on a little thick, if nothing else, especially since Cherokees aren&#39;t exactly new or uncommon.
Also, a surprising number of sources are consistently getting it wrong (as recently as <em>today</em>), reporting that he was pinned to his <em>mailbox</em>, when the mailbox was in a completely different brick pillar, at road level, on the other side of the driveway from the corner he was found in.
After that, it&#39;s all about the shifter, Jeep, the lawsuits and blame. The only people even considering any alternate theory are Illuminati conspiracists on youtube, and theirs are lazy almost to the point of being part of misdirection themselves, really. They pretty much don&#39;t consider the case itself at all (to the point of mentioning irrelevant or wrong information) and just say &quot;New member of the 27 Club? Must be Illuminati equinox sacrfice to the antichrist!&quot;. I don&#39;t think that helps do anything but make alternate theories about his death <em>less</em> plausible-- which maybe is the point of them? Idfk... This isn&#39;t my territory, so I&#39;m trying to consider any and every possible angle. If they are serious and just not well researched, then I&#39;m sorry to offend anyone.</p>

<p>THE SCENE: 
First of all, they didn&#39;t secure it. There is video of reporters standing IN the driveway either the day it happened, or the next- but there&#39;s no police tape <em>anywhere</em>, nothing to prevent crime scene contamination, even though it was claimed the police and feds were investigating this. 
Second, I&#39;m no expert on physics, but it seems to me, that if a person is being crushed with so much force that they die in sixty seconds, that&#39;s gonna make a bit of a mess SOMEHOW. 
But this is the cleanest &quot;blunt traumatic&quot; <em>anything</em> scene I&#39;ve seen in my entire life. 
First of all, I don&#39;t think the scene has been cleaned. The ground seems uniformly dry, I don&#39;t see any recently dried puddle marks andthe driveway isn&#39;t free of all dirt/leaf, etc. debris as it would be if a big cleanup happened.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://i.imgur.com/IZSAC7C.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/IZSAC7C.jpg</a> LARGEST, CLOSEST image I&#39;ve found anywhere) (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/nOgaZ5m.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/nOgaZ5m.jpg</a> Corner &amp; ground) You can see that there&#39;s not <em>one</em> speck of blood, gore, skin, clothing fiber, hair or ANYTHING on the brick, gate or ground. The only sign of damage <em>at all</em> is the warping and paint-scrape on the gate itself. There isn&#39;t even a single mark or notch in the brick pillar or the walk-in gate on the left.
The gate is bent just behind where the gate-opener arm attaches to the gate, which means the gate arm was able to structurally withstand an impact that mangled the gate. I am 99% sure this (<a href="http://www.ramsetinc.com/RAM-30">http://www.ramsetinc.com/RAM-30</a>) is the same model of gate opener and according to that page, the gate opener is rated to move only 400lbs of gate. Can someone do the math on impact-survivability for that gate arm, because my top-of-the-head common sense says that an arm that can only move 400lbs of gate would have trouble holding back an SUV  at mortal-force.
If you look at the large picture again, you can see where the gate was marred by something  (his Cherokee, I assume). Those marks are <em>very</em> close to the brick, but there&#39;s not a single marking on the brick or the other gate. 
The actual amount of driveway after the gate is not very much, and it&#39;s curved (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/hRt5a04.png">http://i.imgur.com/hRt5a04.png</a>)
So on that short driveway, the Cherokee managed to hit hard enough to dent the gate, kill <em>in 60 seconds</em> with only one injury, and mangle the gate <em>that</em> close to the brick <em>but ALSO</em> with enough..<em>finesse</em> to not break the gate-opener, not touch the brick and not make a gruesome scene. </p>

<p>THE SHIFTER: This makes no sense, no matter how you look at it. 
When a car is on an incline/decline, first of all, you can <em>feel</em> it moving or not.
If the car was on a steep enough incline to get the speed/force needed to kill him in 60 seconds then it wouldn&#39;t have stayed still long enough for him to:
+Remove his foot from the brake and think it was in park
+Open the door and exit the vehicle (<em>and possibly</em> close the door- no word on whether the door was open or not.)
+Walk along the left side of it
+Make his way behind it</p>

<p>(<a href="http://i.imgur.com/jU1Wf09.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/jU1Wf09.jpg</a>) I have a Toyota Yaris and my friend has a somewhat steep driveway. Compared to a Jeep Grand Cherokee my car weighs nothing, to my mind then, on an incline it would take a lot less to &#39;overcome Newton&#39; and get my little car moving from a full stop than a heavy Cherokee.
Yet time and time (I forgot to keep count because I was getting upset) again I couldn&#39;t even get my <em>door OPEN</em> with my foot off the brake unless the car was in park,  and when I was <em>any</em> further back in the driveway than the very top (where the front wheels were on semi-level ground) then I couldn&#39;t even overcome immediate rollback without the <em>emergency</em> brake on, IN PARK.
I GET that the electronic shifter is shit, but the shifter doesn&#39;t also malfunction the laws of physics. The shifter wouldn&#39;t make him exit or walk behind a moving vehicle, and a stationary vehicle wouldn&#39;t wait until it&#39;s driver was behind it to suddenly start rolling back on it&#39;s own- the Steven King movie Anton was in was <em>Hearts in Atlantis</em>, not fucking <em>Christine</em>.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s say gremlins did it- then it <em>still</em> doesn&#39;t make sense because, by all accounts Anton was a highly intelligent man, sane and not an alcohol abuser or drug user. If his vehicle started rolling backwards he&#39;d get back in and stop it or just let the damn thing blow through the gate. It&#39;s not like he couldn&#39;t afford to replace the car, gate and garage beyond if need be. The driveway is wide (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/vPrmTwM.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/vPrmTwM.jpg</a>), so if his car began rolling back when he was next to or behind it, why would he run into the ONE place where he couldn&#39;t escape it instead of going back the way he came, or, if he was ALREADY at the walk-in gate -- trying to scale the fence? Any action besides covering his eyes with his hands would have resulted in a different set of injuries than is claimed.</p>

<p>THE CAUSE OF DEATH:
According to TMZ (on the 21st) he was killed by &quot;chest and head&quot; injuries, though most other sources never mentioned his head. TMZ was (to my knowledge) at the front of news on him, so this inconsistency is interesting.
According to this death certificate copy (<a href="http://tmz.vo.llnwd.net/o28/newsdesk/tmz_documents/0622-Anton%20Yelchin%20death%20certificate.pdf">http://tmz.vo.llnwd.net/o28/newsdesk/tmz_documents/0622-Anton%20Yelchin%20death%20certificate.pdf</a>) his cause of death was &quot;Blunt Traumatic Asphyxia&quot;, other significant conditions contributing to death was listed as &quot;None&quot;.
According to this (<a href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-1947-6-257">https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-1947-6-257</a> WARNING: Graphic descriptions of traumatic asphxia symptoms within.) however, that&#39;s not as likely as it sounds. Long story short (though if you DO read the above report, please read it in it&#39;s entirety), though blunt-force traumatic asphyxia is really horrible looking and scary souding, it&#39;s actually less deadly than you would think, <em>especially</em> if there are <em>no other symptoms/injuries</em> to worry about. 
&quot;Despite the dramatic appearance...mortality in crush asphyxia is low. However, it may be influenced by the severity, nature and duration of the compressive force and the presence of concomitant injuries, which can be useful markers of the severity of compression.&quot;
In my opinion, according to the above, this (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dangthanhtuan/emt-thoracic-trauma">http://www.slideshare.net/dangthanhtuan/emt-thoracic-trauma</a>) and all other sources I could find on the subject, the only way that he could have died:
+That fast
+Clean <em>and</em>
+With no other underlying or contributory causes of death
.... was if he were portraying that death in a movie and the director wanted a PG-13 rating. The elements are contradictory from what I can see, ESPECIALLY when taken in context of everything else.</p>

<p>DEATH CERTIFICATE ITSELF:  (<a href="http://tmz.vo.llnwd.net/o28/newsdesk/tmz_documents/0622-Anton%20Yelchin%20death%20certificate.pdf">http://tmz.vo.llnwd.net/o28/newsdesk/tmz_documents/0622-Anton%20Yelchin%20death%20certificate.pdf</a>)  I&#39;m no expert, but a couple things jumped out at me as weird about this, and maybe they&#39;re normal but I&#39;m just mentioning them for comprehensiveness&#39; sake. Number one is the elephant in the room, in red outline: &quot;NOT A VALID DOCUMENT TO ESTABLISH IDENTITY&quot; but maybe that&#39;s because they were giving a copy to TMZ, idk. So, that aside:
His middle name is initialized (and his middle name isn&#39;t the letter &quot;V&quot; alone) instead of written out.
The embalmer&#39;s license number is not filled in. 
The physician&#39;s certification appears to just have had the pretense of being blacked out, that is, I&#39;ve never seen a doctor&#39;s signature in my life that would fully fit within the single bar of a marker line. It looks like they marked it to make it look like they redacted a signature, which is strange because they didn&#39;t bother to fill out anything else in that Physicians Certification section (near the bottom).</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s it, I think. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve got. I might have forgotten something, Idk... I hope not.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, just reading your message again and wanted to check in to see how you are doing.</p>

<p>I understand how you feel. I felt sad at first, but not really sad. Then, about a week after it happened, I started getting really sad and really disturbed. Seriously crying. I NEVER get upset about celebrities&#39; death. I loved Alan Rickman, but I was merely sad when he died, and I moved on. </p>

<p>This is different. I don&#39;t know how into woo you are,  but it could be Anton reaching out. I am not into woo, but I believe that there is life after death. It might be your own intuition telling you there is something wrong. If your gut is telling you that the story doesn&#39;t add up, listen to it. </p>

<p>What we don&#39;t know is if Anton&#39;s vehicle was subject to the recall because we don&#39;t know his VIN, or if he got the letter in May. I do have a hard time believing that someone raised in SoCal wouldn&#39;t know to put on his parking break. </p>

<p>Now, I know Hollywood is shady, but I don&#39;t think studio investors regularly go around killing off their actors. If he was murdered, it was more likely someone who knew him. Running over someone with their car own seems a bit...personal. The options there are a crazed fan or a disgruntled ex. Or an insane Trek fan who has a bug up their butt about the reboot. He was very focused on his career, so perhaps there was someone he was seeing who wanted more, and Anton wasn&#39;t willing. Or if he broke it off with someone. He was very private about his personal life so there could have been someone who was angry with him because of a romance gone wrong. But then again, if there was someone else there, it would be on the tape. </p>

<p>If he did fake his death, he&#39;d go to Russia. Americans need a visa to go there and that can take weeks, so he would be long gone before a stalker realized that it was a ruse. </p>

<p>Anyway, hope you are doing a bit better. I am sort of, but it&#39;s been a rough time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been happening to me too. I honestly can&#39;t comprehend why I have consistently been getting more upset over Anton Yelchin&#39;s death. I mean, yes I&#39;ve seen a lot of his films, but I&#39;m an actor so I&#39;ve seen a lot of films in general... I have increasingly become, in all honesty, distraught over this. It&#39;s freaking me out, as this is truly bizarre behavior for me. I don&#39;t know what woo is. I don&#39;t know about any of that. But something isn&#39;t right with this. Oof. It&#39;s actually a bit of a relief to know there are others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here&#39;s nothing more than I&#39;d wish that this wasn&#39;t real 😔 But something seems off to me about the accident, too. How could he not notice the car rolling? Did the recall not get to him or did he ignore it? Did he let himself be hit on purpose? That would kinda make sense with his last Instagram pic with the serious face with the hashtag #egoist I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s good to look at this from all possibilities. I don&#39;t know of any reason he&#39;d want to commit suicide, but then again, I didn&#39;t know the guy. He could have had a personal struggle no one knew about.</p>

<p>The story doesn&#39;t make sense. The police aren&#39;t even sure if the gear shift was the issue, but the media is blaming it on the gear shift. </p>

<p>Keep an eye out for the tox report. He wasn&#39;t known to use drugs or alcohol, so if the report says anything was in his system, there&#39;s a good chance he was murdered. I wonder if his family and friends accept the story, or if they are just as bewildered as we are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, in the conspiracy world? I could see them looking at it in a few ways. 
1. He didn&#39;t get the letter because &quot;someone&quot; got involved so the jeep problem would be a great cover
2. It&#39;s all part of the new world order plan to get people used to seeing deaths from celebrities, cops, and people to further the chaos to eventually lay down corrupt laws and a 1984 like control
3. He was sacrificed during a summer whatever it&#39;s called (total blank on the word don&#39;t feel like googling, hey respect the honesty) which is a little creepy because some die hard conspiracy theorist have been light weight spilling prophets on Freely hosted blotter platforms.(one in particular said it wouldn&#39;t be a big name celeb.</p>

<p>Actually accidental deaths are pretty common, just they make a better tv show (1,000 ways to die) than anything else. People have died from taking selfies, to planking but because we see it on a click bait blog we kinda assume it may be a bit exaggerated. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, but I really was a huge fan of his...he stayed out of the spotlight and idk he seemed true to himself. I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t a conspiracy, I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s possible for these kind of things to happen to a celeb as well. I&#39;m sure his parents are devastated </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, that&#39;s fair.  I&#39;m still a little fuzzy on the details of how the whole thing actually occurred. Did it slam into him when he got out to get something, and he had no time to react, or did it start rolling when he came back out of his house? I&#39;m not terribly keen to see the security footage. The Yelchins&#39; lawyer said yesterday he got the recall notice in May, and the company sent the letter saying that they had a fix a week after his death. His parents are suing, and regardless of how this occurred, I don&#39;t blame them. They both broke down in the press conference yesterday. I don’t know how they go on.  </p>

<p>It still does seem like that thing had to have gotten up some speed to dent that gate like that, and I still don&#39;t see a steep incline in the driveway, unless I&#39;m blind. There are also some suspicious-looking spots in the driveway in one of the pics TMZ posted. They kinda look like blotted out blood stains. </p>

<p>Idk. The whole thing has been stressing me out and I need some closure. Can&#39;t imagine what this is like for his parents. I cried yesterday watching them. </p>

Was the recall notice really too little too late, was it not published on any other news pages or the newspaper?
 Why is that park mode actually a thing in automatic cars? Why not only have a hand brake?</p>

<p>The driveway does look a bit steep to me, but steep enough to for the car build up such fast speed? 
Which suspicious stains do you mean?</p>

<p>There are weird stains toward the opposite side of the driveway from where he was supposedly found. Idk if they are from before the accident or not, but they&#39;re a suspicious color of pink. If you maximize the photo on the left, they are easier to see. The largest one is in front of the fence, kind of far from where the gate is bent. There are some smaller ones trailing to over by the brick work. I only noticed them when I was creeping around looking at the photos. Blood would turn that color if someone tried to clean it up with bleach or peroxide, rather than the professional stuff that the po-pos use. </p>

<p>The driveway is so short on both sides of the fence that I really don&#39;t get how it got up the speed to do that much damage to the gate, unless the pressure/strain of the car sitting against the gate for a couple hours is what did it, but Anton was supposedly killed by the impact. </p>

<p>I was talking to a Russian friend of mine about Anton yesterday and she is pretty cut up still, and also thinks the accident makes no sense and is suspicious. Apparently some independent Russian  news site called Meduza that left Russia and is now based in one of the Baltics posted a video that they claimed was the security footage, and it had something to do with his gate malfunctioning, but I told her that their lawyer didn&#39;t mention anything about his gate not working, so she thinks this video was probably fake and the site posted it without verifying it. It&#39;s he just some independent blog site that doesn&#39;t have the resources that the state-sponsored sources have and as far as I know, none of the main Russian news sites have posted any video. She tried to find it for me, but it was off their site. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, who exactly are these friends that found him? No one has reported their names, nor has anyone interviewed them as far as I know. I understand that maybe they want their privacy, but there are essentially no witnesses. Just the dented gate and the crappy reports of what supposedly occurred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lawyer said he got the recall notice in May (the one that notified owners that the Jeep could roll away if left on) and the notification that the fix was available went out after he died (prompted by his death), so I think they&#39;re going to argue that Chrysler was negligent in rolling out the recall because it was obviously available before the accident since they were able to tell everyone the fix was ready after he died. The Yelchins apparently got the notification that the fix was ready after he died because the company actually sent a letter addressed to Anton a week later, letting him know that the fix was ready. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think it&#39;s odd that he ignored the warnings in the car. I wonder if the problem is worse than what has been reported. I wonder if the car lights say it is in park, but it still makes the warning sounds, in which case, the transmission is totally screwed up. But yeah, from everything everyone had said about Anton, he ws a really smart guy, and ignoring what it said in the recall and the warning sounds and ignoring what the dash lights said sounds REALLY oit of character. Unless he was tired/distracted, but still. That doesn&#39;t explain why he was behind it, and why he didn&#39;t see it coming straight at him, unless he was on his phone...which is totally understandable because I get pretty distracted on my phone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s was no phone found on the scene, wasn&#39;t it?  I think he might have been in thoughts rushing back to the house, because he forgot something and that he was tired, too (why meet up at 1 am anyway?), then the car hit him, threw against the fence, he hit his head on it and got unconscious maybe, having no chance to escape and then was crushed. That&#39;s how I imagine how it could have been.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t hear if they found his phone on the scene or no. </p>

<p>The reports here have been really fuzzy about what time they were supposed to meet. They all say &quot;in the late evening or early morning,&quot; so they might have been supposed to meet around 11, which isn&#39;t that late for a band to meet up. </p>

<p>I also imagine he must have been tired and thinking about other things and maybe the car hit him and pushed him into the gate and he had no time to get away.</p>

<p>I wonder how this lawsuit is going to go for his parents, then. If he ignored the recall warning and got out of his car and left it running after the company specifically told owners not to do that and ignored the warning sounds, it might be hard to convince a jury that it wasn&#39;t his fault. It does seem strange that someone who was supposed to have been that intelligent and responsible would be likely to have ignored all of that, so it remains a little suspicious in my mind. </p>

In the video it shows how it is even more difficult to know if the car is in park if the shifter is exposed to sunlight, but it must have been dark when Anton wanted to drive away and according to here <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/22/autos/chrysler-gearshift-recall/">http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/22/autos/chrysler-gearshift-recall/</a> 
there&#39;s a warning sound if you open the door and an indication on the dashboard if not in park.
It is just weird...

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that poor guy. That&#39;s not something he will ever be able to forget. He might not know how it happened, either.  </p>

<p>I can imagine also that Anton was a night person. A lot of creative types stay up late, and are out late, so he may not necessarily have been tired, but maybe thinking about other things. Creatives do get lost in their thoughts, but to ignore the recall notice,  the warning sounds, and the lights on the dash sounds odd considering everyone said he was incredibly mature, even as a teenager, and not at all reckless. I never heard if he was forgetful or ditsy, but it sounds like he was a responsible and conscientious young man. I&#39;d hate to think that a momentary space-out cost him his life. It&#39;s like Simon Pegg said. It&#39;s circumstances that defy explanation. He knew Anton very well and probably also thinks this whole thing was out of character. </p>

I don&#39;t know how people who knew him can handle this. I think about him all the time, and sometimes I feel better, but mostly I just wish he could come home. Maybe when the lawsuit against Chrysler gets started, there will be more answers. Who knows? Maybe the issue with the Jeep is worse than people thought. Maybe someday we can know what happened to him, and it might help, but it won&#39;t bring him back. :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I imagine there could be any number of motives, but that kind of information wouldn&#39;t be able to be ascertained from a few pictures of a mangled gate.. 
Off the top of my head, I think I&#39;ve read (in comments and such) that he was a solstice sacrifice, that he joined the 27 Club for whatever reasons someone joins the 27 club, that he was killed for &quot;refusing to deal&quot; (whatever that means), and that he was a victim of the Illuminati, those are what others have said.</p>

<p>If Hollywood is as seedy and shadowy as some believe then it might be worth noting that on the day of his death Lindsay Lohan blamed his death on Hollywood with a weird Instagram picture. Most assumed she was just high, but maybe she was trying to send out a message. (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/PsH2Byg.png">http://i.imgur.com/PsH2Byg.png</a> the Russian says <em>&quot;condolences to the family and friends&quot;</em>).</p>

<p>Also, he was three weeks from his directorial debut on a movie called <em>Travis</em>, that he wrote, about an actor/photographer that witnesses a murder; Idk if it&#39;s based on a true story or not, but <em>he</em> was an actor-photographer and so, stopping that movie from being made can&#39;t be ruled out.</p>

<p>Personally, I think greed is always a potential motive since people will generally go to any lengths to achieve more than they have, fuck anyone over to do it. His death might not even have been the point- maybe someone had a beef with Fiat-Chrysler.</p>

<p>Finally, there is good old fashioned &quot;self-faked death&quot;, which makes the most sense evidence wise, but the least sense when considering the victim. There are only two reasons I could imagine Anton faking his death. The first could be a criminally elaborate publicity stunt for <em>Travis</em>.. which would make me so happy because then he&#39;s not dead. I seriously doubt it, though. It would take a pretty high level of either malice and/or disregard to keep up the ruse at this point. The second would be faking his death to escape fame, but considering his life and ambitions, I doubt that one just as much as the last.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally think motive is relevant to whether or not this case is weird, it would only make it weirder. Frankly, I don&#39;t care, the outcome is the same either way (except in the case of a self-faked death) which is that Anton was murdered, and that&#39;s heartbreaking no matter the reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to post again...Generally, from what I have learned, most coroners follow the practice of the CDC in filling out the death cert form, and the form calls for the deceased&#39;s full legal name. His full legal name included his patronymic, Viktorevich. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s standard practice to abbreviate the middle name on a death cert. I believe my dad&#39;s had his full name spelled out. I am sure his driver&#39;s license, SS card, and passport all have his full legal name. His death cert should match those documents. </p>

<p>I also don&#39;t know if this is anything but his place of birth on the death cert says Russia and homeboy was born in the USSR. They are different thingd Technically, it doesn&#39;t matter, even if the place name changed, but it should match whatever it says on his other documents...the American version of his birth certificate, passport, and other documents. Might just be lazy coroners&#39; office workers, but he was born in the USSR. I have a Russian friend who was born in 1986 and I think his passport and visa information both say USSR.</p>

<p>So either it was filled oit out by someone who didn&#39;t know what they were doing or TMZ knowingly published a fake cert or it&#39;s just plain fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there a picture of the whole driveway? It doesn&#39;t look like there is an &quot;incline,&quot; ad the media reported, near the accident at all. Cars in neutral roll forward on a flat surface, not backward. </p>

<p>Also, why no abdominal injuries? The design of the new Jeeps is a curved body, not boxy like the old Jeeps. The bottom is wider than the top windshield part of the car, which curves inward. Standing next to a Jeep GC at about 5&#39;5&quot;, the wide part would hit me right exactly at my breastbone. It would hit someone about 5&#39;9&quot; (Anton&#39;s height) the stomach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More questions about his death certificate.</p>

<p>Time of death. According to the standard practices, time and date of death are entered when the deceased is pronounced dead. At the top of the certificate, it says that he was pronounced dead at 1:10 local time on June 19. That follows procedure. However, down at the bottom, it says the injuries occurred on June 18th (Sat. night), but the time of death at the bottom says unknown. He supposedly died within a minute of his injuries, so could they not approximate? According to CDC practices, they can estimate the time of death by putting approx. in front of the time. The person who pronounced him dead would have been able to determine how long he had been dead, would they not? Seems a bit odd to put unknown when they know about when his injuries occurred and about how long it took him to die. </p>

<p>They also redacted the place his injuries occurred, but elsewhere, they wrote out his address and that he was found in his driveway. They redacted Victor&#39;s address, but not Anton&#39;s. </p>

<p>Also, if Victor was the informant, they would have his patronymic, because I&#39;m pretty sure this poor man knows his only child&#39;s full name, and wouldn&#39;t have abbreviated it, which is not really recommended by the CDC guidelines. </p>

<p>The accident still doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense to me. I&#39;m trying to get over it and hoping his spirit has crossed over, but I do think something is wrong, and maybe something is keeping him here.</p>

<p>TMZ&#39;s copy is informational, and that&#39;s why they stamped it. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s safe to say that he is indeed gone. </p>

<p>Maybe in a week or two, the police will have more details about what they think may have occurred. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By woo, I mean the supernatural. Boo! :)</p>

<p>I am completely distraught. I liked him and all in Star Trek. He was my favorite. Actually haven&#39;t seen a lot of his other work. I&#39;ve been crying like crazy. </p>

<p>What&#39;s he trying to get us to do? What&#39;s he trying to tell us? </p>

<p>His parents have to suspect something.  They&#39;re Russian, and Russians in general are a) not easily fooled and b) skeptical of official stories. They are being totally classy about it, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks flat to me.</p>

<p>The cropped pics give an illusion of an incline because of the brick work. Every time I put my own car in neutral on a flat or curved surface, it rolls forward.</p>

<p>I stood behind a Jeep GC again yesterday and yeah. Im 5&#39;5&quot;, 5&#39;6&quot; on a good day, and the bumper would hit me square in the chest. Seems like it would have hit Anton in the stomach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I imagine there could be any number of motives, but that kind of information wouldn&#39;t be able to be ascertained from a few pictures of a mangled gate.. 
Off the top of my head, I think I&#39;ve read (in comments and such) that he was a solstice sacrifice, that he joined the 27 Club for whatever reasons someone joins the 27 club, that he was killed for &quot;refusing to deal&quot; (whatever that means), and that he was a victim of the Illuminati, those are what others have said.</p>

<p>If Hollywood is as seedy and shadowy as some believe then it might be worth noting that on the day of his death Lindsay Lohan blamed his death on Hollywood with a weird Instagram picture. Most assumed she was just high, but maybe she was trying to send out a message. (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/PsH2Byg.png">http://i.imgur.com/PsH2Byg.png</a> the Russian says <em>&quot;condolences to the family and friends&quot;</em>).</p>

<p>Also, he was three weeks from his directorial debut on a movie called <em>Travis</em>, that he wrote, about an actor/photographer that witnesses a murder; Idk if it&#39;s based on a true story or not, but <em>he</em> was an actor-photographer and so, stopping that movie from being made can&#39;t be ruled out.</p>

<p>Personally, I think greed is always a potential motive since people will generally go to any lengths to achieve more than they have, fuck anyone over to do it. His death might not even have been the point- maybe someone had a beef with Fiat-Chrysler.</p>

<p>Finally, there is good old fashioned &quot;self-faked death&quot;, which makes the most sense evidence wise, but the least sense when considering the victim. There are only two reasons I could imagine Anton faking his death. The first could be a criminally elaborate publicity stunt for <em>Travis</em>.. which would make me so happy because then he&#39;s not dead. I seriously doubt it, though. It would take a pretty high level of either malice and/or disregard to keep up the ruse at this point. The second would be faking his death to escape fame, but considering his life and ambitions, I doubt that one just as much as the last.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally think motive is relevant to whether or not this case is weird, it would only make it weirder. Frankly, I don&#39;t care, the outcome is the same either way (except in the case of a self-faked death) which is that Anton was murdered, and that&#39;s heartbreaking no matter the reason. </p>

<p>His family, friends, and fans deserve to know what happened to Anton that night. The LAPD isn&#39;t taking it seriously because they probably assume he was high. It&#39;s just another dead actor to them. What do they care about his devastated parents? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, that&#39;s fair.  I&#39;m still a little fuzzy on the details of how the whole thing actually occurred. Did it slam into him when he got out to get something, and he had no time to react, or did it start rolling when he came back out of his house? I&#39;m not terribly keen to see the security footage. The Yelchins&#39; lawyer said yesterday he got the recall notice in May, and the company sent the letter saying that they had a fix a week after his death. His parents are suing, and regardless of how this occurred, I don&#39;t blame them. They both broke down in the press conference yesterday. I don’t know how they go on.  </p>

<p>It still does seem like that thing had to have gotten up some speed to dent that gate like that, and I still don&#39;t see a steep incline in the driveway, unless I&#39;m blind. There are also some suspicious-looking spots in the driveway in one of the pics TMZ posted. They kinda look like blotted out blood stains. </p>

<p>Idk. The whole thing has been stressing me out and I need some closure. Can&#39;t imagine what this is like for his parents. I cried yesterday watching them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t hear if they found his phone on the scene or no. </p>

<p>The reports here have been really fuzzy about what time they were supposed to meet. They all say &quot;in the late evening or early morning,&quot; so they might have been supposed to meet around 11, which isn&#39;t that late for a band to meet up. </p>

<p>I also imagine he must have been tired and thinking about other things and maybe the car hit him and pushed him into the gate and he had no time to get away.</p>

<p>I wonder how this lawsuit is going to go for his parents, then. If he ignored the recall warning and got out of his car and left it running after the company specifically told owners not to do that and ignored the warning sounds, it might be hard to convince a jury that it wasn&#39;t his fault. It does seem strange that someone who was supposed to have been that intelligent and responsible would be likely to have ignored all of that, so it remains a little suspicious in my mind. </p>
