       'How does one man assert his power over another, Winston?’
Winston thought. ’By making him suffer,’ he said.
’Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suf- fering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery is torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always — do not forget this, Winston — always there will be the intoxica- tion of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face — for ever.’

       With all due respect perhaps you are not paying enough attention to what is currently happening.  As an example,
       <a href="http://legalinsurrection.com/2013/04/msnbc-all-your-children-are-belong-to-us/">
        here is a speech which aired on MSNBC a year or so back

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.

        Once it’s everyone’s responsibility, and not just the household’s, then we start making better investments.

       The end goal is to eradicate men. That's why the Duluth model was put into place. It was to try to put masculine men behind bars, so that women can form a lesbian separatist society. The feminine men are simply made to be transgender, as evidenced by the increased levels of estrogen in the water supply (and guess who control the estrogen? It isn't men). Luckily, there are women who do stand up to the feminist lesbian separatist plot, namely Phyllis Schafly, Marine Le Pen, and Pauline Hanson.

       Your comment reminded me of something I was just reading yesterday. This novel,
       <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/RiLfjaeqpWizCbxu">
        Shyness and Love
       </a>
       deals with what is commonly known as 'forever alone' syndrome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your mention of a lesbian separatist society reminded me of a series of quotes from love shy-men in the book.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Well, I don't like boys. In fact, I hate boys. I know because I was
a boy myself. And a boy is a terrible thing to be in this world.
Sometimes I think that the world would be a better place if everyone
could somehow be a girl—if from now on no boys would ever be
born again to anyone, and people had children by being artificially
inseminated with only female sperm. There wouldn't be anymore
war or bullying or cruelty. And there would be no more danger of
a nuclear holocaust, and no more crime. The world would be a much
safer place to live. And you could still make love.
         <strong>
          Everyone would
be a lesbian, so there would still be a lot of sex. And the sex would
be a lot better because there wouldn't be anymore violence and
cruelty and rape
         </strong>
         ." (22-year old love-shy man.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Ahhhh, boys are dirty and aggressive. And I don't know how I'd
handle one. I guess I'd have to leave the boy up to my wife, and
I'd take care of the little girl.
         <strong>
          Have you ever noticed the fingers of
little boys? Yuck! They're disgustingly filthy and sticky
         </strong>
         . The paws
of my goddam dog are cleaner and more sanitary. Little girls can be
kept clean. They are manageable, and you can sort of show them
off. I mean you can dress them and take them out to different places
and be proud of them." (37-year old love-shy man.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Well, I like the theatre. In fact, everything that I really enjoy doing
seems to be considered sort of feminine by people. I wouldn't have
anything in common with a boy. I wouldn't know how to relate to
one. I know I could relate very easily to a little girl. If I had daughters
I know they would both grow up happy and well-adjusted. They
would both be really wanted kids, and they would both be well
taken care of. I don't know what I'd even name a son if I had one.
I've got the names of my daughters all picked out already. I decided
several years ago that I'd call them Lisa and Becky.
         <strong>
          What would I
call a boy?! Attila and Hitler are the only things I can think of
         </strong>
         —or
maybe Fletcher, after my airedale—or maybe Stinky and Smelly! Ha
Ha Ha!" (39-year old love-shy man.)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Notice that these are boys, despising themselves.
       </strong>
       One of them is talking about a complete lesbian society, and the others despise traditional ideas of masculinity.
       <strong>
        "Boys are so dirty and aggressive"
       </strong>
       This is the direction our world is heading.

       after moving to Asia from the States, I can see this happening to a small degree; specifically the seperating the families. Family is the cornerstone of life in Asia. It is an immoveable source of strength, the pillar of love and support, financial, emotional, etc. Families stick together, and as a result are less tied to the modern financial system and reliant on government support.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not solitary creatures, but the US government seems to be encouraging this, and increasing reliance on loans, government assistance (imagine, where will you go when you turn 70? Are  you going to live with your kids, who would happily support you, and in turn, be supported by theirs?) .  People literally have pictures of their parents that they pay respects to, worship, daily. Is that kind of family respect in the US?
      </p>
      <p>
       How much more in rent, electricity, utilities, double-bills, are caused by the seperation? I think most people are struggling to pay rent, because of the way society operates. If you turn 18, its time to go out on your own. You are separated from the most natural source of support and strength, and are reliant on Big Brother, and perhaps payday loans.
