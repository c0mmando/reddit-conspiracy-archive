<p>So, my question is this...where are the Bernie supporters now? Aren&#39;t they at least a little suspicious of the way things are going in this election?</p>

<p>I told her he was used as &quot;false hope&quot; to get people to think they actually have the ability to change things. She disagreed.</p>

<p>But, again, where are they now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with that at all. The media tells us this, but it&#39;s straight propaganda.</p>

<p>A vote for either is a vote for your own enslavement.</p>

<p>Vote Johnson or Stein (and educate yourselves on the downticket races, candidates, and issues before voting!) - get them funding for next election - and tell the Republicans and Democrats where to stick their corrupt, idiotic candidates and parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be right to an extent. The problem is everyone thinks they are doing the right thing. Nobody questions the process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep trying to press this when speaking to friends and relatives who&#39;ve joined the Trump or Clinton trains - they&#39;re being duped. Hardcore conservatives voting for Trump, full-well knowing who and what he is, is the craziest thing I&#39;ve seen in my lifetime. <em>Anyone</em> voting for Clinton is just as crazy.</p>

<p>Most get my points but are terrified of jumping off the train, as if their one piddly vote for Trump or Clinton will keep the other from the Presidency. But I have gotten through to a few - it&#39;s easier for third parties this election than every - two choices that some of us can&#39;t in good conscience vote for.</p>

<p>I thought Romney vs. Obama was bad - man, I&#39;d rather have either. You can&#39;t help but think that this entire election was architected to demoralize us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what they are saying.  They are preparing for a trump presidency on the off chance that the miracle that Clinton is thrown in cuffs.  No one for Bernie is for Hillary except stupid ass bernie himself, probably said publicly with an invisible gun to his head (metaphor).  </p>

<p>Because otherwise we know Clinton has completely stolen this election already.  Yes, I get it: most people are for Trump because they are low information voters, but that doesn&#39;t matter.  It hasn&#39;t since nixon: the cia &quot;gets what it wants&quot;... in this case, &quot;who it wants&quot;.  Trump doesn&#39;t have the diplomacy skills to be president, and Clinton doesn&#39;t have the humanity skills to be president.  And Obama doesn&#39;t have the ethical skills to remain president for a 3rd term in a vote of no confidence in the elections.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s gonna be a shit show for sure.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I made that comment first thing in the morning I did misunderstand.</p>

<p>Although, I&#39;ll comment on a couple things you said. I honestly, 100% believe the whole Bernie movement was created to divide the anti establishment vote, the same way I think trump is the same thing. I think they were both in on it, I mean, Hillary is the most corrupt politician ever, and that&#39;s saying something. How do you get someone like that in office? Infiltrate and disillusion any anti establishment rhetoric.</p>

<p>I agree with you though, it&#39;s definitely up to who the CIA wants. Kennedy was assassinated for a reason.</p>

<p>As always, you have great insights. Keep up the good work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bernie supporters I know are largely focusing on getting the &quot;State Legislative Resolution to Restore Free and Fair Elections in the United States&quot; passed through an organization called <a href="http://www.wolf-pac.com/">Wolf PAC</a>. Essentially, they&#39;re campaigning to pass a constitutional amendment which would reverse the Citizen&#39;s United decision that opened the floodgates to money&#39;s influence in politics. I think that&#39;s an important step in the &quot;revolution&quot; they&#39;re talking about. And so far, the amendment proposing convention has been approved in 4 states and the momentum is good. (As it should be, 97% of Americans support the removal of money from politics; it&#39;s just Congress that disagrees.) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But, again, where are they now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the progressive-leaning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ7wAC2jYLA">The Young Turks network, Sanders did effectively push the Democratic platform into a more liberal direction</a>. I think the reason &quot;Bernie supporters&quot; might be less visible today is because the Sanders campaign pushed a &quot;Not Me, Us&quot; slogan toward the end which made it easier to harness the enthusiasm for their candidate and redirect into more generally into grass-roots movements toward specific political goals (Like that of Wolf PAC mentioned above). In other words, now that he&#39;s no longer the presumptive nominee, they&#39;re not &quot;Bernie supporters&quot; they&#39;re &quot;progressives&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think modern feminism is a complete joke and essentially a psyop. The origins of feminism were literally CIA operatives.</p>

<p>As a woman, I agree with the basic tenets of equality for all humans. However, I in no way subscribe to the modern perversion of the term equality.</p>

<p>As a woman, I believe that I am different than a man. I believe because of this difference, men and women are suited for different things.</p>

<p>I believe that most of these changes have come to be to break down any concept of a family unit. I also have written a lot in my post history about the conspiracy behind modern beliefs about gender.</p>

<p>It took me a long time to break down what I feel was &#39;programming&#39;. 10 years ago I wouldn&#39;t have felt this way.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I do have a hard time relating to modern women. It&#39;s hard for me to make female friends. I&#39;m stuck on Reddit on these forums trying to fulfill some intellectual need that I just can&#39;t do in real life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep trying to press this when speaking to friends and relatives who&#39;ve joined the Trump or Clinton trains - they&#39;re being duped. Hardcore conservatives voting for Trump, full-well knowing who and what he is, is the craziest thing I&#39;ve seen in my lifetime. <em>Anyone</em> voting for Clinton is just as crazy.</p>

<p>Most get my points but are terrified of jumping off the train, as if their one piddly vote for Trump or Clinton will keep the other from the Presidency. But I have gotten through to a few - it&#39;s easier for third parties this election than every - two choices that some of us can&#39;t in good conscience vote for.</p>

<p>I thought Romney vs. Obama was bad - man, I&#39;d rather have either. You can&#39;t help but think that this entire election was architected to demoralize us all.</p>
