      <p>
       There’s a fun game I like to play in a group of trusted friends called “Controversial Opinion.” The rules are simple: Don’t talk about what was shared during Controversial Opinion afterward and you aren’t allowed to “argue” — only to ask questions about why that person feels that way. Opinions can range from “I think James Bond movies are overrated” to “I think Donald Trump would make a excellent president.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually, someone responds to an opinion with, “Oh my god! I had no idea you were one of those people!” Which is really another way of saying “I thought you were on my team!”
      </p>
      <p>
       In psychology, the idea that everyone is like us is called the “false-consensus bias.” This bias often manifests itself when we see TV ratings (“Who the hell are all these people that watch NCIS?”) or in politics (“Everyone I know is for stricter gun control! Who are these backwards rubes that disagree?!”) or polls (“Who are these people voting for Ben Carson?”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Online it means we can be blindsided by the opinions of our friends or, more broadly, America. Over time, this morphs into a subconscious belief that we and our friends are the sane ones and that there’s a crazy “Other Side” that must be laughed at — an 
Other Side that just doesn’t “get it,” and is clearly not as intelligent as “us.” But this holier-than-thou social media behavior is counterproductive, it’s self-aggrandizement at the cost of actual nuanced discourse and if we want to consider online discourse productive, we need to move past this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Economist tracks what media is talking about vs. the habits of actual people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is emerging is the worst kind of echo chamber, one where those inside are increasingly convinced that everyone shares their world view, that their ranks are growing when they aren’t. It’s like clockwork: an event happens and then your social media circle is shocked when a non-social media peer group public reacts to news in an unexpected way. They then mock the Other Side for being “out of touch” or “dumb.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Fredrik deBoer, one of my favorite writers around, touched on this in his Essay “Getting Past the Coalition of the Cool.” He writes:
[The Internet] encourages people to collapse any distinction between their work life, their social life, and their political life. “Hey, that person who tweets about the TV shows I like also dislikes injustice,” which over time becomes “I can identify an ally by the TV shows they like.” The fact that you can mine a Rihanna video for political content becomes, in that vague internety way, the sense that people who don’t see political content in Rihanna’s music aren’t on your side.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone communicates that they are not “on our side” our first reaction is to run away or dismiss them as stupid. To be sure, there are hateful, racist, people not worthy of the small amount of electricity it takes just one of your synapses to fire. I’m instead referencing those who actually believe in an opposing viewpoint of a complicated issue, and do so for genuine, considered reasons. Or at least, for reasons just as good as yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a “political correctness” issue. It’s a fundamental rejection of the possibility to consider that the people who don’t feel the same way you do might be right. It’s a preference to see the Other Side as a cardboard cut out, and not the complicated individual human beings that they actually are.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens instead of genuine intellectual curiosity is the sharing of Slate or Onion or Fox News or Red State links. Sites that exist almost solely to produce content to be shared so friends can pat each other on the back and mock the Other Side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the Other Side! So dumb and unable to see this the way I do!
      </p>
      <p>
       Sharing links that mock a caricature of the Other Side isn’t signaling that we’re somehow more informed. It signals that we’d rather be smug assholes than consider alternative views. It signals that we’d much rather show our friends that we’re like them, than try to understand those who are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s impossible to consider yourself a curious person and participate in social media in this way. We cannot consider ourselves “empathetic” only to turn around and belittle those that don’t agree with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       On Twitter and Facebook this means we prioritize by sharing stuff that will garner approval of our peers over stuff that’s actually, you know, true. We share stuff that ignores wider realities, selectively shares information, or is just an outright falsehood. The misinformation is so rampant that the Washington Post stopped publishing its internet fact-checking column because people didn’t seem to care if stuff was true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where debunking an Internet fake once involved some research, it’s now often as simple as clicking around for an “about” or “disclaimer” page. And where a willingness to believe hoaxes once seemed to come from a place of honest ignorance or misunderstanding, that’s frequently no longer the case. Headlines like “Casey Anthony found dismembered in truck” go viral via old-fashioned schadenfreude — even hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Institutional distrust is so high right now, and cognitive bias so strong always, that the people who fall for hoax news stories are frequently only interested in consuming information that conforms with their views — even when it’s demonstrably fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution, as deBoer says, “You have to be willing to sacrifice your carefully curated social performance and be willing to work with people who are not like you.” In other words you have to recognize that the Other Side is made of actual people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I’d like to go a step further. We should all enter every issue with the very real possibility that we might be wrong this time.
Isn’t it possible that you, reader of Medium and Twitter power user, like me, suffer from this from time to time? Isn’t it possible that we’re not right about everything? That those who live in places not where you live, watch shows that you don’t watch, and read books that you don’t read, have opinions and belief systems just as valid as yours? That maybe you don’t see the entire picture?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think political correctness has gotten out of control? Follow the many great social activists on Twitter. Think America’s stance on guns is puzzling? Read the stories of the 31% of Americans that own a firearm. This is not to say the Other Side is “right” but that they likely have real reasons to feel that way. And only after understanding those reasons can a real discussion take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       As any debate club veteran knows, if you can’t make your opponent’s point for them, you don’t truly grasp the issue. We can bemoan political gridlock and a divisive media all we want. But we won’t truly progress as individuals until we make an honest effort to understand those that are not like us. And you won’t convince anyone to feel the way you do if you don’t respect their position and opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       A dare for the next time you’re in discussion with someone you disagree with: Don’t try to “win.” Don’t try to “convince” anyone of your viewpoint. Don’t score points by mocking them to your peers. Instead try to “lose.” Hear them out. Ask them to convince you and mean it. No one is going to tell your environmentalist friends that you merely asked follow up questions after your brother made his pro-fracking case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, the next time you feel compelled to share a link on social media about current events, ask yourself why you are doing it. Is it because that link brings to light information you hadn’t considered? Or does it confirm your world view, reminding your circle of intellectual teammates that you’re not on the Other Side?
I implore you to seek out your opposite. When you hear someone cite “facts” that don’t support your viewpoint don’t think “that can’t be true!” Instead consider, “Hm, maybe that person is right? I should look into this.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Because refusing to truly understand those who disagree with you is intellectual laziness and worse, is usually worse than what you’re accusing the Other Side of doing.

       O yea? Continuity of Government subverted the Constitution on Sept 14th 2001 and since then the CIA has taken command. The whole kabuki theater is just a cover or Coverment as some in the liberty movement call it. So all that opposite understanding goes out the window once you understand COG.

       Playing devil's advocate here...
      </p>
      <p>
       The "other side" is probably not going to click any of your links. Two of them are youtube videos and the rest are links back to r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I clicked one of your links back to Reddit hoping that it would send me to some verifiable information, like a a few high-ranking officials admitting to this, a BBC article, a PBS article, a link to a .gov site, a link showing us some legislation, etc. Nope, it's just a youtube video at the bottom and a link to "history commons," whatever that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will need to cite some actual, easily-verifiable information as an introduction to your viewpoint. The youtube videos and other stuff should be at the bottom of your citation list. It's 2016, you should market your ideas as if they are competing against other ideas. Make your viewpoint easily accessible, or at least give us something that can be verified as fact within 5 minutes so that we know we aren't wasting time on a conspiracy video.

       No you did it wrong.

        You are a forum spy

       Your post reads like a forum spy's, one who is trying to create a fracture point using 'doubtmaking'.  Just because you say 'playing the devils advocate' doesn't excuse you from making a doubtmaking shitpost.  Here's why I believe this:

       If you clicked on those conspiracy links then you'd see there are links to wikipedia, and whitehouse.gov within the text posts.
       <em>
        MY posts, which is why I posted them
       </em>
       .  I seem to be an authority on COG here in this sub.  You are a lazy human who has tried to discredit my links by saying they go back to conspiracy.  You are literally the kind of annoying pseudoskeptic that the OP is talking about.  You presume that anything on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is already false---so why are you here then?  To fuck with us?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't know what history commons is, you're a dolt.  Its far more authoritative than a gov site, a pbs or bbc article.  If you think those mainstream media sources are authoritative, then you really don't belong here actually.

       Your accusations are incorrect. I put myself in the shoes of a skeptic, then analysed your post.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do want other people to read your material, right? I spent a good 5 minutes checking yours to determine if I should spend another hour or maybe 5 hours going through everything you've presented. After a good spot checking, it seemed like another conspiracy shitpost, so I just moved on. There is so much information out there that you should market your posts as verified fact. Assuming your post does contain verified facts, you presented it as if it was a conspiracy shitpost, unwittingly I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       I shouldn't have to go through every post and every comment on here to find the 5 percent which isn't shit. I don't have enough time to do that. If your post isn't shit, then make it obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I don't know what history commons is. If you did a poll, I would bet at least 95 percent of the world also does not know what history commons is. Don't be a dick. If you assume everyone else knows everything you know, then you will not be able to change anyone's mind. If you present your posts as conspiracy shitposts, you are only going to be popular with those who are already conspiracy theorists. You will be wasting your time.
      </p>
      <p>
       "History commons? WTF is that, some conspiracy crap ...SKIP."
      </p>
      <p>
       That is probably what happens with the bulk of the people who read your posts.

        What is emerging is the worst kind of echo chamber, one where those inside are increasingly convinced that everyone shares their world view, that their ranks are growing when they aren’t. It’s like clockwork: an event happens and then your social media circle is shocked when a non-social media peer group public reacts to news in an unexpected way. They then mock the Other Side for being “out of touch” or “dumb.”

       See "Bill Maher's republicans are

        'in the bubble'

Then he just throws his hands in the air and blames Bush because st. obama is blameless.  He also thinks Isis is real, and given his 'insider alternative hbo news team : VICE"...which
       <em>
        he
