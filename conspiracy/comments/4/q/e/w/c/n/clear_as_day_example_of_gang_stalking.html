<p>Gang stalking is a form of community mobbing and organized stalking combined. Just like you have workplace mobbing, and online mobbing, which are both fully recognized as legitimate, this is the community form.
Most gang stalking targets are women, minorities, dissidents, whistle blowers, and outspoken.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what was discussed. You added that massive generalization in to add credence to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GangStalking is a delusion. The idea that entire communities would work together to troll some strange person is unfounded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But &quot;entire communities&quot; aren&#39;t required for GangStalking. You make that a part of it&#39;s definition in order to discredit the idea. That is &quot;unfounded.&quot;</p>

<p>Stalking is real. Harassment is real. Surveillance is real. Conspiracies are real.</p>

<p>Some group could conspire to stalk, survey, and harass an individual, therefore, GangStalking does exist.</p>

<p>However, the linked video is anything but evidence of gangstalking. It&#39;s evidence of assholes acting like assholes to other assholes which is a &quot;proven conspiracy&quot; in the genes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t move the goal posts at all. Gang stalking is clearly defined in that it does not clearly define what groups specifically are taking part. The assumption is that everyone in the community is in on it. the term itself has no useful purpose except to give paranoid people something to focus on. Stalking is stalking. Harassment is harassment. Surveillance is surveillance. Gangstalking is not real, it is imagined. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll agree that it is as effective as &quot;hate crime&quot; or similar crimes by another name. But if it&#39;s composed of actual, verifiable actions (Stalking, Harassment, Surveillance) can it not also be as verifiable and real as those actions?</p>

<p>No. Stalkers stalk. Harassers harass. Nobody &quot;gangstalks&quot;. It&#39;s not real. If you are being watched by law enforcement, that&#39;s not gang stalking. It&#39;s called surveillance. Once again, I did not move the goal posts, the word has a definition, and it is vague and so open to interpretation that it means nothing. It is a way to highlight someone&#39;s paranoid delusions. Targeted individuals believe that if someone sneezes near them on the street, they are a gangstalker. Stalking victims believe that the person following them down he street in the middle of the night is going to kidnap and rape them. One scenario is real, and dangerous, the other involves a fucking crazy person who has lost touch with reality. </p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve heard this phenomenon tends to tie into things like V2K, implying these communities of people are being subtlely manipulated to target an individual. I&#39;m not saying every case of this is 100% real and it happens everyday, but it&#39;s definitely a thing that&#39;s possible in this world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know all that much about actual mind control technology, but I&#39;m fairly sure some are more susceptible to it than others. It may not work on large populations or on specific individuals in those populations. </p>

<p>Though you are right that it seems like a lot of effort to go through, which is why I&#39;d imagine it would only be used when its deemed a practical tactic for the situation. Maybe there&#39;s a well known and respected scientist who&#39;s getting too close to some truth and you need him discredited since killing him is too sketchy, so you make him appear crazy. </p>

<p>Like I said it&#39;s probably not as widespread as the paranoid schizophrenic hivemind might believe, but it is a very real possibility. I could see the possibility kind of exacerbating the delusions of some people until they believe it&#39;s happening to them and then we get another report of a &#39;targeted individual&#39;. However I get the feeling not only is your average Joe not on the list, but even if they were I would think that whoever is behind the mind control would be able to prevent them from telling of their experience.</p>

<p>inform  every american about the joys and benefits of gang stalking a lot of them will sign up. after the recruitment period is over, we&#39;ll know exactly how many americans need to die. most of them are probably demons anyway or some other disgusting creature. you have to be a complete fuckin retard to be a gang stalker, and this country has too many complete fuckin retards fucking everything up. we need to get rid of them. harsh problems call for harsh solutions.</p>

<p>this i believe, is the best way to save this country. imagine all those billions of dollars wasted on gang stalking going towards thats useful like schools, over-crowded prisons, detroit, jobs, police accountability. </p>

<p>as you know, those of us with brains are aware of the consequences of gang stalking, which are more long-term than short-term. anyone with a brain cell knows gang stalking cant last forever. i dunno who&#39;d sign up for this shit other than advanced masochists who want more than just a ball gag and a fist up their ass. thats assuming they have a future.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But if it&#39;s composed of actual, verifiable actions (Stalking, Harassment, Surveillance) can it not also be as verifiable and real as those actions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Stalkers stalk. Harassers harass. Nobody &quot;gangstalks&quot;. It&#39;s not real. If you are being watched by law enforcement, that&#39;s not gang stalking. It&#39;s called surveillance. Once again, I did not move the goal posts, the word has a definition, and it is vague and so open to interpretation that it means nothing. It is a way to highlight someone&#39;s paranoid delusions. Targeted individuals believe that if someone sneezes near them on the street, they are a gangstalker. Stalking victims believe that the person following them down he street in the middle of the night is going to kidnap and rape them. One scenario is real, and dangerous, the other involves a fucking crazy person who has lost touch with reality. </p>
