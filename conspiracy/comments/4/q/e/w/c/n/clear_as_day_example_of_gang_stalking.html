      </p>
      <p>
       Gang stalking is a form of community mobbing and organized stalking combined. Just like you have workplace mobbing, and online mobbing, which are both fully recognized as legitimate, this is the community form.
Most gang stalking targets are women, minorities, dissidents, whistle blowers, and outspoken.

       Gang stalking is real. You just don't know what it is. It's not some huge government conspiracy involving hundreds of paid agents. It's a local crime, targeting individuals for sport, or in an attempt to force them to move from their homes.

       No. Stalking is real. Harassment is real. Surveillance is real. GangStalking is a delusion. The idea that entire communities would work together to troll some strange person is unfounded. I do not deny humans stalking and harassing others, but targeted individuals say "everyone is in on it" which is insane.

       That's not what was discussed. You added that massive generalization in to add credence to:

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But "entire communities" aren't required for GangStalking. You make that a part of it's definition in order to discredit the idea. That is "unfounded."
      </p>
      <p>
       Stalking is real. Harassment is real. Surveillance is real. Conspiracies are real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some group could conspire to stalk, survey, and harass an individual, therefore, GangStalking does exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the linked video is anything but evidence of gangstalking. It's evidence of assholes acting like assholes to other assholes which is a "proven conspiracy" in the genes.

       I didn't move the goal posts at all. Gang stalking is clearly defined in that it does not clearly define what groups specifically are taking part. The assumption is that everyone in the community is in on it. the term itself has no useful purpose except to give paranoid people something to focus on. Stalking is stalking. Harassment is harassment. Surveillance is surveillance. Gangstalking is not real, it is imagined.

       I'll agree that it is as effective as "hate crime" or similar crimes by another name. But if it's composed of actual, verifiable actions (Stalking, Harassment, Surveillance) can it not also be as verifiable and real as those actions?

       No. Stalkers stalk. Harassers harass. Nobody "gangstalks". It's not real. If you are being watched by law enforcement, that's not gang stalking. It's called surveillance. Once again, I did not move the goal posts, the word has a definition, and it is vague and so open to interpretation that it means nothing. It is a way to highlight someone's paranoid delusions. Targeted individuals believe that if someone sneezes near them on the street, they are a gangstalker. Stalking victims believe that the person following them down he street in the middle of the night is going to kidnap and rape them. One scenario is real, and dangerous, the other involves a fucking crazy person who has lost touch with reality.

       "The assumption is that everyone in the community is in on it"  At one point did the definition of gangstalkers become a 'community' and not just a group of people? What number of people, precisely, constitutes a 'community'?  Where did you get the number from?

       It may sound insane but wouldn't that be all the more reason to do it to someone, because who would believe them if they tried to tell anyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've heard this phenomenon tends to tie into things like V2K, implying these communities of people are being subtlely manipulated to target an individual. I'm not saying every case of this is 100% real and it happens everyday, but it's definitely a thing that's possible in this world.

       What would be the purpose of this? So much effort and coordination, to what end? If we had the power to control populations in this way, the world would be all wrapped up by TPTB. Chaos still rules.

       I don't know all that much about actual mind control technology, but I'm fairly sure some are more susceptible to it than others. It may not work on large populations or on specific individuals in those populations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though you are right that it seems like a lot of effort to go through, which is why I'd imagine it would only be used when its deemed a practical tactic for the situation. Maybe there's a well known and respected scientist who's getting too close to some truth and you need him discredited since killing him is too sketchy, so you make him appear crazy.
      </p>

       Like I said it's probably not as widespread as the paranoid schizophrenic hivemind might believe, but it is a very real possibility. I could see the possibility kind of exacerbating the delusions of some people until they believe it's happening to them and then we get another report of a 'targeted individual'. However I get the feeling not only is your average Joe not on the list, but even if they were I would think that whoever is behind the mind control would be able to prevent them from telling of their experience.

       Consensus reality is rendered based off what we co create through our projections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain individuals have more spiritual sway in that co creation. These individuals are identified and attempted to be turned into agents of fear, so that the dominant reality that manifests is one of fear. If they could release that fear, the universe would fail to render these stalking agents from base consciousness in.

       Have you ever heard of the term 'gaslighting'? That is essentially the point of gangstalking, and in a not so subtle way what you appear to be attempting to do to the OP by implying he and people like him ought to question their sanity.

       Oh god, you're not another one of those teenage edgelords who does this kind of stuff for kicks are you? If anyone needs to be monitored by law enforcement, it's people like you.  Guaranteed you will be moving onto torturing homeless people or animals within a few years.

       If you believe in gangstalking you are either stupid or crazy, plain and simple. Gaslighting is gaslighting. Call it what it is. Gangstalking is pure unchecked paranoia run amok.

       as you know, those of us with brains are aware of the consequences of gang stalking, which are more long-term than short-term. anyone with a brain cell knows gang stalking cant last forever. i dunno who'd sign up for this shit other than advanced masochists who want more than just a ball gag and a fist up their ass. thats assuming they have a future.

       Way I saw it the bike's engine jumped into higher revs as he downshifted to brake in front of the pizza guy trying to pull out in front of him.

       But, speaking of gangstalking i find this channel highly entertaining, and a little creepy, especially the one where he sees the same guy hours later at a record store and another store the next day.

       u know what, the useless dumb fuck bitch slaves are right. america needs more gang stalkers. everyone that is willing should be a gang stalker. its the best way to save this country from its inevitable shit storm.
      </p>
      <p>
       inform  every american about the joys and benefits of gang stalking a lot of them will sign up. after the recruitment period is over, we'll know exactly how many americans need to die. most of them are probably demons anyway or some other disgusting creature. you have to be a complete fuckin retard to be a gang stalker, and this country has too many complete fuckin retards fucking everything up. we need to get rid of them. harsh problems call for harsh solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       this i believe, is the best way to save this country. imagine all those billions of dollars wasted on gang stalking going towards thats useful like schools, over-crowded prisons, detroit, jobs, police accountability.

        But if it's composed of actual, verifiable actions (Stalking, Harassment, Surveillance) can it not also be as verifiable and real as those actions?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No. Stalkers stalk. Harassers harass. Nobody "gangstalks". It's not real. If you are being watched by law enforcement, that's not gang stalking. It's called surveillance. Once again, I did not move the goal posts, the word has a definition, and it is vague and so open to interpretation that it means nothing. It is a way to highlight someone's paranoid delusions. Targeted individuals believe that if someone sneezes near them on the street, they are a gangstalker. Stalking victims believe that the person following them down he street in the middle of the night is going to kidnap and rape them. One scenario is real, and dangerous, the other involves a fucking crazy person who has lost touch with reality.
