<p>I have not done much research on this at all.
But, the black square involves Saturn.</p>

<p>Why the Judges and Priests wears black, is because of Saturn.
Why they graduate with a black square on their head in the US, is because of Saturn.</p>

<p>And much more related to Saturn, which goes backs thousands of years. And yes, these secret societies really do exist.</p>

<p>I&#39;m nowhere near to have any knowledge on this however.
But it&#39;s fascinating stuff, truly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Treating Saturn as something &#39;bad&#39; or to avoid may be a mistake, the solar system is holistic in nature. They may be creating this fear over Sarturn in order to keep people away from exploring their own Saturn aspect.  </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense to regard all the other planets as benevolent, but Saturn as not. The whole system works together.  Saturn as Chronos is related to Time, so no wonder they want to keep people away from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so what you&#39;re assuming is that the man on  power worship saturn since they managed to put so much Saturnian symbolism into our society? - I have researched a bit and it seems that the black cube symbol is tightly connected with Saturn worship.

    <div class="md"><p>What is the connection between Saturn and the Cube though? The Mecca thing isn&#39;t enough, is there a geometric proof?  </p>

<p>The Christian Cross is an unfolded Cube, so it may represent Christ&#39;s victory over Time, (The Solar victory over Saturn).

    <div class="md"><p>the cube represents a prison in every direction; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4280Iw-kwc">passio</a> goes over an explanation of this at length in the link.</p>

<p>the cross(crucifix) is another victory of saturn; people are literally worshiping an idol... the image of a man nailed to the cube (the prison), his mind wreathed in barbs. </p>

<p>the &quot;black lodge&quot; is a name for the group of elite-level saturn worshipers that seem to be &quot;the powers that be&quot;. They <em>allegedly</em> sacrifice children and engage in rampant pedophilia and other possibly even darker shit...</p>

<p>There are those who have said that &quot;magic&quot; is the art of changing consciousness in accordance with Will, and these people practice this art to serve themselves. </p>

<p>That is, if you believe in this kind of thing...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubal">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubal</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hubal (Arabic: هبل‎‎) was a god worshipped in pre-Islamic Arabia, notably at the Kaaba in Mecca. His idol was a human figure, believed to control acts of divination, which was in the form of tossing arrows before the statue. The direction in which the arrows pointed answered questions asked of the idol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Access to the idol was controlled by the Quraysh tribe. The god&#39;s devotees fought against followers of the Islamic prophet Muhammad during the Battle of Badr in 624 CE. After Muhammad entered Mecca in 630 CE, he removed the statue of Hubal from the Kaaba along with the idols of all the other pagan gods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hubal most prominently appeared at Mecca, where an image of him was worshipped at the Kaaba. According to Karen Armstrong, the sanctuary was dedicated to Hubal, who was worshipped as the greatest of the 360 idols the Kaaba contained, which probably represented the days of the year.[1]
Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi&#39;s Book of Idols describes the image as shaped like a human, with <strong>the right hand broken off and replaced with a golden hand</strong>.</p>

<p>In short: Saturn was our original sun (a brown dwarf) once upon a time. We were captured by our current star and cosmic upheaval commenced. The ancients were witnesses of the events and mythology is nothing other than the history. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLBuBiGE5o0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLBuBiGE5o0</a></p>

<p>The worship of Saturn gradually began to change to the worship of Sol.</p>

<p>Not only was the Earth&#39;s crust fractured, but also man&#39;s psyche. Ego arose as a reaction to keep man somewhat functional. The unconscious is your real consciousness, but your not fully aware of it -- it&#39;s very powerful. The Ego is nothing but a socially constructed cast to help protect the unconscious as it heals and mends itself (although, it is being toxically misused and is very misunderstood today). Therefore, Humanity is in a state of trauma. Think MK-Ultra on a mass scale that stretches through our past up until now; that is what religion, politics, economics, etc., is -- a giant occult mind fuck. We are vulnerable, loss and disconnected to our true Selves, our connection with nature, etc. The Elites have set themselves up as our rulers, using occult and historical knowledge that they&#39;ve sequestered from our &quot;golden age&quot; under Saturn (all modern criminal syndicates originate with Akhenaten in Egypt, down to the European Royalty and the Vatican [the cross and the crown which are together are a continuation of Akhenaten&#39;s Atonism-Sun worship], then down to the secret societies, and the rest of it). Good and moral people can sit in their same positions and things would be much better, but these demons want to exasperate and continue picking at the trauma to keep us in a state of deep anxiety, fear -- trauma -- so they can continue to manipulate and rule. History keeps repeating itself for a reason -- that&#39;s how trauma works. The fall of Babylon, the fall of Rome, and maybe the fall of America is an example of it. They produce economic collapses because it mimics the existential horror that the human species experienced when the planet was in upheaval and falling apart all around them (all of this is still encoded in our genetic memory or unconscious) and triggers the trauma. It&#39;s like a button. They just keep pushing it over and over again -- not really ever changing their game -- and it keeps working for them. Although, recently people have been &#39;waking up&#39; more and more and people are recognizing their games. The human psyche is healing. All learning we do now is merely remembering who we once were: Greatness.</p>

<p>I can keep going on, but that&#39;s the gist of it. Tons of info on YouTube and the internet in general. Pieces are still being put together, but that is the basic story as I understand it.</p>

<p>Saturn is the sixth planet, it has a six sided hexagram on its pole, the jews worship on the sixth day, which is named after Saturn(Saturday is the sixth day according to the International Organization for Standardization, and it was named after the sixth planet for a reason, because it is the sixth day. Sunday, which is named after the Sun obviously is the seventh day, 7 being the number of the Lord, and the Sun being the object which gives life to our planet.) The jew&#39;s number is 6, the same number of the beast. They are who the following passage from the Book of Revelation is obviously talking about.</p>

<p>Revelation 3:9</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The original jews fell from God&#39;s grace after rejecting their true messiah, this was confirmed by the destruction of the second temple. The true chosen and those that are of Abraham&#39;s seed are those who follow Christ.</p>

<p>I hope people don&#39;t take this seriously. Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, but nobody knew that when the days of the week were named. The days were named after the Sun, the Moon, and the <em>five</em> planets known to the ancients. Earth was not considered a planet back then.</p>

<p>The Jewish Sabbath, which runs from what we call Friday night to Saturday night, is the <em>seventh</em> day in their week.</p>

<p><a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/occult-symbols-in-corporate-logos-pt-1/"> Occult Symbols in Corporate Logos </a></p>

<p>People who run/create companies appear to be following a hidden &quot;occult&quot; religion of some kind. It&#39;s very clear that there is a reason behind all of the Saturn logos and other occult symbolism, but the actual reason for it I am not aware of. </p>

<p>Before you judge this as some whackjob conspiracy theory, see the evidence for yourself. It&#39;s <strong>very</strong> obvious. Once you see it you cannot unsee it. It will change the way you see the world. </p>

<p>Google image search &quot;saturn corporate logos.&quot; There are so many corporations that use Saturn as their logo. Nike, Saturn (cars), Nissan, directv, internet explorer, etc.</p>

<p>If the company doesn&#39;t use Saturn as the basis for their logo, they might go with a black cube, they might use a freemasonic square and compass...&quot;Pyramid corporate logo,&quot; &quot;eye corporate logo,&quot; etc. Get creative with the image searches. It&#39;s all based on occult symbolism. The craziest ones are Time Warner Cable and other eyeball logos on media companies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you&#39;d find it interesting to check out about the Bosnian and Bulgarian &quot;Bogumils&quot; - also a form of early Christianity (before it was slaughtered by the Roman Catholic church) where it was taught that the material existence was made from the Lucifer and hence aiming towards the spiritual was a must. Also their saying that this existence was &quot;the dream of the demons&quot; sounds quite interesting </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, Bogumils believed in a world within the body and a world outside the body, much like the Cathars believed. They both had a dualistic approach to their belief system. Cathars were said to be an offshoot of Bogumils but were almost identical in their belief system. But when we talk about moderate dualism: there is one good God and a fallen angel (Lucifer). Did the CATHARS  and the Bogumils see Lucifer as the bad god of the earth?    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They did not use the Christian cross nor build churches because they revered their gifted form and considered their body to be the temple. This gave rise to many forms of practice to cleanse oneself through purging, fasting, celebrating and dancing.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Interesting that they revered their gifted form and had zero statues. Seems as if this is what Jesus supposedly preached. It wasn&#39;t merely about worshiping as it was having a relationship with God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So... Saturn worship was (apparently- do your own research but this is some of what I uncovered) Satanic in nature. The Sun/Sol represented God and Saturn was -to our knowledge- the farthest planet from the Sol. So it represented the dark version of the sun.  </p>

<p>It also appeared black hence it&#39;s nickname black sun. As has been mentioned it is related to the black cube. If you represent the 3d cube on a 2d plane it appears as a hexagon. Add a triangle to each side and you get a hexagram a.k.a. the star of David... which is why someone said that Jews worshiped Saturn. They also said that Muslims worshiped the moon, but realistically <a href="http://f.tqn.com/y/islam/1/S/6/9/1280px-Kaaba2.jpg">Muslims also worship the black cube which represents Saturn</a>.</p>

<p>Notice that the muslims form rings around the kaaba... like the rings of Saturn. Saturn is also nicknamed the &quot;Lord of the rings&quot; which is, of course.... where we get Sauron a.k.a. Saturn a.k.a. Satan from. Also where we got wedding rings from. </p>

<p>Back to the hexagram.... inside it is the hexagon with SIX sides... on each side is a triangle to make the star so there are SIX traingles. At the tip of each triangle there are SIX points. The degrees of each angle of a hexagon= 66. </p>

<p>Finally... to tie the hexagon, the black (hole) sun, the lord of the rings (eye of sauron) all together...

    <div class="md"><p>Saturn is not inherently bad. Saturn is the last planet you can see with your eyes. Thought to be the edge of the universe so to speak. Saturn is associated with time, also he is called Chronos. Time=death. So people think of Saturn in relationship to death, the end of the limits, the barrier, restriction. People don&#39;t like death or limits, so it&#39;s thought of as negative when it just is. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t consider Saturn&#39;s opposite to be the Sun, that&#39;s generally more associated to Jupiter. Good fortune, expansion. Saturn is the inhale, Jupiter the exhale. Both necessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Making you fear Saturn is a trick.  </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t integrate all the planets holistically then you will never go &#39;over the rainbow&#39;, &#39;beyond the infinite&#39; etc. You can&#39;t just accept all the other planets as harmless, yet reject Saturn. It doesn&#39;t work like that.</p>

<p>There seems to be an agenda to keep people in fear of Saturn, probably because it connects to Time and Death, and they don&#39;t want people exploring that side of themselves, so they want to scare them away from integrating it holistically.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s too easy to just regard all the other planets as benign albeit eccentric, yet we should just reject saturn, it seems like they want people to reject it because they don&#39;t want people to gain the understanding of Death and Time for themselves.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s why there are so many Jupiter-esque movies nowadays. (i.e &#39;Epic Adventure&#39; with high color saturation) i.e Jurassic World.<br/>
Keeping people at the level of Jupiter.  </p>

<p>The Wizard of Oz as Saturn being &#39;The Green Man&#39; in Mythology. i.e &quot;Nothing to fear&quot;<br/>
<a href="http://journalofantiques.com/2006/features/mystical-magical-mistletoe-the-link-between-santa-claus-the-green-man/">http://journalofantiques.com/2006/features/mystical-magical-mistletoe-the-link-between-santa-claus-the-green-man/</a>  </p>

<p>While the long coat worn by Father Christmas is similar to that of St. Nicholas, the origins of this particular Christmas character go back much further. The celebration of the Green Man in British and European history was a worship of a personification of nature.  </p>

<p>The Green Man was decorated with ivy and berry holly, the traditional foliage even now associated with Christmas. He was supposed to be a very jovial man, whose large beard was constructed from holly and ivy!</p>

<p>Saturnalia: The Real Roots of Christmas</p>

<p>Many Christians today believe that Christmas is a Christian holiday. The fact is that people have been celebrating Christmas, long before the birth of Christ. The festivity was known then, as Saturnalia.  </p>

<p>The movie 2001 is really about Saturn in the original book, so it&#39;s interesting with the stargate sequence and going beyond. &quot;Over the rainbow&quot; 7 colors, stargate sequence. The 7 colors and Penrose&#39;s 17 tile patterns have something to do with the &#39;wallpaper&#39; of our experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sun worship, as far as Egypt goes, ties to both Ra and Horus, though. In earlier Egyptian history they were separate, but later on Horus became more or less synonymous with Ra; whether this was because they were, in fact, the same, or because one usurped the title/identity of the other, I am not sure, although I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the latter. </p>

<p>Of those two, only Ra was considered the &quot;father of all gods&quot; like you said.  Horus was the son of Osiris and Isis (Goddess of fertility, although I guess you could call her &#39;mother nature&#39;)and was supposed to be the reincarnation of Osiris which gave the whole story disturbing incestuous undertones.  Coincidentally, the story of Horus/Osiris is more or less a copy of from the story of Nimrod aka Baal (guy who built the Tower of Babel and was killed by Noah&#39;s son, Shem, iirc) and Semiramis, who is also represented by the sun.</p>

<p>What I find interesting about Sun worship in modern times is the prevalence of sun symbolism in various blockbuster films. Here are a few examples:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZZloOPRnQ8">The Hobbit</a></p>

<p>At about a minute into the clip the Sun is shown shining behind Gandalf&#39;s head, much as you see in Christian art, as he talks about simple acts of kindness and love to keep darkness at bay.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suVPJuRDeVA">Pacific Rim</a></p>

<p>Notice when Pentecost (an interesting name with religious significance in of itself) exits the Jaeger, the extreme sun symbolism, in almost the exact same manner)  An interesting tidbit about this movie:  Try and count how many times you see &quot;eagle&quot; or &quot;bird&quot; imagery (on their suits, all over the walls in the military bases and TV broadcasts).  Now, it&#39;s not uncommon for eagles to be used to symbolize &quot;murica!&quot;, but they are also the symbol of Horus.  Draw whatever conclusions you will, I merely found it interesting.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzxzajhak9Y">Jurassic World</a></p>

<p>The first time you seen the main protagonist, or &quot;Hero&quot;, in this film, he is enshrouded in Sunlight in a very similar manner to the other two scenes and his line is &quot;okay, eyes on me&quot;.  Also interesting to note that his role is as the raptors &quot;Alpha&quot; and that&#39;s how he is often referred to.</p>

<p>Anyway, just some food for thought.  There are lots of examples of this sort of thing in other movies, it&#39;s not just limited to these three.  It&#39;s actually quite glaring and obvious if you know what to look for. </p>

<p>You mentioned Israel, which reminded me of an interesting factoid: Back in the 90s or early 2000s the Israeli government minted coins with the Tower of Babel on them, which is confusing to say the least because I&#39;m pretty sure in the Old Testament that Nimrod was considered to have built the Tower as an act of rebellion against God. </p>
