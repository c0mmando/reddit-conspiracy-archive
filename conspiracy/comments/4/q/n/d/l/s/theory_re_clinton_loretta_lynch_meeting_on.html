       Lots of speculation about this meeting between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch on the tarmac at the Phoenix airport:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/29/politics/bill-clinton-loretta-lynch/">
        http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/29/politics/bill-clinton-loretta-lynch/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       'Lynch and Bill Clinton met privately in Phoenix Monday after the two realized they were on the same tarmac, an aide to the former president said. The encounter took place ahead of the public release Tuesday morning of the House Benghazi Committee's report on the 2012 attack on a U.S. consulate in Libya.
      </p>
      <p>
       The meeting is raising questions about whether the independence of the Justice Department, which is conducting an investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server, might have been compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking at a news conference in Phoenix on Tuesday, Lynch confirmed the meeting and denied the two spoke about any matter pending before the Justice Department or the Benghazi probe. She also said the former president "did not raise anything" about an ongoing case or anything of that nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as he was leaving and spoke to myself and my husband on the plane," Lynch said according to CNN affiliate KNXV/ABC15. "Our conversation was a great deal about grandchildren, it was primarily social about our travels and he mentioned golf he played in Phoenix."'
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that Bill tried to strike a deal with Loretta Lynch, promising to advance her career and nominate her to the Supreme Court if she agrees not to indict Hillary re: the email server. Hard to believe this meeting wasn't planned and didn't relate to the FBI's investigation of Hillary Clinton, which, as Attorney General, Loretta Lynch is the top authority on--as the FBI falls under the DoJ's command. I think this theory makes the most sense as the Clintons will do anything they can to stay in the campaign and win the presidency and this is a realistic offer that they would be able to promise to Lynch if Hillary is elected. Thoughts?

       I used to think Bill Clinton was a good President.  Then I thought he was not a very good President.  Now I think he is an opportunistic, narcissistic bag of sleaze.  Just like his wife.

       I had the same progressive throughout the years--now I think they're not just opportunistic bags of sleaze but people who would do anything to stay in power, including murder. And who use that power to make themselves and their friends rich.

       Right.... You stop and board a plane on the Tarmac away from the public to talk about golf and grandkids .

       This had to be a setup..the dems have a trick up their sleeve..if Lynch passes the job down or there's a special prosecutor it may delay the proceedings until after the election..then if she wins they won't prosecute until her term(s)  is over..or something along those lines..

       Any backroom dealings would have been done in the shadows already.  This 'incidental' meeting that just happened make headlines is an attack on Lynch, initiated after other methods failed.  Watch for a feeding frenzy over Lynch with her political career in the balance.  Newsmakers, Republicans &amp; Democrats alike will start to turn on her as the Clintons turn up the heat.

       It's possible that Bill/Hillary might have WANTED to get AG Lynch to recuse herself because they thought she'd actually go through with an indictment... so that a special prosecutor more favorable to them would be put in place!
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill and Hillary aren't stupid... Bill is an ex-president for goodness sake, he knows meeting with Lynch would look horribly. So one should ask, why did he do it!?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary is the best of the best when it comes to deception, manipulation and getting what she wants by any means necessary. Basically, she's a world class criminal who does the bidding of her masters.

       I can't see him doing that so overtly... if he were to do something like that, it would probably be more subtle and the message would be delivered by someone removed from the Clintons. Plus, their reputation exceeds them. They don't need to go around making direct threats; people know what they're capable of and what happens when you get in their way.
