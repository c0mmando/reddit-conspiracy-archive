</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. </p>

<p>Apparently OP does not know the difference between a &quot;<strong>fake</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>hoax</strong>&quot; (which would be a overly complicated <strong>theatrical production</strong> where no one is really hurt) and a <strong>False Flag</strong> (which is a <strong>real</strong> attack involving real bombs, guns, etc, and in which people really DO die or are injured). </p>

<p>The only difference between a &quot;genuine&quot; attack and a &quot;False Flag&quot; attack is the MOTIVE of the False-Flag attackers - which is to lay blame on an &quot;innocent&quot; <strong>third party</strong>, usually for the purpose of manipulating public opinion and mobilizing political/military retaliation <strong>against the blamed party</strong>.</p>

<p>Imaginary example: Boston HATES Cleveland, but it does not want to waste resources attacking Cleveland, so instead, it launches a FALSE FLAG attack against Chicago <em>(who Boston doesn&#39;t like THAT much anyway)</em>, making sure that it LOOKS like Cleveland did the dirty deed. Naturally, Chicago gets PISSED, and STOMPS THE SHIT out of Cleveland <em>(who actually did nothing to Chicago)</em>. Net result: Cleveland gets STOMPED by Chicago, while Boston sits back, cracks a beer and watches the fireworks.</p>

<p>Is that so?</p>

<p>If that be the case, why don&#39;t you make the differentiation clear? You used the term &quot;False Flag&quot; in the title, but your soliloquy makes no mention of &quot;False Flags&quot;, only FAKES and HOAXES.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>It seems that there is a concerted effort to conflate the terms &quot;False Flag&quot; and &quot;Hoax&quot; in the public mindset - thereby delegitimizing the former, much as the term &quot;Conspiracy&quot; has been <strong>intentionally</strong> delegitimized so as to make anyone who questions the &quot;official narrative&quot; look like a raving lunatic.</p>

<p>If you are NOT trying to muddy the waters, <strong>edit your soliloquy</strong> and clarify, or admit that you are guilty as charged.</p>

<p>:-) </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point I&#39;m making is that [<strong>THIS SUB</strong>] immediately throws out those terms literally minutes after an event happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Head&#39;s up, Bub.</p>

<p>YOU are a participant in THIS SUB, which means that YOU are every bit as guilty as those you indignantly ACCUSE when you condemn the ENTIRE SUB.</p>

<p>Do you believe that THIS SUB operates under a HIVE MIND?</p>

<p>If so, <strong>you are a part of that hive mind</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pointed this out the other week after the Orlando shooting.  Within minutes of the attack it was being claimed here that it was a hoax.  Minutes.  Same thing happens every single time.  Literally every, single, time.   That makes zero sense.  I mentioned that if all shootings this sub claimed were false flags actually were false flags, that would mean this country is without incident since well before 9.11.  Of course, it didn&#39;t go over well.  Was downvoted, called a shill and a plant, you know, standard <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> response when someone doesn&#39;t agree with you.  <strong>Accepting everything as fake without sufficient evidence is absolutely no better than accepting everything as true.</strong>  This sub has practically become a farce of itself.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the OP. The quantity of information from unreliable sources, or posts with little or no factual evidence to back claims is horrendous.  It could be considered endemic on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.   </p>

<p>If misinformation is propagated, then people will just turn away from that information.  It also tarnishes any real investigative journalism posted to the subreddit.  Conspiracies should be formed with a decent amount of information, cross referenced with multiple sources, and presented in a decent format.</p>

<p>The pinned &quot;Lets look at the Orlando Shooting&quot; post ( I forget its whole name ), is a good example of investigative journalism on this subreddit.  There are others, but that is a prominent post that I&#39;m glad to have read.</p>

<p>Paints work that way, subtractivly absorbing certain wavelengths of light and reflecting the rest. Lights work oppositly and in an additive fashion. There are even different primaries! Red blue and green mix and make white, and as you taken them away you get yellow cyan and magenta</p>

<p>it really doesn&#39;t matter how educated either of us are. there is either a way to disprove flat earth or there is not. the invitation stands. </p>

<p>what experiments have I done? I have measured the surface of water. allowing for the miniscus -- which is not proportional but always the same size on the edges -- the surface of still water is always flat and perpendicular to a plimblhine. -- therefore the oceans, which are mostly water, are also more so than not - level. the oceans, cover most of the earth - -which leads to the strong likelihood - the earth is at least mostly level. a mostly level surface can not create a sphere. if we are not a sphere there must be some other explanation for why the sun appears to rise and set. </p>

<p>I have done visual experiments to demonstrate what we see when we see the sun set can and is done - through the light source receding at a fixed altitude above a level surface -- seeming to set but not lowering. --- here is a good illustration </p>

    <div class="md"><p>awesome questions -- </p>

<p>the flat earth model still a work in progress. but -- the answers to your questions, </p>

<p>to start with -- satellites are not up there. real satellites are a ground based system only. there are drones - which is where most aerial photography comes from -- and there are high flying planes etc, just not outer space satellites, etc. </p>

<p>Antartica is the outer boundary -- it is a ring of ice surrounding the circular flat earth. if anybody has gotten past it -- there is no easy access to their record of it. as far as we know it is a barrier than can not be crossed. all the known land and oceans are on the same side of flat earth, within antartica . </p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Flat_earth.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Flat_earth.png</a></p>

<p>what is underneath, on the other side is a mystery!!!</p>

<p>the sun is much lower and smaller than thought - it circles above, giving us the exact day and night experience that we have, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you&#39;re answering questions on flat earth, I have a few I am curious about:</p>

<p>So if antarctica is the edge, why is there a race around it that takes much less time than the flat earth model?</p>

<p>If satellites are fake, what are satellite dishes pointing at when they are aimed straight up near the equator? </p>

<p>Why do GPS receivers work in the middle of the ocean, hundreds or thousands of miles away from any land-based antenna?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>to tell you the truth -- I do not know how GPS works, but I know it worked in the ocean before they allegedly put satellites up in space, gps originated in the navy. and still operates with same basic function it used when it was first invented. if it originally worked without satellites -- </p>

<p>what race are you referring to around antartica? I think there are a great deal of accounts that it takes much longer to circumnavigate antartica than expected. however -- if the race is arranged by the british monarchy -- there is a great deal of evidence than this whole lie was born with the british monarchy -- perhaps to have a leg up on the rest of the world for trade routes -- perhaps for many more reasons. so i would not put it past them to stage a false &quot;proof&quot;. but -- I&#39;m not sure the race you are talking about. </p>

<p>I do not know why people point their satellite dishes up -- because they think they should? but more so -- why would they point them up only at equator - if we are on a globe -- why doesn&#39;t everybody point their satellite dishes straight up? the equator is not supposed to be more of a globe than the rest of the earth. </p>

<p>[Citation needed]. There were other methods of navigating prior to GPS, but I&#39;ve never had anyone else claim that GPS existed prior to satellites. And once again you&#39;re trying to discredit something you don&#39;t even understand in the first place. Just because you don&#39;t understand it doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t behave the way it&#39;s designed. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.acronautic.com/antartica-cup-ocean-race/">http://www.acronautic.com/antartica-cup-ocean-race/</a> - No monarchy required, so you can toss that theory right out the window. It&#39;s a 14,000 mile race around antarctica. How does that compare to what the flat earth requires for the size of that continent?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not know why people point their satellite dishes up -- because they think they should?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or maybe because that&#39;s what&#39;s required to receive a signal that is beaming down to them from nearly straight above. Do you even understand how the globe model works?</p>

<p>Who is &quot;they&quot;? Unless you own a satellite phone, it&#39;s assumed that a cell phone will only work in range of a ground-based antenna. I&#39;ve never heard anyone claim that cell phones require satellites for reception.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>gps is not fake, but the necessity for satellites to assist gps is a deception. -- one example to demonstrate this is -- you can travel to a place where cell reception is crap. but gps still works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based upon what I said, the fact that GPS works where cell phones don&#39;t actually lends more weight to the fact that GPS uses satellites and cell phones do not. If GPS didn&#39;t require satellites, then how would it work in the middle of the ocean? INS is <em>not</em> accurate enough on its own to provide accuracy over long periods of time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;d think that a flat earth with encased sky dome does make global warming make a lot more sense, so -- yeah -- </p>

<p>the spinning ball model - where there is no barrier between atmosphere and outer space actually makes no sense why heat can&#39;t escape. if heat can travel hear from the sun outside of our atmosphere it should be able to go back the same way it came. haha, it&#39;s really the globers who have a model that refutes global warming  - good point. </p>

<p>in the flat earth model there is a lot more ice than in globe model - so that could help stave off effects for a bit - but really global warming is a question that is neither refuted or directly supported by the flat earth theory, the idea that flat earthers are global warming deniers - is a myth, it&#39;s just not true, we take little issue with it -it&#39;s not something we are debating. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t imagine anybody has seen the edge. I don&#39;t even know that I expect there is an edge --  maybe there is an edge but also - maybe there is more earth , more ice - more something/ more land/ more many things,  I only feel I know for sure - Antartica is not a &quot;cap&quot; on a ball. all known land and ocean simply does not curve enough for that to be the case. </p>

<p>I think there are a lot of real aerial photographs, I think those are taken by planes or drones. as for the images that include the earth as a whole, or antartica as a whole  -- there are none that are photographs. Nasa themselves admits any such images are  illustrated composites created by graphic artists  from computer data -- they are not photographs. they are not even a collage of photographs, they are illustrations created to mimic what the data the illustrator is given - indicates should be there. but that data they work from is not an image unto itself, and is not available to the public - so how would I know if it&#39;s verifiable - esp given the very fact that they do not release the raw data -- I expect, strongly, that it is fabricated bs. </p>

<p>as for photos from ISS or the moon - you are correct - I deeply suspect fakery,  as there as so many aspects of those &quot;missions&quot; that betray theatrics and deception. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the sun&#39;s path suggest the earth does &quot;end&quot; at around where antartica creates an outer crust -- but how far out that ending is ?? probable there is a lot of leeway, maybe the earth is twice as big as we think - I don&#39;t know. but the sun circles above low and small. generally like a spot light above the equator -- expanding and shrinking its path as seasons change.there are many videos explaining the sun&#39;s path on flat earth model - a goole search away. and how perspective of a receding light source gives exactly what we see when we thing sun is going down. imagine street lamps on a highway -  they look lower further away -- but they are really al same height just closer or further away, same principal for how we perceive sun set, </p>

<p>I think stable earth orbiting is bs. </p>

<p>I think radio PROVES flat earth. I think radio works because the earth is flat. we had radio that reached all across the world - before we (even allegedly) had satellites - . in my opinion this very fact on its own proves flat earth. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t know much about the magtetosphere but I do believe it is real. what I can say is -- consider a round flat disc magnet with a hole in the center, -- these magnets have magnetic fields that go from their center out to outer ring -- I think it&#39;s a very similar situation with our flat earth. I&#39;ve never seen a sphere magnet do this, in fact i&#39;ve never seen anybody make a sphere that has any magnetic function.  - but i&#39;&#39;ve seen flat disc magnets work like this all the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For reference, the reason that street lamps on a highway look lower when they&#39;re further away is because of the curvature of the earth. It is indeed exactly what we see when the sun sets, because the curvature of the earth is responsible for both of those perceptions.</p>

<p>Radio can work to a certain distance despite the curvature of the earth because radio waves of certain frequencies reflect off of the ionosphere, actually; I didn&#39;t word that well. That only gets them so far, though. Different frequencies of radio energy are used to interact with satellites. Source: I&#39;m an electrical engineer with a specialization in telecommunications.</p>

<p>You do have the general principle of the earth&#39;s magnetic field right, except that measurement of the magnetic field indicates a spherical shape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>cool - you are an electrical engineer with specializing in telecommunications! ( sincere not sarcastic btw) that&#39;s a lot of knowledge  - I&#39;m sure can be useful here. </p>

<p>but I disagree with all of your statements here pretty much otherwise, the first most of all. you do not see lamps going down on a highway because of the curvature of the earth. nobody thinks that we do either -- I mean no science book will tell you we do - etc, (&quot;nobody&quot; isn;t a fair term - obvs you think we do -- so somebody does) but it&#39;s not the accepted explanation. the curvature is supposed to be way too big to be able to perceive it at that scale - looking down a highway. I&#39;m a visual artist - lots of years of schooling in the arts. 101 is perspective. all lines appear to converge to the eye when looking at a distance, this occurs at any scale -- weather you are looking into a straw -- or down a hallway - or across the ocean ,it is how your eye processes visiual information. a camera does the same thing. the camera lens is modeled after the human eye. if you are up in an airplane and you stand at one end -- the little &quot;service&quot; lights will seem to go down the same way street lamps do, -- even if the plane is aiming up -- it&#39;s about you looking straight on -- the visual information you see all converges the further away it is. curvature plays no role. </p>

<p>this hallway is miniature -- (for sure no curvature, it&#39;s a built model) and yet the lights of equal height still appear lower the further they are from your eye, just like street lamps do:</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4mTtduYEcd0/S-dD3Ym61FI/AAAAAAAAAng/NOo5PQMrm_M/s1600/photo10.jpg">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4mTtduYEcd0/S-dD3Ym61FI/AAAAAAAAAng/NOo5PQMrm_M/s1600/photo10.jpg</a></p>

<p>here is another  visual example:</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6MA1hddNATs/UsA4z8-tn4I/AAAAAAAAA94/sl3IbRHdRHg/s1600/field1.jpg">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6MA1hddNATs/UsA4z8-tn4I/AAAAAAAAA94/sl3IbRHdRHg/s1600/field1.jpg</a></p>

<p>all lines converge upwards in your view too. you can&#39;t say that&#39;s due to curvature - or we&#39;d have to live INSIDE a ball for that to make sense. the truth is street lamps appear to go down at a distance - and rows or crops appear to go up at a distance for the exact same reason - all lines converge at a center point on eye level/horizon - inside our eye -- it is how our eye captures visual information. and it is how we see the sun too. </p>

<p>I&#39;m interested to know why the you say the measurement of the magnetic field on earth indicates a sphere. -- i don&#39;t see  that at all - -but  magnetic force is not my field ( I made a pun!:)  -- I&#39;m interested to know why you see it. </p>
