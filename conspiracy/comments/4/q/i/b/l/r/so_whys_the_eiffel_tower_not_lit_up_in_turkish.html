    <div class="md"><p>Anyone else notice how Turkey is apologizing for shooting down that Russian jet and right around the same time their airport gets hit?</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to think that there is no such thing as terrorism... not as we know it anyways. Sure you had your groups like the PLO and the PKK. But those are really just independence movements.</p>

<p>Maybe these modern, international &quot;terrorist&quot; movements are just quasi-mercenary groups made up of people who don&#39;t really know who they&#39;re really working for. Their real purpose is to create terror. But the real reason is to act as shake down artists on behalf of their real sponsors. ISIS is a shake down of half the Middle East. </p>

<p>tldr; Right now Turkey is pissing someone off, so they get hit by &quot;terrorism&quot;.</p>

<p>There has not been for some time. ISIS and Al Queda are 100% fake in my opinion. It is an undeniable fact - we trained, armed, and supports both &#39;terrorist&#39; organizations before they became a problem. Just like in 1984, the no faced enemies will never end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What part is factually incorrect.  You see him walking with his bag and put it down then you see him walking away and moments later there is an explosion right where he left without his bag.  And why couldn&#39;t those bombs produce the carnage that was described?  Other people have made pressure cooker bombs to show what they are capable of and depending on the amount of shit you put in them to be thrown around they absolutely would be shredding people&#39;s legs and killing people based on your proximity to the blast point.  But of course that can&#39;t be true.  It&#39;s much more likely that there were thousands of people in on it and performing a giant hoax during a marathon watched by millions.  All of the EMTs and injured people and doctors and nurses at the hospitals helping injured people and their families all have been sworn to secrecy to never admit that this was all a hoax.  That makes much more sense.  If the government wanted to hoax this event wouldn&#39;t they just explode a couple of real bombs?  Why would they risk so many loose ends?  Why hasn&#39;t a single person who was &quot;in on it&quot; come forward to expose this hoax?  Not even one single person has anonymously posted online saying they were in on it and know it&#39;s fake.  How is that?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also do you remember the Saudi kid who was one of the first FBI persons of interest?  He was injured and hospitalized because he was close to one of the explosions?  The FBI wanted to treat him as a potential suspect but he was the son of a high up Saudi dignitary so he was almost immediately cleared and as soon as he was OK enough to travel he was immediately allowed to be flown back to Saudi Arabia?  Glenn Beck went on for months about this kid and eventually was sued by his family for defamation... Why the fuck would the government allow this story line to occur if this was a hoax?  This was a Saudi kid who was being tied to helping the attack because he was close enough to a bomb to have been injured.  What good does that serve the greater story if this was all actors and fake?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there was a lot of civilian help and since 9-11 there has always been a ton of police and emergency response presence at big events like this.  All of those &quot;drills&quot; actually do happen.  They aren&#39;t all just covers for hoaxes.  There are constant drills for terror attacks.  We are much better prepared for this sort of shit today than we were 15 years ago.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ok if all you read and saw was the mainstream media but just take a look at all the other evidence. Look up Blackwater and have a look at some more footage. Look at the colour of the bag and then see the bag which is left. Too many idiosyncrasies.
As for anyone coming forward..if they did you wouldn&#39;t believe them, there&#39;s no such thing as anonymous on the Internet and people die in road accidents all the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw everything and none of it convinced me that this was all actors.  If government wanted to hoax an event they would just explode real bombs.  The idea that they would count on thousands of people to keep a secret for the rest of their lives is crazy.  The hospital workers that were treating and rehabbing injured survivors for months are still at the damn hospital working today.  None of them are anonymously making posts about it being fake.  How is that possible?  They got REAL doctors and nurses to play along for the rest of their lives?  </p>

<p>In a way I don&#39;t feel bad. The Turks are arming Terrorist to create refugees to extort EU membership. The government essentially  told the Turk women to have as many children as possible, to basically to out breed the Europeans.</p>

<p>Same thing happened in South Africa. Black leaders told the women it was their duty to have as many children as possible.</p>
