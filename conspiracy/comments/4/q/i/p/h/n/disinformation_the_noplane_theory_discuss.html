<p>One of the first documentaries to promote the “No Plane Theory” is called “September Clues” and it was created by Simon Shack. Simon is not alone on his crazy beliefs. Other so called 9/11 “Truthers” that promote the No Plane Theory (NPT) are James Fetzer, Morgan Reynolds, Killtown, Ace Baker and many of their “useful idiots” on social media. The “No Plane Theory” is an old disinformation theory that has been used by “agents” in order to discredit the 9/11 Truth Movement. </p>

<p><strong>Anyone that believes in such nonsense is not for the 9/11 Truth Movement.</strong></p>

<p>Most people <em>who wish to push Theories Of Lunacy</em> ask questions rather than provide evidence of their claims. It keeps TOL on the offensive. You&#39;re following the TOL playbook nicely, in my estimation.</p>

<p>Edit: provide your evidence or don&#39;t play. simple really, if you put your mind to it! <strong>E2: His evidence is forum sliding!!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you have to watch the coverage of the event, live, on all networks - and determine for yourself if what you <em>see</em> backs up what you are <em>told you see</em>. I watched 24 hours if every network that day. Can you say the same? Or just watched a half produced YouTube video and picked up your broad brush to paint users as disinformation? My bet is the latter but I&#39;ll indulge anyway.</p>

<p>So my suggestion is to start there. And you can stop being a passive aggressive douchebag and learn a thing or two.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/abc200109110831-0912">Here is ABC</a></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/nbc200109110831-0912">Here is NBC</a></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/cbs200109110831-0912">Here is CBS</a></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/cnn200109110848-0929">Here is CNN</a></p>

<p>The time you want to skip to is around 9:01 and just let it roll. Watch it on mute once, even, before you watch it with sound.</p>

<p>Take note of the characters on screen and <em>covering</em> the event. Make note of who the on-site reporters are - and their relationships with the networks themselves.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t have the time to do that tonight? The STFU about something that probably happened when you were still in diapers. </p>

<p><em>I remember</em>.</p>

When the Dove population was significantly diminished, the hawks battled and killed each other, subsequently they began to die off. I believe we are there with sociopaths....and psychopaths.

    <div class="md"><p>Beware, James is not honest. I ran into him yesterday and he won&#39;t come clean. He seems to have bought into a pointless disinformation campaign meant to steer people away from talk of the controlled demolitions that blew up the World Trade Centers 1, 2 &amp; 7. Proof:</p>

<p>His motives are questionable at best, but I can&#39;t have an honest debate with him so I&#39;m calling it like I see it. Cheers fellow truth seeker, here&#39;s a good place to get started: <a href="http://911speakout.org/">http://911speakout.org/</a></p>

<p>The website gives a comprehensive explanation of the controlled demos that went on that day. I hope you have a good time discerning the important things (what brought the building down in record time: hint-controlled demos exploded those buildings) from the non-important ones: hint-holograms/cgi/no-planes/drones are all meant from keeping you, the citizen, from asking WHAT THE FUCK BROUGHT DOWN THAT BUILDING BELOW THE FLOORS OF IMPACT IN ALMOST FREE-FALL SPEEDS!!!  Cheers brother/sister</p>

<p>Since he works at JTRIG ... that must be where you ran into him?  I notice he has a lot of alt-accounts that he argues with (and a lot that he pats himself on the back with, as well).</p>

<p>This whole thread is a pet topic of his, so the verisimilitude of all these alt-accounts arguing, &amp; re-emergence of his pet topic are a win/win for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sleep on it before you jump into this.</p>

<p>But fast forward to important <em>minutes</em> of the <em>story</em> of that day. Like the impact of the first &#39;plane.&#39; And the second impact.</p>

<p>And the crash in PA. And the impact at the Pentagon. The official record all has these happening at specific times.</p>

<p>Yet sometimes the networks broadcast different <em>versions</em> of the event. Sometimes they have the same cameras. Sometimes they don&#39;t. Sometimes completely different plane images are shown to the viewer of something that should be identical.</p>

<p>These are the glitches that you need to find and <em>understand</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you believe a 757 boeing made small tiny hole in that wing of the Pentagon where the documents for those trillions of dollars Rumsfeld and his criminal buddies stole were housed, than you are no truther. So I really don&#39;t give a fuck what you and your limited hangout &#39;loose change&#39;  truthers think.</p>

<p>Ever  ask yourself when the last time  a real truther was spotlighted on CNN for 911? The answer is when the very people who did 911 allow them. &#39;Loose Change&#39; was revelation of the method psyop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With only few original footages, and most coming from mainstream media, how do we know what is real from a movie shot painting us a picture of planes when in the same instance we observe explosions and demolition?  Building 7 is proof the buildings were pre-rigged for demo
 They knew if they didn&#39;t have the planes and terrorists story, and movie,  their demolition would be more easily exposed. Is it too far fetched?  no plane in Pentagon, and Shanksville..is it too far fetched that they showed us a pre- recorded movie footage overlay of planes hitting WTC? The plane 175 slipping into the South Tower like fucking CGI graphics is proof. Wings of airplane could not slip perfectly into that steel frame without impact, and resistance.</p>

<p>What is sad is you people who call themselves &#39;truthers&#39; yet You want to exclude anyone who dares to think of other ways how they pulled this off. You don&#39;t have  fucking monopoly on the truth! The planes were the cover story. Without them, the demolition is self evident. But you people will spend your free time Ridiculing  those us who point out the very obvious sinister bullshit of planes being used as mirage to cover demolition of buildings. And because of this stupid insistence on planes, the &#39;elephant in the room&#39; demolition evidence is ignored. If we throw the fake planes out, then can we make a dent in exposing what is clearly buildings being brought down by demolition explosives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No planes includes the notion that there were no commercial airplanes hijacked and flown into the towers or the pentagon.   Since there is no proof of these planes, no black boxes, no recognizable parts, and even the wrong plane part - it MUST be something else.  </p>
