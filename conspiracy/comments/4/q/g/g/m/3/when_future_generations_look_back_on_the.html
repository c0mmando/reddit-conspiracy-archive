<p>Although it has been emerging for seven years or more, one of the most extraordinary scandals of our time has never hit the headlines. Yet another little example of it lately caught my eye when, in the wake of those excited claims that 2014 was “the hottest year on record”, I saw the headline on a climate blog: “Massive tampering with temperatures in South America”. The evidence on Notalotofpeopleknowthat, uncovered by Paul Homewood, was indeed striking.</p>

<p>Puzzled by those “2014 hottest ever” claims, which were led by the most quoted of all the five official global temperature records – Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (Giss) – Homewood examined a place in the world where Giss was showing temperatures to have risen faster than almost anywhere else: a large chunk of South America stretching from Brazil to Paraguay.</p>

<p>Noting that weather stations there were thin on the ground, he decided to focus on three rural stations covering a huge area of Paraguay. Giss showed it as having recorded, between 1950 and 2014, a particularly steep temperature rise of more than 1.5C: twice the accepted global increase for the whole of the 20th century.</p>

<p>But when Homewood was then able to check Giss’s figures against the original data from which they were derived, he found that they had been altered. Far from the new graph showing any rise, it showed temperatures in fact having declined over those 65 years by a full degree. When he did the same for the other two stations, he found the same. In each case, the original data showed not a rise but a decline.</p>

<p>Homewood had in fact uncovered yet another example of the thousands of pieces of evidence coming to light in recent years that show that something very odd has been going on with the temperature data relied on by the world&#39;s scientists. And in particular by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which has driven the greatest and most costly scare in history: the belief that the world is in the grip of an unprecedented warming.</p>

<p>President Barack Obama will use the report as evidence for action as he tries to move ahead with policies on climate change before leaving office in 2017</p>

<p>How have we come to be told that global temperatures have suddenly taken a great leap upwards to their highest level in 1,000 years? In fact, it has been no greater than their upward leaps between 1860 and 1880, and 1910 and 1940, as part of that gradual natural warming since the world emerged from its centuries-long “Little Ice Age” around 200 years ago.</p>

<p>This belief has rested entirely on five official data records. Three of these are based on measurements taken on the Earth’s surface, versions of which are then compiled by Giss, by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and by the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit working with the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction, part of the UK Met Office.</p>

<p>The other two records are derived from measurements made by satellites, and then compiled by Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) in California and the University of Alabama, Huntsville (UAH).</p>

<p>In recent years, these two very different ways of measuring global temperature have increasingly been showing quite different results. The surface-based record has shown a temperature trend rising up to 2014 as “the hottest years since records began”. RSS and UAH have, meanwhile, for 18 years been recording no rise in the trend, with 2014 ranking as low as only the sixth warmest since 1997.</p>

<p>One surprise is that the three surface records, all run by passionate believers in man-made warming, in fact derive most of their land surface data from a single source. This is the Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN), managed by the US National Climate Data Center under NOAA, which in turn comes under the US Department of Commerce.</p>

<p>But two aspects of this system for measuring surface temperatures have long been worrying a growing array of statisticians, meteorologists and expert science bloggers. One is that the supposedly worldwide network of stations from which GHCN draws its data is flawed. Up to 80 per cent or more of the Earth’s surface is not reliably covered at all. Furthermore, around 1990, the number of stations more than halved, from 12,000 to less than 6,000 – and most of those remaining are concentrated in urban areas or places where studies have shown that, thanks to the “urban heat island effect”, readings can be up to 2 degrees higher than in those rural areas where thousands of stations were lost.</p>

<p>To fill in the huge gaps, those compiling the records have resorted to computerised “infilling”, whereby the higher temperatures recorded by the remaining stations are projected out to vast surrounding areas (Giss allows single stations to give a reading covering 1.6 million square miles). This alone contributed to the sharp temperature rise shown in the years after 1990.</p>

<p>But still more worrying has been the evidence that even this data has then been subjected to continual “adjustments”, invariably in only one direction. Earlier temperatures are adjusted downwards, more recent temperatures upwards, thus giving the impression that they have risen much more sharply than was shown by the original data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What will shock them more is how the human population stayed below 1 billion for 200,000 years,  and then in 200 years went from less than 1 billion to over 8 billion.</p>

<p>Further,  the degree of chemical,  radiolological,  visual,  sound,  light, and EMF pollution that humans had introduced into their environment will add to the amazement of the period.     All of this in proportion to technological advancements in the per capita consumption of energy which will have increased exponentially during those 200 years.</p>

<p>Furthermore,   when it comes to duplicity,  the intentional deception in the release of information,  the fudging of temperatures will not be regarded as exceptional compared to the fudging of other data,  and not just the fudging,   but the selective preference for some information over other.</p>

<p>Look at how people will overlook the genocidal war crimes of their favorite &quot;democratic&quot; rulers and yet rationalize hatred of Muslims etc. for defending themselves against occupations and invasions.   The wars since 9/11 have more bearing than the silly pissing contest over global warming.    </p>

<p>The next time there is a major water/food crisis that leads to thousands of deaths,   or a major epidemic related to lower health in a region tied to deteriorating environmental conditions,  it won&#39;t matter what caused the temperature and rainfall changes.   What will matter will be what we could have done to be better custodians of our environment.    Planting trees instead of building bombs.    Reducing erosion instead of fracking for oil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your bigoted view of Muslims and ignorant view of the history of religion is what is being discussed.</p>

<p>Demonizing Islam is based on three fallacies:</p>

<p>1)  The text of the Koran.    The old Testament is actually even worse,   so,  thats an invalid argument based on ignorance of comparative religious/mythological literature.</p>

<p>2)  The practice of a religion in modern times.    Whether Christianity,  Buddhism,  or Islam,  etc.  religious practitioners include millions of followers who live under secular governments with constitutional forms of government.    There are great arguements for atheism,   but even atheist societies under Stalin,  Mao,  and others have committed attrocities.    No humans are exempt from attrocities,    and if it is attrocities you want to point out,  lets include Hiroshima,   Nagasaki,   Vietnam,  and the Iraq,   Libya,  Syria,  and Afghanistan illegal wars of genocidal weapons of mass destruction.    Sure,   list out all the beheadings etc of Muslims,  Buddhists and others too,   why not.     But you are not going to come up with a compelling argument to single out the Muslims unless you are a bigot.</p>

<p>3) Acts attributed to ISIS and Al Qaeda.    The CIA was involved in creating both,   the US has supported both.    This needs to stop.   When it stops,  there probably will need to be international tribunals for western leaders whose acts contributed to the creation of these organizations.    In the meantime,   these organizations are not representative of Islam,  and most of their targets have been Muslims,  for missions that the US made possible,  and that serve a US strategy.</p>

<p>So,  if you want someone to be mad at for all the wasted American life and taxpayer treasure,   look in your own house/country.</p>

<p>If you want a religion to hate,  look at the religion of the people who came up with the strategies that ISIS and Al Qaeda implement.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m going to look at the Quran, which says to slaughter everyone who is not a Muslim.

<p>The US and our ally,  Saudi Arabia,  helped to create a new virulent strain of Islam that is indeed now a problem.    This was strategic.</p>

<p>New virulent strains of radicalism also include the US Neocon agenda,  or the new Israeli agenda.    Radicalism.    Sounds like you got bit by it as well.</p>

<p>Yes,   I looked into the Egyptian connection,  but there is also a separate Saudi connection,   and also a Turkish connection.    Besides,  the Egyptian brotherhood,  founded in 1928 by Hasan al-Banna, the Egyptian brotherhood earned legitimacy among its core constituency, the lower-middle class, as the most effective organized resistance against British domination (1882–1952).    In other words,  it was a form of nationalism that used religious institutions to its advantage.    The more modern virulent Koranic interpretations were surprisingly absent.</p>

<p>Its never all that simple.    I think you have to study the religious right,  the neocon movement,  and other fundamentalist radical belief systems on both sides of the divide,  and I think you also have to follow the money.   But it sure is interesting to realize that the Sam Harris definition of Islam is the anomaly,  not the norm.   Again,  war propaganda with useful tools.    The Muslim populations were increasingly secular in governmental form prior to the neocon agenda:   how surprising!    The average American is being trained to hate a force their own government created, <strong>and that would not exist without ongoing US and Israeli support</strong>.   How sad.</p>

<p>Some efforts at bolstering radical schools and groups have also been specifically targeted at China and at Russia.    Some of the radical connections are also calculated into the opium and other drug trades which corrupt elements in the US and US government benefit by.    </p>

You are right, I did truly simplify the issue and that could be seen as an error; I just intended to support the narrative of &#39;guess who started this&#39;. I truly wish that when the MSM discuss these topics they covered the truth and educated the people instead of whip them into a farror. It is nice to see an educated response from an individual on reddit instead of the typical attack tactic to create straw man arguments; hence I&#39;ve spent the time in replying. Keep spreading the truth, we need more of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mythological literature systems exist side by side with human institutions.    This is the case of the dogmatic American imperial mythology as well,   where once it was believed that the Germanic population was inherently prone for a Teutonic conquest of the world and had to be wiped out,   or at one time was supportive of slavery,  or at one time did not let women vote,  considered them property,   or at one time was anti Semitic.     Or look at the old and new testaments of the Bible,   how they have been interpreted and emphasized over time in different places.</p>

<p>Formal U.S. relations with Morocco,  an Islamic culture,  began in 1787 when the United States Senate ratified a Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the two nations which had been negotiated in 1786 to be the first foreign power to officially befriend the US.</p>

<p>New virulent strains of Christianity have been created even within the last few years.    Look at the Westboro Baptist church.</p>
