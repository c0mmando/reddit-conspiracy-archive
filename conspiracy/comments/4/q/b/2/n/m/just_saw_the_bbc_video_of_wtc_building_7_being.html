    <div class="md"><p>The media doesn&#39;t have to worry about not reporting certain topics because they are a business and their business is to talk about the things they&#39;re paid to talk about.  </p>

<p>There is no longer anything called journalism or integrity anymore.  Those people were pushed out.  All that remain are yes men and sick minds.</p>

<p>Its no longer about speaking truth to power, it is about who pays the bills and not biting the hand that feeds you.  We have been collectively bought and paid for.  Not many are willing to stand, most are bending over and or decided to not participate.</p>

<p>Thus, it is far easier to demonize topics like this and let them fall down the memory hole.  If no &quot;main stream&quot; media picks up on it, then the logical thing to believe is that the topic actually is conspiracy and not worthy of thought.  See the solid logic on that?  Can&#39;t be beat......yet.</p>

<p>sidenote <strong>why are none of these people listed on Wikipedia</strong>, but just BS conspiracy sites?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t say with absolute certainty, but this might help to give us a clue:</p>

<p><strong>Video from Arutz Sheva (Israel National News)</strong>:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t52LB2fYhoY">Course: Zionist Editing on Wikipedia</a></strong> (two minute news segment).</p>

<p>So, what is the implication here? Could Wikipedia possibly be collaborating with Zionist interests to shape the content of &quot;sensitive&quot; Wiki pages to their favor???</p>

<p>Again, I can&#39;t say with absolute certainty, <strong><em>however</em></strong>, Mr. <strong>Jimmy Wales</strong>, founder of Wikipedia and member of the Board of Trustees of <strong>Wikimedia Foundation</strong> was a recipient of the <strong><a href="http://www.dandavidprize.org/laureates/2015/190-present-the-information-revolution/755-mr-jimmy-wales">Dan David Prize</a></strong> (One Million Dollars) in 2015.</p>

<p>What is the <strong>Dan David Prize</strong>?</p>

<p>Well, according to WIKIPEDIA</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_David_Prize">The Dan David Prize</a></strong> grants annually three prizes of US $1 million each for outstanding achievement. Fields are chosen for Past, Present and Future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>History</strong>: The Dan David Foundation was founded in 2000 with a $100 million endowment by Romanian-born <strong>Israeli</strong> businessman and philanthropist Dan David.[2] The Founding Director was Professor Gad Barzilai. <strong>The foundation and Tel Aviv University award the prizes</strong>. The first awards ceremony took place at <strong>Tel Aviv University</strong> on May 2002.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what does a paltry MILLION DOLLARS mean to someone like Jimmy Wales? I mean, he must be SUPER-RICH, right?</p>

<p>Not according to this <strong>New York Times article</strong> (2013)</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/magazine/jimmy-wales-is-not-an-internet-billionaire.html">Jimmy Wales Is Not an Internet Billionaire</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wales suffers from the same paradox. Being the most famous traveling spokesman for Internet freedom brings in a decent living, but it’s not Silicon Valley money. It’s barely London money. <strong>Wales’s total net worth, by most estimates, is just above $1 million</strong>, including stock from his for-profit company Wikia, a wiki-hosting service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the Zionist Dan David Prize damn near DOUBLED Jimmy&#39;s net worth? <strong>How nice!</strong></p>

<p>So, it would <em>appear</em> that the Zionist State is quite appreciative of both Wikipedia and founder Jimmy Wales, wouldn&#39;t it? </p>

<p>Mystery solved?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because wikipedia is controlled. The most famous attribute of Wikipedia is supposedly anyone can edit it. I suggest you try this yourself! Go edit the wiki of a highly controversial subject, see how long your edit lasts. No, there is a highly editorial process and power-seeking officials who delete anything that goes against their official narrative. Even if this edit is part of a provable reality, if it does not conform to their narrative it will be deleted. Go try it yourself. </p>

<p>posit: Incredulity can be used as a weapon.</p>

<p>posit: Some truths are difficult to face, because accepting them makes previous actions taken unjustifiable in the human mind.</p>

<p>posit: Most people parrot other people&#39;s conclusions.</p>

<p>context: 9/11 event</p>

<p>conclusion: If the official story is not correct, a whole bunch of other considerations must immediately follow, and these conclusions must either be rationalized or emotionalized. </p>

<p>Subject is likely to choose either anger at the people who aren&#39;t accepting the official conclusions (and will likely seek constant validation for these official conclusions) or will internalize this as cognitive dissonance, which will likely result in negative behavior like depression or addiction.</p>

<p>The subject could also choose to not accept the official version. This is also fine, because of the degree that the media narrative can be manufactured; accept social marginalization or the official conclusion. </p>

<p>The audience <strong>must constantly be reminded</strong> that not accepting the official version is CRAZY.</p>
