       Brexit, if anything, was an awesome laboratory that showed how the markets are 100% rigged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banks, the media, the rich and powerful cities, every powerful entity in the UK bet on Remain. But Brexit won.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then began the negativity. We need a revote. People have regretted their vote. The Pound will collapse to 0.01. It's the end of the world!
      </p>
      <p>
       The markets then recovered strongly and all the media propaganda and demands for a new referendum simply disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened? Did the 10 actors hired by someone to say they regretted their Leave vote no longer "regret" their vote because stocks went up?
      </p>
      <p>
       LOL
      </p>
      <p>
       The results of the Brexit laboratory are a once in a lifetime opportunity to see how the markets are rigged. What you saw since last thursday is the propaganda machine and corrupt banking system manipulating popular opinion with an intensity they usually don't need to use. They had to expose themselves due to the Brexit vote surprise. They thought they had everything rigged up to the vote, when they were putting out polls showing Remain with 10 point lead.
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN, The Guardian, The Independent, Financial Times, Bloomberg are all suddenly quiet and ok with Brexit after the stock market went back up! Remember this when you read news, when you buy a candy, when you fill your gas tank : the system is rigged. Media and banks live in a different world than you, they simply manipulate reality. All the negativity is gone from
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       everything is back to normal, nothing to see here, move along, citizen.

       The system is rigged, but the markets aren't back up yet. They've been in a solid downtrend for a year. That downtrend will accelerate in the months ahead. A tiny dead cat bounce like the one we've seen the last few days, ain't gonna change that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM and its elite controlled pundits are trying to gloss over that fact right now, but they are under strict globalist orders to unleash a lot of pessimism and negativity in a month or so. And that is when we'll see the start of the big economic crash. (And a few other global disasters.)

       I agree with your comment fully. I also think the crash is coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       But my main point is the "laboratory" part. How the mass media and banks went desperate in the wake of Brexit vote and how when the markets recovered just a tad, a dead cat bounce as you say, the negativity decreased with it! The point is to see how the mass media, banks and the powerful work together to keep things the way they want to. We had a unique opportunity here to see the guts of the machine, how they went desperate and they fired all their ammunition in Reddit, the media, the fear and propaganda was absolutely relentless! We saw the machine working at full throttle which is very rare. Normally they're able to keep the people compliant and obeying with much much less.

       Or... Markets weren't expecting a Brexit and the surprise caused a big sell off which resulted in a market downturn (the effects were exaggerated, a few percentage points isn't that big of a deal).  But then after the initial shock wore off investors realized that the ramifications won't take effect for years and probably won't be all that disruptive in the long run.

       Sure, that might be it. I'm not a market expert.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm talking about is the media and bank reaction to that big sell off.

       And the subsequent calm and lack of propaganda once the markets recovered.

       Well as to the markets you couldn't exactly say they have "recovered".  In the short term markets are mostly random, they might still tank over the next few weeks or they might rally and break all time highs.  Nobody knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media just capitalized on the initial shock and uncertainty that people felt when the UK surprised us with the Brexit vote.  The globalists theoretically don't want a Brexit but if they are as powerful as we think they are, they might be behind the Brexit anyways with ulterior motives.  And if they are not that powerful, then perhaps everything is not so rigged after all.

       I think you've contradicted yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they have ulterior motives and capitalized on the mania and fear, that's exactly how the markets are rigged. Basically they conducted the markets, and when a unexpected event happened, they blasted out full propaganda to revert it, when they did, they go quiet again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media and banks controlled the market precisely. We saw it live since thursday's vote. We saw it on
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is zero news for the market recovery. Just propaganda. The media blasted FUD until they got what they wanted. Now the big banks are probably selling off quietly, so that they'll let the markets crash next but now they're prepared.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's rigged. The individuals pay the cost for what happened. The market is not free to flow at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only problem with the Brexit vote was that the controllers were not prepared. Now they are, so let it crash. That's he point. Like in 2008 the people will pay the cost, not them.

       It hasn't "recovered".  The S&amp;P was at 2110 Thursday then hit a low of 1992 on Monday.  Now it's back to ~2060.  Meaning it dipped about 5% and gained back half of that over the course of a few days.  Seems perfectly reasonable absent media intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       If banks control the markets then why were London banks hit the hardest from the Brexit news.  Giants such as Barclays are down 40%.  The markets will surely recover but these banks might have a harder time.
      </p>
      <p>
       People pay what cost?  The markets aren't down like in 2008.

       Were the elite surprised by Brexit or was it part of the plan?  OP argued it surprised them which wouldn't make sense with the whole 7 years months days thing because why would they plan a market reaction to a vote that they expected to be remain?

       This time it dropped 611 points which could be 911 mirrored (a warning). This is just the start.

       If there are various factions how could they possibly be coordinated enough to create a specific 611 point crash exactly 7 years months days after the last one?  If the elite are split into groups there is no way they could coordinate such an absurdly difficult task.  Look up how stock markets work and how prices are set and you will see how absurd this is.

       The problem is with scale.  How many trading companies are there?  Every single one can affect the price of a stock so they all need to be in on it.  Which means all the people who write the algorithms and all the people who have any influence over whether to buy or sell need to be in on it.  It's too many people to organize something so precise.  Plus the vote would have to be rigged, the people who set the date of the vote would have to be in on it, it's just goes too far.

       You don't know whether or not ownership is consolidated at the top. You don't know whether rogue AI doesn't have control of the markets and is using 7 to keep us all scared. You don't know. You just want to deny evidence because you want to believe it's the more happy ending.

       Even if a rogue AI did somehow have control of the markets, why would it be using the number 7 to keep us scared.  And who exactly is "us" in that scenario?  The .00001% of people who would even notice the number 7 showing up?

       My puts hope you're right but at the same time, look at what they did in February. This market is not and will never be rational again. Once Bernanke's helicopter money and HFT took precedence, the game changed completely.

       Bruh, I am in the UK and have been following the situation pretty closely and can assure you nothing looked like it was rigged. Yes, of course, The Guardian turned into the The Daily Doom Prophet, but you have to understand that loads of people in the EU are quite fond of the union and are afraid of a potential collapse, so no need for actors (this is not sandy hook lol).

       The "panic" that was supposed to happen was fear-mongering by the upper echelon. Independent countries are going to be the new normal and it won't be as horrific a transition as they want you and I to believe it is. National Separatism is a good thing if handled properly. You'll see once DJT comes into office and starts making calls and jabbering on the presidential phone.

       You got it totally backwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brexit was exactly what "they" wanted, as is proved by the fact their controlled media mouthpieces have been campaigning against the EU for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crash after the vote could not be avoided, but it could be mitigated, and thanks to the promises of cash injections from central banks, it eventually was.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact remains, none of this would have even happened if the elites themselves didn't want it to happen. They proposed the referendum. Their media had laid the groundwork with all its lies about the EU over the last couple of decades. They got what they wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they are hiding the mess they created with their market manipulations:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Brexit: Bank of England to boost post-Brexit markets with $460 billion
       </p>
       <p>
        Global central banks have rushed to deal with financial markets fallout from Britain's shock referendum decision to quit the European Union.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the elites really wanted the UK to stay in the EU, they would not be propping up the markets to prevent the backlash the crash was causing. They would be doing the complete opposite - making it worse so the people demanded the referendum be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no. The elites are doing everything they can to hide the damage they are causing so that the "Brexit" can continue.

       I think it's more if the "Elites" (though I don't regard these people as elites) wanted this for a long time and seem to be as powerful as you make it out to be then it was a win/partial win for them. If UK stayed in EU they would continue to reap the benefits, if it leaves they still win but less than what they intended. Weighing that up, I say we have a better chance now since the UK is leaving than if it stayed; either way no matter your age be prepared this is going to be a long, arduous and steep game but it has only begun.

       The market is completely run by computers now. They can make it dip, bounce whatever. Really what this Brexit thing showed is that yes the fear propaganda campaign can be turned On or Off at a moments notice. Something probably happened. Either a plan changed, or a deal was struck. And the order was given to terminate the propaganda campaign. Markets stabalized, sky is no longer falling.

       Maybe you guys can explain this one to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recently started looking into globalism and the forces at play behind most of the events in the world. I agree there is absolutely some shady shit going on, but the degree to which they affect the world I'm not solid on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Brexit vote passed by a fairly small margin. If the globalists have so much power and influence, why did they not steer public opinion away from Remain or fanagle the results? With the quick crash and rebound, could this actually be what they wanted? Or do they not have as much power as some think?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just find it hard to believe these people, who have ostensibly guided the direction of the world for the past few centuries, at least, would allow the plebs to give them a big fuck you.

       The Brexit was most likely planned by a group of financial elite looking for a reason for an engineered market crash. The economy is stabilizing because of mass purchasing of the damaged stocks. The UK's entire economy just changed hands and everyone is focused on immigration policy? I did notice too that now that the markets are stabilizing the tone of Brexit info has morphed.
