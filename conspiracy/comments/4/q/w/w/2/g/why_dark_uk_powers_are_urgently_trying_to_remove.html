       Jeremy Corbyn is a good guy, he was never meant to get to power, he represents the people, not just the British people, but humanity itself.  People like this aren't meant to get to power as they are the enemy of the corporations and the Elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's really going on here, why is it suddenly so urgent for powers in the UK to remove Corbyn from power?  The truth is amazingly simple and is not being discussed in the mainstream media.  In less than one week from now, the inquiry into the Iraq War (Chilcot Inquiry) is going to release it's findings, Corbyn was strongly opposed to the Iraq War and he would like to see the key figures who backed it brought to justice, such as Tony Blair.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is suspected that the inquiry will be a whitewash.  The people currently trying to oust Corbyn from his leadership position are those who voted for the war, so they are living in fear of having their careers and reputations tarnished by their bad decision, they are hoping for a Chilcot whitewash which will go unchallenged.  Corbyn would not allow a whitewash to go unchallenged, he would demand a real inquiry, and would call for Tony Blair to be tried for war crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't just the politicians who are trying to get rid of Corbyn before Chilcot, but dark forces in the shadows who instigated the Iraq War, that's why the media is also onboard and even David Cameron.  Jeremy Corbyn has overwhelming support from his party members, as they want an honest leader with a solid moral compass.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're in the UK (unlike me), I'd recommend you do what you can to help Jeremy Corbyn, you can join the Labour party to vote for him in any upcoming leadership contests.  Also make sure you spread the word that this is really about Chilcot, that will make it a lot harder for the Iraq War criminals to get away with yet more deciet, lies and dirty tricks.

       Corbyn was the only one to condemn the actions of the referendum campaigners, particularly the lies and half truths, when MPs returned to Parliament on Monday.
      </p>
      <p>
       The man has principles and seemingly can't be bought or intimidated.  We need many more politicians like him.

       I'm not traditionally a Labour supporter, but Corbyn caught my eye.  He seems to want what's best for the normal man.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the problem I think, there are people who don't want him to get justice for mere mortals, as it could upset the apple cart.  He is a breath of fresh air, and the only way to try and get rid of him is a witch hunt, because he's not establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Labour front bench supported Tony Blair on a phony excuse for war and still defend him now.  Corbyn hasn't, as far as I can tell done much wrong and he's been pilloried.

       I agree with everything you have said, and Corbyn needs our support, but there is a more fundamental reason why the political elites the media are trying to push Corbyn out - he is critical of Israel (for its war crimes, and its inhumane treatment of Palestinians).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is simply not acceptable the Jewish lobby in the UK, which (like the US, France, Germany etc) has a lot of political and financial leverage. They hate Corbyn, whom they perceive as a threat. A revolt has been engineered by the Zio-Blairite Labour MPs, who are apparently willing to destroy the Labour Party, such is their determination to depose Corbyn.

       I agree, but don't say "Jewish" when you mean "Zionist". Some Jews are anti-Zionism and some Zionists are not Jewish. It's like saying "Germans" when you mean "Nazis".

       Everybody's aware of the difference between Jewish and Zionist, thanks. Now perhaps you'd like to cite an example of an influential Jewish lobbying group that isn't pro-Israel (ie Zionist)? Westminster is packed full of pro-Israel parliamentarians, just like Capitol Hill. This state of affairs is carefully curated by the extremely influential Zionist lobby in both countries.

       Thank you for your exposition of the Talmud, and the history of Judaism! I am an atheist, and repudiate all religions, but it is clear to me that the Talmud is the most hateful and bigoted of the all the major religious tracts, including the Islamic Hadith.

       Anyone who doubts that Zionists are at the core of the assault against Corbyn and the Labor Party need only look at the "witch hunt" that has been underway for quite some time. The charge: That the Labour Party is "anti-Semitic", and we have seen one party member after another fall under the crosshairs of the Zionist Machine, who has been exhaustively combing through all manner of available records for
       <strong>
        <em>
         any hint
        </em>
       </strong>
       that any party member may have said anything that could possibly be (mis)construed to accuse them of
       <em>
        "anti-Semitism"
       </em>
       - which EFFECTIVELY means that they have said something - ANYTHING - that
       <strong>
        <em>
         Zionists
        </em>
       </strong>
       don't like being said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corbyn and Labour would do well to turn and face those accusing them HEAD ON, naming names and exposing the agenda of their insidious game, but it is an unfortunate fact that decades of propaganda and Pavlovian programming has had the effect of conflating Judaism with Zionism, and creating a reflexive repugnant response in the public mindset
       <strong>
        <em>
         any time
        </em>
       </strong>
       the actions or motives of Zionist zealots are scrutinized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Confronting this extremely powerful cabal will take BALLS OF STEEL, and a spokesman with the ability to articulate a clear and straightforward counteroffensive that will cut through the indignant appeal to EMOTION that will no doubt be launched by the vicious Zionist zealots, who will claim, as always, that it is THEY who are being victimized.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this end, Labour would be wise to invite the Honorable
       <strong>
        <a href="https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/news/74874/george-galloway-demands-jeremy-corbyn-rescinds-his">
         George Galloway
        </a>
       </strong>
       to rejoin their ranks. He is articulate, impeccably honest, and has a well-earned reputation for ruthlessly FLAYING those who use underhanded and deceptive tactics to further their agenda. Galloway is a seasoned veteran in the battle against Zionist hegemony - virtually bullet-proof - and I can think of no Western politician who is better suited to face these cowardly Zionist bastards, and to publicly expose their game.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TLDR:
       </strong>
       Corbyn, Galloway is your
       <strong>
        ally
       </strong>
       , and will work in the best interests of Labour and the British People. Bring him back into the Party.

       I think getting George Galloway back in the Labour Party would be brilliant. Corbyn should make him chief whip - that would put the obnoxious Blairite dregs who were behind the recent coup, in their place. Corbyn needs more allies, in any event.

       It amuses me greatly that the Blairite dregs have thrown the kitchen sink at Corbyn, and then doubled-up and thrown the entire house, and even David Cameron stepped in to help them, and Corbyn has refused to budge. The Blairites just look utterly stupid because they gambled everything and appear to have no more ammunition.

       He's a good guy that is being shafted unfairly but unfortunately although he recognizes the problem he doesn't have the right solutions (socialism kills).

       Just a thought: what if Jeremy Corbyn is being ousted out of the position of Leader of Labour Party because when the Chilcot report about Iraq was is released he will stick his teeth into every labour MP who knew that the UK should not go to war but voted the opposite, maybe because they were blackmailed or paid off? Just a thought.

       As a Brit and Corbyn supporter it's disgusting the way he's being attacked... even the media are spending more time hounding him than worrying about the Tories and leaving the EU...
