       I'm talking about the countless number of attacks, or "foiled attempts", that were planned, organized, and paid for by the FBI. Without terrorism, there is no need to spend billions of taxpayer dollars to fight against it. Therefore, the only way to ensure that your budget isn't cut each year is to be able to say "Look how much terrorism we prevented! You need us!"

      </p>
      <p>
       The Munich Massacre targeted Olympic athletes directly and not fans. Furthermore, the Olympics have much less "distraction value" during any given year since it rotates from country to country and is not a weekly occurrence as with other popular sports.

       it is an event but it isn't wholly there to placate the masses. Another difference with the boston bombing is that it isn't going to stop people from going to marathons, not many go already, but a bombing at an NFL game, or disneyland will absolutely destroy them.

       I've got to disagree. I am into conspiracies, but feel it's important to know the figures to back up claims. Also, I happen to be from the Boston area (that doesn't really mean anything, it's just why this event came to mind).

       There were upwards of 30,000 people registered to run this year's Boston Marathon, and of those nearly 27,000 ran. In addition to this, in 2015 the city anticipated approx. 1 million attendees to the event. To put this in perspective, there are just under 69,000 seats in Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would qualify that as a major sporting event. I also would argue that sports aren't there wholly to placate the masses. I think you're maybe getting a little deep into the dangerous parts of the web haha ;)

       so 2 things here (and i didn't downvote you, not sure why anyone would do that as you are obviously adding to the discussion). the first is that those million people are pretty spread out, sure there might be a chunk of them at the finish line, but the others are else ware. the second is that emotions for the marathon are not that high, sure there are some who follow stats or something, but their lives don't revolve around it like some sports fans for other sports.

       what percentage of the American population would be sad or even furious if the bostom marathon was canceled forever?

       what would be the percentage if any of the 4 major usa sports were canceled?

       If you just want to argue one game vs one game, figure more people would care about the Boston marathon.
       <br/>
       Now if you want to cancel a whole season or a few weeks that might make people upset. But then again, cancel the NY marathon and people are also more upset.

       but its a one off, it brings in tons of tourist business.  but its a one off and comparatively few people would be crying if it was canceled forever.  a lot of folks would be crying and angry if they canceled baseball, or sold the red sox to las vegas.

       check out my reply to the last guy here. I would disagree that it's not a major sporting event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's not about the number of people who died. It was "terrorizing" enough for the people of Massachusetts to be totally fine with our Governor invoking Marshall law. Those close to the city literally allowed police and law enforcement to enter their homes without warrants to search for Tsarnaev. We allowed them to shut down the whole city in a search for one man. Absolute absurd abuse of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The marathon bombing (which I believe was a set up and that Tsarnaev didn't actually do it) was to test the limits of law enforcement and what the people will allow them to do.

       oh I totally agree with your second point. it's terrifying (c wut i did?) to see the govt roll in special police with military vehicles and weapons and just invoke their authority and strom thru entire neighborhoods.

       they WANT people in stadiums to feel threatened.  people already associate so much of their identity with professional sports.  If THAT'S under attach, our way of life is under attack and finally it becomes a courageous and subversive act against extremist islam to get drunk and paint your face and shout at grown men playing a children's game.

       Two or three years ago, the nfl started not allowing bags over a certain size into the football stadium.  I had tickets to the first game of the season and did some dumpster diving after the game for thousands of dollars in designer handbags.  It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.

       the centennial Olympics and Boston marathon were not major. only a hanfdul died.  and those are sports for very specific fans.  most fans dont care much about Olympics and certainly not a marathon.

       I agree with you that sports are a tool for mass distraction buuut here is my theory. I think that people are more emotional during big sport events, and that makes them more vulnerable. They put feelings in sports and that opens a small door in someones mind. It works jusy like fear... you are easier to manipulate when you are afraid. Just imagine what emotional impact a terror attack will have on a nation cheering for their team at EURO 2016... much bigger than a random airport bombing.

       You have a good point b/c, good lord, it can't be that hard to find a secluded place with a view of a stadium and just start unloading on the crowds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've thought that about plane jackings too. Why get on the plane when you can just stand at the end of the runway and shoot one out of the sky with a rocket launcher? Are rocket launchers hard to get? The most sealed off place in the world doesn't seem to have a problem getting them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But more that any of those. Why do they keep targeting "no ones". Wouldn't it make more sense to go after people in power? Why do the "nuts" so rarely decide to do that? It seems almost completely opposite of what you would expect.

       i cannot say i agree with you, but i've been reading this thread and it's impressive how far people go to ignore the thrust of your concern and bring up irrelevant objections.
      </p>
      <p>
       mass media team sports are the topic of your discussion, not olympics, not marathons, not other bullshit-----------your are talking about the addictive sports fan mass media distraction complex. and people are trying to object to your point by bringing up marathons and olympics. this is annoying. it's as if a real discussion of your main point cannot even begin until annoying morons are dispatched with.
      </p>
      <p>
       my advice don't respond to their comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for your theory, I think that you are overly myopic in your concern about terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if you are talking about open conspiracies regarding media distraction in the sports complex ------------
      </p>
      <p>
       you can start with public financing of sports stadiums. you can then continue with the fact that the nfl was  a non=profit  for decades and never had to pay any back tax or admit any guilt when it changed status to for profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can then go on to discuss how the PUBLIC is at fault for this and the elite are just doing their job taking advantage of a completely moronic asinine public as would any good overlord whose pesky subjects are as easily subdued by sports as most toddlers are by children's television programming. Then you can transition from sports, to the mass entertainment complex at large, including movies, television, and the big one, video games. it's not just about sports.................
      </p>
      <p>
       you see---------------concerning your self with terrorism just distracts from the importance of  fully discussing this topic by unnecessarily boxing in the topic to fit your narrow conspiratorial concern. look for the bigger conspiracy, the social engineering, it's more interesting. that's my 2 cents.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for your conspiracy, i'll indulge you.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as false flags go-----------historically you don't want to create a false flag that is too big. if you believe in false flags, than you know it's not so easy to pull them off cleanly. The bigger your target the more risk there is in loss of narrative control, which is precisely what a false flag must be about. in this case of sporting events, they are generally too big and challenging targets ( they usually have high security) . It's not an easy target and the narrative of a successful attack is hard to control. that might be one rational reason any individual or group might choose different targets other than a main stream sporting event-----whether false flag or 'legitimate' act of terror.

       Although you may be on to something here, I want to propose a different theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe there aren't attacks on things like, lets say The Super Bowl, because the people in charge of that just put a ton of extra thought and resources into security, because they stand to lose tremendous amounts of money if it is disrupted.

       I once read an article on alternative news where it was suggested that arena shaped sports stadiums, a circle full of people, gives off a particular energy?

       Needless to say it was a crazy rabbit hole

       If you say that the Olympics aren't a major sporting event, and the NFL is, then you are just a pure out American. How many people watch the NFL? And how many people watch the Olympics... lets see... the NFL... only the USA... let us say 20 million people watch... now the Olympics.... nearly every country... 800 million people watching.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its common sense in terror attacks to go for the biggest audience. So if you attack the USA in the Olympics and people die, that's the biggest publicity you can get without using nuclear/biological weapons.

       You accept soccer as a "major sporting event? OK: Karachi, 2002, suicide bomb attack on New Zealand national team, 14 dead. Also 2002: car bombing at the Madrid stadium just before a Real Madrid game.  And your thesis is that the shadowy elite control attacks? In 1997, the Grand National horse race, an event
       <em>
        patronized
       </em>
       by the elite, was cancelled due to terror threats from the IRA.  I could go on, but why bother...

       no major sporting events were attacked.  and at the soccer game only one person died. the other three were bombers.  and it was outside and the game wasn't even stopped. hardly a major attack.

       It is just like the TSA/airline terror crap, sure someone can set their underwear on fire, but you can not tell a piece of metal in my laptop from a sharpened piece of metal, and you can tell a 9-cell battery from 9 cylindrically shaped pieces of an explosive.

       If you just want to argue one game vs one game, figure more people would care about the Boston marathon.

       Now if you want to cancel a whole season or a few weeks that might make people upset. But then again, cancel the NY marathon and people are also more upset.
