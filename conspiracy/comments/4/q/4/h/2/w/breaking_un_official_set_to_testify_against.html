       Niccolo Machiavelli gets a bad rap. Everybody reads The Prince and thinks he has a hardon for monarchy/dictatorship when in reality his life's work and passion, the Discourses on Titus Livius, we're all about self-rule, democracy, and good governance. High school students and college freshmen just read The Prince because it's less than 1/10 the size of the Discourses.

       One is black, the other white. I think the truth is grey.
      </p>
      <p>
       On this particular matter I agree that it's clear Ashe wasn't scheduled to testify in any manner that would name Clinton in the near future. But what both Snopes and the conspiracy sensationalists leave out is that Ashe absolutely was going to testify about corruption in the State department. Knowing what I know about the Clintons, I think it's likely that testimony could eventually have lead back to Hillary.

       Snopes is just other people doing research. If a reddit comment is researched and uses sound logic, why is it less valid than Snopes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, do you truly believe the people at Snopes do not have their own biases? That they cannot be coerced like any other outlet? Happened to reddit, happens to every major platform at some point. Assuming infallibility is never wise.

       How could the District Attorney know what he was going to say before he said it? And just to belabor the point a bit further, assuming that the opposing view is true, would you think that they wouldn't have him in on it to help cover their asses?

       Banks won't suddenly replace states if money is viewed for what it is: nothing. All that needs to be done to remove any threat from them is to move away from capitalism, preferably toward anarchism.

       Temporarily, maybe. But we're thousands of years into human history and have never stopped killing each other over petty, insignificant and ultimately pointless "issues." This is only exasperated by nationalism and capitalism. Politics are fickle and have too much impact on human lives considering that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanity has been at war with itself for as long as we've existed. Tribalism is part of human nature. The only way to avoid it is to acknowledge it for what it is, and actively try to move past it. The only way to achieve that is abolishing the state on a global scale. I am positive there will be individuals and organizations that wish to appropriate the power vacuum for their sociopathic power grabs, but they are a consequence of human nature, not a consequence of state abolishment. We already have thousands, if not millions of such people under our current system. We will only have less when the main factors that enable and abet many of them are gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nationalism and isolationism are poison, nothing more. They offer no benefits to the human condition, only disgusting dregs like xenophobia and jingoism. We move increasingly towards utter annihilation of both ourselves and our environment. Forsaking them is the only way to avoid this.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, globalism implies that some form of government is involved. That is not what I want.

       National and tribal identities are utterly perfunctory and meaningless, and inevitably lead to the desire to expand and eventually conflict with another. Culture and ethnicity will evolve, as they always have. After WWII, nations didn't suddenly not want to expand and conflict after thousands of years of doing exactly it. They couldn't do it because of globalization. Nations becoming more dependent on each other and sharing a vision of economic and political unity (through the UN and the EU) is what has largely prevented war in the West, as well as alleviated the Cold War to a degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nations will always want to expand. It's in human nature, but it's an utterly dangerous way of thinking if people desire at least some measure of peace. Globalization, economic interdependence and such actively prevent conflict. For that, from a personal moral standpoint, I think they're right under the circumstances. Human nature is sometimes flawed, but we should work around it and be mindful. Knowing your neighbour more intimately holds back that innate human desire to fear "the other."
      </p>
      <p>
       I by no means think globalism is perfect or the "end state." Every ruling and political system so far has been flawed, yet evolved. Globalism is just another rung.

       Not in the real world, I'm afraid. We can absolutely maintain individual and cultural identity, they will merely evolve through deeper connection with others throughout the world.

       No there has not. The "peace" you are so accustomed to was achieved through globalisation. And we still have many precarious situations around the world. To insinuate that peace is easy in a nationalistic world is ludicrous. History speaks for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Globalism may suit the purposes of bankers or whatever. But it's not the root problem, human nature is, and greed and a lust for power are part of that. I'm not even going to bother with your "all wars are caused by bankers" nonsense. While it's true to some extent, insinuating that all human conflict is banker-bred is ridiculous. You are very ignorant of human nature and history.
      </p>
      <p>
       These bankers you speak of also thrive in a nationalistic world. If they are the string pullers of many wars, then a political landscape that naturally breeds conflict is in their best interests. Globalism is not, particularly since the fantasy of global governance by a single entity is unfeasible.

       They factually are not. You have a poor understanding of globalism and globalization (two distinct things) as it is. Increased globalization does not mean global governance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Economic stagnation and inevitable collapse on a global scale is unavoidable without globalization now. Many nations will simply tear themselves apart. This is a problem with the world's view of economics, not globalism. We need to review and restructure global economies, or veer away from capitalism altogether. But for now, trade enhances economic growth, and growth reduces poverty. Globalism has directly delivered a better standard of living in less developed countries. We see examples of this today with Wales and its (former) funding from the EU.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how anyone can argue against the social aspect of globalism. Being exposed to more cultures does not mean your own culture will be overwritten. Culture is not constant. It evolves, and sometimes just vanishes due to outside factors. This is not a problem, and it takes someone exceptionally weak-minded to base their identity on superficial external factors that are often out of their control. People being made more aware of superficial differences makes them much less likely to be suckered into the human flaw of hating "the other", so peace is more easily achievable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Globalism is by no means perfect, but it is by no means the end of days or the installment of a new world order either. It can certainly take that path if enough of these people you mention will it, but that is not a predestined road and people will fight to keep it on a peaceful route of fraternity.

       Absolutely untrue. Feminism is an attempt to bring equality to women.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is true that some hardcore feminists perceive themselves as superior. This is called human nature. Many people naturally wish to be superior to "the other." These are not the majority among feminists, though, just as neo-Nazis are not the majority amongst white people.

       If they choose different careers, then they choose different careers. No woman is under the illusion that they should be paid the same as a man in a completely different field. I refuse to believe you're dense enough to believe this laughable notion.

       We have actual, tangible things that point to globalization being "awesome" though. Like the active prevention of World War III. You think nukes wouldn't fly without global diplomacy?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that it is marketed as a panacea. Many things are, because not everyone who supports something is versed in thinking about it beyond a superficial realm. They don't account for history, human nature, real world examples, or think about something in practice over paper. Prohibition firmly does not and has never worked at any point in human history, but people still think it's a saving grace. Even though parallel to that we know it is wholly unnecessary and only creates problems that never existed before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is perfect, but we have to work with what we've got and continue to evolve. Regression is not the answer. You can't put the genie back in the bottle with globalization. Better to reap the benefits while keeping it on the straight and narrow.

       The system posits a perfect enlightened leader, or group er who just loves the world so much ,and gosh y gosh just love people so much and would never use power for themselves. Blah blah blah. Your right about people, but the system that gives one small group so much power is also flawed.  The reality is that the globalist are all genocidal freaks. Population control they call it. It's for the trees and the animal? Do you hate trees?

       Culture is superficial in some respects, but a culture which advocates theocracy is more than superficially different.  Rational people are right to reject it, and will not be shamed into silence by globalist shills such as yourself.

       Culture is superficial in every respect. I accept religion so long as it is completely separate from governance and has no direct influence (as in politicians do not base policy on belief). But on the whole I agree with you on this point.

       The form of "Islam" that the likes of ISIS and Al Qaeda claim to adhere to does not exist. It's a bastardization passed off as ideological justification to continue and spread their barbarism and recruit the weak-minded. It is basically the Islamic version of God Hates Fags, if that organization were trained and armed by the American government. You wouldn't say GHF was represenative of Christianity, would you? It's an equivalent bastardization, warped beyond recognition and carefully selected from choice passages when are then extrapolated.

       Their goal is to sow discontent with Muslims, so that they can then enlist more disenfranchised and disenchanted Muslims into their organizations in order to gain more power and eventually topple Western regimes. Their membership is a drop in a bucket in terms of the overall global Muslim population. They want to fill the bucket by pressing nations into more hardline immigration policies against Muslims. They intend to recruit those turned away from having a normal life. Again, we've seen this many times throughout history. Turning one group against another is not difficult if you manipulate the situation at even a rudimentary level.

       You have no idea what you're talking about and it's quite plain to see you've never interacted with an actual Muslim, and are relying on a portrayal by a media you supposedly don't believe.

      <p>
       Globalisation benefits everyone, including corporations. That's due to capitalism, which I'm against. The world has always been full of theocrats. The GOP desires a fascist theocracy, for instance. It's irrelevant whether it's Christianity or Islam, both are as good or bad as each other and entirely dependant on the whim of their followers. Neither is inherently bad. You don't think the GOP wants Christianity all over?

       Crazy theocratic cunts are a small proportion of any religion. The majority of people just want to live their lives.

       Not if it is steered in the direction of democratic socialism, socialism, communism, and eventually a form of anarchism, in that particular order and probably missing one or two steps. While you're right that many of the rich and powerful benefit from globalization, this will end with the fall of capitalism. No path to change is unscathed.

       It's Islamophobia because it's a genuine phenomenon where people fundamentally don't understand what Islam is, and their perception of it is myopic, linear, and damaging.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there's an equal term for any other religion. The difference is that Islam is "a big deal" right now due to world events, while Christianity was neutered centuries ago. Many will still complain about how Christianity etc are criticised. Christians have taken to declaring that secularists and the liberal left have undertaken a "War on Christians."

       Islam does not teach "jihad." If it did, terrorism wouldn't be limited to (comparatively) tiny organisations. Muslims are no more violent than any other people. You would know this if you knew any, or knew anything about the religion itself. You do realise there are just as many forms of Islam as there are forms of Christianity? Some are extremist, like Christianity, others are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, "jihad" is being taught by Wahhabism. A subset of Islam that few Muslims follow, which has been actively perpetuated by Saudi Arabia and the U.S., whether directly or indirectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The increase in jihadis is directly correlated to invasion of the Middle East. It turns out that murdering people and taking away their political realm makes them angry. It's a fairly recent phenomenon. People haven't been blowing themselves up to kill others for a long time.

       Christianity has not? Most religions are tainted in blood throughout history. You insinuate that 1.6bn Muslims are predisposed towards jihad, which is frankly untrue. You refer solely to Wahhabism, which is a mere fraction of that population.
      </p>
      <p>
       The violent version of Islam emerged in response to European imperialism, and has become recently popular in the late 20th century and early 21st due to Soviet and American imperialism and artificial propagation of Wahhabism in the Middle East and western nations directly by Saudi Arabia, which is allowed and enabled, if not outright endorsed, by America. If the people don't want it, they will fight it. Just take a look at Vietnam.

       And they should be allowed. Those fleeing are being killed by those fundamentalist jihadis, or a dictator. What makes you think they sympathize with them? Out of any possible number of Muslim immigrants, a miniscule fraction would be terrorists. It's already a low frequency if you count terrorists who do not conduct activities overseas or try to travel.

       Jihad, like sharia, is a word that's been appropriated by the West to mean something very specific even though the word jihad is a noun meaning the act of "striving, applying oneself, struggling, persevering", and sharia loosely means "law", and not a specific one, just law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many Muslims disagree on the definition of jihad, but most do not think it means "holy war." The Quran refers to Jews and Christians as "people of the book" who must be protected, so there is no intrinsic desire among Muslims to massacre other religions, just as there is not for Jews or Christians. It takes a violent leadership to go down that path, and ISIS or al-Qaeda are merely a minor fraction of Muslims just as "God Hates Fags" is a minor fraction of Christians.
      </p>
      <p>
       If military jihad is required to "protect the faith against others" (like resisting occupation by a foreign country trying to steal natural resources and plant puppet governments), it can be performed using anything from legal, diplomatic and economic to political means. If there is no peaceful alternative, Islam also allows the use of force, but there are strict rules of engagement. Innocents - such as women, children, or invalids - must never be harmed, and any peaceful overtures from the enemy must be accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Military action is therefore only one means of jihad, and is very rare. To highlight this point, the prophet Mohammed told his followers returning from a military campaign: "This day we have returned from the minor jihad to the major jihad," which he said meant returning from armed battle to the peaceful battle for self-control and betterment. The Crusades were an act of minor jihad, because they were opposing an invading force. Likewise with the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, where the U.S. venerated and sponsored their minor jihad because they knew at the time what it meant, though now it's become a word synonymous with terrorism by racist agenda pushers you've been suckered in by.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a plain old racist, nothing more. Few words you've said on any subject matter has a hint of truth to it. You're as warped and delusional as the "masses" you scoff at.

       It's not what you think it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sharia can mean "way" or "path", essentially, a way of life that pleases Allah. If you asked a Muslim if they followed sharia, many would answer yes, because that is like asking a Christian if they live as God desired. There is nothing about sharia that promotes extremism, those are added after the fact by fundamentalists and Wahhabis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering you are in the conspiracy subreddit, I'd expect you to have much more sympathy for Muslims as they are an inverted version of yourself and Western society. They are the result of demagogues and far-right wing fundamentalists seizing power and introducing draconian hard-line measures to enforce a specific way of life. This is happening in many nations right now. Painting Muslims as "the enemy" only helps those fundamentalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The West is also wholly to blame for Islamic extremism. America in particular actively promotes and perpetuates it so long as it maintains Saudi Arabia as an ally. Instead of fervently trying to pass blame onto others who are simply caught in a horrible situation and most are completely innocent, maybe you should take action yourself against your own corrupt and warmongering government.

       I agree. But hate speech is called hate speech for a reason, it's hateful. It inspires conflict. It is fascist. The moment you treat someone as a flawed or lesser person, it's easier to pit others against them. History had shown us this time and time again and yet we are doing the exact same on the biggest scale yet to the entire Muslim population on a global scale, far surpassing the scale of contempt on the Jewish.

       Criticism of religion is not banned. Inflammatory hate speech, insults etc are because they breed conflict and serve no purpose in reasonable discourse. Every single religion is criticised regularly.

       Looking through your post history, you appear to suffer from an acute case of paranoia, and probably veering towards some form of mental illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what if ISIS claim to be killing in the name of Allah? Christians claim to do a lot of heinous shit in the name of God too. The fact of the matter is that the religions are not the problem, they are also illusory constructs, which men twist and warp to suit their preconceived ideals. Just like "nationalism" and its off-spring patriotism and jingoism, signs of simple-mindedness and disconnection from reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone can claim they believe in something. It doesn't suddenly make the belief wrong or evil. It's all about context. ISIS is operating outside the context of Islam. Yes, you can probably find references to violence or culturally out of touch elements in the Quran. But you can also find just as many, if not more, in the Bible. I'm sure you have no trouble wearing two kinds of fabrics and masturbating even though these are stated to be despised by God, and the latter is deemed worth killing over.

       Uh, no. Plenty of terrorists are Christians. The media just doesn't like calling anyone a terrorist unless they're dark-skinned or Islamic, because that suits the narrative they peddle and keeps the Western world docile with a specified target to hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean it wasn't that long ago that a bunch of hicks took over a government building and held hostages, but were never labeled as terrorists and the local police shook hands with them despite threats of violence. The Quran actually says "don't kill" just like the Bible, maybe try reading it you pleb. The Bible incites violence against many types of people. You know stoning was a big thing, right?

       I actually do realize. That's why I believe we should try our hardest to make sure our whole planet doesn't become some absurdly rich cunt's personal fiefdom. I thought that was pretty much the whole point of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me make this clear: I believe that Depopulation (agenda 21, codex alimentarius, whatever)
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       climate change. What the elites don't realize is that by fucking up the climate to reduce the global population, they run the risk of runaway climate change, which could render the whole planet unliveable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Big Oil
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/climate-change-oil-industry-environment-warning-1968">
        knew
       </a>
       about climate change for a long time now, just as Monsanto knows Glyphosate is a carcinogen. On one hand they want to make the big $$, on the other though, they have so much money they could invest in alternatives and then force the switch to the alternatives to become market leaders there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe part of the reason they don't do this, is that they
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       climate change happening.

       Down vote to hell here i come! Some people are to closed minded and scared to face the fact that we are ultimately going to end up as that anyways. People are going to look at all this in 1000 years like we look back at the dark ages now. So much potential and ideas were held back because of this reason or that reason and we look at those reasons and like WTF you asshole why did you stop that?!?!? we could be 100 years more advanced now if you didn't! At least that's how i think.

       Unfortunately we don't all get along, borders dividing us or not. What you described is ideal, I'm sure we all can agree. I just simply do not see it going that smooth and it easily putting and end to the same issues we have today.

       Yep, completely agree. People just need to learn to get along. Not everyone thinks like you and that is okay, go find someone who does and don't force your shit on the person who doesn't. Borders are just like our currency though. They don't really exist yet they still control us.

       No, he wasn't. But as the article states, “During the trial, the prosecutors would have linked Ashe to the Clinton bagman Ng. It would have been very embarrassing. His death was conveniently timed.”

       I wonder how long it will take before people realize some of those deaths are BS, and a few names are actually not even real people. (assuming this is the same "kill list" that is always posted on these kinds of threads). This has been debunked about 10 times that I've seen. Maybe people will finally start to realize propaganda can come from both sides.

       If you want to find the ones that don't exists just search for names in the list. You won't find any information on a lot of them other than sites that posted the body list. Most of them, with very little research can be shown that they either had no affiliation with Clinton or there was absolutely no foul play involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       This reddit post itself is a false one. He wasn't testifying against Clinton. Do your own research before calling people out.

       One wiki source, that's some deep investigation! Any other sources that aren't a wiki? Perhaps news articles or a self written report on aritcles and how they connect with your debunked statement? I mean as far as facts go, a lot of these coincidences have been proven true by autistic mother fuckers. Calling them a crazy doesn't invalidate their work, it just goes to show just how detailed and precise their work is. Irrelevant of nutty people there are legitimate agencies investigating. So based on a level of probabilities I'd say that Clinton has at least committed a crime where the sentence would be life. So who cares about the details, lock that bitch up!

       Do your own research. If you can't find a source that isn't a page set up for the Clinton body count then the person probably isn't real. Like honestly posts like the kill list just waste up space here on conspiracy. Everyone wants to believe them but if anything they just take recognition away from real conspiracies

       I think it would be foolish to assume she killed someone with her own hand. Is directly related in the death of innocent people? Meaning she knew of a murder before it occurred, then yes. To say she initiated  the murder would be too difficult since we don't know, but to say she knew or was apart is not that difficult of a connection to make. Again I'm leaning more towards conspiracy to commit murder/first degree murder.

       How do you know what he was going to testify to before he got to testify? Also, do you think that he would not have been told to tell exactly that? Presuming they are willing to execute a potentially harmful witness, would they not also be willing to coerce to cover up?

       Because a helpful tip is to not assume things without basis especially when evidence points against it. Sure, there is an extremely slight chance.  Unless there is actual evidence for the other side of the argument then it shouldn't be assumed

       You might in fact be right, but you sure go about it in a dickish manner. 
For you to claim that someone asking politely for you to give some background to your contrary opinion is "calling you out" is asinine.
I don't have time to spend hours on the internet. You having done the research already are able to provide some info in a quarter of the time.

       lol this is a perfect example of why uninformed people would vote for Hillary, they simply dont care that she lies and behaves like a sociopath....because they think her "goals" justify the means. What you dont realize is that  her goals are in direct counter to anyone else on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to lie in order to hypothetically do something which will benefit us all in the long run but does not have widespread support---such as lying about the massive, crippling amount of transitional unemployment we would have by switching away from fossil fuels--then thats probably OK..but when you lie in order to pump more money into the clinton foundation and start for-profit wars, then yeah, we should all be against you lying to achieve your goal.

       It's not technically a "lie"---its simply a very misleading title. Idk where youve been for the past decade but that's the era of click-oriented journalism we live in. Conversely, trying to paint a misleading picture that she had him killed, while baseless, pales in comparison to the innumerable amount of 100% true/verifiable infractions and truly evil behavior Clinton has perpetrated over her tenure as a politician.....in fact, articles such as this only gain traction because her reputation is so horrendous (for good reason) that something like this actually happening is believable

       Specifically a brench press. Of all the lifts people die performing this is probably the most common. However it makes you wonder why a man in his position, who I'm assuming could afford proper equipment, would be doing one of the most dangerous lifts you can do alone, without a proper safety setup.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it happens a few times a year, so I don't think we can conclude either way unless we saw his setup.

       Yep, as I said it is pretty rare and it's usually some kid who has shitty equipment and is lifting alone in their parents basement or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to know the details from the report and see exactly how it happened. They said it was asphyxiation so it means the barbell fell on his neck and did not kill him immediately, but he was unable to get out from under it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can happen if you collar the weights and are in some sort of rack that wouldn't let you dump the bar to the side far enough to get out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it could have broken his neck and then he was unable to lift it and it asphyxiated him. But again, lifting enough weight to break your neck without any safeties or a spotter/family member nearby to call for? Strange and tragic indeed.

       Ashe was due in court Monday with his Chinese businessman co-defendant Ng Lap Seng, who is charged with smuggling $4.5 million into the US since 2013 and lying that it was to buy art and casino chips.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ng was identified in a 1998 Senate report as the source of hundreds of thousands of dollars illegally funneled through an Arkansas restaurant owner, Charlie Trie, to the Democratic National Committee during the Clinton administration. (Ng was not charged with any crime.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Ng and Trie had visited the White House several times for Democratic fund-raising events and were photographed with then-President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       One source told me, “During the trial, the prosecutors would have linked Ashe to the Clinton bagman Ng. It would have been very embarrassing. His death was conveniently timed.”

       True, but in order to make a stronger case against Ng it would seem appropriate to get any testimony linking him to former acts of political corruption. In this case, it seems he was to testify about the link Ng had to the Clintons.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while he wasn't testifying
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       the Clintons, it's very possible he was going to speak about their involvement.

       He was only slated to attend a pre trial interview. Official court documents state that he was never scheduled to testify against Clinton at all. I can't discount it entirely as I don't have all the information, but I can draw a reasonable conclusion that this story is not representative of the truth. Especially since the initial rumour was fabricated by a renowned fake news syndicate.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       From this unnamed source and a nebulous "linkage" (which could have been nothing or simply that he contributed to the fundraiser) we immediately leap to this idea that he was
       <em>
        testifying against Clinton
       </em>
       ?! That seems rather extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been linked to many bad people in my life, and I'm not even in politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's wait for actual charges in this case before leaping to conclusions based on "endthefed.com", which though I'm sure it's an unbiased news source...

       I found it strange that that snopes article is literally the first article on google when you search "John Ashe". It's true that he was facing a separate trial not affiliated with the current Hillary FBI thing, but that's not what's being claimed. The idea is that in the process of parsing through his corruption the details of the co-defendant Ng Lap Seng's interaction with the Clintons could come to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see anything on Ng on that page so
       <a href="http://pagesix.com/2016/06/26/disgraced-ex-un-officials-death-conveniently-timed/">
        this

       may fill you in. Either way I feel using a single websites' analysis to shutdown an argument is kinda shady.

       Absolutely untrue. Feminism is an attempt to bring equality to women.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is true that some hardcore feminists perceive themselves as superior. This is called human nature. Many people naturally wish to be superior to "the other." These are not the majority among feminists, though, just as neo-Nazis are not the majority amongst white people.
