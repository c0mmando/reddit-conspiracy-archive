       Silver and Gold have both entered a bull market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gold spiked 25$ overnight, which is inversely related to the strength of our "ole faithful" fiat currency. Meaning that purchasing power is declining. New year high
      </p>
      <p>
       Silver is up like $3.00 dollars in the last week. New year high overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Silver Market was artificially manipulated at a terribly low price for months. Mining operations across the world shut down/mined other materials such as Copper,zinc,lead, which do to the influx, are at terribly low prices atm. Only a small amount of silver is being mined while demand for it is through the roof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying this is a crash or anything extreme. But expect Silver to sky-rocket over the next few months. Some predict 50$.
      </p>
      <p>
       --Edit---
      </p>
      <p>
       -Dollar down at a 11 month low.
-Investors, Banks, and Consumers confidence are lower due to interest rate raised like a few bits, raising commodity prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion: The Fed cannot even begin to think about stabilizing the economy and raising interest rates. It's simply not gonna happen. They will continue to pump cash into the market into infinity, while final preparations are set.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a friendly remaindered to my fellow co-conspirators. That we live in a lie, and the only thing you can do is protect yourself when the lie comes down.

       They just want to rub it in. They aren't advertisements because you can't afford gold. Only the billionaire elite control gold. Most of the world's supply is under the control of a select few banks and individuals and governments. Especially now since Libya and Ukraine were looted by the West. America was looted under Roosevelt.

       I follow the price of Gold intradaily.....texted my friend yesterday when it was up $14. The swings are pretty crazy to me. Silver nearing $18....I had really thought the bottom for Gold would be below $1000 (could have been in the 990's). I just had that gut feeling for years and years. So much so that I promised myself a bottle of Brunello di Montalcino if it dipped below $1000 for even a millisecond. Came so close in December, haha.

       There is a global re-positioning of economic power capabilities happening right now. It's a shift before the IMF adjusts the SDR basket in October/November. Just expect U.S. hegemony to be less. How much less? That's the uncertainty.

       Yeah silver is a good investment. Gold too. Always buy physical metals though. There's a phrase amongst proponents of physical commodities: "keep stackin". I don't know what will happen though in the future, meaning if a police state/confiscation era dawns upon us, or if a disaster recovery barter system emerges. With the former, we're all kind of shit outta luck. With the latter, the investment move would prove somewhat prudent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't invest in markets, to be honest. It's hard to do in my profession (a lot of res trict ions that don't allow you the full capacity of investment tool access). So, if I did invest in the markets, it'd be like playing baseball with no legs. I do do research though, and I'd look into global shipping, demolition (for ships and trucks), water filtration/utilities/processing and piggy back companies supplying materials for things (napkins, bathroom stuff like urinals and toilets and their components, plastic bags, etc.).
      </p>

       Hope that expands your view more.

       I'd suggest some government coins.  Helps verify authenticity.  Silver and gold eagles are very liquid in the United States.  Easy to sell.  Maples are popular too and recognized well around the world.  I wouldn't buy any bars that are above a kilo (32.2 troy oz) in weight. Buy from somewhere reputable like Apmex or JMBullion.  Other than that, buy what you like or get what's closest to spot if you're looking to maximize savings.

       A few plastic bottles of acid, I forget what they are, and a touch stone. If it sticks to a magnet don't test it it is garbage. Scratch the metal on the stone enough to see scraping apply acid to stone, which ever one dissolves it will be labeled with what you have. You want to avoid touching the potions and always wipe the stone off.  You will want to store this upright in a box. Away from children pets and conscious exes.

       Paying by check on bullion sites (like APMEX) will be a little cheaper. Also, I'd guess have a variety of weighted rounds and bars so that if a barter situation ever arose, you'd be more versatile in what you could offer, and not make a bad deal for yourself. I've bought used online. The condition doesn't really matter to me. If I take a few bars in a bugout bag if shit ever hit the fan, then I'm really not going to treat them all coin collector-esque.

       I wouldn't even worry about the price fluctuations in the paper market either......just buy to have.

       You can only hold so much. Have you ever seen the show 'Life Below Zero' on NatGeo? The family there (white guy with native/Eskimo looking woman with 2 girls) in Alaska, when the go on long trips on a set remote route, keep several supply stash spots. Thinking along those lines, if you accumulate a lot of real assets, might be worth looking into stash spots if you are interested in survival stuff.

       I feel freer not owning real estate. Owning a house and retirement pensions/401k schemes seem to be 2 of the biggest long cons for Gen X and Gen Y to me. Not to say that people haven't made money, but if you are just looking in 2016 to buy a house or are counting on a 401k to provide for you later in this 21st century, you are fooling yourself.

The invented numbers interest due Fiat we use....the fed...the fraud....
Truth is the Constitution calls for what?  History has shown and continues to show, that when the money is no longer accepted the currency changes. The only way to reform anything resembling any kind of capitalism/banking minus the fraud, is thru legitimate currency. Bitcoin, Doge ...all great till there is no power. My gold rings will trade, with almost certainty anywhere in the world. For more than what I have in them. By far. Not sure I am wrong. Welcome to studentloans my friend..

       True but that ring was really handy. Not saying there isn't room for bit or any other digital currency. Just sharing what has most definitely worked for me in the past. Seems when ever currency in any form becomes worthless, those that have extra will always accept the family heirlooms. Not sure if this s still a thing anywhere but in the seventies I remember the Turkish family upstairs would wait until they had a few hundred extra,and dad would go buy mom a bracelet. Mom wore the family wealth. Dad had some on too. On hand is on hand.

       I have no job or budget . I flea market and take care of my veteran dad. But I usually end up finding treasure someone doesn't know they have, and I have a few milk crates full of Antique's and collectibles. You would be surprised. If I had it to play with, i defintely would do some type of e currency, but I don't know think I would ever trust a bank again. Not with funds bonds futures. Nah. You haz what you hold. Grandma made it through Dresden ww2 . She taught me well.

       So that magically means it won‚Äôt ever collapse? They can‚Äôt do anything else anymore. QE won‚Äôt work, changing the interest rate will hyperinflate, and the economy isn‚Äôt working on its own.

       Until the currency collapses, gold and silver will be worthless. The trick is to see when it will collapse. It ain't going to collapse today, or tomorrow, or next month(probably).

       I feel sorry for anyone that held out in Dec when it now appears the actual bottom was hit around $15 for silver, and 1100 for gold, those already seem like bargain prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       but remember these large increases seem to drop just as quick, if we are up $25 today we could be down $25 monday morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       the volatility should still leave plenty of room for concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       please remember though, prices can increase quickly and inventory can drop just as fast. There isnt enough gold and silver to go around if everyone decided they wanted/needed some

       Less than a 2% increase. Quite a bit, but not astronomical. I wouldn't say its indicative of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at the past 4-5 days it has gone up almost 5% though, that's a lot for sure...

       Going to do some more research to try to determine if this is due to cyclical effects or if it looks like there's actually something going on here.

       Just remember, the dollar ran up in value by a huge amount (~15-20%) in late 2014-early 2015. So this small decline should be viewed in a suitable historical perspective.

       Technical trader here. Yes the dollar tanked here and it's basically at last years may low. If it breaks down from this you can definitely expect that it will continue.

       On the other hand however the euro and everything else (gold, bitcoin,platinum ect) that's priced in dollar will make moves upward.

       All true if pushing us to war doesn't succeed. China is stockpiling oil, all the tankers and storage facilities are full to the brim. Do you know what all that oil is once the missiles fly? It suddenly goes from $38 a barrel to $300. Martial law and a command economy, price controls, commodity and banking "czars" are empowered. Silver sales get shut down along with all strategic metals.

       Seriously r/conspiracy?  This post is just flat out wrong.  The dollar was super strong late 2014 and since then has gone sideways with a lot of volatility.  The dollar has weakened considerably so far in 2016, but is within a pretty normal range and nowhere near as weak as it was just a few years ago.
