       A new report from analysts with industry research group, Sandler Research, forecasts the Global Riot Control System Market for the next four years — but beyond a burgeoning market to parallel the expanding global police state, it appears world governments are also keenly aware of civilian discontent. Sandler predicts the market will have an annual growth of 3.5 percent, and makes a telling juxtaposition, emphases added, involving the United States:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Law enforcement agencies around the world are the biggest market for riot control systems. This market is expected to generate revenues of over USD 3.5 billion by the end of 2020. Countries such as the U.S., Iran, Egypt, Russia, China, and Thailand have started procuring riot control equipment and are investing heavily in [non-lethal weapons]. Moreover, special vehicles that are equipped with water cannon and reservoirs have been designed for security personnel, for use in areas of conflict to handle large crowds and demonstration. Demand for such equipment is expected to rise during the next few years.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Note the last sentence in its truncated time frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically, the analysts continue:
      </p>
      <p>
       “In North America, the prominent markets are Canada and the U.S. and law enforcement agencies in these nations are best equipped with the upgraded weapons. The militarization of the police department and other law enforcement agencies in the Americas has encouraged the use of advanced riot control equipment.”
      </p>
      <p>
       While swaths of the country debate the finer points of which lesser evil should take the helm of the corporate plutocracy, various U.S. law enforcement agencies have been gearing up for the virtually inevitable unrest both during and following those elections.

       Maybe, but those movies will planned out several years ago. Not to mention they areare very obvious choices to translate onto film. Civil War is an insanely popular Marvel event, and Apocalypse is one of the most favorite Marvel villains.

       I noticed how we have been brain washed with tv to think that heros are soldiers. Like all the recruitment commercials are like become a hero join the military. So bieng a hero is getting weponized and pushing a political agenda on a group of people/killing people. Heros are people like captain planet and hurcules. People who do the right thing people who make it thier lifes purpose to help others and make others quality of life better and people who give up thier life to show others the truth like snowden. Idk what made me go off about this kinda off topic lol.

       Who a they preparing against?  Which "faction"?  The common person is nowhere near ready to protest, so who is it going to be?  Probably no one.  They are likely just spending this years budget down to the penny so they do not get less, but more, next year.

       So what's the timeframe then?  Are they planning for next month, year, or a decade down the road?  I don't see us running out of supplies (in the 1st world countries) in the near future unless something immensely horrible happens.  If something immensely horrible is about to happen, then what is it going to be?

       Could be any time, I'm not a prophet.  Nor do I think anyone is 'planning' for any specific date.  It's more like over a series of weeks prices will skyrocket in stores across the country but pay will stay the same.

       Peter Schiff always makes economic collapse predictions, so take his word with a grain of salt.
       <a href="http://youtu.be/JWlYNZNeVKA">
        Here
       </a>
       is his latest prediction.

       Honestly if you look at Donald Trump rallies there's a lot of violent protesting. Those events are a powderkeg for a big riot or worse, especially if shots are fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       As well, the events in the summer of '14, with the looting of Ferguson and Baltimore, set a precendent for future urban conflicts on a large scale.

       Maybe there could be more anti police brutality riots but on a massive scale since nothing has changed and more people are aware since the last time

       ok, that's a thought, but suppose the plan is to totally stop protests when the real SHTF. maybe the plan is to make people afraid to speak out.

       The thought had occurred to me.  However, most people don't even know, aren't aware of, that this is going on.  How all this equipment is being accumulated.  If they don't know, then it wouldn't act as a deterrent unless something serious does happen, and I'm talking big time.  By then it'd be too late to riot anyway.

       people are still "asleep". should things break down to the point of them pulling out the "big guns" (whatever they may be), people will be hurt or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       don't forget that there are others in the mix that will agitate the situation as they're job will be to escalate the situation, so people
       <em>

       get hurt. we can only hope that this is assumed, but it's happened in the past.

       US LEAs have obviously been infiltrated by terrorists or criminal subversive anti-american groups who are using LEOs as their own personal unquestioning militia men, as can be seen by their constant behavior/the fact that they're gunning people down in the streets for money every day/torturing people on city streets with electrical current and gas/accepting payment to perform daily violent abductions in our country/etc.

       Who would hire an intelligence analyst and policy thinktank whose report says, "everythings fine, the government risk asseement by domestic terroirsm (non-self-created) is 0.  In fact, you can lower your budgets because crime is down 50% and we predict a steady decrease in crime by 2% yearly thereafter"
