When people who look white call him out it is associated with a race problem, therefore many keep their mouths shut. We elected this man and now the &quot;rules&quot; will be shifted to see what else they can get away with. The reason Americans do nothing in protest is because of one thing, fear. The only way to have accountability is to know your neighbor, love them, and do whatever it takes to band together and demand it. </p>

<p>i guess i kind of did.  i didnt know when i wrote that that i would be called out like this, but thats fine.  </p>

<p>i came to my conclusion actually based on evidence that the birther movement provided.  they said kenya wasnt a country yet, so why did kenya appear as his fathers birthplace?  and something about the layering in the pdf file it was released on proving it was photoshopped etc.  it didnt take much digging to debunk these claims.  so now, when i see the long form birth certificate, i just take it at face value.</p>

<p>Voting for Trump because he isn&#39;t establishment is short-sighted and foolish. Please don&#39;t ruin your own country and its reputation around the world by voting in a man who has only himself in mind and has little to no knowledge on how the world actually works.</p>

<p>If you want to protest vote, vote for Bernie. He&#39;ll do considerably less damage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The motivation in my mind is to find out just how little the American people will do in protest. This has really nothing to do with him being black it is about having something to question about an individual&#39;s ability to represent all qualifications necessary to be president and really getting a ehh... he&#39;s still gonna be president. And he was and is. Now here comes the next puppet and its even worse, she is a liar, a really scummy person and we know she lies and we know the scandalous events she is shrouded in. It doesn&#39;t matter though because the American people won&#39;t even do something to demand answers to questions of legality concerning eligibility of a candidate much less anything moral. Why would I protest vote for bernie?! My biggest concern with politics is lobbying. Trump speaks as if that shit doesn&#39;t phase him. So I am curious to see. He has some deep pockets and I am investing my vote into the idea that just maybe... they haven&#39;t got to him yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re seeing shadows were there aren&#39;t any. </p>

<p>Nothing about what you say about Hillary is wrong and I agree that she shouldn&#39;t be President. I don&#39;t think Obama is a litmus test for Hillary though. She is popular. She has always been popular to some degree. There&#39;s really no mystery to her rise. </p>

<p>Regarding &quot;qualifications necessary to be President&quot;, Trump should be ringing a lot of alarm bells. The man is so obviously unfit to rule a country its painful to watch. </p>

<p>Why Bernie? Because he&#39;s been anti-establishment and anti-lobbying since he first set foot in Washington. The man very clearly is what your country needs. He&#39;s not a radical like the media would like you to believe. He&#39;s a true threat to establishment politics and the only pockets he&#39;s beholden to are you, the common people. </p>

<p>Please look into him and Trunp more from a policy stand point. Trump is a fool who doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about. Bernie, at least, has some understanding and is trying to fight against what you claim to despise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right that he won&#39;t be on the ticket and its far too late for me to be trying to change people&#39;s minds. Unfortunately. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by can&#39;t not vote democratic. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not American so at the end of the day I don&#39;t need to make the decision. I can honestly say I&#39;ve no idea how I would vote in the coming Trump vs Hillary election. I feel like Lindsay Graham&#39;s thoughts when asked about whether he&#39;d support Trump or Cruz are very appropriate for Trump and Hillary too (although I&#39;m going to alter it slightly. &quot;Its like being asked if I want to be shot in the face or slowly and painfully poisoned&quot;.</p>

<p>One thing for a Trump vote is it might actually spur a revolution. I&#39;m not sure the risks outweigh the potential cons though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? I didn&#39;t know that. That is absolutely absurd. </p>

<p>I knew your system was broken but damn, that&#39;s just ridiculous. I hope electoral reform becomes a hot issue for you guys soon enough. Maybe this race will spur that talk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I didn&#39;t mean to suggest that it was actually a murder, I just wanted to clarify the actual info from the article rather than just what my uncle said.  I agree it seems rather unlikely to use that strategy to have her killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The motivation in my mind is to find out just how little the American people will do in protest. This has really nothing to do with him being black it is about having something to question about an individual&#39;s ability to represent all qualifications necessary to be president and really getting a ehh... he&#39;s still gonna be president. And he was and is. Now here comes the next puppet and its even worse, she is a liar, a really scummy person and we know she lies and we know the scandalous events she is shrouded in. It doesn&#39;t matter though because the American people won&#39;t even do something to demand answers to questions of legality concerning eligibility of a candidate much less anything moral. Why would I protest vote for bernie?! My biggest concern with politics is lobbying. Trump speaks as if that shit doesn&#39;t phase him. So I am curious to see. He has some deep pockets and I am investing my vote into the idea that just maybe... they haven&#39;t got to him yet.</p>
