       We still don't know exactly what this man's birth certificate states as his place of birth. We did nothing about it. When people who look white call him out it is associated with a race problem, therefore many keep their mouths shut. We elected this man and now the "rules" will be shifted to see what else they can get away with. The reason Americans do nothing in protest is because of one thing, fear. The only way to have accountability is to know your neighbor, love them, and do whatever it takes to band together and demand it.

       If he is the child of his american born mother he is an american citizen. No matter where she shit him out geographically. Was he groomed and placed as POTUS, absolutely, he's nothing but a figurehead puppet in black face. Scout? I didn't think they let gay people be scouts?

       Nope it's the fear. What are you gonna do when your baby is crying for food and big business has shut down shop to put the squeeze on the American people to get back in line. No food in Wal-Mart, people coming into your home for resources,  nobody wants that and they are scared it COULD happen so they play their little parts.

       I saw that too but didn't the lady that produced the certificate get murdered or something two weeks later? My uncle was telling me that I will have to look it up.  I don't think it's certain that he is a citizen, although I agree that it is inconsequential.

       Edit: ok so it was 2 years later and it was a plane crash but she was the only casualty and there is no known cause for the crash.

       I'll lead with I don't know whether or not the birther argument is bullshit or not, but I personally tend to believe it's bullshit so we agree on that. But did you really just say, more or less, "it's on the internet so it's true."

       i guess i kind of did.  i didnt know when i wrote that that i would be called out like this, but thats fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       i came to my conclusion actually based on evidence that the birther movement provided.  they said kenya wasnt a country yet, so why did kenya appear as his fathers birthplace?  and something about the layering in the pdf file it was released on proving it was photoshopped etc.  it didnt take much digging to debunk these claims.  so now, when i see the long form birth certificate, i just take it at face value.

       A scout for who exactly? What non-American entity wants to scout this out. And if Obama is already establishment, which is obvious that he is, then what does it matter? They're already in power.

       Seems like you're scraping the end of an empty barrel in an attempt to make Obama be a foreigner for some reason. I have no idea what that is. Only you can answer that.

       Scout wasn't the right word... kinda like, "lets see if there is any uproar/riot if all the controversy surrounding this guy comes to light". And there was really none. So now this time lets push the envelope a little further. I am a trump voter (notice the lowercase t because he shares the address) only because there isn't a true people's candidate. Hillary will win though and it is crazy because she is crooked and when she does they already know we won't do anything because of their scout.

       But what's the motivation for "pushing the envelope"? Whatever that means? How is having a black president controversial? What's the next step then?
      </p>
      <p>
       Voting for Trump because he isn't establishment is short-sighted and foolish. Please don't ruin your own country and its reputation around the world by voting in a man who has only himself in mind and has little to no knowledge on how the world actually works.
      </p>

       If you want to protest vote, vote for Bernie. He'll do considerably less damage.

       I agree that Hillary will win though.

       Neither here nor there though cause I don't understand what your point is with testing the waters with Obama.

       The motivation in my mind is to find out just how little the American people will do in protest. This has really nothing to do with him being black it is about having something to question about an individual's ability to represent all qualifications necessary to be president and really getting a ehh... he's still gonna be president. And he was and is. Now here comes the next puppet and its even worse, she is a liar, a really scummy person and we know she lies and we know the scandalous events she is shrouded in. It doesn't matter though because the American people won't even do something to demand answers to questions of legality concerning eligibility of a candidate much less anything moral. Why would I protest vote for bernie?! My biggest concern with politics is lobbying. Trump speaks as if that shit doesn't phase him. So I am curious to see. He has some deep pockets and I am investing my vote into the idea that just maybe... they haven't got to him yet.

       I think you're seeing shadows were there aren't any.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing about what you say about Hillary is wrong and I agree that she shouldn't be President. I don't think Obama is a litmus test for Hillary though. She is popular. She has always been popular to some degree. There's really no mystery to her rise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding "qualifications necessary to be President", Trump should be ringing a lot of alarm bells. The man is so obviously unfit to rule a country its painful to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why Bernie? Because he's been anti-establishment and anti-lobbying since he first set foot in Washington. The man very clearly is what your country needs. He's not a radical like the media would like you to believe. He's a true threat to establishment politics and the only pockets he's beholden to are you, the common people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please look into him and Trunp more from a policy stand point. Trump is a fool who doesn't know what he's talking about. Bernie, at least, has some understanding and is trying to fight against what you claim to despise.

       You're right that he won't be on the ticket and its far too late for me to be trying to change people's minds. Unfortunately.

       I'm not sure what you mean by can't not vote democratic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not American so at the end of the day I don't need to make the decision. I can honestly say I've no idea how I would vote in the coming Trump vs Hillary election. I feel like Lindsay Graham's thoughts when asked about whether he'd support Trump or Cruz are very appropriate for Trump and Hillary too (although I'm going to alter it slightly. "Its like being asked if I want to be shot in the face or slowly and painfully poisoned".
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing for a Trump vote is it might actually spur a revolution. I'm not sure the risks outweigh the potential cons though.
