       Ugh. That's so asinine! I'm a woman. As much as I'd love to see a woman in there I'd much rather see a decent human in there. Which means I certainly can't vote for her. I don't care what gender/race/religion/sexual orientation/favorite fucking color a candidate has if they would just not be terrible and basically fucking evil.

       I totally agree. And half of it really comes down to her hating Trump as well. I mean don't get me wrong, Trump is nowhere near a perfect president, but I do agree with him on a lot of issues as far as taxes and anti TPP even foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the thing about Trump I started to realize is, even if Trump is a wolf in sheeps clothing and is a Clinton operative or whatever, the level of civil unrest in this country is so high that Trump would be tieing the noose around his own neck.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think he is for real and will wipe the floor with the whore, and get her back for screwing Bernie as well, cuz Bern is a good guy.

       I don't understand why issues of race or gender come into play when people vote for someone to represent them in policies. Choose the one that has the program you agree with the most, not the one who looks better than the other.

       I know Im a little late but this has me worked up. Seriously, the average person is so caught up in the material things of society like looks and status that they can't sit and think to process informartion and formulate their own view on a subject. Some material things are great, in moderation. We all love them to some degree, but to envelope our lives in something so meaningless is dangerous, and possibly soon to be deadly.

       Two of them. They want her bc she's a woman.

       EDIT- Should add that I know several life-long Democrats who have said they would vote for Trump before Hillary. Shocked me, but she is pretty rotten. Voting for Hillary is voting for the shadow government, Goldman Sachs, Wall Street, and the CIA.

       I've met a few women yah... I ask them what they like about her and  literally the only responses I've received have been:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I don't know, I just think she is an amazing woman!"
      </p>
      <p>

       Most people around that age that I know and are Clinton supporters, like my brother, only support her because they have some sort of power fetish and think she's a "boss bitch". The thing about wanting to be contrary to their peers also has something to do with it. It's very short sighted and obnoxious

       My husband, but he has a green card and can not vote. He is an immigrant who just knows the popularity of the Clinton legacy. She is a woman. He says Bernie is too old, but he can speak real nice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other ones are older. Voting for her out of fear of the other. They think Bernie is another Nader. They are so used to getting thier progressive values trashed that they've developed a stockholm syndrome and the Clinton name is thier safety blanket - despite her poor judgment and corruption.

       Oh without question, I don't blame the cast or anything just noticed that she seems to be the one who comes out looking most favorable but then that could just be that Kate McKinnon is super likable. Who knows maybe this will be the year the other parties on the ballot receive a second look. Green party, peace and freedom(or something), and libertarians May have a shot.

       Yes. And the cognitive dissonance is strong in them.

       I think there are more than you realize, that won't speak up about it and just change the subject when you talk politics because they're embarrassed about it. I know Trump fans like this, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I must be honest, though, and admit that I know more undecided "This is obviously the end of days" supporters than any other type. (Some of these are the reluctant Trump AKA let the world burn types.) Second place is Sanders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I think the End of Days crowd now understands why I have historically always voted third party.

       I was thinking the same thing a cpl weeks ago. I know of no one supporting her. Barely anyone shows up to her events (and those could be hired crowds) and obviously her online supporters can easily be fake. I know (I think) ppl vote for her but has nowhere near the support she says she has IMO.

       My ex is pro Bernie, but adamant about following Hillary in the event she gets the nomination because she severely hates Republicans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sad to me because she doesn't seem to realize that Clinton is funded by the majority of people Sanders wants to get under control. That and Clinton really isn't much better than Cruz. Sadly, Trump is a better choice than Clinton in my opinion, and that really doesn't take much.

       yes, i met one (gay male, for what it's worth) the other day.  (truth.)

      <p>
       edit/ps.  and i do have a "banker" (straight male, fwiw) friend in NYC that supports hillary.  (so stereotypical, but i am totally serious.)
      </p>
      <p>
       and my mom claims she has a friend (female, fwiw, "from college") who supports hillary.  but... yea, definitely not a common occurrence in my social circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have literally ONE (out of ~500) facebook "friends" that post pro-Hillary crap -- which usually totally avoids major issues, and simply works to associate Hillary with women and girls (which I find rather creepy, to be honest).  It's as if all she has to play is her "woman card", while on nearly every other issue, she is simply atrocious, if not outright criminal (such as
       <strong>
        her absolutely vicious support of the bankers &amp; Netanyahu's apartheid regime
       </strong>
       - ugh, it's truly nauseating if not terrifying).

       Don't really know why tbh. She subscribes to "democrat" for one, and two....idk she hasn't heard of Sanders or doesn't care. Probably just because Hillary is a woman..

       Yes, they like what she has to say and she's a democrat and bernie is a socialist.  That's what they say.  American propaganda is one of the most effective the world has seen.  How people aren't riled up about how she's just throwing corruption in everyones face is beyond me.

       I know and have met many Hillary supporters. They are very quiet about it though. Saying you are a Hillary supporter brings instant attacks, just like being a Trump supporter. Even better was Bush supporters in 2004. You would think they didn't exist, but he won.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only "cool" candidate to support right now is Sanders, so you see his supporters everywhere. We've become a tremendously polarized country. People don't talk about politics IRL if they think something bad is going to happen to them.

       One, a homosexual friend on FB.  Everyone else is either pro-Bernie (hahaha oh those tears the other day, cause I'm in NY) or just anti-Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can understand my friends' position, to an extent.  He has concerns regarding gay rights and gay marriage that Trump has not really addressed (or has made negative comments regarding), and I guess he sees Bernie as too weak to beat Trump, so he's hitching his wagon to the surest bet for the continuation of his lifestyle (a lifestyle I personally believe he is entitled to).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny, though because out of 200+ friends he is the only person posting pro-Hillary stuff every day.

       Only three; all of them young, privileged white women who also voted for Obama both times. Having a black [looking] president was more important than whether or not he was an immigrant, liar, or criminal; now it's more important than anything else to have a woman president.

       One of my good friends is a Hilary supporter, having a discussion with him was.....diffucult. He's a 20 year old in college bear in mind. I brought up so many facts, cover ups, and shady shit she's pulled over the years but he didn't care because Hilary has "experience" and "did good things in the white house during the 90s" and "Sanders wouldn't get anything passed." it was a tough night.

       I actually have met a lot of them, both male and female and both young (under 35) and old (over 60).  In fact I know more Clinton supporters than I do Trump or Bernie supporters.  Its a big country.

       Edit: gotcha!!! I'm actually a Hilary shill trying to make her seem like she has a voter backing when actually she is the latest figure head of the Illuminati which is actually the front facing entity for the crab people that live in the center of the earth but control all the major world powers!! Mwhahahahahahahhaha

       I totally agree. And half of it really comes down to her hating Trump as well. I mean don't get me wrong, Trump is nowhere near a perfect president, but I do agree with him on a lot of issues as far as taxes and anti TPP even foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the thing about Trump I started to realize is, even if Trump is a wolf in sheeps clothing and is a Clinton operative or whatever, the level of civil unrest in this country is so high that Trump would be tieing the noose around his own neck.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think he is for real and will wipe the floor with the whore, and get her back for screwing Bernie as well, cuz Bern is a good guy.

       I don't understand why issues of race or gender come into play when people vote for someone to represent them in policies. Choose the one that has the program you agree with the most, not the one who looks better than the other.
