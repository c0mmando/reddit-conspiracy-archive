    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree. And half of it really comes down to her hating Trump as well. I mean don&#39;t get me wrong, Trump is nowhere near a perfect president, but I do agree with him on a lot of issues as far as taxes and anti TPP even foreign policy.</p>

<p>But the thing about Trump I started to realize is, even if Trump is a wolf in sheeps clothing and is a Clinton operative or whatever, the level of civil unrest in this country is so high that Trump would be tieing the noose around his own neck.</p>

<p>But I think he is for real and will wipe the floor with the whore, and get her back for screwing Bernie as well, cuz Bern is a good guy.</p>

Seriously, the average person is so caught up in the material things of society like looks and status that they can&#39;t sit and think to process informartion and formulate their own view on a subject. Some material things are great, in moderation. We all love them to some degree, but to envelope our lives in something so meaningless is dangerous, and possibly soon to be deadly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. And the cognitive dissonance is strong in them.</p>

<p>I think there are more than you realize, that won&#39;t speak up about it and just change the subject when you talk politics because they&#39;re embarrassed about it. I know Trump fans like this, too.</p>

<p>I must be honest, though, and admit that I know more undecided &quot;This is obviously the end of days&quot; supporters than any other type. (Some of these are the reluctant Trump AKA let the world burn types.) Second place is Sanders.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think the End of Days crowd now understands why I have historically always voted third party.</p>

<p>Sad to me because she doesn&#39;t seem to realize that Clinton is funded by the majority of people Sanders wants to get under control. That and Clinton really isn&#39;t much better than Cruz. Sadly, Trump is a better choice than Clinton in my opinion, and that really doesn&#39;t take much.</p>

<p>edit/ps.  and i do have a &quot;banker&quot; (straight male, fwiw) friend in NYC that supports hillary.  (so stereotypical, but i am totally serious.)</p>

<p>and my mom claims she has a friend (female, fwiw, &quot;from college&quot;) who supports hillary.  but... yea, definitely not a common occurrence in my social circles.  </p>

<p>I have literally ONE (out of ~500) facebook &quot;friends&quot; that post pro-Hillary crap -- which usually totally avoids major issues, and simply works to associate Hillary with women and girls (which I find rather creepy, to be honest).  It&#39;s as if all she has to play is her &quot;woman card&quot;, while on nearly every other issue, she is simply atrocious, if not outright criminal (such as <strong>her absolutely vicious support of the bankers &amp; Netanyahu&#39;s apartheid regime</strong> - ugh, it&#39;s truly nauseating if not terrifying).</p>

<p>/practically no one i know actively / actually supports hillary.</p>

<p>The only &quot;cool&quot; candidate to support right now is Sanders, so you see his supporters everywhere. We&#39;ve become a tremendously polarized country. People don&#39;t talk about politics IRL if they think something bad is going to happen to them.   </p>

<p>I can understand my friends&#39; position, to an extent.  He has concerns regarding gay rights and gay marriage that Trump has not really addressed (or has made negative comments regarding), and I guess he sees Bernie as too weak to beat Trump, so he&#39;s hitching his wagon to the surest bet for the continuation of his lifestyle (a lifestyle I personally believe he is entitled to).  </p>

<p>It&#39;s clear, the people want sanders or trump, but Hillary is gonna win. It&#39;s the sad rigged truth.</p>

<p>Even if the boys did win, they would probably be killed. The VP may be very important.</p>

<p>But the thing about Trump I started to realize is, even if Trump is a wolf in sheeps clothing and is a Clinton operative or whatever, the level of civil unrest in this country is so high that Trump would be tieing the noose around his own neck.</p>
