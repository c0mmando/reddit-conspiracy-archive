<p>Who is “They”?</p>

<p>That is the International Oligarchs, they privately own the Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank Of International Settlements, they happen to be Jews loyal to Israel, and they want to destroy the American/European/Russian People by bankrupting their countries with force, forcing them to default on the debt they owe to them, so they can take that countries real wealth assets like land and resources.</p>

<p>The International Oligarchs intend to damage your country and you, and they got you in the palm of their hand because they got a monopoly on the money supply, they print the money and lend it out with interest to all the countries, and ALL that money gets paid back to them.</p>

<p>We must take this Highest Power On Earth, the power to print/create the money back to Congress, same way President Andrew Jackson did before the Federal Reserve Act signed by Woodrow Wilson in 1913 gave the monopoly on printing/creating and then lending it to governments to a small group of individuals who happen to be Jews.</p>

<p>I feel &#39;Illuminati&#39; is a filler term that makes the shadow of the beast seem larger than the beast itself. Whoever it is that pulls the strings, it is clear that finance is the method of control on such a monstrous scale.</p>

<p>They can be forced to relinquish power but hopefully can be convinced to do so without bloodshed.</p>

<p>What do you mean, That&#39;s where the purge 1.0 came from?&#39;</p>

<p>To OP: Jews may have a disproportionate amount of control relative to their population density; but it&#39;s a disservice to them and ourselves to act as if they have a racial monopoly on control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how you conveniently forget to mention how this actually impacts the African/Arab population. Westerners actually enjoy high living standards along with a select few countries such as Japan. It is the aim of westerners to keep everyone else down. Why do you think they&#39;re ramping up their attacks on the BRICS? Face it guys, it&#39;s in our interest to keep Africa, South America and the Middle East stagnating so we can enjoy our high living standards. Not every country can become a developed one. </p>

<p>In fact, your statement would be true if you added <em>if you want to keep capitalism</em></p>

<p>yes, under current system which only favors the 0.01% by exploiting the lower 99% there is a) too much people in the world and b) not everybody can have nice new iphones</p>

<p>but i claim the earth is big enough and there&#39;s plenty of resource for everybody, not just the 7 billion of us, but 20 billion at least</p>

<p>we just have to be smarter</p>
