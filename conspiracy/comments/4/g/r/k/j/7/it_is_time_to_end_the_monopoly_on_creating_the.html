       All the Geo Engineering Chemtrails, all the damage they intended, all the lies they told, their false flagging 9/11, their current private monopoly on the entire money supply, them being ISIS, them starting all the wars and trying to get a war with Syria and Russia right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is “They”?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the International Oligarchs, they privately own the Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank Of International Settlements, they happen to be Jews loyal to Israel, and they want to destroy the American/European/Russian People by bankrupting their countries with force, forcing them to default on the debt they owe to them, so they can take that countries real wealth assets like land and resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       The International Oligarchs intend to damage your country and you, and they got you in the palm of their hand because they got a monopoly on the money supply, they print the money and lend it out with interest to all the countries, and ALL that money gets paid back to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must take this Highest Power On Earth, the power to print/create the money back to Congress, same way President Andrew Jackson did before the Federal Reserve Act signed by Woodrow Wilson in 1913 gave the monopoly on printing/creating and then lending it to governments to a small group of individuals who happen to be Jews.

       Well said.

       I feel 'Illuminati' is a filler term that makes the shadow of the beast seem larger than the beast itself. Whoever it is that pulls the strings, it is clear that finance is the method of control on such a monstrous scale.

       They can be forced to relinquish power but hopefully can be convinced to do so without bloodshed.

       To OP: Jews may have a disproportionate amount of control relative to their population density; but it's a disservice to them and ourselves to act as if they have a racial monopoly on control.

       Anymore I just view it as synonymous with "Old Money." The individuals and families that are so rich they don't place on the forbes list. Literally the oldest and most powerful tribes of humans to have ever existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes "New Money" gets to play in their games, but it's mostly the old European families (I suspect, at least.)

       The monopoly on the creation of money  is being formed. It's not yet water tight. There's only a couple of independent central banks yet to conquer though. Syria and Iran are the two main holdouts. North Korea is third and the others are much smaller so they'll probably just give in once Syria and Iran have their central banks compromised.

       I like how you conveniently forget to mention how this actually impacts the African/Arab population. Westerners actually enjoy high living standards along with a select few countries such as Japan. It is the aim of westerners to keep everyone else down. Why do you think they're ramping up their attacks on the BRICS? Face it guys, it's in our interest to keep Africa, South America and the Middle East stagnating so we can enjoy our high living standards. Not every country can become a developed one.

       Yep. If everyone on earth enjoyed a western standard of living we would need 5 more earth's to maintain the usage of natural resources.  Which is really sad but I live a western developed standard of living and am not giving it up.

       In fact, your statement would be true if you added

       yes, under current system which only favors the 0.01% by exploiting the lower 99% there is a) too much people in the world and b) not everybody can have nice new iphones

       It's natural resources not money. The co2 output alone would fuck us all up. Poor person in a shack produces very little pollution...now imagine they all live like Americans....all got big cars and fart a lot.

       Bitcoin is not the answer
      </p>
      <p>
       sure you don't support FED but in the end it's just another FIAT currency whose value is determined on the market, just like dollar, who is guranteeing the value of money? noone is
      </p>
      <p>
       and you need a shitload of infrastructure to keep it running (internet), what happens when the revolution starts and internet dries off?

       Bitcoin is limited, if I understand correctly. There will only ever be a finite supply created. Fiat currencies on the other hand...
