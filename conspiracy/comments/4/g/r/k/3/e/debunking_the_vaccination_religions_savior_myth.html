        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anytime there is a debate about vaccinations the very first thing that devout followers of the vaccination religion will argue is that <em>“Vaccines saved us from terrible diseases, and therefore, they are our unquestionable god.”</em> After that, it matters not what your argument is, since gods cannot be questioned. </p>

<p>But did vaccines really save us? The answer is no. If they played any part at all, it was minor, and in fact – they may have actually increased the quantity and severity of outbreaks of diseases by acting as a vector for spreading the disease. This article serves to highlight the historical failure of vaccines, specifically with small pox, and highlight what was the likely reason we were able to defeat this as well as countless other non-vaccinated diseases at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Debunking the Savior myth for Small Pox</strong></p>

<p>The concept of vaccinations was popularized by Edward Jenner, whom was not a doctor, after he heard that milkmaids seemed immune to small pox after getting cow pox. It’s worth noting that <strong>cow pox and small pox are not the same virus, and for the entire 19th century (and much longer in some places) vaccinations did not use actual small pox. Everyone understands flu vaccines have very poor efficacy due to the changing flu virus, vaccinating against one virus does NOT confer immunity against another.</strong></p>

<p><em>In 1796, believing these stories, Edward Jenner subjected an eight-year-old boy named James Phipps to an experiment. He took disease matter that he believed to be cowpox from lesions on the hands of dairymaid Sarah Nelmes and vaccinated James with it. The child was later deliberately exposed to smallpox in order to test the protective property of the cowpox inoculation. When the boy did not contract clinical smallpox, it was assumed that the cowpox vaccination was successful and that it would also provide lifelong protection against smallpox. Immunology was so crude that knowledge of preexisting immunity or sub-clinical infection was not part of Jenner’s experimental design.</em> <strong>Even though his claims were based on a sample of one and no scientific method, it fueled the belief that once a person was exposed to cowpox, lifelong protection from smallpox was possible.</strong></p>

<p>Since the late 1700s, the medical profession has supported vaccination, even though there was never a trial where one group was vaccinated and compared to another group of the same size that was not vaccinated. (Also known as a placebo controlled study)</p>

<p>The standardization and purity of smallpox vaccines was lackluster even after the eradication of smallpox from the United States. Dr. Beddow Bayly’s 1952 statements should leave everyone wondering how such a vaccine could have possibly been responsible for eradication of any disease: </p>

<p><em>&quot;When we recall that vaccine lymph is derived, in the first place, either from a smallpox corpse, the ulcerated udder of a cow, or the running sores of a sick horse’s heels, the choice depending upon the country of its origin and the firm which manufactures it, it is hardly to be wondered at that it has far-reaching ill effects on the human constitution. Years ago, the Lancet declared that “no practitioner knows whether the lymph he employs is derived from smallpox, rabbit-pox, ass-pox, or mule-pox.”</em> [1]</p>

<p><strong>Small Pox vaccination failures</strong></p>

<p><em>The Medical Observer for 1810 contains particulars of 535 cases of small-pox after vaccination, 97 fatal cases, 150 cases of vaccine injuries, with the addresses of ten medical men, including two professors of anatomy, who had suffered in their own families from vaccination.</em> [2]</p>

<p>An article in the 1817 London Medical Repository Monthly Journal and Review stated,</p>

<p><em>”Variola, above all, continues and spreads a devastating contagion. However painful, yet it is a duty we owe to the public and the profession, to apprize them, that the number of all ranks suffering under Small Pox, who have previously undergone Vaccination by the most skilful practitioners, is at present alarmingly great.”</em> [3]</p>

<p>Numerous Journals at the time sang the same tune, </p>

<p><em>”…during the years 1820, 1, and, 2 [1820– 1822] there was a great hubbub about the small-pox. It broke out with the great epidemic to the north… It pressed close to home to Dr. Jenner himself… It attacked many who had had small-pox before, and often severely; almost to death; and of those who had been vaccinated, it left some alone, but fell upon great numbers.”</em> [4]</p>

<p><strong>Mandatory Vaccinations Failed</strong></p>

<p>With more and more evidence mounting against the effectiveness of vaccinations, the early 19th century brought about a lot of people refusing to be vaccinated. To combat this, vaccinations were made mandatory in 1853 in England, with even stricter laws passed in 1867. Boston took the toughest stance in the United States passing comprehensive laws in 1855 which mandated all children be vaccinated before two years of age. </p>

<p>In 1898 Dr. Wilder noted that during the 1871– 1872 pandemic, the vaccinated often contracted severe smallpox more rapidly than the non-vaccinated. </p>

<p><em>”Never, however, did the faith in vaccination receive so rude a shock as in the Great Small-Pox Epidemic of 1871 and 1872. Every country in Europe was invaded with a severity greater than had ever been witnessed during the three preceding centuries.”</em>[5]</p>

<p><strong>Following the 1855 mandates [in Boston], there were smallpox epidemics in 1859– 1860, 1864– 1865, and 1867, culminating with the infamous epidemic in 1872– 1873. These repeat smallpox epidemics showed that the strict vaccination laws [&gt;95% of people vaccinated] instituted by Massachusetts had no beneficial effect.</strong></p>

<p>The failure of vaccinations wasn’t only occurring in Boston,</p>

<p><em>”…Bavaria [Germany] in 1871 of 30,742 cases 29,429 were in vaccinated persons, or 95.7 per cent, and 1313 in the un-vaccinated, or 4.3 per cent. In some of the small local outbreaks of recent years the victims have been nearly all vaccinated (e.g., at Bromley [England] in 1881, a total of 43 cases, including sixteen confluent, all vaccinated).”</em> [6]</p>

<p>The desecration of the vaccinated people in France, Germany, and England was graphically illustrated in a 1900 medical article: </p>

<p><em>”Every recruit that enters the French army is vaccinated. During the Franco-Prussian war there were twenty-three thousand four hundred and sixty-nine cases of small-pox in that army.</em></p>

<p><em>The London Lancet of July 15, 1871, said: Of nine thousand three hundred and ninety-two small-pox patients in London hospitals, six thousand eight hundred and fifty-four had been vaccinated. [73%] Seventeen and one-half per cent of those attacked died.</em></p>

<p><em>In the whole country more than one hundred and twenty-two thousand vaccinated persons have suffered from small-pox…”</em> [7]</p>

<p>These stories continued the world over, with nearly fully vaccinated populations suffering massive epidemics. What’s not often discussed is the fact that the unsanitary methods of vaccination, as while as the nature of the vaccines themselves caused many people to get sick and die from other diseases following vaccination. Erysipelas, gangrene, cow pox, scarlet fever, Streptococcus pyogenes, as well as other diseases were recorded immediately following vaccinations.</p>

<p><strong>From 1906 to 1922, the number of deaths recorded from vaccination and from smallpox were approximately the same. In 1948, there were an estimated 200 to 300 deaths [8]  as the result of smallpox vaccination, while during the same time there had only been 1 smallpox death.</strong> [9]</p>

<p><strong>The Leicester Method Completely Debunks Small Pox Vaccination</strong></p>

<p>Following the rampant failures of mandatory vaccination programs across the world, the city of Leicester, in 1885-1887, decided to completely abandon vaccinations and instead opted for what became known as the Leicester method. The method involved quarantining patients and then thoroughly disinfecting their homes. </p>

<p><em>“Sir Duminie Corrigan, M.D. when acting as one of the committee in 1871, on the Vaccination Act, said: “An unvaccinated child is like a bag of gunpowder which might blow up the whole school, and ought not, therefore to be admitted to a school unless he is vaccinated.”</em> <strong>[Doesn’t this sound familiar?]</strong></p>

<p>The opponents of Leicester were all certain that they would soon be swept away and massacred by an unrivaled small pox outbreak for failing to vaccinate. <strong>The epidemic never came.</strong></p>

<p>In the 1893 smallpox outbreak, the well-vaccinated district of Mold in Flintshire, England, had a death rate about 32 times higher than Leicester.</p>

<p><em>”Leicester, with a population under ten years of age practically unvaccinated, had a small-pox death-rate of 144 per million; whereas Mold, with all the births vaccinated for eighteen years previous to the epidemic, had one of 3,614 per million.”</em> [10]</p>

<p>In the 1891– 1894 smallpox outbreak described by Dr. J. W. Hodge, the highly vaccinated town of Birmingham had 63 smallpox cases and 5 deaths per 10,000 of population, compared with Leicester at 19 cases and 1 death per 10,000.</p>

<p>In 1893, Professor E. M. Crookshank, author of History and Pathology of Vaccination and Professor of Comparative Pathology in King’s College, London, expressed his views on vaccination:</p>

<p><em>”Unfortunately, a belief in the efficacy of vaccination has been so enforced in the education of the medical practitioner that it is hardly probable that the futility of the practice will be generally acknowledged in our generation, though nothing would more redound [contribute] to the credit of the profession and give evidence of the advance in pathology and sanitary science. It is more probable that when, by means of notification and isolation, small-pox is kept under control, vaccination will disappear from practice, and will retain only an historical interest.”</em> [11]</p>

<p>Dr. Millard, who had been the minister of health in Leicester from 1901 to 1935, explained why he believed medical experts of the day were wrong:</p>

<p><em>”At the core was a set of self-reinforcing beliefs in vaccination. Looking back it is interesting to consider why medical experts were so mistaken in their prophecies of disaster to come if universal vaccination of infants was abandoned. It was probably due to the belief, then so strongly held, that it was infant vaccination, and that alone, which had brought about the great diminution of smallpox mortality that followed upon an introduction of vaccination. That this was clearly a case of cause and effect was reiterated in every textbook and in every course of lectures on public health. It was hailed, indeed, as the outstanding triumph of preventative medicine. No wonder that medical students accepted it as an incontrovertible scientific fact.”</em>[12]</p>

<p><strong>Yugoslavia February 16– April 11, 1972</strong> </p>

<p>The WHO was forced to implement a version of the Leicester Method in the latter stages of their smallpox campaigns, when it became plain to them that vaccination didn’t reliably protect. Yugoslavia experienced a smallpox epidemic beginning in February 1972. The index case was a recently vaccinated Yugoslavian haji pilgrim who picked up the disease while traveling through Iraq. He had been vaccinated in December 1971 at a public health clinic. By the time the epidemic was controlled in April of 1972, there were 175 cases and 35 deaths. Of note was that the older portion of the population was highly vaccinated, and the third wave of cases was almost all in people who were previously vaccinated.</p>

<p>The WHO&#39;s own report stated:
&quot;<em>In the age group 20 and over, 92 patients had previously been vaccinated while 21 were unvaccinated. The relatively large number of previously vaccinated cases among those over seven years of age indicates a substantial decrease in post-vaccinal immunity following primary vaccination, as well as a lack of successful revaccination when they were seven and 14 years old.</em>&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<p>The savior myth of vaccination is just that, a myth. Small Pox is touted as the number one success of vaccinations and unfortunately history does not reflect that. Not only did almost complete vaccination of entire towns and cities fail to prevent outbreaks, but it some cases may have actually increased the spread of the disease as well as caused other diseases through contamination and unsanitary practices. </p>

<p>Thankfully for the world, Leicester operated as our placebo controlled study to debunk the Savior Myth of vaccinations. Despite extremely low levels of vaccinations, they experienced fewer and less severe outbreaks than almost fully vaccinated populations, proving beyond any shadow of a doubt, that vaccination was a huge failure. </p>

<p>This post was compiled from an incredible book called <em>“Dissolving Illusions: Disease, Vaccines, and the Forgotten History”</em> and it’s available on Kindle. The book covers living conditions and disease rates spanning three centuries, and follows the path of failure of vaccinations throughout. </p>

<p>What the book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt, is that vaccinations played a minor role if any in the elimination of diseases. Scores of diseases that we never developed vaccinations for used to ravage our nations, and all faced a steep decline from 1850-1950, at the exact same rate as the diseases we did vaccinate for. So what was the cause of this across the board decline? Sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition. </p>

<p>The religion of vaccinations has no leg to stand on, absent the savior myth. Thanks for reading, and if you have even a tiny interest in vaccinations please check out the book, you will not regret it. </p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p>

<p>If vaccines were a product of an industry with a flawless record of purity and good science, I as well as anyone else, would be foolish to question them. Unfortunately, vaccinations are produced by one of the most corrupt industries to ever exist. </p>

<p><strong>Between 2000-2012, the 20 largest criminal and civil fines against pharmaceutical companies amounted to a combined $19.3 BILLION!</strong> [13]</p>

<p>These fines are handed out for what amounts to criminal conspiracy, and absolutely no one goes to jail. The fines, while large to peasants such as ourselves, are just a tiny fraction of profits. This means it is actually cheaper for these firms to act criminally than it is to act responsibly. History is replete with pharmaceutical companies knowingly marketing drugs that they know are dangerous and killing people, as well as, marketing drugs that they know are not effective. </p>

<p><strong>The largest penalty of $3.2 billion dollars was handed out to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which admitted criminal wrong-doing for failing to report drug safety information to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://healthland.time.com/2012/07/05/breaking-down-glaxosmithklines-billion-dollar-wrongdoing/">A Time Magazine article about the GSK fines noted that the fines paled in comparison to the profits:</a></p>

<p><em>&quot;Avandia, for example, racked up $10.4 billion in sales, Paxil brought in $11.6 billion, and Wellbutrin sales were $5.9 billion during the years covered by the settlement, according to IMS Health, a data group that consults for drugmakers.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>“So a $3 billion settlement for half a dozen drugs over 10 years can be rationalized as the cost of doing business,” [Patrick Burns, spokesman for the whistle-blower advocacy group Taxpayers Against Fraud] said.</em></p>

<p><strong>More than 100 drugs that were approved by the FDA as &quot;Safe and Effective&quot; have been recalled. In many cases the companies knew that they were dangerous, especially as in the case of Vioxx.</strong> [14]</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKmxL8VYy0M">Ben Goldacre gave an incredible Ted Talk called &quot;What doctors don&#39;t know about the drugs they prescribe&quot;</a> in which he describes the nature by which negative studies are not published. In this manner, the medical literature appears to show an overwhelming bias towards a drug being safe and effective, because the negative studies don&#39;t get published. This causes doctors to be fooled into a false sense that the drugs they are prescribing have been scientifically proven to be safe and effective, when they may have not been. </p>

<p><a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/pharmagovvenn.jpg">Here&#39;s a graphic showing just part of the &quot;revolving door&quot; that exists between the Pharmaceutical industry, and the Government.</a> These are blatant conflicts of interest, and they&#39;re not isolated. Routinely people go from pharma to the FDA, and the FDA to pharma. It&#39;s not possible for people to serve two masters. It&#39;s a literal case of the fox guarding the hen house. </p>

<p>And lastly, <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100802173713.htm">When published results are systematically tracked for drug trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, those from industry-funded trials are the likeliest to be favorable to the drug in question, report researchers at Children&#39;s Hospital Boston.</a></p>

<p>Pro-vaccine people don&#39;t literally worship the idea like a false idol. We recognize that over a long time that vaccines have been effective at fighting diseases. That&#39;s all. Nobody reasonable would ever make the argument that every single vaccine program was perfectly constructed, 100% effective, or without the potential flaws of any longterm human endeavor  involving thousands of people and millions of moving parts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention that s/he decries Jenner&#39;s original experiment as being unscientific (which is true) and then goes and cherry picks cases that could be seen as failures from during a time that vaccines were very much still in their experimental phase.</p>

<p>This cherry picking of cases and then yelling &quot;but look at what happened in Leicester!&quot; isn&#39;t scientific either. </p>

<p>This is what annoys me about the anti-vax (and a lot of other crowds): their failure to see their own methodological short-commings. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I could equally go off and pick a bunch of cases that show case the efficacy of vaccines in the same manner OP has done to show case their failure. </p>

<p>Honestly, the hyperbole being slung in this thread is like listening to someone try to discredit evolution. The vaccine movement isnt about vaccinating anyone and everyone possible. Its about weighing the pros and cons of viral exposure and targeting demographics that are more likely to contract a viral infection than to fall victim to the incredibly rare side effects of the vaccine.</p>

<p>Should everyone receive a flu vaccine? Hell no. Not unless they are in specific danger from a flu infection. Should everyone be vaccinated for universally deadly diseases like small pox and measles? Of course.</p>

<p>Its not as white and black as most anti-vaxxers make it out to be. Lots of grey area, and still lots to learn, but it&#39;s been proven effective time and time again. Shortcomings caused by human error or lack of foresight should not entirely discredit such a useful tool.</p>

<p>If you want to argue the ethics involved, and whether or not the pharmaceutical industry is cutting corners to increase profits, I&#39;m with you. But to say vaccines flat out don&#39;t work is painfully ignorant.</p>

<p>Statements like this are typical of the ignorance in regards to both the safety and efficacy of vaccinations. Small pox and measles are NOT universally deadly diseases. As this post highlights, vaccinations did not stop small pox. Measles, is NOT a deadly disease in the modern world where adequate nutrition is present. </p>

<p>Throughout the 1800s, measles epidemics occurred about every two years in the United States and England. During these epidemics, some hospital wards overflowed with children, up to 20 percent of whom died. However, by the 1960s, the deaths had dropped to extremely low numbers in both England and the United States. In England, the percent decline from its peak level reached an astonishing 99.96 percent by the time the vaccine was introduced in 1968. </p>

<p><em>Before the general nutrition status of European children reached the high level it is today, measles infection was something to be feared… measles accounted for 11% of all deaths in Glasgow in the years 1807-1812. Case fatality rates were high. For example, during the years 1867-1872 in a Paris orphanage, the Hospice des Enfants Assistés, 612 of the 1256 (49%) children who developed measles died… During the last century, the burden of measles had dropped remarkably in Europe. In Glasgow, 14.2% of children younger than 5 years of age contracted measles in 1908 and had a mortality rate of 5.8%. Even in the absence of a vaccine, by 1960, notification of childhood measles in England and Wales was only 2.4% and mortality fell to 0.030%, which is 1/ 200th of the 1908 Glasgow mortality rate.</em> [1]</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/aONgbz0">Graph showing measles mortality drop in England prior to vaccinations</a></p>

<p><strong>In England and in the United States, the chance of dying from measles had dropped to 1– 2 percent by the 1930s.</strong> [2]</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/6yFFJlz">Graph showing decline of numerous diseases through 1960</a></p>

<p>The official 1960 number of deaths from measles in the United States was recorded as 380, with the population during that year at 180,671,000. This equaled a mortality rate for measles of 0.24 per 100,000. Statistics from 1963 show that, relative to many other causes of death, measles was extremely low. By the year of the New York Times report [1960], the US measles death rate had plummeted by more than 98 percent from that peak.[3]</p>

<p>In 1963 some New England states had no deaths at all from measles. During this year, the whole of New England had only 5 deaths attributed to measles. Deaths from asthma were 56 times greater, accidents 935 times greater, motor vehicle accidents 323 times greater, other accidents 612 times greater, and heart disease 9,560 times greater. </p>

<p><strong>Hence, it&#39;s laughable at best when I hear people say &quot;Should everyone be vaccinated for universally deadly diseases like small pox and measles?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I could go on about how the vaccines that were introduced were dangerous, hurt people, were not effective, and how atypical measles (when vaccinated people got measles) was extremely deadly, but there&#39;s no need. The savior myth, is just a myth. </p>

 If vaccines are that safe how come big Pharma is protecting themselves from their safe vaccines prosecution?  They go to secret settlement courts so people will never find out exactly how safe the shit they gave their baby is. The government doesn&#39;t give a fuck about your safety either that&#39;s why they allow secret corporate hearings. Some vaccines may work.

<p>There are religious opt-out laws. As well, it&#39;s only a requirement that children receive vaccines in order to attend public schools. You are welcome to homeschool your children, in which case the government has no authority to force vaccination.</p>

<p>Speaking of consent, when you refuse to vaccinate your children, you&#39;re exposing others&#39; children to dangerous, infectious diseases without their consent. Why is your consent more valuable than theirs? No one is forcing you to vaccinate, they&#39;re only forcing you to vaccinate to access the services provided for your benefit at no cost to you.

<p>That&#39;s really not much of a reach. Some people are literally deathly allergic to latex. Still, I acknowledged the weakness of the comparison. Condoms will have mild side effects, if any. I would not accept serious side effects. But the potential consequences from failure to use condoms are also relatively mild. The consequences for falling to vaccinate are severe: I&#39;m willing to accept more severe side affects from vaccines. </p>

<p>From OP&#39;s own plagiarized source, the common practice before the cowpox vaccine was to <em>give you smallpox and hope you don&#39;t die</em>, because that was a better alternative than catching it during a bad outbreak.</p>

<p>One of the greatest fallacy of the antivax ideology is the belief that autism is the worst thing that can happen to a person. It isn&#39;t, by a wide margin. Even if vaccines had a small chance of causing autism, any rational person would still see that as better odds than dealing with measles and the potential problems associated with it, like blindness, deafness, developmental delays (so you know, exactly the same thing vaccines are claimed to cause), and <em>death</em>.</p>

<p>Luckily, vaccines don&#39;t increase your risk of autism. Which makes the argument that much more pointless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But in practice, people literally do worship vaccines that&#39;s why it&#39;s impossible to have any rational debate about them on Reddit. Any harm that people admit to is said to be acceptable because vaccines saved us, and continue to save us and that&#39;s false.</p>

<p>Second, as this post highlights vaccines did not save us from Small Pox. And the rest of the vaccines we still use for the most part, weren&#39;t even deployed until the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s after the lethality of the diseases at plummeted more than 90%.</p>

<p>So to &quot;recognize that over a long time that vaccines have been effective at fighting disease&quot; just demonstrates that you don&#39;t understand these basic facts in regard to vaccinations and what they have, and have not accomplished.</p>

<p>It&#39;s religious fervor because vaccination proponents are unable to understand (or admit) that other factors played a larger role in the demise of disease, namely, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition. Those 3 things were able to wiped out 90-98% of disease over a century prior to vaccinations, but as soon as we deploy a vaccination we hear &quot;Oh yay, the vaccine saved us.&quot;</p>

<p>To sit and pretend that it&#39;s a strawman to highlight the fact that the savior myth is used to justify mass vaccination is preposterous. That&#39;s exactly what happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, what you say about sanitation and nutrition is correct. So what?</p>

<p>What is missing from your arguments, and that of all anti-vaxxers, is demonstration that the rate of serious vaccine injury is anything other than miniscule.

<p>You keep naging on about &quot;the saviour myth&quot;....isn&#39;t it more honest to admit that both vaccination and improved living conditions toppled the scourges of infectious diseases. And that continuing vaccination programs is a worthwhile and low risk measure to stop things like measles and pertussis coming back, and maybe killing a few kids?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to give explaining why the much larger number of vaccines given early is not actually the kind of concern one might very intuitively think it is a shot, and that will unfortunately take a somewhat embarrassing amount of text and some background in how the adaptive human immune system works as well as what its challenges are. I hope you&#39;ll indulge me in following along because I&#39;d like to hear what you think.</p>

<p>Our adaptive immune systems work in a really beautiful way that should, in theory, protect us from an infinite number of potential pathogens but has a few significant drawbacks. As the white blood cells that drive the adaptive immune response get made they each are born with a completely new antibody through a very randomized process that creates a very specific and very random molecular shape on the business end of the antibody that could, in theory, bind to anything. <sup>1</sup> These antibodies are how our bodies recognize foreign invaders that have evolved some means of evading our innate immune systems, and in generally there are enough white blood cells running around our bodies that one of them will have an antibody that will be effective against functionally anything. One white blood cell though is not enough to meaningfully fight off an infection, and so whenever a mature white blood cell encounters something that triggers its antibody it immediately races back to a lymph node and starts dividing like crazy to make enough cells to eliminate the infection. Then, once the infection is cleared, almost all of the new clones of the white blood cell with the effective antibody will trigger themselves for death to make room for new white blood cells. One of the big draw backs to the fantastically complex process of the adaptive immune system is how long it takes to get going, needing cells to divide so much is a significant rate limiter, so a significant portion of them will change in such a way as to protect themselves from degradation and remain as a reservoir of memory cells waiting in case the infection ever comes back such that the process has a big head start the second time. This is the most common reason why when people get sick with infections they then get better, as well as why people don&#39;t tend to get sick from the same thing twice.</p>

<p>I can sort of see the logic in assuming that this process is all pretty stressful, and that maybe young children would have a hard time dealing with it, but you&#39;ve got to understand that the moment that the child leaves the sterile uterus their immune system is suddenly surrounded by the functionally infinite number of antigens present on the 100 trillion bacteria found in the human gut and on human skin. The infant immune system is amazingly robust, the how of it all is truly beautiful if you&#39;ve got the stomach for learning all of the four letter acronyms you&#39;ve got to memorize to understand what we know of it, and the effort required for it to learn from the 14 vaccines delivered in 26 doses as infants is absolutely piddlyshit compared to the stress from learning the contents of a single sneeze. Just the exposure from the act of birth so dramatically dwarfs the full compliment of vaccines we would need to borrow metaphors from astronomy to compare the two. At the same time the benefits are amazing, instead of having to learn from a thing that is trying to kill it, the infant immune system gets to learn from target practice on something that is dead in the water or better yet a inert piece that happens to be the weak spot for the whole damn thing. </p>

<p>Whenever a baby is exposed to a new antigen, or a molecular shape that can be recognized by an antibody, it can go through the whole process I described above and the sheer amount of exposures that babies just handle like champs is truly astounding. How much stress each exposure to something new causes is entirely dependent on factors that we know very well and can manipulate easily in vaccines. For example, when your innate immune system sees one of a small set of very specific patterns embedded into our DNA that are associated only with pathogens in combination with something new, our immune system goes into overdrive, which can sometimes be dangerous. So, even though I could use these patterns in my lab to vaccinate rabbits for research purposes, no one would ever think to use them in human vaccines despite the fact that using them would make vaccines incredibly cheap and effective. Especially with infant vaccines, they are formulated to cause such a trivial amount of stress that the vast majority of babies notice nothing beyond the prick. The idea is just to make sure that the hundred or so most important antigens to have antibodies pre-made against are a part of the trillions and trillions that go through their systems on a daily basis. It is important to understand that vaccines are made from viruses and bacteria found in nature, and the process they go through in children is identical to the natural one in every important way except for the amount of control we are able to exercise over it to ensure safety and efficacy. They are generally made by killing the thing with heat leaving its corpse as a book the body can read and learn from, or growing the thing at lower and lower temperatures until it can&#39;t replicate effectively in you anymore allowing the body to learn from real but harmless infections, or in more advanced vaccines by providing only what we already understand to be the weak spot of the thing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><sup>1</sup> One of the big problems with that strategy though is what happens when the antibody recognizes something that is actually us or for what ever reason actually belongs in us and shouldn&#39;t be attacked. Our bodies deal with this by immediately killing all of the white blood cells that are born with an antibody that recognizes a target within the first few weeks of being created, the idea is that if it sees something that quickly its probably something that should be there. Auto-immune disorders are what happens when this system fails for a variety of reasons and our immune cells start attacking things that are us.</p>

<p>Sorry that you did not have access to adequate education to get you out of conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>You are on a conspiracy subreddit m8. You come here and expect people not to believe in conspiracies? :).</p>

<p>Edit: I recommend you check out this reply by one of the authors of the book &quot;Dissolving Illusions&quot; (a chapter of which OP analysed), addressing a critical comment by one of the readers. It thoroughly answers the points that you mention. <a href="http://drsuzanne.net/2015/10/why-dr-suzanne-humphries-an-anti-vaccine-activist-is-lying-to-you-about-measles/">Link</a>.</p>

<p>The most likely reasons for the difference in the number of deaths between UN and non UN members, is nutrition and sanitation, not vaccination. For example, encephalitis as a consequence of measles only appears in vitamin A deficient. Check out the authors reply, it&#39;s a great read with solid sources.</p>

<p>To answer your original question, the sources are old because they point to old statistics and publications of the time. One of the reasons for that, is because obviously that&#39;s when the statistics were gathered and published. Or links to documentation of old events. It&#39;s a link to original sources. And another reason is to address the point that disease rate declined as a direct result of vaccination. It has not. It has likely declined mostly due to better nutrition, hygiene, improvements in water treatment, waste disposal etc. </p>

<p>Edit2: Also, it&#39;s a well documented fact that vaccines often cause the very disease people are vaccinated against, or the vaccinated person gets infected anyway (the official spin on this fact is that vaccines cause it in a milder thаn the wild form). But since the vaccines were introduced, vaccinated people that got the disease were omitted from the statistics. So if we look at the statistics, the incidence appears to have decreased, but it hasn&#39;t necessarily - the amount of documented cases has decreased. The article that I linked explains it in detail. Cheers. </p>

<p>Correlation does not equal causation, they actually started giving out Vitamin A tablets during Measles outbreaks in the Third World, that would be a far more likely reason to the decrease.

<p>i agree with your conclusion, but feel the need to touch on this, because the correlation between vit A and decrease of disease is the <em>actual</em> correlation once we look at it more closely.</p>

<p><em>appearance of</em> correlation does imply causation, and from there, we examine until we can confirm actual correlation. </p>

<p><a href="https://vactruth.com/2013/11/26/vaccine-associated-polio/">https://vactruth.com/2013/11/26/vaccine-associated-polio/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis can occur both among immunologically normal OPV recipients and their contacts and among persons who are immunodeficient. In addition, vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) can emerge to cause polio outbreaks in areas with low OPV coverage and can replicate for years in persons who are immunodeficient.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Translation sentence one: Our vaccine can cause paralysis in a few people, oh and the people around them including hemophiliacs and hiv infected people who go near them.  Basically we created in a few instances, a bioweaponized polioparalyzed child.  There&#39;s a word for this: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis">iatrogenic medicine</a></em></p>

<p>Translation sentence two:  our vaccines may protect the vaccinated, but those vaccinated still host infectious polio that affected those who weren&#39;t vaccinated, giving a false sense of security in the abject failure int his case of the herd immunity hypothesis, one of the &#39;clearly false promises of vaccination&#39;.  So better get your vaccines or else (even though they don&#39;t work correctly and you may be paralyzed or cause others to be)!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many lapses in logic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Following the 1855 mandates [in Boston], there were smallpox epidemics in 1859– 1860, 1864– 1865, and 1867, culminating with the infamous epidemic in 1872– 1873. These repeat smallpox epidemics showed that the strict vaccination laws [&gt;95% of people vaccinated] instituted by Massachusetts had no beneficial effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How so? How can anyone be sure the outbreaks may have been much much worse without vaccination?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”…Bavaria [Germany] in 1871 of 30,742 cases 29,429 were in vaccinated persons, or 95.7 per cent, and 1313 in the un-vaccinated, or 4.3 per cent. In some of the small local outbreaks of recent years the victims have been nearly all vaccinated (e.g., at Bromley [England] in 1881, a total of 43 cases, including sixteen confluent, all vaccinated).”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These statements are meaningless and prove nothing. If the vaccination rate in Bavaria approached 100%, this statistic may very well show the infection rate being higher in the unvaccinated population. Do the math: assume the epidemic infects 10% of the population and the vaccination rate in Bavaria was 99%, then these figures show that you would be <strong>four times</strong> more likely to get smallpox if you were unvaccinated (0.04% vs 0.01% ). You can&#39;t tell anything from these statistics without being told the vaccination and infection rate. Same applies to the Bromley outbreak. If almost all the population is vaccinated, then of course most or all cases will be vaccinated, as they make up the vast majority of the population. </p>

<p>All you can tell from these stats is that the smallpox vaccine was not 100% effective, which again is well established with all vaccination. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 1893 smallpox outbreak, the well-vaccinated district of Mold in Flintshire, England, had a death rate about 32 times higher than Leicester.
”Leicester, with a population under ten years of age practically unvaccinated, had a small-pox death-rate of 144 per million; whereas Mold, with all the births vaccinated for eighteen years previous to the epidemic, had one of 3,614 per million.” [10]
In the 1891– 1894 smallpox outbreak described by Dr. J. W. Hodge, the highly vaccinated town of Birmingham had 63 smallpox cases and 5 deaths per 10,000 of population, compared with Leicester at 19 cases and 1 death per 10,000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, so? Leicester is not a true control. A control has only one variable different to the experimental arm. What is the population of these other districts? Population density? Comparable measures of poverty? Distance from London? You are not necessarily comparing like with like. </p>

<p>That sanitation and nutrition has played a role in reducing infectious disease is beyond question, as is that vaccine efficacy is not 100%. But Leicester is not &quot;proof&quot; of anything, except that public health measures are a good thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just going to copy/paste my response to the ELI5 thread about this post:</p>

<p>So most of it is actually factually correct, as far as I&#39;m aware.  However, the conclusion he&#39;s drawing from them is not.</p>

<p>For instance, he states early on that cowpox is not the same virus as smallpox, then acts like it&#39;s a great discovery that cowpox might not be universally effective against smallpox.  Shouldn&#39;t that already be an easy conclusion to draw?  Similarly, he points out that the flu vaccine doesn&#39;t always work depending on which flu virus you&#39;re exposed to (incidentally, the yearly flu shot is a combination of three viruses - the ones pathologists believe will be the most common in the coming season.  They&#39;re <em>usually</em> pretty good about predicting it, but not perfect.  Hence, last season was pretty bad, as an unexpected strain of flu that wasn&#39;t included in the vaccine popped up).  None of that should be particularly surprising to anyone.  It&#39;s also more or less irrelevant to modern medicine.  <em>Of course</em> using the wrong virus won&#39;t guarantee immunity.  Using the <em>right</em> virus doesn&#39;t guarantee immunity!  Still, Jenner&#39;s work wasn&#39;t about perfecting a vaccine, it was about laying the foundation that one can create immunity to a virus without contracting the disease itself.  Before his work, the common practice was to expose your family to smallpox <em>and hope they don&#39;t die</em> and then move on with your life knowing you couldn&#39;t get smallpox again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Small Pox is touted as the number one success of vaccinations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and no.  It&#39;s not Number One, gold medalist of vaccines; it&#39;s number one, <em>the first one</em>.  The <a href="http://cx.aos.ask.com/question/aq/700px-394px/fast-did-first-car_6fedf4cc56bc1ac9.jpg">first car</a> wasn&#39;t particularly good (we have much better, faster, safer, more comfortable cars now).  The <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/First_flight2.jpg">first plane</a> wasn&#39;t very good, either (woo, a few hundred feet <em>at best</em> and 10ft in the air...).  Should we expect the first vaccine to be flawless?  Of course not.  That wasn&#39;t the point, the point was <em>it worked at all</em>.</p>

<p>This, it seems, isn&#39;t something that post denies: exposure to a disease <em>does</em> give you immunity.  And exposure to cowpox did, in fact, prevent a great number of people from dying to smallpox.  Since then we&#39;ve made our vaccines safer by injecting dead or dying viruses of the same disease we&#39;re trying to immunize you against.  That makes them far more effective.  Still, not everyone gets immunity.  Sometimes your body simply doesn&#39;t keep the appropriate antigens created by the vaccine.  Some people <em>can&#39;t</em> get the vaccine because their immune systems are already compromised (chemotherapy is a big cause) and even a dying virus would get them sick.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t actually care enough to dig into it, but I strongly suspect he&#39;s conflating the numbers of cases of smallpox because of the &quot;smallpox vaccine&quot; and the numbers caused by the <em>cowpox</em> vaccine.  Remember, it was common practice to vaccinate people with <em>live, active, dangerous smallpox</em>.  For example, this passage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1836 in Attenborough, Massachusetts, Dr. John C. Martin took fluid from the pock of a man who died from smallpox and inoculated it onto a cow’s udder. He then took pus from that cow and used it to vaccinate people. A large smallpox epidemic ensued causing panic and sickness in many people over the subsequent months. <a href="http://www.vaccinationcouncil.org/2013/08/27/vaccination-a-mythical-history-by-roman-bystrianyk-and-suzanne-humphries-md/"><sup>Source</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(And that&#39;s an <em>anti-vax</em> source!)  There was a lot of confusion at the time about how the vaccine actually worked, why cowpox might (or might not) protect against smallpox, where cowpox and smallpox actually came from, etc.  That&#39;s really what this comes down to.  If you look at his sources, few of them are from after 1900, and those that are just analyze the same old data as anti-vax confirmation.  That post itself acknowledges the confusion of the era <em>using sources from that era</em> and then tries to claim that those sources should be taken at face value.  Essentially: &quot;Look how unscientific they were in the late 1800s according to these sources!  Now listen to all the totally valuable and scientifically accurate data pulled from those same sources!&quot;</p>

<p>If you really want to understand vaccines and their efficacy, you need to look at updated sources.  Medicine is, ultimately, a branch of science, and old science is outdated science.</p>

<p>Oh really? The <em>truth</em> is, thanks to the vaccines, that is <em>not</em> always the case:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to the measles vaccine, two shots are better than one. Most people in the United States are initially vaccinated against the virus shortly after their first birthday and return for a booster shot as a toddler. Less than 1% of people who get both shots will contract the potentially lethal skin and respiratory infection. And even if a fully vaccinated person does become infected—a rare situation known as “vaccine failure”—they weren’t thought to be contagious.</p>

<p>That’s why <strong>a fully vaccinated 22-year-old theater employee in New York City who developed the measles in 2011 was released without hospitalization or quarantine.</strong> But like Typhoid Mary, this patient turned out to be unwittingly contagious. <strong>Ultimately, she transmitted the measles to four other people</strong>, according to a recent report in Clinical Infectious Diseases that tracked symptoms in the 88 people with whom “Measles Mary” interacted while she was sick. Surprisingly, two of the secondary patients had been fully vaccinated. And although the other two had no record of receiving the vaccine, they both showed signs of previous measles exposure that should have conferred immunity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/04/measles-outbreak-traced-fully-vaccinated-patient-first-time">http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/04/measles-outbreak-traced-fully-vaccinated-patient-first-time</a></p>

<p>Because doctors believed the bullshit about the efficacy of the measles vaccine, they let a contagious person walk out of the hospital and infect four other people - including two other fully vaccinated people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That no vaccine gives 100% immunity, or lifetime protection, is long understood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now <em>that</em> is pure bullshit. That is the very purpose of vaccination. The fact the vaccines fail is actually a relatively <em>new</em> admission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I am trained in statistics. If you were, you might understand that it is possible to get statistical significance with a small sample size. It entirely depends on the event rate.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I admit the study I posted (the Nigerian one) was pretty poor quality. Here is a better one, looking at global infant mortality rates comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated populations from multiple countries, across decades, AND controlling for socioeconomic factors:</p>

<p><a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mcgovern/files/mcgovern_vaccination_0.pdf">http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mcgovern/files/mcgovern_vaccination_0.pdf</a></p>

<p><strong>24% reduction in infant death</strong>. Effect most strongly seen with measles and maternal tetanus. I agree the Guinea data on DPT is intriguing and warrants further study. Does it have a negative non-specific immune effect? A question worth answering, although the data does come from old vaccines from the 1980s.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s the thing: you are suffering from <strong>cognitive bias</strong>. Your mind is already made up, and you are closed to any evidence that contradicts your views. Hence, you will happily quote studies about vaccines bring associated with increased mortality or other adverse health effects, but will instantly dismiss similar observational studies with identical methodology as being flawed. This is called cherrypicking. Do you want to see some studies about measles improving infant mortality above what can be expected from stopping measles alone? (That sppears to be an immune stimulating effect, you know, like all those nebulous &quot;natural&quot; unproven effects that vitamins and apple cider vinegar are supposed to have, except with measles vaccine it has actually has evidence.) Or of vaccination decreasing asthma rates?</p>

<p>No, because your mind is already made up.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoyed you employing the old <strong>shifting goalposts</strong> trick.....arguing against mortality data at age 5, asking what if they all died of leukaemia at 18? And if I gave you data to 18? You would&#39;ve said: what about 35? You cannot be satisfied by any data contrary to what you believe in because your mind is already made up. It&#39;s all a Big Pharma conspiracy.</p>

<p>Vaccines are a complex issue. If you are not going to approach the conversation with scepticism and a use of the scientific method, then what&#39;s the point? You say DPT is toxic and should be out? Ok ....some of the data points to negative effects, and maybe we need a discussion on this. But I&#39;ve seen your posts: you&#39;re against ALL vaccines, and seem happy to dismiss the mountains of data FOR measles vaccine, HPV vaccine, HiB vaccine, etc</p>

<p>You can&#39;t have your cake and eat it. Stop pretending to be approaching this logically; you&#39;re coming from a place of emotion, not reason.</p>

<p>So a system of early identification of infectious contacts, and their isolation and quarantine, works at halting the spread of an infectious disease? Well, colour me surprised.

</blockquote>

<p>Very astute observation. So to really boil it right down, follow me here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Mass vaccinations throughout the 19th century failed to prevent outbreaks, failed to protect the vaccinated, and even caused the spread of disease themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>One town decides after watching this failure to stop vaccinating and <em>miraculously</em> they experience fewer and less severe outbreaks than fully vaccinated towns. And <em>miraculously</em> they conquer small pox before 1910, without the use of vaccinations, which if we believe vaccines saved us, would be an impossibility. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The logic here is that: Un-vaccinated people actually did better than vaccinated people. Therefore, to make the claim that &quot;vaccines saved us from small pox&quot; is completely fallacious, and not based in reality. It&#39;s the savior myth passed down generation by generation based on nothing just like every other religious savior. </p>

<p>Small Pox, just like every single other disease the majority of which we never developed vaccinations for, all declined more than 90% from 1850-1950, paralleling sanitation, hygiene and improved nutrition. </p>

<p>I have absolutely no doubt, that if there was never one single vaccination ever produced, we would not have any more diseases than we do today. We&#39;ve crowned the wrong savior, and in doing so, we&#39;ve become blinded to the absolutely REAL, proven damage that vaccines inflict on people every single day across this planet.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s all done in the name of the &quot;Greater Good&quot;, because vaccines are our savior. But they&#39;re not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, you&#39;re using variolation as a strawman. It was the prototype. Modern vaccines are far more efficacious, much safer, and their mechanisms better understood. Comparing modern vaccines to the first smallpox vaccine is like judging aviation by the Orville brothers.</p>

<p>Secondly, Leicester, while definitely benefiting from its public health  policy, also likely benefited from <em>herd immunity</em> as incidence fell in vaccinated communities. You cannot use it as a &quot;control group&quot;. Much of its population <em>was</em> previously vaccinated, while other towns likely had their own public health measures in place. What are you comparing with what? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I cannot, because this study which should have been done, hasn&#39;t been done. The only case we have, which I mention in the post is Leicester, which abandoned vaccinations acting as a placebo control group versus the rest of the vaccinating world. The results speak for themselves, less frequent and severe outbreaks, and they eliminated small pox completely before 1910, while many places in the world had small pox well into the 20th century despite mass vaccinations. </p>

<p>While most people naively want to believe that &quot;vaccines do no harm&quot; it&#39;s well documented that in some people they do very, very serious harm. Further, we are facing an explosion of childhood diseases from ADHD, Allergies, Asthma, autoimmune conditions, Inflammatory diseases, gut disorders, and myriad of other maladies that as of now have no definitively known causes, but we should be at least looking at the role of vaccinations. </p>

<p>Vaccines are made from viruses, DNA, RNA, heavy metals (aluminum, mercury), other adjuvants, chemicals like polysorbate80, aborted fetal tissues, as well as animal byproducts. We can argue the amounts are &quot;tiny&quot; but there&#39;s literally no safe level of mercury, it&#39;s a potent neurotoxin and when injected into a newborn it can pass the blood brain barrier. </p>

<p>We then inject this concoction into newborn babies that do not have a functioning immune system, in order to &quot;train&quot; this non-functioning immune system, in and of itself, and incredible failure of logic. </p>

<p>The human immune system is not designed for injections, this bypasses more than half of our natural immune system that resides in our gut. Our guts are home to the majority of our immune system because nearly all pathogens enter the body through it. </p>

<p>Now our problem is that people ignorantly believe that the &quot;good&quot; of vaccines, outweighs the potential &quot;bad&quot; of vaccines because..... &quot;Vaccines saved us, and continue to save us from diseases&quot; .... But I do not believe that for a second. </p>

<p>What we need is an honest evaluation of the vaccination schedule, and truly independent studies to be conducted on the safety and efficacy of vaccinations. We can&#39;t leave it to an industry that has been caught over an over again (and fined 10&#39;s of billions) manipulating studies, marketing lethal drugs, and corrupting science. </p>

<p>The problem is that Government has mandated vaccinations, and if they were to admit that they were causing more harm and not as effective as we believe, it would create a legal nightmare and shit storm with the people of the world. Therefore its expedient to just continue the status quo, never truly investigate, and allow newborns to be damaged by vaccines that are not always safe, and likely not very effective. </p>

<p>Keep in mind here, ALL communicable diseases whether vaccinated or not plummeted by more than 90% (some 98%) by the 1950&#39;s, before many vaccines even existed. So to argue they saved us is ridiculous when &gt;90% of the job was already done. </p>

<p>Furthermore, just because a child gets a measles vaccine for example, and then doesn&#39;t get measles is not proof of the success of the vaccine. All of these diseases were wiped out by sanitation, hygiene and nutrition, and that&#39;s why all over the third world diseases still run rampant. </p>

I hope it&#39;s just that he hadn&#39;t looked into them before, otherwise I would suspect he&#39;s controlled opposition</p>

<p>Congratulations, your kids are now at risk for developing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingles">shingles</a> as adults. Fortunately there&#39;s a vaccine for that as well. Which they can decide for themselves to take.</p>

<p>big pharma is &#39;regulated&#39; by fear of lawsuits, investor revolt, an reputational damage caused by &#39;bad drugs&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol. Pharmaceutical companies are legally immune to lawsuits from vaccine damage in the US. Indoctrination is so strong for how perfect vaccines are that any reputation damage caused by bad drugs will do almost nothing. For example, look to the HPV vaccine Gardasil. There are few things more dangerous and less helpful a doctor can do to you.</p>

<p>And investors will never revolt from something with such a cushy setup and revenue model. Pretty soon buying their product will be mandatory! An investor&#39;s dream!</p>

<p>The problem is that Dr Humphries is so fervent in her belief that vaccines are evil that it ultimately “blinds” her, and leads her to become clumsy in her interpretation of studies, which in turn hurts her credibility. The more you delve into her work and consult her sources, the more you will find her guilty of:</p>

<p>Cherry-picking isolated statements from a range of studies that support her views but completely ignoring qualifying statements made by those authors and overall conclusions drawn in those studies.</p>

<p>Aiming to confuse readers by quoting 30-year-old studies on the failures of the 1963 inactivated measles vaccine (and serum gamma globulin as a form of treatment) numerous times throughout the chapter, even though both are no longer in use.</p>

<p>Ignoring data on counter studies and third world countries that are inconvenient to her claims.</p>

<p>Stripping numerous quotes off their context as an intentional means to mislead and deceive.</p>

<p>Anytime there is a debate about vaccinations the very first thing that devout followers of the vaccination religion will argue is that “Vaccines saved us from terrible diseases, and therefore, they are our unquestionable god.” After that, it matters not what your argument is, since gods cannot be questioned.
But did vaccines really save us? The answer is no. If they played any part at all, it was minor, and in fact – they may have actually increased the quantity and severity of outbreaks of diseases by acting as a vector for spreading the disease. This article serves to highlight the historical failure of vaccines, specifically with small pox, and highlight what was the likely reason we were able to defeat this as well as countless other non-vaccinated diseases at the same time.</p>

<p>How old are you OP? Were you born in the 40&#39;s or 50&#39;s or even 60&#39;s?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using Leicester as proof really bothers me. Especially when in the opening paragraph OP decries the unscientific nature of Jenner&#39;s original experiment. </p>

<p>None of this post is scientific. Whether OP knows this and just has an agenda or is incapable of reflecting on their own Methodological short-commings, I&#39;m not sure, but let&#39;s not hail them as a purveyor of truth. </p>

<p>Hell, the tone set by claiming that people who are pro-vaccine worship vaccinations as if they were gods really shows how unwilling OP is to be neutral and view the actual facts through an open-minded lens. </p>

<p>I&#39;m really not sure if I should consider this satire, willful ignorance it just plain stupidity on behalf of OP. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, which is why MMR vaccines no longer contain thimerosal or mercury, and in fact very few vaccines do, only those designed for use with adults. </p>

<p>If you like, look at seatbelts as the analogy instead. A few people survive car wrecks because they <em>weren&#39;t</em> wearing a seatbelt and got thrown clear of a burning car. Does that mean we should all stop wearing seatbelts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When ever people argue with me about vaccine safety and effectiveness, I tell them to go and sign up for every vaccine trial by big pharma, and before you inject your new born child, take all 30 vaccines required for babies 2 years before your baby. 
Every horrible disease from HIV, Polio and hepatitis have been &quot; accidentally&quot; spread through vaccines infecting millions. Big pharma doesn&#39;t give a fuck about you or your baby. They get immunity from being prosecuted already. It&#39;s dumb fuck average joes who believe they are 99% safe
 If vaccines are that safe how come big Pharma is protecting themselves from their safe vaccines prosecution?  They go to secret settlement courts so people will never find out exactly how safe the shit they gave their baby is. The government doesn&#39;t give a fuck about your safety either that&#39;s why they allow secret corporate hearings. Some vaccines may work. But most are dangerous and unnecessary, but make money for Merck and others. I will never trust my child&#39;s life to some fucking money making vaccine scheme. We should all know better. The information is all out there. We live in a sinister fucked up world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called thiomerosal, and it <em>is</em> actually organic mercury. It&#39;s  ethylmercury and is easily excreted from the body, in contrast to the far more toxic methylmercury which accumulates in tissues. Totally different things. In the tiny doses used it was perfectly safe but has now been removed from almost every vaccine because of ignoramuses with a sketchy grasp on even basic science kicking up a stink.</p>
