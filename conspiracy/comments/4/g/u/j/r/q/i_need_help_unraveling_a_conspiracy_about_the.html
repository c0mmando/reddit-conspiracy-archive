        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There seems to be money flowing into the Clinton Foundation from big pharma. The CEOs are donating to Hillary&#39;s campaign. On the campaign trail I&#39;ve seen Bill Clinton name drop the drug naloxone. One of the manufactures of this drug is Hospira, a company recently bought by Pfizer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Naloxone’s rise to prominence has been good for its manufacturers, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer PFE -0.06% , which both doubled the price over the past two years. (Three other companies, Mylan MYL -2.65% , Kaléo, and Adapt Pharma, also recently entered the market.) But more significant: It saved 8,000 people from an overdose last year—a number that’s growing fast.
<a href="http://fortune.com/2015/12/08/narcan-opioid-heroin-drug-overdose/">http://fortune.com/2015/12/08/narcan-opioid-heroin-drug-overdose/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There seems to be serious conflicts on interest. been the campaign and the companies. For example Clinton wants to give these campaigns 7.5 billion dollars through federal programs. This is an OP-Ed from Hillary from last year:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today I’m releasing a strategy to confront the drug and alcohol addiction crisis. My plan sets five goals: empower communities to prevent drug use among teenagers; ensure every person suffering from addiction can obtain comprehensive treatment; ensure that all first responders carry <strong>naloxone</strong>, which can stop overdoses from becoming fatal; require health care providers to receive training in recognizing substance use disorders and to consult a prescription drug monitoring program before prescribing controlled substances; and prioritize treatment over prison for low-level and nonviolent drug offenders, so we can end the era of mass incarceration.
<a href="http://www.unionleader.com/article/20150901/OPINION02/150909909/1004/opinion">http://www.unionleader.com/article/20150901/OPINION02/150909909/1004/opinion</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the drug not being under patent, there is still a virtual monopoly on the manufacturing of the drug. The allows the 2 or 3 companies making the drug to raise praises for no reason</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In an emailed statement today, Amphastar CFO Bill Peters said, the company&#39;s price for naloxone was less than competitors. </p>

<p>&quot;Indeed, our price for naloxone after the increase is still the lowest among similar products in the United States. The fact that we have the lowest naloxone price is all the more remarkable because it is sold in a pre-filled syringe associated with a higher manufacturing cost. On average, the price of naloxone in the U.S. market (in vial form) is $37.23 per milligram, or 226% of the price of Amphastar&#39;s naloxone (in a prefilled syringe) when considering the price per milligram of naloxone. With all of this in mind, I am confident that we can assist Ohio in a similar way that we did with New York as we are committed to public safety.&quot;</p>

<p>In making his request, DeWine pointed to $6-per-dose rebate that Amphastar this month agreed to pay back to New York, an agreement that also protects the state against wholesale price increases for a year. According to The New York Times, that rebate was sought after police departments in the state, as well as across the country, began complaining that price increases were limiting their ability to save lives. <strong>In Georgia, for one, the price rose from about $20 a dose to $35 to $40 a dose</strong>. Health officials in Baltimore have been handing out kits containing naloxone to relatives and friends of people where there were concerns of overdoses but has had to limit that to 2,000 from 3,600 in the face of price increases.</p>

<p>The company, which went public last year, reported 9-month revenues of about $155 million and an operating loss of nearly $11 million for three quarters. It did not break out sales of naloxone in its last filing but said the drug was having &quot;increased sales.&quot;</p>

<p>Amphastar is not the only company to be caught in the cross-hairs of public sentiment for raising prices of the overdose drug. <strong>The Clinton Foundation last month said it had negotiated a discount with Kaléo for the naloxone autoinjector it makes. Rain Henderson, CEO of the Clinton Health Matters Initiative, wouldn&#39;t name the price but told the Times it would make it available to any institution that can distribute it widely</strong>. The foundation has approached other naloxone makers but Kaléo was the first to respond.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clinton seems more concerned about providing drugs to treat overdoses, rather than combating the over use of opioids in the US medical system or seriously helping people battling addiction.</p>

<p>What is interesting about her plan to make naloxone widespread, is that it lines the pockets of her donors, while reducing the number of deaths from overdoses. This plan could change this statistic, without changing the number of addicts in various communities. It wouldn&#39;t solve an addicts problems, just makes their habits less deadly.</p>

<p>I was wondering if if someone here with more experience at looking at campaign donations could find anything illegal. Is seems highly suspicious to me that you can take millions of dollars of money from companies, and then name drop their products in Op-eds and speeches while campaigning. There are different ways this problem could be solved, such as developing non-addictive pain medication. However, a Clinton administration and the Clinton foundation want to push a band-aid solution on this opioid addiction epidemic; this of course increases the money that flows into their donor&#39;s pockets. I think this is one of the easiest cases of Clinton being influenced by campaign contributions and Clinton Foundation donations.</p>

<p>~edit</p>

<p>I&#39;ve continued to dig and I have found something extremely interesting. I was having trouble linking Hillary Clinton to the Pfizer&#39;s Super Pac, but Pfizer has been extremely active this year, giving thousands of dollars to Democrats. I started to cross reference the Democrats they give money too with the list of Democratic Ssuperdelegates. Here are the links I&#39;m using:
Pzifer&#39;s PAC: <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgot.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00016683">https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgot.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00016683</a></p>

<p>Hospira Inc&#39;s PAC (they are owned by Pzifer: <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgot.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00433284">https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgot.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00433284</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Democratic_Party_superdelegates,_2016">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Democratic_Party_superdelegates,_2016</a></p>

<p>It appears that Pfizer gives money to superdelegates who then pledge their vote to Hillary. I think there needs to be some serious analysis of the money going to superdegelates; it is probably far more cost effective to get a candidate via superdegelates than it is to donated to Hillary directly. </p>

<p>There is a grand conspiracy at work, before they planned 9/11 they probably had all of this planned. There are some genius&#39; behind it. The question is when will the tyranny stop?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really a grand conspiracy. And I don&#39;t think this has much to do with 9/11. Doesn&#39;t heroin in the US come from Mexico and South America? </p>

<p>This can easily be explained by the simple drive to maximize profits and US domestic issues. Big-Pharam don&#39;t want to stop selling opioid-based pain killers, thus they develop solution to a problem they&#39;ve created (naloxone). If they can reduce the number of over-dose deaths, they can hide the scale of the addiction epidemic. They buy-off a politician (Hillary) to push their product naloxone. This ignores the problem of the over-use and easy of access to addictive opioid-based painkillers in the US medical system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>BTH comes from Middle East typically, while Mexican Brown comes from Mexico, from what i understand, Black Tar is alot more powerful, unless the Brown is cut with Fentanyl, BTH is less processed and closer to the opium that comes directly from the plant, when they cut the Poppies it oozes out the chemical and the BTH is closest to that exact thing, what the Chinese smoked (Opium) back in the day is  a very unprocessed version of the natural product </p>

This is because our military industrial complex launders money in the form of the drug war by <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/US-Role-in-Massive-Aerial-by-Jason-Leopold-090721-122.html">spraying monstanto herbicides over latin american poppy fields</a> consistently and has for decades.  Mexican cartels are middle men, smugglers, not producers.</p>

<p>The media has lied about this issue and wants to drum up anti-mexico rhetoric, but numbers don&#39;t lie and these counter-claims I&quot;m making are all listed in the following link, which is an essay on exactly this subject that I encourage you to read otherwise you&#39;ll continue to be misinformed and that will shape your perspective against latin america when the real demon is the US and the Media.  It&#39;s coming from Afghanistan, being shipped into Mexico and Columbia and being smuggled in by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar_Cartel">knights templar cartel</a> with whom the CIA has agreements and assistance while making the appearance of fighting them, given the total sum of money (2.5B / yr) and advanced technology only the CIA has to be thrown at the situation only to have a ragtag bunch of criminals become stronger every year. <a href="http://www.alternet.org/world/what-do-isis-and-drug-cartels-mexico-have-common">[1]</a><a href="http://narcosphere.narconews.com/notebook/bill-conroy/2011/08/us-trained-assassin-teams-now-deployed-drug-war">[2]</a><a href="http://narcosphere.narconews.com/notebook/bill-conroy/2011/06/us-special-ops-troops-deployed-mexico-leaked-briefing-confirms">[3]</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve continued to dig and I have found something extremely interesting. I was having trouble linking Hillary Clinton to the Pfizer&#39;s Super Pac, but Pfizer has been extremely active this year, giving thousands of dollars to Democrats. I started to cross reference the Democrats they give money too with the list of Democratic Ssuperdelegates. Here are the links I&#39;m using:
<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgot.php?cycle=2016&amp;amp;cmte=C00016683">https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgot.php?cycle=2016&amp;amp;cmte=C00016683</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Democratic_Party_superdelegates,_2016">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Democratic_Party_superdelegates,_2016</a></p>

<p>It appears that Pfizer gives money to superdelegates who then pledge their vote to Hillary. I think there needs to be some serious analysis of the money going to superdegelates; it is porbably far more cost effective to get a candidate via superdegelates than it is to donated to Hillary directly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in this industry. I will say this, there will never be such a thing as a non-addictive effective pain med, because the brain has natural opiate receptors that opiod and synthetic opiods play off of. Its the natural chemical mechanism of the brain to relieve pain. Naloxone is also in response to Fentanyl being cut into Heroin to increase potency at a dramatically cheaper price. Fentanyl being used Intravenously is about as dangerous as can be. Mexican and South American Cartels have been cutting into their heroin with Fentanyl. These companies are trying to corner the market on something they know they can charge a hiked rate for. The reason only larger companies or heavy money backed smaller companies can produce this is because of its classification by the FDA as well as the amount of hoops they have to jump through to get it to market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just watched an episode of Anthony Bourdain&#39;s &quot;Parts Unknown&quot; that talked about this! There&#39;s a segment in it somewhere around the middle of the episode that talks about how modern heroin addiction seems to come about. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80043539">Here it is if you have a Netflix account!</a> I think that should should work, but if not, or if you don&#39;t have Netflix, it&#39;s Season 4, Episode 7 and it&#39;s titled &quot;Massachusetts.&quot; The segment starts at around 17:00 but the entire episode is great if you like food or travel shows!</p>

<p>They interviewed a (former?) junkie who said it was easier to get a bag of heroin than weed. I believe they also said it&#39;s just as likely for some old, white grandma to be a heroin/opioid addict as it is for the traditional stereotype of a young dude living in a crack house.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just for more info, its the reason bio-freeze, Tylenol, etc is less effective, because its not playing on the brains already natural system. The issue with Opiates is that it opens the flood gates and pours the chemicals into the system. The eventual dependence is that your brain will stop producing the chemical naturally because it realizes its getting it from an outside source. For even more info, i know the science behind the stuff based on education, but i am not in the production or manufacturing, clinical trials, etc. I am an industry HeadHunter</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In particular, the body releases an endogenous cannabinoid called anandamide, a name which is derived from the Sanskrit word meaning &quot;internal bliss.&quot; When the body senses pain, anandamide binds to CB-1 and nullifies pain by blocking the signaling. However, this effect is weak and short-lived as other molecules metabolize the anandamide. The compound has a half-life of only a few minutes in vivo. </p>

<p>Science has proven that its relief for only a few minutes and then after it, its that you are high enough to where youre incapable of registering it, which only masks most chronic pain vs. physical therapy to resolve</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Expo is a VERY good thing to look at closely. She was desperate and desperation leads to carelessness. </p>

<p>They told reporters that the business community was in charge of the fundraising process, but Clinton at first was forbidden by ethical statutes to take donations from Boeing (which was on a list with a few other &quot;controversial&quot; companies). Then went against those for a $1 million donation from Boeing. Then upped it to $2 million. Which was the official number. But she announced the official $2 million mark before this email was sent: </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/369">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/369</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just a quick note to tell you that we are moving forward on the Expo funding. ATT came in at $500k, McGraw Hill at $200k, Intel at $250k more, Delos Living (a Mantz client) $250k, and CITI at a minimum of $2M brings us down to $3.7M. </p>

<p>The following are on deck and likely to come in soon - <strong>Boeing (more)</strong>, Carlyle, Blackstone, Alcoa, and AECOM. EB and I chatting with many others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So did they end up getting even more from Boeing? I can&#39;t find an official list of donors and dollar amounts, but I would really like one.</p>

<p>By the way Mantz is Jonathan Mantz (longtime lobbyist, super ingrained in money-throwing with the Clintons), and EB is Elizabeth Bagley (also ingrained with Clintons, and the State Department in general) if anyone wants to help dig further.</p>

<p>Big question: They got that money for a stadium for Haiti. They&#39;re not building the stadium. Where is that money now and how is it being used? Do the donors even care? Looks like the Clintons use Haiti out to beg for money and nothing ever goes back to the Haitians. Sick stuff.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how it connects to the Clintons, but the truth is out there and I&#39;d be surprised if they were innocent. I mean it makes sense from a business perspective; you want to keep the junkies on the good shit, but you want them to stay alive to consume more of your product. Along comes Naloxone and there you go, you have the best dope around AND the remedy for the overdoses. And you&#39;re laughing all the way to the bank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice post, OP!</p>

<p>This is interesting.  What&#39;s going on with these pharmaceutical pain killers?  While I can&#39;t find any direct association with the Clintons other than what you&#39;ve dug up, I think it&#39;s an industry worth paying attention to.  It looks like the pharmaceutical companies aren&#39;t just profiting directly off of opioids any more, but are opening up new markets as a result of opioid dependancy.  </p>

<p>Narcan is one instance (the brand name of the Naloxone drug you&#39;re referring to).  It IS saving lives.</p>

<p>Another weird one is this new condition- OIC (Opioid Induced Constipation), which appears to have been invented by Astra Zeneca to sell their drug Movantik.  They went so far as to advertise the CONDITION (not the drug- wink wink) during the Superbowl with this spot:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X276jp-vvRY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X276jp-vvRY</a></p>

<p>At the end of the ad, you&#39;ll find the names of it&#39;s sponsors- which include several foundations before the names of the Pharma companies (Astra Zeneca and Daiichi Saankyo).  I would intuit that these foundations would be directly associated with Big Pharma as a means of skirting advertising laws.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s check out the first on the list for this 2015 advertisement:  US Pain Foundation</p>

<p>This is what comes up first in googs, from May 2012:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/senate-panel-investigates-drug-company-ties-to-pain-groups">https://www.propublica.org/article/senate-panel-investigates-drug-company-ties-to-pain-groups</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the U.S. Senate Finance Committee launched an investigation Tuesday into makers of narcotic painkillers and groups that champion them, a leading pain advocacy organization said it was dissolving &quot;due to irreparable economic circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p>The American Pain Foundation, which described itself as the nation’s largest organization for pain patients, was the focus of a December investigation by ProPublica in The Washington Post that detailed its close ties to drugmakers.</p>

<p>The group received 90 percent of its $5 million in funding in 2010 from the drug and medical-device industry, ProPublica found, and its guides for patients, journalists and policymakers had played down the risks associated with opioid painkillers while exaggerating the benefits.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether the group&#39;s announcement Tuesday evening — that it would &quot;cease to exist, effective immediately&quot; — was related to letters sent earlier in the day from Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the finance panel chairman, and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, to the foundation, drug companies and others.</p>

<p>In the letters, the senators cited an &quot;an epidemic of accidental deaths and addiction resulting from the increased sale and use of powerful narcotic painkillers,&quot; including popular brand names like Oxycontin, Vicodin and Opana.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the American Pain Foundation is shut down after a congressional inquiry, but now the US Pain Foundation has popped up in it&#39;s place.  But they&#39;re no longer advocating the pain medication directly- they&#39;re advocating for other drugs which combat the symptoms of dependency. </p>

<p>Mm, mm, si, si. Let me show you a few of the other characters that are involved in this... tragicomedy:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endo_International_plc">Endo Pharmaceuticals</a>: Percocet, Percodan, and Opana.</li>
</ul>

<p>One year ago, Endo&#39;s stock price was sitting above $90.  Today it&#39;s below $30.  Interestingly, Adapt Pharma licensed the name Narcan from Endo.  Also interestingly, Endo recently lost a lawsuit by the FTC for pay to play on generic drugs.  </p>

<p>Purdue Pharmaceuticals: Maker of oxycontin.  Privately owned by the Sackler family.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Pharma">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Pharma</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Sackler">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Sackler</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In May 2007, the company pleaded guilty to misleading the public about Oxycontin&#39;s risk of addiction, and agreed to pay $600 million in one of the largest pharmaceutical settlements in U.S. history. Its president, top lawyer, and former chief medical officer pleaded guilty as individuals to misbranding charges, a criminal violation, and agreed to pay a total of $34.5 million in fines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whoa, wait.  In 2011, the FDA lowered the Acetaminafin in vicodin to increase safety.</p>

<p>In 2014, Zogenix was approved to sell the first pure hydrocodone product.  In looking at their stock price, it has twice hovered around $40, before falling back to $10/ share- once in 2011 and once in 2014.</p>

<p>It seems like it&#39;s well known that these drugs are largely responsible for an epidemic, and that these companies are being held slightly accountable.  So now the industry is branching out to deal with side effects and to make nominal attempts to combat the issue of addiction. I&#39;d like to see the connections with increased heroin availability and usage.  It&#39;s shady.  The marketing is shady, the politics is shady, and I suspect it goes much deeper than is apparent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 501c3s they set up are actually used to funnel money through them tax-free for advertising and stealth marketing that benefits those who donate. (I also wonder if it&#39;s to avoid legal liability for astroturfing laws and suits by adding a single layer of abstraction - seems like that wouldn&#39;t be very effective, though, as it&#39;s pretty transparent.) Seems like most big industries and loads of politicans do it. I have no idea why it isn&#39;t legal and have asked my representatives why. It&#39;s such a crooked way to deceive the public. You think about the IRS denying Tea Party organizations their charitable foundations, but let these big companies run roughshod all over the system, it&#39;s pretty messed up.</p>

<p>Did you ever read the City of Chicago&#39;s <a href="http://www.fiercepharma.com/regulatory/updated-chicago-makes-second-run-at-allergan-j-j-purdue-and-others-painkiller-lawsuit">lawsuit</a> against a bunch of these guys?

    <div class="md"><p>That chicago suit is interesting, but we all know chicago is as corrupt as it gets, so it seems like a tough place to get the ball rolling.</p>

<p>your point reminds me of Hillary&#39;s claim against gun manufacturers that legislation protecting them from legal action by those harmed by illegitimate use of their products is &quot;unprecedented&quot;.  Well clearly it&#39;s not unprecedented at all!  These companies are being protected by suits from people who have been using these drugs exactly as their being marketed.  Opiates for back pain?!  </p>

<p>If they&#39;re saying that the FDA was cool with it, then maybe the FDA should be sued and the FDA can sue the companies for falsifying their studies.  Big tobacco&#39;s got nothing on these guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s one of the things that made me so happy about it - <em>Chicago</em> actually stood up to them. It was unbelievable to me. But notice it never made mainstream news. For all the handwringing over the opioid, heroin, and overdose deaths issues in this country by media and politicians, not a peep about the Chicago suit that laid it all out there. </p>

<p>FDA was absolutely complicit and still is. When they pulled back, the drug companies blamed them for the heroin problem. But what are they going to do? Problem, too, is FDA is a revolving door when it comes to industry. There&#39;s a user on here who talks about seeing that firsthand, but you can also see it via reading the news. The new director we have, so far, has <em>appeared</em> to be a little more strict about things - and surprising, because he was in the pocket of at least 20 drug companies...</p>

<p>Other thing about opioids is that there&#39;s research showing they cause cancer to grow faster. I only started digging into it after people I know were hit by this. So you have back pain, your doc gives you Oxy, now you have two problems: opiate addiction and possible cancer (and god help you if you take both of these with a TNF inhibitor for arthritis. Don&#39;t doctors understand what they&#39;re prescribing? Shit). This is something no one is talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Herion has been rising now more than ever. Tbis is all a fuckin&#39; game. It is much harder to get opiates on the street now adays, because they are not overly supplied like they used to be. I will not lie, I fell into this growing epidemic... Price of prescription painkillers are rising and not scripted out like they used to be, so they are much harder to get and if you do find them, its atleast 5x the price they used to be years ago, due to rarity and shortsupply. </p>

<p>I have been addicted to drugs since I was 14 years old... I dabbled in this and that, but nothing &quot;hardcore&quot; enough to get me addicted. Until about 3 years ago..  I had some dental issues, and only did pain killers every once and a while.. After I got my prescription, I started to really like them again, more than I have ever had.. Shortly after the teeth pulling business, I shattered my wrist falling down the stairs. No, I didnt do this on purpose like many addicts do to get pills. I got prescribed numerous painkillers for a month and a half. So right there, I had about 2 1/2-3months of opiate usage, with doctors knowing ofcourse.(No illegal use etc). </p>

<p>Then when I come back for the checkup to see if it was going well, they said I needed my wisdom teeth taken out... So I was prescribed stronger pills, and was on it for another 2-3 weeks. So I then had about 4 months of prescription opiate usage, the longest amount of time I had religiously taken opiates every day. </p>

<p>My doctors all knew how long I was on painkillers etc and the duration... and i had never become fully addicted before like everyday use... I got so sick, I had no idea what was happening. So I hit up Jimmybob and got some opiates... I felt so much better, I thought I just had a sickness and it helped...The next day still felt sick... So I didnt take any for another two days, and was feeling worse. At first it was like the flu, then it became something I had never experienced before. I hit up Jimmybob and got more.. This lasted for a week or two before I understood I was fullblown addicted to opiates, all from my doctors doing, providing no support or guidance for me... </p>

<pre><code>I heard about withdrawal, never expeirnced it myself... Called one my doctors and they said I should feel better shortly... But I already had many health issues, so this piled ontop of it was unbearable.. So for a few months I was on the hunt for opiates so I would not be so sick.. 
</code></pre>

<p>It got to expensive... I couldnt afford spending a hundred a day... So mt friend introduced to me to &quot;pure opium&quot; or so I thought. It was helluva lot cheaper. Anyway to keep it short, I later found out what it really was, dope. I was addicted for 2 years spending a hundred a week for a few months, then I was spending a few hundred a week for a month or two. But it wasnt cutting it, so I was eventually spending 120$ a day... </p>

<p>To keep a long story short, I finally came to realization and  saw what I was becoming, what I was doing, and how I was hurting everyone around me. This is something many addicts eventually realize, but the fear of it.. Makes them even more addicted, literally past the point of no return no matter how many rehabs one has been to. I have been on suboxone for a year and 2 months now, fighting the mental battle of not wanting to relapse. But what I came fo realize is this grand conspiracy...</p>

<p>Dope/H/Smack has blown up in the past 2-3 years. It was unheard of in my area til recent. Now, I know more people addicted than not, and hundreds from my old highschool are addicted aswell. All of this out of nowhere? After our foothold in Middle East poppy fields became &quot;secure&quot; ... Something doesnt add up. Its as if, the doctors/pharamies knowly make you addicted... Make pills harder to get, so you are forced to do dope, because it is in the start, cheaper than suboxone/methadone maintenance. Its a legal drug cartel more or less. They get em hooked legally, then shorten the supply, and make people go for dope due to its cheapness in the start... Then, here comes along all these brand new multimillion dollar rehabs coming out. </p>

<pre><code>Seriously, I have yet to meet anyone who has been to rehab that it actually helped them. Its a gigantic mental battle. People look down upon addicts, Icfelt like a piece of shif... Didnt want to live, hoping each day I would overdose and get it over with... Rehab is a joke, and a huge money maker. Now insurances cover many rehabs and raise your prem... Its all a conspiracy.
</code></pre>

<p>Suboxone is legal drug dealing. The doctors dont know shit, charge you 250-300$ every single mandatory monthly visit, 500$ introduction fee when first become their &quot;patient&quot; aka customer... Its all a sham, its all bullshit. There is a much bigger picture and I really hope someone, somewhere can bring it to light. I believe this is all tied in with this conspiracy you present to us... I just wanted to let you see first hand how all this shit ruined and destroyed not even just my life, but many many others lives.. </p>

<pre><code>Drug addiction is a mental disease, it cant be helped. You cant just simple stop, mind over matter is bullshit. To this day I have not felt happy, or actually any emotion other than anger... It ruined my life. All these drugs do, and the root of this issue is pharamecutical companies... It truly is. Theres a chemical in these drugs I really think... that makes people afdicted and hooked. Its not like being hooked on cigarettes, thats nothing. Its like H is a demon in your body, that screams at you that you need more... It makes you feel like shit, makes you feel worthless, it makes you feel like you are nothing without it. And since I have been off for a year, I would rather be back on it... I wish I could feel emotions again and feel like my normal self. Everyday it feels like time is moving beside me, while I am standing still.... It truly ruins ones mind and life, and will never make you feel like a himan being ever again... Or atleast for me... So please, Please find some concrete evidence of these pieces of shit, so they can be brought to justice, and stop ruining peoples lives, and killing their souls..

    <div class="md"><p>I got addicted to something my doctor prescribed for anxiety by taking it wrong because ironically, I was too mentally incapacitated by the very depression and anxiety the drug was to treat to remember to OR figure out that I should bring my medicine with me if I were to be able to take it &quot;as needed.&quot; I was dependent for a year or two? </p>

<p>The good news is I didn&#39;t kill myself or have a breakdown. The bad news is I stopped developing into adulthood and stalled out. Like a pacified zombie. It slid over me without notice. 
Thank God that doctor realized I was having withdrawal symptoms when I skipped my regular daily dose. Coming off of it was terrifying, mostly because of the fear of being controlled by the addiction (I know many people who don&#39;t get free) but also because of the psychological pain of acute anxiety and the uncontrollable, deep shaking from the core muscles of my abdomen. Detoxing is fucking harrowing. I can&#39;t imagine how much harder or would be with an opiate after having your natural source of dopamine eradicated, to take away the artificially supplied source. Within a couple weeks I felt like I was waking up from Kansas after a tornado...life was Technicolor and so much more real. I felt amazing! It was like being born into the world and your own body again after watching everything from behind a fog. Within another year I began to go after the underlying issue causing the anxiety.</p>

<p>My experience taught me that rx drugs can do great good and great evil in your life AND our medical system is not effective at treating vulnerable populations with addictive medicines. I should never have been given that medicine in my state of mind. I literally couldn&#39;t put two and two together. How could I process questions about medicine?  What seemed like a practical solution to forgetting your medicine was actually the perfect way to begin a chemical dependency. I was so naive and incompetent. It would have been better to simply suffer through the anxiety without the dumbass medicine! Maybe I would have taken up biking or meditation and faced the environmental sources of my anxiety. </p>

<p>Yes, there are structural failures in our medical system on many levels that create the circumstances for addiction to blossom. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s a very profitable situation!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s one of the things that made me so happy about it - <em>Chicago</em> actually stood up to them. It was unbelievable to me. But notice it never made mainstream news. For all the handwringing over the opioid, heroin, and overdose deaths issues in this country by media and politicians, not a peep about the Chicago suit that laid it all out there. </p>

<p>FDA was absolutely complicit and still is. When they pulled back, the drug companies blamed them for the heroin problem. But what are they going to do? Problem, too, is FDA is a revolving door when it comes to industry. There&#39;s a user on here who talks about seeing that firsthand, but you can also see it via reading the news. The new director we have, so far, has <em>appeared</em> to be a little more strict about things - and surprising, because he was in the pocket of at least 20 drug companies...</p>

<p>Other thing about opioids is that there&#39;s research showing they cause cancer to grow faster. I only started digging into it after people I know were hit by this. So you have back pain, your doc gives you Oxy, now you have two problems: opiate addiction and possible cancer (and god help you if you take both of these with a TNF inhibitor for arthritis. Don&#39;t doctors understand what they&#39;re prescribing? Shit). This is something no one is talking about.</p>
