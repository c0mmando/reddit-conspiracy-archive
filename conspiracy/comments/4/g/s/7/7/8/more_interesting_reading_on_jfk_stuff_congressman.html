       there are so many
       <em>
        convenient disappearances
       </em>
       , there shold be a thread just for them.  the real martyrs, real men and women who went out on a limb and tried to reach out to us, but we kept our hands in our pockets and let them fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       it would make for a powerful resource.  theres something about direct knowledge of someone's personal sacrifice and suffering, either in the cause of exposing criminality or even just victimization of the innocent.  for good and for bad, hero worship is a deeply seated aspect of human emotion and motivation, lets at least attract regard to real heroism.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think about
       <a href="http://www.wellstonetheykilledhim.com/">
        paul wellstone
       </a>
       and bring him up all the time among my
       <em>
        unwashed
       </em>
       or should i say
       <em>
        brainwashed
       </em>
       friends and family and can see it does have impact, they tend to stop smirking and begin listening more attentively.
      </p>
      <p>
       i also remember watching the "jumpers" on 911. i cant help but feel responsibility for their justice. i well-up with anger and sadness to this day when i think about it. their hopelessness haunts me, or maybe it just triggers feelings of a similar sinking hopelessness already existing in me where once i believed it was trust in people that afforded us our security and happiness and now that sentiment seems naive at best, deadly at worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       but in reality there are still humans, good people, out there doing their heroism and should be supported in their cause if you believe them, as well there are those that gave up everything for us and our babies, we shold remember them if for no other reason than to show that there were plenty "somebody's" that "said something" its just that most of us didnt listen or worse, did nothing.
      </p>

       tldr; we need a whistleblowers memorial resource.

       I agree. I feel gratitude to all those who have been fearless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether this guy, Boggs, or Frank Church (who had the CIA hearings, and I think was killed), Wellstone, Breitbart, Michael Hastings, Gary Webb, Phillip Marshall (and his two kids).... And what about that guy who was making that police state movie a year ago when he suddenly died? Very suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the list of the dead just keeps growing, and we probably don't know 20% of all of them who died trying to expose the truth.

       JFK Jr. Died July 16th 1999. He was strongly considering going into politics. Would likely have started out (like his father) as a Senator. He lived in New York, so he probably would have run for Senator in the summer of 2000... with the election itself being held on November 7th.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now go check and see for yourself who got elected as a Senator for the state of New York on that date.

       I agree that Frank Church was probably controlled. Wouldn't have said that until recently, when I learned he was on some list of politicians who were rolling around with hookers.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the guy who was making "Gray State".....I dunno about that. Let's look at some of the names of the people involved:
      </p>
      <p>
       David CROWLEY - Director &amp; Writer
      </p>
      <p>
       Mitch HEIL - Director of Photography
      </p>
      <p>
       Danny MASON - Lead Actor
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that not a triumvirate of suspicious monickers? Almost like a joke, in fact?
      </p>
      <p>
       A while back, I googled "Gray State" and "Psy-Op" and found this:
       <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/01/is-gray-state-psy-op.html">
        http://www.activistpost.com/2013/01/is-gray-state-psy-op.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Writer makes some good points. 1st time I watched the trailer, frankly, I didn't even watch it to the end. It was so dark, oppressive and needlessly violent. Didn't sit right with me -- without hope, nobody's going to pay to see this movie, &amp; it sure as hell looked expensive.

       Yep, doesn't get much more obvious than that.  Those names are a clear signature.  Try to look those people up on IMDB or find out details about their families and upbringings.  All three are ghosts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the movie itself, though I haven't seen it, seems like fear and doom propaganda.

       Gary Caradori, he is the first person to come to mind as I read your post. After all the scandal around Hastret and now his smack-on-the-wrist sentence, it makes the Franklin scandal seem even more plausible. And, I agree about the thread and memorial!

       Thank you! That looks really interesting. It's a crazy event that more people should be aware of.

       And don't forget there are so many convenient "accidents", such as JFK Jr's plane crash.

       Excellent reading. I'm glad people are still interested in JFK as there are still a shitload of avenues to explore regarding the people &amp; circumstances surrounding his assassination.

       While I have my doubts that the media and the government will ever allow a formal revision to the lone-nut LHO story, it's still incredible fun to pour through the immense amount of data and find clues (or mostly learn about others who found them first).
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's still motivated by the belief of a new type of government taking control upon that assassination— one which is still in control today (I think JFK's killing, more than anything, gave rise to the "deep state").

       Thanks and welcome aboard.

       My personal view on it is that Ed Lansdale &amp; co, who were trained experts in Overthrowing Governments, were the backbone/structure used to complete the assassination, though I'm open to who was behind it, as I'm not convinced either way.

       Boggs &amp; Begich had come up to Alaska to investigate the impact &amp; advisability of the proposed North Slope pipeline from Prudoe Bay to Valdez. Before they got on the Cessna 310 to Seattle, they had a small news conference; they opposed building the pipeline until more studies on it's impact had been made. Waiting 2, 4, 6 years meant  hundreds of millions of $ to oil companies and suppliers, e.g. the Teamster union. OP is looking in the wrong direction, or deliberately misleading. If Begich &amp; Boggs were shot down over the Gulf of Alaska, it was about

       Planes crash in Alaska all the time, this isn't unusual in my eyes. It was even worse 40 years ago. It's almost an epidemic I'd say.
