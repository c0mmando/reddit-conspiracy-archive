     5 Cases of Suspicious Scientist Deaths

       Conspiracy theorists often cite 'knowing too much' as a cause for mysterious deaths and, in the case of some scientists, that may actually be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       YouTube user Dark5 has created a video that looks at five of the most mysterious and eye brow-raising scientist deaths and raises the question of what knowledge they people may have taken to the grave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the most puzzling case is that of an Australian astrophysicist named Rodney Marks who was working at a research station at the South Pole.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Marks unexpectedly died at the site, the defense contractors which controlled the facility did not turn his body over to authorities for an inexplicable six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       A later investigation into his cause of death revealed that Marks had somehow accidentally poisoned himself with methyl alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether Marks had fashioned his own moonshine still at the South Pole or was the victim of a conspiracy to silence him remains open to conjecture.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is be particularly troubling about the video is that it also highlights instances where numerous scientists bearing a curious connection to each other all passed away.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, an astounding 25 scientists working on the Star Wars Defense Initiative for the United States government all perished within a span of eight years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consisting of an inordinate amount of suicides and accidents, some believe the scientists were taken out by either their own government or concerned Russian forces hoping to put a stop to the SDI program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out the video for more of these eye brow-raising cases, including a scientist who was allegedly blown off of a bridge by a gust of wind and a trio of Antarctic researchers who also perished under very weird circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Somehow the video didn't post the first time around...

       It's not a case of not wanting to turn over the body, it's just that you don't travel to or from antarctica during the summer.

       Methyl alcohol freezes at -97.6C, so it can travel to antarctica in the summer.

       On a more serious note, from everything I know about this case I'd sounds very plausible that he was murdered, but we will probably never now for sure.

       I don't know anything outside the video but it sounds like because of the parts which mention they were uncooperative with the investigation, and that the government may have actually shut the investigation down, it seems pretty suspicious.

       Well, there might be other reasons for that. I mean, they might've been doing something illegal or highly immoral that they didn't want people to know about. He might've found out and was going to tell the world so they had to kill him, but we will probably never know.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also the chance that he made a mistake, or maybe he got depressed and wanted to kill himself, but all we can do is guess until someone who really knows comes forward and tells us.

       If he killed himself I don't see the need for the government to shut down the investigation and the reported uncooperative nature of his associates.

       The uncooperativity of his associates and the governments involvement is probably connected. They were probably doing something that they didn't want everyone to know about, which doesn't mean that it's something in the likes of GWB admitting he planned and executed the order for 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodney Marks was a smart guy, but it's a known fact that people who go to antarctica tends to become what we in the civilized part of the world would call an alcoholic, and he was a heavy drinker. Drinking until you blackout everyday in the week for a couple of months coupled with the isolation and darkness will have enormous consequences on your mind. You can't think straight, you make simple mistakes, you make bad choices, you get depressed and you lose your judgement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very likely that he simply killed himself or made a mistake, nothing really points to him being killed by his associates, except the fact you brought up, which is something we can only speculate about.

       Well, I see no real reason to kill him and that's what makes me believe that he wasn't killed and that it's more likely they were doing something secret. If someone dies at area 51 there is no was in hell law enforcement would get invited in, no one would cooperate out of fear of slipping up (from the governments side), and that's most likely what's happend here too.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were/are doing something that they don't want the world to know about, at least for the time being.

       Well I don't know anything about him or exactly what he was researching.  However, I would have to say that his death was the least suspicious out of any of all of the other deaths in the video.  What you are saying here could be a possibility.
