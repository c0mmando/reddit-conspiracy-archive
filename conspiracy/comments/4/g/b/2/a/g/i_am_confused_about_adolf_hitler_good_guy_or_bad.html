       I have read extensive on Hitler on You Tube comments (and videos), David Icke Forum, Jim Stone Freelance, Nothern Truthseeker blog, Reddit Conspiracy and other sources. I am nowhere near coming to a conclusion about Adolf Hitler if he was a good guy or bad?, I know he is an off spring of the Rothchild's but I want people opinion here about him and did he really flee to Argentina and lived until 90 years old?. I also learned about him from these sources:

       OP collects data from multiple self identified sources. He will be able to form accurate conclusions because he has given himself the ability to hear multiple opinions. To consider any source as not worth your time is detrimental to your learning process. The more effective way to form a well rounded opinion would be to listen to any and all sources possible, identify anomalies, spend time researching these anomalies to judge whether the information is good. Form your own opinion considering all of the opinions and evidence collected.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, you're what's wrong with this sub - you're a wannabe. Real conspiracists will always offer support and take any information they can from their peers.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP stick to the forums, you will be returned a lot more value for your efforts than you will on this sub. From what I've read Hitler was a good guy, everybody thinks they're doing "it" for the right reasons. I think you have done more research than me on the topic though.

       You can't murder your way to freedom and happiness.  It's automatically invalid by any religion's measure.  Even Islam. Even atheism. There is a fundamental law of karma that will always get you, even if you think you're living in a psychopathic utopia thereafter.

       I'm pretty sure you're not aware that what you're parroting there is a truism.

      <p>
       It's a simple and nice phrase. You like this phrase because it resonates with your lack of education.

      <p>
       History is a science after all, and revisionism could be seen as the homeopathy or snake oil of this part of academia. How do you explain the Teutoburger battle and what we know about it? Pyrrhus? Eagle Claw? Bay of Pigs?

       No, that's exactly what I believe.  History is fiction that is changing all the time in people's memory and how it is perceived is how history is crafted.  The perception can be manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       You brought out some nice words there yourself!  Pat yourself on the back I guess.  Was your post after all this time only to give yourself another example of your over education?  Revisionism is snake oil....wow, that's a new one.

       So, as an example, when I say "Holocaust revisionism", you say what?

       In 1550, King Henry VIII was a strong, respected leader who started the C of E and many Englishmen saw his reign as prosperous and good. In 2016, he's a fat misogynist who treated women like garbage and beheaded them for no reason, oh and also a king.
Perception/paradigms changing the way we tell history is also a signifier of history changing. The feminists winning over our paradigms are evident in the way we change how/which history and literature are taught and analyzed.

       History is written by the winners of wars. Hitler helped Germany become a world power, wouldn't cooperate with the Zionist Rothschild banking system (the Jews) and when he showed the world you could fight back they crushed him to make an example of anyone else who won't play ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say he was a good guy, he was super right wing for sure, but imagine if he had beaten the rulers of the world and you could have liberal countries today free of the overlords....

       I said it in another comment but just so you know too, history is science, not some one sided tale by those who think of themselves as winners. If you truly think of history as a work of those who "won" you didn't understand that war only lasts as long as takes for all combatants to realize that there's nothing more to lose.

       I guess I'll be a terrible history educator then, because I believe very strongly that history is not a science. A soft science
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       but it's definitely not a quantifiable study you can run experiments on to determine the truth. Maybe I'm just an idiot, but it seems like you're trying to suggest that history cannot be manipulated, biased, or inaccurate. Is that true? Because if so, then damn, I need to rework every history education paper I've ever written.

       You are so far off base it's absurd. History as a science? It's a known fact that history has to be rewritten time and time again. The truth of events is suppressed, more information comes to light, some of it completely contradictory to what was established and taught. All your posts and posts like yours do is convince doubters that they shouldn't doubt the "story" that's fed to them by he government spoon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact everyone knows the gulf wars were about oil is the clearest example...... The history books are teaching that it was about freedom and democracy. You think that's the only time stories have been whitewashed? Just stop trolling and go suck on your civil war was about slavery some more and when you read time and time again from Lincoln's own hand it wasn't about slavery come talk to me. Or how about the fact that we have zero information from non-Romans about the Romans and barbarians? You think Soviets were told the whole story about the revolution? NO. You're just shilling for the establishment. Please leave

       Nice attempt at dismissing me, and will you stop with the uneducated bullshit, I have a four year degree from a public university. The fact remains that you're  clinging so tightly to your history it's reminiscent of a zealot realizing their faith is unfounded. If you refuse to acknowledge that the governments, religions, banks, and education systems throughout the world wield more power than they should; especially concerning history, and the official story then you've got wool over your eyes kid.

       Aww, so close. I agree with everything you said up until the Civil War. It wasn't about slavery on the Union side, but for the Confederates, it was very much about preserving slavery (and by extension, their economy).

       It's definitely not good v. evil (black and white). I would say that the topic of Hitler has been highly propagandized negatively by the "victors".

       In the Nazi documents, there is no wording for "genocide". The wording is for banishment/internment. After the war, Jews would be exiled from the country. It turns out, Germany didn't win and the war resulted in mass causalities via starvation and rampant disease in the camps. Not saying what they did was ok, but facts are facts and no historical event should be banned from re-investigating. It just so happens, in Europe if you question the official narrative, you can go to jail. Hmmm, wonder why...

       No. You can only go to jail for holocaust denial in Germany, for obvious reasons. Anywhere else you can, and do, publish books about the subject. It just so happens that no one except for Nazis takes this seriously.

       That perception of him is divided because both sides (positive and negative) are promoted by the same people (USFG and UN).

       There's a quote, "One man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist."

       I wouldn’t say good, just not bad. But I believe in representative republicanism, pre-1900 capitalism, and a moral foundation for society. His views were somewhat different.

       What you have to remember about benevolent dictatorship is that while it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       one of the least damaging and most effective means of government for its initial term,
       <strong>
        <em>
         you cannot guarantee benevolence

       beyond the first generation of government. Cannot. That’s why it’s untenable.

       I guess I'll be a terrible history educator then, because I believe very strongly that history is not a science. A soft science
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       but it's definitely not a quantifiable study you can run experiments on to determine the truth. Maybe I'm just an idiot, but it seems like you're trying to suggest that history cannot be manipulated, biased, or inaccurate. Is that true? Because if so, then damn, I need to rework every history education paper I've ever written.

       You are so far off base it's absurd. History as a science? It's a known fact that history has to be rewritten time and time again. The truth of events is suppressed, more information comes to light, some of it completely contradictory to what was established and taught. All your posts and posts like yours do is convince doubters that they shouldn't doubt the "story" that's fed to them by he government spoon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact everyone knows the gulf wars were about oil is the clearest example...... The history books are teaching that it was about freedom and democracy. You think that's the only time stories have been whitewashed? Just stop trolling and go suck on your civil war was about slavery some more and when you read time and time again from Lincoln's own hand it wasn't about slavery come talk to me. Or how about the fact that we have zero information from non-Romans about the Romans and barbarians? You think Soviets were told the whole story about the revolution? NO. You're just shilling for the establishment. Please leave
