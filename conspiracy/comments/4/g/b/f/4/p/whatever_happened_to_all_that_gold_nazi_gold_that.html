       Either way, it's got me thinking about how many big news stories come up, then disappear/get forgotten.

       The goldman Sachs tapes story springs to mind too.

       It's not that forgoten here in Poland. The guys who claim that the train/gold is there are still trying to raise funds to dig. But without public support it's hard. Noone belives them, so...

       <strong>
        Polish president and leading advisers among victims of Smolensk plane crash
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Poland has suffered its worst political disaster since the second world war after its president, Lech Kaczynski, and dozens of top government officials were killed when their plane crashed in thick fog in western Russia this morning.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         The crash wiped out almost half of Poland's leadership.
        </strong>
        Those killed included Kaczynski's wife Maria, the army chief of staff, the head of the national bank, Poland's deputy foreign minister, three members of parliament, and at least two presidential aides, the Polish foreign ministry said. Rescuers found several unidentified bodies and the plane's black box.

       I have a couple of favorites too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jeffery Alan Lash story out of the posh southern California neighborhood Pacific Palisades last year, where the guy was found dead in a vehicle which had been parked on a public street for 10 days with his body in it. Never positively identified and when examined by the coroner 'no fingerprints could be determined'. His 2 bedroom apartment contained thousands of firearms and two pallets of ammo; he owned dozens of vehicles including bulletproof 4-wheel drives and an amphibious car. Story completely disappeared and I have never been able to find another mention of it since last October.
      </p>
      <p>
       My other favorite was a one time story about 2 years ago reported by Agence France-Presse of US diplomatic vehicle which was stopped at the Gaza/Israel border full of thousands of dollars cash, hundreds of cell phones, hundreds of cartons of cigarettes, and other easily converted items, I forgot the whole list. Driven by a motorpool mechanic who said he was sent to drive the car to its destination at the last minute when the diplomat who was supposed to be making the trip called in sick. riiiight. Never saw another word about it, and I looked.
