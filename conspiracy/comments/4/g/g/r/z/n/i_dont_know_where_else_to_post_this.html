       Has anyone else noticed how few comments there are across ALL subreddits? Save r/politics or any of the party affiliated offshoots and all the circus that goes along with that, there are posts at #1 on all with less than 300 comments. What the fuck is going on?! I am afraid that the sneaking feeling that I or anyone else are being censored is not just a sneaking feeling. I am only seeing the few posts that are approved to get through to me. I remember a day when this site was a bastion of free speech and a place that I knew I could hear what people think. Someone convince me these days are not gone...

       I have felt this way as well; any time I mention Israel in a popular thread my post stays at neutral, indicating to me that it is being censored, because these are the type of posts that usually inspire either hateful downvoting or posts that attempt to refute me, but the last thing it inspires is nothing. I've felt this way for a few months man.

       You can check this by posting the comment and then logging out.  Go to your userpage using a different username (or using no username at all) and see if you can still find the comments.

       It's also possible that the automod for a certain sub has you in their filter, meaning that anything you post to that specific sub is automatically deleted before anyone can see it.

       Interesting; this is also very possible. I don't break rules though, so I can't see why I would be banned other than fascists who don't want certain ideas being discussed openly.

       That's reason enough for some of the defaults, people have been banned for less.  It's all at the mods discretion so you could've simply caught one of them on a bad day.  And you would never know unless you confirm it for yourself, the default subs usually don't admit to automod banning users unless directly confronted with evidence.

       This. Reddit succeeded because they were first to major news stories. Now mods only allow links to content already published by major news outlets. So why bother coming here?

       I've noticed something odd too. It's like reddit goes almost to sleep. Like it's being throttled or something. No new stories for days. My comments will sit with nothing.  Then days later they perk up and sometimes get upvoted pretty strongly. Wtf- where did the thread go and hide? Do people sort by "oldest" ? Why no new posts? It's getting weird like OP said.

       So where do we go now, as common people who wouldn't be aware of these "secret communities"? Have they just abandoned us as a worthless cause? If so, what makes them any different than the "powers that be"? The CIA wants to restrict our access to information, if the anti-CIA also doesn't care about us, then why should we assume they're any different from each other in how they would treat us?

         The corporate owned mass media (including Reddit) and government media can't be trusted or relayed on for information. They will lie, censor and twist any fact into an engine of conquest and nihilism. Personally I only use them as comic relief and to see what they are up to next. It is nothing but celebrity worship, sports, trivia and misinformation.

         If you feel alienated form your fellow citizens, friends and family it is because they actually succeed! People care, they have and always did, it is the fear and desperation that gets to you. in the end. That is their language and how they control you.

       Yep, the downfall of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       was when people collectively decided "political conspiracies are the only thing worth thinking about". I don't give a fuck about the 2016 election or any of its candidates, so wading through the subreddit is a massive pain now.

       Yeah I'm not convinced that more than half of the users on this site are fake. Whether the be bots, shills, marketers, or some other form of non-organic interaction and posting.

       It is odd when you see an enormous post on the front page of Reddit with only 1,000 comments and its been up all day. Don't millions of people come here every day?

         The corporate owned mass media (including Reddit) and government media can't be trusted or relayed on for information. They will lie, censor and twist any fact into an engine of conquest and nihilism. Personally I only use them as comic relief and to see what they are up to next. It is nothing but celebrity worship, sports, trivia and misinformation.

         If you feel alienated form your fellow citizens, friends and family it is because they actually succeed! People care, they have and always did, it is the fear and desperation that gets to you. in the end. That is their language and how they control you.
