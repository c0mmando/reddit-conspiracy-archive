Save r/politics or any of the party affiliated offshoots and all the circus that goes along with that, there are posts at #1 on all with less than 300 comments. What the fuck is going on?! I am afraid that the sneaking feeling that I or anyone else are being censored is not just a sneaking feeling. I am only seeing the few posts that are approved to get through to me. I remember a day when this site was a bastion of free speech and a place that I knew I could hear what people think. Someone convince me these days are not gone...</p>
