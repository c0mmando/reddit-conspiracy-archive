       Just looking for some opinions on this; I think there's two possibilities when it comes to the ET question: 1) There exists an ultra secret, compartmentalized shadow government in the United States that has all but monopolied any small amount of ancient and ET technology, using it to construct breakaway civilizations and corporate combines that have beta-tested human interstellar affairs (fabricating aliens or at least most of them) since at least the 40's-50's, or 2) There actually is multiple (possibly dozens) ET species that have been involved with this planet for millennia, and they use us in various ways such as food, energy, entertainment, collateral etc, and they have given said shadow government incredible technology in exchange for the Cabal's loyalty. A few things to remember; human nature dictates that the strongest, most cunning, most morally neutral people will be risen to power. The keystone of this (these) theories is Nikola Tesla. This man was the the genius of the 20th Century, his work has led to over 4,000 patented inventions predominantly dealing with energy, sound, plasma, and anti-gravity technology. After Word War II and the death of Tesla in 1943, it became clear to interested parties that the Nazis had nearly perfected anti-gravity (US and Russia were more focussed on the Atom Bomb). Project Paperclip and Project Sign and others led the "read in" military, intelligence, and corporate agents to decide that the "UFO phenomenan" was to be completely secret. My question is, can we fault these men for their secrecy? I don't know. Put yourself in their shoes, perhaps dozens of powerful ET groups (which are likely competing with each other) have taken interest in humanity? What would you do? This would destroy our society in a matter of days. The Cabal already has their escape from the system as a contingency plan. They would leave us here to rot if Earth goes full crazy bitch on us with the climate. All I'm saying is we have to be open to the possibilities, the secrecy of our governments is not permissible morally, but it may have been necessary practically. Thoughts?

       The amount of eye whitness testimony and government documents proves it to be both. There seems to be so many things going on that understanding every aspect would be extremely difficult to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I also want to add that it is time for Disclosure and we the people should demand the truth. There are so many initiatives going on right now, it's quite synchronistic. Our previous generations decided to hide the truth. It is time we changed that order.

       Agreed, I tend to think it's possible that there is an alien presence in our solar system, but I have never personally seen one (and boy have I tried to spot one). It's a shame that people have been lied to and suppressed, but we can't dwell on the past. As far as these initiatives go, I simply don't trust them. Barring some kind of unveiling by the aliens themselves I don't think we can do anything to coerce the power structure into telling the truth before it's too late. I mean, people like Steven Greer seem cool, but they're in the pockets of the Cabal. David Icke and his reptilian theories as well, they're all seemingly disinformation. Who do we trust? Trust thyself. I'm prepared physically and mentally for confrontation, we all need to be.

       Here's how it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world goes haywire and the rich all escape.  In 20 yrs their things start breaking.  They think, that's ok, we'll just have our kids fix it because we don't know how.
      </p>
      <p>
       But their space montessouri schools didn't quite cut it, because they didn't have good teachers because the best teachers are all poories like us, left behind.  Or they thought they could teach with computer based training developed by 'us suckers', but they forgot their tech support guy because they've never respected him, even if he's brilliant and in the FBI (blacklist guy).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, their generation of kids are stupid from decades of inbreeding, which is what royals do in order to keep wealth in their family (historically this is what they do). SO their kids come out stupid because they've not perfected their eugenics and human genetic engineering yet and no, folks, no smart pills exist.  The best you can do is
       <em>
        pramiracetam
       </em>
       , and it's effects are very temporary and no they aren't 'limitless'.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in closing, these royals and elites will end up in space with equipment they won't know how to fix and so either Picard and his crew from the democratic, socialist / moneyless federation of planets will have to beam aboard to fix their technocratic civilization for them; and if that doesn't happen they all die.
      </p>
      <p>
       So take solace in knowing that you're useful because you know how to do things in the real world, that people who start out with money and make money off their money and only know how to move money around will NOT know how to do and will therefore kill themselves alone in the vast coldness of space and in the unflinching fairness of karma.

       In addition, what if the "greys" are the elites' descendants visiting from the future. They only appear as aliens due to decades of inbreeding, gene-splicing, eugenics etc. They visit us as a warning to the elites and help them with technology so that the elites of our timeline will not make the mistakes of the "greys" in that timeline. Although, I don't really think reverse time travel is possible...but your prompt got me thinking

       Haha I like what you said, but I don't know if I would be so quick to say these things. The elite didn't get there by being stupid. People like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs weren't born into Masonic families or royal dynasties. Some people just become successful and decide that they are better than everyone else, that they're special. In a way, their right. Manifest destiny, however made up and unfair it is, has placed them at the top. I think it's wishful thinking to believe that they will be punished in this life for their actions. We're too far gone, as a species. Now, in the next life, you can bank on justice being served. Who knows though. In the 3rd dimension, the law of the jungle rules.

       I believe alien-level tech exists.  Aliens dont.  The theory of aliens is to keep people from searching for who is mutilating their cows and abducting their family members.  It's humans with advanced technology, imo.  Look at all the believable abduction stories.  Most have humans as the pilots of the "alien" craft.

       Well, I can't claim to know whether or not there is/has been ET involvement in our society, but my feeling towards your question (what would I do if I were I'm their shoes... keep it secret or is their secrecy justified) lies in the film "they live." If you haven't seen it, do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the movie, there is a group of humans "the cabal" who are in on the secret that there are non human entities enslaving the people of the world without them knowing about it. If there is some semblance of truth I'm that scenario,  them I say fuck those people and their need for secrecy. Actively benefiting off the destruction and suffering of your fellow man is inexcusable regardless of the alternatives. You mentioned something like "what if this race of aliens would destroy instantly if we didn't play ball" ... again , fuck that.  What is the point of protecting am existence of slavery and perpetual suffering? Anyhoo, sorry for the rant and typos, I'm on mobile, bitches.

       I think it's a matter of perspective and looking at the bigger picture. By no means am I condoning those men's actions. However, I can empathize with them if they were in fact confronted by the sudden arrival of more powerful agencies; ET, inter-dimensional, demonic etc. On the other hand, I tend to lean towards the side where these "ETs" are fabrications. I've looked down some dark roads, I've seen some scary shit; and at the end of each road you find some psychopath or narcissist just trying to cause a ruckus. There exists thousands of disinformation agents. If there really are no aliens, and Tesla invented those things himself without ET involvement (which, he claims in his journals that ET helped him), then fuck these men. There would be no reason to hide these technological advancements from us. It's a difficult position they have put us in, but we have to ask the hard questions.

       The whole of the human race can be educated and greatly raised in its level of evolution, but there are powers in control of this civilization working diligently at making sure and keeping the society down.  There is inequality, and that inequality contributes to the lack of education that exists here.  With education will come the elevating of the human species, but an equalizing of the classes is needed in order for the proper educating of the masses to take place.  One cannot really have one without the other.  If there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       proper education, then the whole of the human species can rise in its level of evolution and not be looked upon as the “dirty, unwashed masses” that many of us are looked upon as.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of us
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       “dirty and unwashed”, but it’s because we are not being given the proper upbringing to rise above our mental/emotional/environmental condition.  If we
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       given the requisites, then we
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       simply rise above these criminal elements and be better as a people.

      <p>
       The reason we’re “dirty and unwashed”, however, is not because we are, somehow, inherently less or worse than the elite, but because the elite themselves make sure and keep us down.  What all of this means is that even though there are indeed some people that seem to be “better” than others, the vast majority of why that is is environmental and not internal or inherent.  If we were given better requisites, we would react concomitantly and rise up to become better.  The
       <em>
        entire society
       </em>
       could be better if we were simply given a better upbringing and teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a circular battle here because the reason some of us aren’t “worthy” is because we’re not being given the proper upbringing to BE “worthy”.  If we were given that upbringing, then most of us would, again, rise to the occasion.  As such, the whole “survival of the fittest” argument the elite use to justify their actions simply doesn’t stick.  The Cabal isn’t necessarily “the fittest”.  They might be “the evilest” or the “most conniving” or most willing to lie, shoot, steal, and kill in order to get ahead…but that shouldn’t necessarily be looked upon as anything that should make them “the best” in the society or the most worthy of moving ahead of everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn’t ultimately seem evolutionarily advantageous for a species to have that type of mentality, so I’d say the Cabal’s m.o. seems worse than better actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this being said, you are right in that there is a lot of evidence that there is very much a breakaway civilization, and the group has been using the Earth human population in a parasitic manner, feeding off of its resources as it were, so as to eventually become completely independent of it and then cast it off like a used husk.

       I think its much more complicated and deeper then that, then again in the end this Solar System could be nothing more then a zoo that is "protected" by those sentient beings (i suspect there are at least 3 different species that are involved since the beginning of the solar system) with simple interests or some higher reason.

       We can absolutely fault these people for their secrecy, and throughout the millennia, I might add. IF disclosure happens and ET life is admitted to exist and has visited us/is currently visiting and has mixed into the population (5th Wave type of stuff), how do you even trust that the information is truth when it is told to you by institutions that turned lying into a lucrative business since Babylonian times? Then take into account the religious aspect of it.....which would cause peoples' whole life belief system to come crashing down to unimagined-by-us proportions. I think those in power have probably looked into this component already, but I don't know if they've decided to hold off entirely, but the brakes on disclosure, or just say "fck it" and tell us.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes, I fault them. When we are thought of as ants or sheep or cattle, how can I not? Basically our entire lives will have been one big dangerous dupe. People have been conditioned with denials for ages, and now are expected to handle disclosure from cabal(s) that send us off to kill other humans for economic privelage or legacy?

       I understand where your coming from man, I really do. If it was up to me, free energy would have been made available decades ago and there would be no nation states. But this is the world we live in, it's not perfect. In fact, it's pretty dark. However, if you take into account the multi-verse and/or the possibility of humans not originating on earth, and possibly the human civilization here being genetically altered into a lower vibration (by various ET corporate interests who use us as commodities) then this whole thing gets blurry. Imagine being presented with all this power and being afraid of losing it because more powerful entities from an unknown planet or dimension have a stranglehold over you. I think it's very likely that their are good people in the shadow government who want this stuff to come out. It's only a matter of time before someone spills the beans.

       I think 1) is the most likely. As you mentioned, Russia and US were concentrating efforts on the atom bomb. But after WW2 we found the Nazi's were secretly working on some seriously advanced rocketry and anti-gravity propulsion devices. These devices were very secret as the Nazi's were hoping to extend the war long enough to deploy them unbeknownst to the allies. The US immediately saw military usage for these inventions, hence, operation paperclip and the creation of NASA. Remember, any large advancement in technology is indistinguishable from magic (i.e. alien tech). The us/nazi collective has been holding on to this technology as a trump card, testing it, perfecting it. Like a magician, they are waiting for the big reveal, but first they have to cleverly distract people with sleight of hand, relying on humans often shoddy memory. Sometimes they like to parade as aliens to keep people in check and distract people from real issues. Remember what Ronald Reagan said at his address to the UN. I'm paraphrasing but something along the lines of "I occasionally think about how our differences would fade if we were to encounter an alien threat". Basically, we have yet to see how the other boot in regards to the alien agenda. As sky projections and holograms become more and more believable, it will sure be crazy IMO. Perhaps they will use the aliens as saviors? intruders to unite the nations? or a depopulation mechanic? Time will tell

       Indeed, there are various possibilities. I think the savior play is their ace up their sleeve. Millions of people already worship aliens and billions of people would be astonished by them arriving here en masse. Personally I wish this would just hurry up and happen so I could laugh in people's faces and get the truth for myself. Maybe that's vindictive but I'm so fed up with people's adoration for governments and their "benevolent" protection of secrets "that are for national security."
