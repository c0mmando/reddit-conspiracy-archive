        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I&#39;ve been giving this a lot of thought.</p>

<p>I really want to know what was on that flash drive. But more importantly, he wanted us to see what was on that flash drive. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe his only plan was to get it on air. Not in the age of technology. He must have uploaded it somewhere knowing we would search for it if his on air plan failed. (Or he might have known that would fail all along, but that his story of a guy in a furrie suit would be on air and we&#39;d search)</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking we might need his name. Which they obviously won&#39;t release until they have searched for this info. Which means WE NEED TO FIND IT FIRST! </p>

<p>Instead of searching by myself, I thought we could all work together. </p>

<p>Note: I&#39;m also hoping he gave the info to somebody else to release upon his death. (Our best chance of gem not being able to get rid of it first) </p>

<p>Fact: he didn&#39;t have a real bomb
Fact: he wanted to stand out as a news story (panda suit)
Fact: he took 2 bullets before he went down with 3rd bullet
Fact: he claimed to have a flash drive we will never see
Opinion: whatever was on that flash drive, is something many people won&#39;t want us to see. 
Opinion: that info is out there for us to find. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s my whole point maggid. </p>

<p>Maybe he DID! But online content is only as good as the number of people who find it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve made a few things go viral. I know what it takes to make them go viral and this... Is a great way to make something go instantly viral. </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually easier than you might think to eliminate things from the Internet. </p>

<p>Even celebrity boobs can be suppressed and lots of people search for those. The thing about some conspiracy info, is it would die off. Nobody would search for it without a drastic approach like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now the other thoughthan of this is drugs, I don&#39;t want to think that but, why chocolate wrapped in tinfoil. Why not just strap a sign to your backee with a file name that can be searched. A user name or something that pplooks can look for. Take the flash drive somewhere to get duplicated. Post all over social media. Make an effort. So many questions. Why set the car on fire? That was like some sort of brain dead decoy maybe they&#39;ll pay attention think to the fire and forget about me... seems like drugs bath salts, salvia, extasy who knows what else.</p>

<p>This post got bogged down by Naysayers... </p>

<p>-The point of this post was to find other people who think that there was something of interest on that flash drive</p>

<p>-if you think he&#39;s just crazy, he is a kook, he was on drugs... I&#39;m not saying your wrong, but you&#39;re not helping at all. </p>

<p>-if you think there&#39;s a chance we can find this info and want to help, please reply to this post with ideas. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Here&#39;s where I&#39;m at. I&#39;m hoping getting Fox News to play his flash drive wasn&#39;t his only plan. </p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking we might need his name to locate the info, but I hope it&#39;s not that easy or any interested party will destroy the info. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also hoping he gave this info to a friend who will use the media attention to get the info out. </p>

<p>But...</p>

<p>On the off chance he was leaving clues with his strange approach, I&#39;d like to find/use said clues. </p>

<p>So far... </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>panda suit or whatever animal that was might be key</p>

<p>the chocolate bars might be a clue (used as pretend bomb) anybody know what kind they were? </p>

<p>this could be a username, search key words, hashtags, etc... </p>

<p>Yeah the video on here at about 4 minutes in is the security guard explaining what the flash drive had on it. </p>

<p>Anything astronomy. Liquid and gas sun. Didn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense. The governments wrong about anything they think they know about space? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably along the lines of this. </p>

<p>This is a story I am not going to cite anything. Use the internet you can easily prove everything I am about to say.</p>

<p>All food, water, and air we breathe has been manipulated to be worse for us. Sugar fogs our minds, so does fluoride, and most likely so do chem trails.</p>

<p>9/11 is an inside job and they used it to invade the middle east, take control of oil, and also import heroin through mass production of poppies in Afghanistan. Now they are even controlling a big pharma heroin over-dose medicine. I am predicting the future when I say heroin over doses will start to happen. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t grow our own food, we do not have our own water to drink. We are lied to every day through non-stop propaganda. Please realize the school system is a joke, it teaches us nothing people.</p>

<p>The powers that be control us through money and we are enslaved. They make us believe it is all about money when they purposely attempt to enslave us. They make infinite money for themselves. They put it all digitally so that the paper money won&#39;t have to circulate. If they want 1 million dollars they type it into a machine and give it to whoever they want. </p>

<p>They have bought our government and they all live like kings while attacking our health and brain. We as humans believe we need these things and must work to get them. In reality people just like them because it keeps them distracted.</p>

<p>If people didn&#39;t have technology to look at they would care a lot more about the devastating effects we as humans have already had on the world. We are quite literally dumb. We don&#39;t think about the big picture at all, we just go with the flow and do what we are told. </p>

<p>Break the chains people, nothing we have matters, think about it. A true world that we want would promote good health, not destroy it. If we want to eat animals if we had too many we would enjoy eating them. </p>

<p>If we weren&#39;t heartless we would have more compassion for each other, instead anyone with an opinion like my own gets shunned.</p>

<p>I only care about the truth. My gut tells me the truth is the complete opposite of what we currently believe. Everything. Everything could very well be backwards and people do not even realize it. All the food we eat is not natural, we believe natural things to be bad. We believe our doctors, we believe our superiors. </p>

<p>Break the chains it&#39;s all a big trick. At first it was good and we did benefit from all this. Those times are over, wake up. The poor are starving, we are killing people, we fight over nothing. Social justice in this country is so fucked it&#39;s irreversible I seriously believe. People cheer at death and pay no attention to people doing the right thing.</p>

<p>This is the belly of the beast people.</p>

<p>Edit: I am not saying the panda suit guy is crazy, I think he&#39;s smart, but he went about it in an insane way. All the conspiracies I spoke of do fit together. The truth will set you free, understanding the truth is a whole other level.</p>

<p>After reading the comments the astronomy thing resonates with me strongly. Watch out for June 20-22nd those are the days of the summer solstice and that&#39;s only 2 months away. Maybe the collapse, probably something much more sinister. I am thinking it&#39;s about time for a new pearl harbor again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not saying conspiracy theorists are crazy. I am truly saying all those conspiracies are true. If I am crazy for believing that so be it, everyone should be crazy with me then. I am only here trying to bring the human race together. People just don&#39;t understand how far this manipulation is going/has gone. We are completely controlled, everything we think matters doesn&#39;t matter at all. Everything we think doesn&#39;t matter, matters the most. </p>

<p>Black lives matter, that organization should have been made 200 years ago. Today we should have things like, the planet matters, the people matter, enslavement is bad, money is not power, truth matters. We can&#39;t even convince 50% of the population 9/11 is an inside job, how in the hell will we be able to convince them there is a better world we could start making right now. It doesn&#39;t involve planting trees or upping wages. It&#39;s really quite simple honestly, make enough food for everyone, share the technology that makes water out of thin air, give us good water purifiers. </p>

<p>Next make energy free like Nikolas Tesla intended 100 years ago. Move more things electronically to lower the amount of slave work that needs to be done. </p>

<p>After that is set in motion we should have about 6 billion unemployed people. I do not want to employ them to slavery I want to spread the knowledge and let the people decide what they want. If you want to live a life of food and water and taking care of your family and loving life that is for you. We are that far into technology they just do not want us to accept it.</p>

<p>The earth is a huge machine, if you control the circulation of water you can control where the crops grow. If you control everything the world turns into your playing ground, apparently they used it to make havoc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of trying to see something in an alternative view to see why someone thinks that way and to find a common middle ground, we try to silence and shame them. Do you realize how many people faught and died so you can have the right to say and believe what you want? So instead of supporting that right that not many other places in the world have, you try to strip it from them. Maybe you should try living in a place where people don&#39;t have this right. A place where you will be arrested or killed for trying to voice your own opinion. Maybe then you will realize how fortunate we are to actually have this right.</p>

<p>If the media really is controlled, they are not going to play this story. </p>

<p>Maybe a panda suit bomb threat isn&#39;t the best or only way to get that information into the hands of the people. But if you&#39;re desperate enough to get that information out, this sure is one way to do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anybody who knowingly came into contact with truly sensitive info would have been silenced immediately. </p>

<p>Maybe he has tried to get the info out and nobody took him seriously. </p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>Maybe he knew he only had one shot because they&#39;d kill him over the info. What better way to instantly get the whole world interested in what&#39;s on that drive than a stunt like this? </p>

<p>Hours ago. He was a nobody. Now because of this, he&#39;s not just national but world news. The panda suit made all the difference. Comedians, talk shows, and news outlets will all speak on this. </p>

<p>Also. The easier it is to find his info, the easier it would be to eliminate it. My point is. They think they stopped him. They will go to his house and destroy his computers. But if there is a hidden message as to where to find the info. A site like this will find it before the government will. </p>
