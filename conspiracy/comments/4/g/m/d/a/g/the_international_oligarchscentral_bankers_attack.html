        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The International Oligarchs, who happen to be Jews loyal to Israel, have had a monopoly on printing/creating the money since 1913 when the Federal Reserve Act was passed, it is absolutely absurd because this means that the all the money they print/create is paid back to them with interest, why anyone wants to allow the few people who comprise the International Oligarchs to have a completely monopoly on the Highest Power On Earth, which is the power to print/create the money can only be because they were bribed.</p>

<p>Hitler, seeing this, had Germany create a currency backed by work, not borrow from any central bank, and therefore obviously was a debt free currency, and because of this Germany hyper-prospered, and seeing this, and knowing that the rest of the world would see, and follow suit, the International Oligarchs false flagged Pearl Harbor, the same way they false flagged 9/11 to take down Saddam who was also having Iraq create its own currency, not borrowed from any of the International Oligarchs central banks.</p>

<p>After the International Oligarchs pulled Germany into war, they started lending Hitler money, and also lending the US money too, this is how they do it, they don’t give a f**k who they lend money to because they know that the debtor will never be able to pay it back with interest and then the International Oligarchs can take all the countries natural resources and land because of the default.</p>

<p>All Americans/Europeans/Russians must understand this, and that they cause of all the problems worldwide are being intentionally caused by this very small group of people, the International Oligarchs for the sole purpose of ruining countries so they have to borrow money from them, and to hide this scam from the American/European/Russian People.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iraq&#39;s central bank was made compliant with the world wide cartel as one of the most urgent priorities within months of our invasion </p>

<p>We changed the Iraq bank right away, and beneath  the radar of the American public.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Banking Law was issued September 19, 2003. The law brings Iraq’s legal framework for banking in line with international standards, and seeks to promote confidence in the banking system by establishing a safe, sound, competitive and accessible banking system.</p>

<p>Then we changed Afghanistan&#39;s central bank</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kabul_Bank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kabul_Bank</a></p>

<p>Then we changed Libya&#39;s central bank. Sorta looks like a pattern forming  at this point, no?</p>

<p>Syria&#39;s central bank is owned by Syria&#39;s own government and not the worldwide cartel. That is why the U.S. is destroying  their sovereignty.</p>

<p>The Syrian central bank has already been deprived of its homepage, which weakens their ability to do business while the entire country is having mountains of debt created, making them vulnerable to the world banking cartel.   </p>

<p><a href="http://www.banquecentrale.gov.sy">www.banquecentrale.gov.sy</a></p>

<p>Syria&#39;s central banks homepage  can  only be found now on the WayBack Machine.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150206001208/http://banquecentrale.gov.sy/main-eg.htm">http://web.archive.org/web/20150206001208/http://banquecentrale.gov.sy/main-eg.htm</a></p>

<p>They&#39;re being groomed to become debt slaves like nearly all of the other countries.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not operate an independent central bank.</p>

<p>Then next of course, we will change the central bank of Iran before the  smaller countries without a worldwide monopoly member  bank will give in.</p>

<p>If nothing serious has changed such as the status of the BRICS nations, That will be the end of the &quot;war on terror&quot;</p>

<p>It was and is, all about a central banking monopoly on the creation of money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a series of meetings, the United States — represented by then U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger — and the Saudi royal family made a powerful agreement. </p>

<p>According to the agreement, the United States would offer military protection for Saudi Arabia’s oil fields. The U.S. also agreed to provide the Saudis with weapons, and perhaps most importantly, guaranteed protection from Israel. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This Petrodollar System was the brainchild of Henry Kissinger and was given birth in the 1970s. It was a clever and diabolical system that enslaved everyone that needed asphalt for their roads and gasoline in their cars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But in 1973, then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger hatched a brilliant plan.</p>

<p>America had great military might and Saudi Arabia needed protection for its vast oil empire.</p>

<p>So, in a stroke of genius, Kissinger exchanged America’s military might for Saudi Arabia’s promise to sell oil exclusively in U.S. dollars.</p>

<p>Meaning, any country that wanted to purchase oil from OPEC was forced to
use U.S. dollars.</p>

<p>So anytime another country wanted to buy oil from the Middle East, they had to first convert their currency into U.S. dollars.</p>
