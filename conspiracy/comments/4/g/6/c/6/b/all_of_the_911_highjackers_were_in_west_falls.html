    <div class="md"><p>I worked about 200 yards from that mosque for 10 years, including during 9/11. Virginia has mostly county forms of governments, so that West Falls Church is simply an area of Fairfax County, one of the richest counties in the U.S. However, during the time I worked there, in last 90s and early 00s, it became heavily Hispanic, mostly from Central America. The mosque is build on very busy Route 7, three lanes in each direction, heavily commercial. 
I first became aware of the mosque in the late 90s when going to lunch or running errands on Friday that took me on Route 7, as the police would carefully stop all traffic to allow the Muslims to cross the busy street safely in very large numbers. Route 7 is also calls Leesburg Pike and was a major road that Union troops used on their way to the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861 (or First Battle of Manassas, as Southerners, including those in Viriginia call it.)
Their main service seemed to be about 2:00 in the afternoon. It&#39;s very near a major intersection called Bailey&#39;s Crossroads via an over pass. The road it goes over, Columbia Pike, runs straight to the Pentagon, about 3-4 mlles straight down the road. 
On 9/11, we were all glued to office TV, and did see the second airliner hit the World Trade Center live on TV.
Of course, it got very scary once the Pentagon was hit just down the road, the panicked evacuations of the White House and Congress, the false report of bombs going off at State Dept and other buildings.
The plane that hit the Pentagon must have flown very close over our heads as it headed towards the Pentagon. It did clip the 20 story building where my daughter lived with her boyfriend, across the major highway 495 from the Pentagon, easily in sight. Her boyfriend found parts of the airliner on top of their building, which the FBI came to collect quickly.
When the fighter jets showed up too late, they roared in at super sonic speeds, breaking the sound barrier. There was a series of boom, boom, booms overhead that set off panic in many nearby buildings. We watched from our buildings as hundreds of frightened people came running out of their offices.
The entire DC region shut down by around noon that day, and it was a nightmare driving home. 
This was also the prime hunting ground of the two DC snipers in 2002. They killed a lady FBI agent in the parking lot of the Home Depot further up Route 7, about two miles away from the mosque.
I used to go to a Gold&#39;s Gym on Route 7 just a few blocks away from Bailey&#39;s Crossroads. Police in reconstructing their rampage showed that they did spend one afternoon parked just across the other side of Route 7 from Gold&#39;s, looking for targets but decided not to hit that day.
They did kill a guy pumping gas at a station I used to use in the nearby town of Manassas, about 20 miles south, another at a gas station near King&#39;s Dominion where we had weekly passes.
In any event, West Falls Church has seen more than its sheer of Muslim terrorism this century.</p>
