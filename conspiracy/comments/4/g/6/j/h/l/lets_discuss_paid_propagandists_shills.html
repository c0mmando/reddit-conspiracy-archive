       So lots of talk has been going around over the past few months regarding a new take on propaganda. I'm talking, of course, about individuals who are paid to promote a certain point of view (or, as we like to call them, "shills"). When I first heard of these money-grabbing opportunists, I was outraged, seeing as how the act of spreading an opinion that may not even be your own and getting paid for it might be one of the slimiest moves you could pull on the internet. The intentional spread of misinformation at the hands of these morons has flipped social media upside-down to a point where you can't even get on Facebook without mindless spewing of politicrap memes. Shame. But it's even worse when these shills get up-close and personal with the people of the internet, hiding in forums and youtube comment threads, waiting for a chance to discredit information that opposes their employers. You may be thinking, "well, there are MANY differing opinions on the web, y u so paranoid about people arguing on the internet?" Well don't worry, I'm not absent-minded enough to overgeneralize like that; there's a certain type of attitude that comes with a suspected shill. Now stay with me here, but the best way I can describe it, is that know-it-all, sarcastic, if-you-disagree-with-me-you're-a-dumbass demeanor; their arguments littered with 4chan lingo (using green text layout, acronyms, etc.) These individuals attempt to make themselves look intelligent, tech-savvy, and in-the-know, giving the "untrained-eye" a sense of credibility for the individual. These individuals will use sarcasm and internet "inside-jokes" to make sensitive information seem invaluable. It's hard to explain the attitude I'm speaking of without providing an example (it's really just something you have to see for yourself, because even believing someone to be a shill is speculation in itself), but I'm sure many of you will know what I'm talking about. There are people out there, just like us, who have been using the Internet for as long as us, who have shared these forums with us, and are now using their ability to fit in online to grab some quick, dirty cash. So let's talk about this. How do we deal with these degenerates? Is it even reasonable to be suspicious of other forum users?

       Yeah, that's the conclusion I've come to: just ignore it. Who knows, maybe if you talk too much about sensitive topics in the presence of a shill, who's to say they won't pass your information on to someone higher up their ladder? Now THAT, I believe, is paranoia at it's finest, but... who knows.

       I doubt that. They use psychological techniques en masse, don't waste time over individual people. If people are waking up, it means their techniques are not working as expected, so they try different things. Fear is an important tool they use, just so you know...

       I agree it is easy to recognize the deliberate promoters or attackers by the language used.
      </p>

       We are seeing something that has been missing since around 2012, that is comments from many user IDs that contain almost word for word identical comments, and often as in the past, not particular to the comment or post they are making the comment on.

       They try to leave the last comment so as to be the final word of derision, That leaves the impression for future readers that you lost the debate. They tend to keep commenting long after the post  has been removed from s the sight of others by 'forum slide'.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of their main objectives is to waste your time to keep you occupied and not communicating with others in  any new (more  visible) posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many paid commenters, each concerned with different subjects, that they are able to overwhelm on any topic in which they have a stake. They will show up, for example at each and every mention of chemtrails. expect one here in five, four three two,...

       I wrote something about this a few months ago. Shills seem to be about controlling and censoring information and not on the premise of morality or righteousness either.  When dealing with shills you got to be a little more discerning than usual. The cunts appear on social media eg facebook and try to muddle the comment section. Porn sites and porn related discussions to brigade some types of porn. A few (very few) users on 4chan have caught on to that and even called them out on that behaviour on porn related topics.

       The only obvious clue for me is the use of emotional non-sequitur that derail the conversation. Lots of shills (and useful idiots) generate noise to drown out meaningful discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a way I'm a useful idiot because I'm so pessimistic about our chances to beat the shills.

       One trick I've learned to spot bots is their response times.
       <br/>
       If you make a long,thought out comment with links, the bots are the ones that reply with their own long thought out reply,complete with links and quotes in under a couple of minutes.
       <br/>
       Very,very few humans can read a post, digest and understand it, then come up with such a detailed reply as fast as they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it's not a bot replying, but an actual human, I also find it suspicious that they have such info at their finger tips,ready to throw it out there at a moments notice.

       Not that I'm waiting idly for the day to come, but shilling should be regulated. It wouldn't be unprecedented, given that similar regulations exist: bloggers have to disclose when they've been given a product for promotion, magazines have to disclose that paid advertorials are in fact advertisements, etc. Shills are advertisers, pure and simple, and they sure as hell should be regulated as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       But unless and until that day comes, I downvote and reply with logic. I also don't get emotionally invested in the outcome of an online debate because that's a waste of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also try keeping perspective and skepticism when it comes to Reddit's overall culture. For example, with vaccines: the number one demographic of those who don't vaccinate their kids is highly educated, wealthy, mainly white. This aligns with Reddit's core demographic, but one would never know it from the insane amount of vaccination propaganda. While there are of course people in favor of the full vaccination schedule, I am highly skeptical that they are as rabid as Reddit makes them appear. Same is true with the pro-GMO segment of Reddit.

       We need to push for mandatory online IDs or tags, but only if it's a bot doing the posting or if the poster is being payed for their time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any automated posting technology should be clearly identifiable as being software and not human. Any person posting for, or at the direction of, any organization, should have to disclose the name of that organization. Any organization that engages people in this manner should have full disclosure of ownership and financing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're just a person acting as an individual, no tag would be needed.

       I honestly think it's funny. If I could I'd be a shill. You just get paid to spew bull shit. Let's be real here: Obama wasn't born in USA. Our president isn't even qualified yet he's a leader, USA was founded on plundering other humans and stealing from them with deception and lies. It's fun to spread propaganda. I do it already in real life for the lols. Systems are broken, just abuse them
