    <div class="md"><p>Simple. Destroy the concept of gender and biological gender roles, and you destroy the core of any nuclear family. Without the family, you have isolated, easily manipulated people.</p>

<p>I know &#39;family values&#39; was an overplayed phrase from 1990-2005, but there&#39;s a legitimate reason for such things to exist. Getting your sense of culture, morality, tradition from the television/internet/media makes you malleable, weak, and impressionable. Family, community, tradition, etc are the only thing stopping this.</p>

<p>Attack masculinity, Attack femininity, Attack the basic organizing principle of our species. That&#39;s the plan. Destroy our fundamental grouping mechanisms and supplant them with pre-approved values systems.</p>

<p>You can see the effects of this currently in our cities, as well as in Europe - where an emasculated population can&#39;t muster the energy to stand up for itself.</p>

<p>This is the intended purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the fuck are you talking about? It is an attack on the classic nuclear family. Mother, father, kids. They want to, and have been pulling apart at the seams the idea of the traditional family. Want to know why? Because the family unit is a structure that is impenetrable. A stable family will fight to death for another family member. A Father will kill to protect his wife and his children. It&#39;s just biological fact. By attacking the nuclear family, they weaken these bonds. They want to weaken these bonds because ultimately they want you to feel that the state is your family, that all of your needs whether medical, philosophical, sexual -- they can all be addressed within the confines of the state. That way, if you are born into a family that has values that are at odds with the state, you have an attractive alternative other than making these values your own. They do not like anything that potentially severs the bond between your mind and their propaganda. They started this a long time ago by attacking Christianity, they did so in many various ways we can see. They did so by introducing buddhism, satanism, theosophy, agnosticism/atheism, hippie lifestyle; the counterculture movement was completely subverted by the CIA by the time the Manson murders happened. They were there the whole time; they engineered most of the events in our life; and I wish it weren&#39;t true but it is. For more on this; you might wish to start with one of my favorites; Miles Mathis. <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/">http://mileswmathis.com/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I didn&#39;t. OP asked why they&#39;re pushing the trans thing so aggressively. He did not ask why transgendered people have rights, why they have other freedoms, he specifically asked why the powers that be are AGGRESSIVELY pushing the transgender thing; again, like I said, they stress these culturally marxist values to break down all traditional ideas, such as the nuclear family. I am not against trans-gender rights, I am against any agenda being shoved down my throat, as are most posters here. </p>

<p>The idea is to destroy the family as one knows it, as another means of dividing and conquering mankind.</p>

<p>Feminism and public school are a part of it also. They do not want men being the leader of their households or the primary educators of their children.</p>

<p>Strong, masculine characteristics are being frowned upon, while politically &quot;correct&quot; pussy idiocy is being applauded in the media daily.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the sign someone is dismantling your nation from within and making it harder for the men who have historically protected said nation from the people doing so because they are a bunch of inundated pussies with bitch tits who regurgitate Western holocaust propaganda and applaud Israel for murdering children. </p>

<p>My father showed me through his own behaviour, why the patriarchy is as bad an idea as anything the Left suggest.  Dad was a serial adulterer and a moral hypocrite who was away from home most of the time, but who still wanted to be play head of the household when it suited him.  I&#39;ve also virtually never heard of a fundamentalist Christian preacher and stereotypical &quot;pillar of the community,&quot; who while delivering the sermon on Sunday morning, wasn&#39;t also secretly sodomising his daughter on the bathroom floor during weeknights.</p>

<p>Moral depravity is everywhere.  The Left don&#39;t have a monopoly on it, and the Right aren&#39;t free of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that social movements are a bit like a pendulum swing. It used to be that homosexuals and TG&#39;s were looked at as mentally ill, or just perverts. As such, they were subjected to all kinds of social abuse.</p>

<p>Then came civil rights. Things began to swing away from abuse and towards neutrality. But like anything else, you always get people who want to &quot;outdo&quot; everyone else. So with gays and transgenders, someone was always there to push things a bit farther.</p>

<p>Now we&#39;ve had 3 decades of political correctness. The pendulum has swung almost all the way to the other end. Today, normal, traditional heterosexual behavior is actually frowned upon. Today, you get SJWs and all kinds of social &quot;activists&quot;. In another place and time, these people would be recognized as being just another type of extremist.</p>

<p>Like any other kind of extremist, they also have keeners within their groups. People who will try and be a better &quot;rights advocate&quot; than anybody else. They will keep on pushing until regular people start to push back. Just watch and see.</p>

<p>Until then, just recognize that there&#39;s a bunch of social extremists on the loose and you&#39;re one of the few people who can see what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Inequality is terrible. I really feel bad for Jay Z, Kanye West, Lebron James, Tiger Woods, Barack Obama and all the other poor black american children that never grew up to be anything because of racist white folk! </p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely a divide and conquer strategy, but if we&#39;re talking averages, blacks still rank lower in the hierarchy than whites. You think a lot of white folks rent? A lot of black folks can&#39;t even afford to rent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very simplistic way of looking at things.  It&#39;s not wrong, just simplistic.  It doesn&#39;t address the bigger issues.  Yes every person SHOULD take responsibility for their situation, but life doesn&#39;t work like that and it never will.  </p>

<p>The hierarchy of our economy depends on people filling the bottom rungs, it&#39;s the only way the pyramid scheme keeps working.  It&#39;s not possible to have everybody working as a manager for example even if everyone is perfectly qualified.  In fact in that scenario all that would happen is wages would plummet as supply increased, which is exactly what has been happening in our economy.  </p>

<p>People today have to work harder to get more skills to earn lower wages than their folks did, and they have to go into more debt to have the basic necessities of life.  And why do we have to go into more debt to pay $400,000 for some shoddy plywood house or take $40k out just to go to school?  Just so that bankers, wall street, and CEOs responsible for inflating these bubbles can take more for themselves and put more points in their over-inflated bank accounts.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to sit there and whine about personal responsibility and completely ignore the failings of this broken and completely rigged system, I don&#39;t know what to tell you.  Maybe get your head out of the sand.</p>

<p>Gender dysphoria is a mental illness and cross dressing is deviance. Doesn&#39;t mean you are a &quot;lesser human&quot; (what the hell does that even mean?) It just means you suffer from a psychological dysfunction, same as many other people with a mental illnesses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sexual deviance and gender dysphoria are labels attached to people by state-certified evaluators using a checklist---originally developed by US military intelligence to identify non-conformist, potential dissidents--that takes them roughly 10 minutes to run through.

<p>I recognize that both or are actually right.  This isn&#39;t moral relativism, this is looking at the situation from the perspective of choice: you can choose to walk into a psychiatrists office and become immediately labeled as defective in one of many possible ways.  </p>

<p>Gender nonconformity isn&#39;t a mental illness. According to the DSM, gender dysporia requires distress.

<p>So, in other words, &quot;sex&quot; is real, and biologically based, while &quot;gender&quot; is a social construct.</p>

<p>Those who have &quot;unique&quot; &quot;gender identities&quot; are not particularly different than role players and cosplayers that identify as &quot;elfs&quot; or &quot;unicorns.&quot;</p>

Studies consistently show that both androphilic and gynephilic male-to-female transsexuals show a shift towards the female direction in brain anatomy, intermediate between male and female.[105][106][107] Brain-based research has also shown that female-to-male transsexuals have several male-like characteristics in their neuroanatomy.[108]
The cause seems to be biological according to several studies as you can see. 
Also, I never said anything about unique gender identities? Can you explain why you brought it up?</p>

You lost the argument there, even though in my opinion you are absolutely right. It is as simple as if you have a penis you use the men&#39;s room. The men&#39;s room is not the washroom for those who identify as male, it is the washroom for those who have the same sexual reproductive organs. Penis with the other penises, vaginas with the other vaginas, it has nothing to do with identification. That, I think, is what this is all about. You are asking others to be inconvenienced so that you can feel like a normal person, but you are not a normal person, you are transgendered, so either we have to create an entirely new bathroom just for LGBT, or you just piss in the men&#39;s room. </p>

<p>I hope you enjoy having people who look and act like ladies in every way stand at a urinal with you (or your male family members), then. Observing proper urinal spacing protocol of course, we&#39;re not barbarians.</p>

<p>And I hope you enjoy having people who look and act like men in every way sit in the stall next to you (or your female family members), as well. Transmen exist and they are short little bundles of testosterone and sinew.</p>

<p>The group of men who claim to be women to assault people in the bathroom is tiny compared to the group of transwomen and transmen. Most transpeople are following the social rules based on the gender that <em>everyone reacts to them as</em>, not the ones based on what was between their legs when they were born, when they choose a bathroom; should we all start pissing in what looks like the &quot;wrong&quot; bathroom just because of a tiny group of criminals?</p>

<p>Asserting that someone is &quot;mentally ill&quot; and &quot;deviant&quot; is not an opinion, it&#39;s a malicious personal attack. ಠ_ಠ</p>

<p>You can&#39;t make assertions and then claim that they are opinions. That&#39;s not how written language works.</p>

<p>The more we accept disgusting behaviour and tolerate it, the less control we have over our lives and communities. We simply tolerate everything. </p>

<p>This also plays into pushing people from the norm of starting families and being normal (especially white people) into persuing self-interest. Which leads to materialism.</p>

<p>This uproots European values and makes one more thing acceptable.</p>

I came out of puberty in the previous category and I&#39;m convinced it was from eating a modern industrial diet with zero concern for health effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Free Tibet&quot; is a perfect way to virtue signal, as it&#39;s half way around the world and the bad guys are Chinese, essentially opponents of America. So it&#39;s cost-free to signal about freeing Tibet.</p>

<p>Now, free Palestine? That would get some push back.</p>

<p>Since transsexuals are a tiny, fringe minority, and most people will never even meet one, it&#39;s also basically cost free to signal over them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also a great way to overturn representative government. Anytime a state government passes some religious freedom law, the Corporate CEOs from Apple and Disney will helicopter in and denounce the citizens and threaten economic sanctions. </p>

<p>Progressives will, of course, side with the rich 1% and cheer as the 99% get denounced by the large corporations. Then, unelected judges will simply overturn the will of the people and declare whatever legislation they passed &quot;unconstitutional.&quot;</p>

<p>Social issues are, of course, just the stalking horse. Judges are now turning over social laws, soon enough the people will be overturned on economic issues as well. See Citizens United, for one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sanders’ specific proposals would:</p>

<p>Stop large corporations from stashing their profits in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens to avoid paying U.S. taxes.  Legislation already introduced by Sanders would raise more than <strong>$590 billion over the next decade.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it sounds like he&#39;ll be stopping about 18% of that, from the US, but &#39;how&#39; is the big question. Sounds more like an inside hit. And there are other ways to handle such funds...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Establish a Wall Street speculation fee to ensure that large financial institutions pay their fair share in taxes.  A speculation fee of 0.03 percent on the sale of credit default swaps, derivatives, options, futures, and large amounts of stock would reduce gambling on Wall Street, encourage the financial sector to invest in the productive economy, and reduce the deficit by $352 billion over 10 years. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds &quot;nice&quot; but it would just result in them offloading the cost onto some other industry or body. And at a time when we&#39;re moving away from that construct... interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>End tax breaks and subsidies for big oil, gas and coal companies to reduce the deficit by more than $113 billion over the next 10 years.  The five largest oil companies in the United States have made more than $1 trillion in profits over the past decade.  Exxon Mobil is now the most profitable corporation in the world.  Large, profitable fossil fuel companies do not need a tax break.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;ll push back. This is how you get $10 / gallon gas. You&#39;ll have to suck their dick as you drive the knife in... and the first shot must kill. It&#39;s the only one you&#39;ll get. The proposed plan is Andy of Mayberry takes on the mob...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tax capital gains and dividends the same as work.  Taxing capital gains and dividends the same way that we tax work would raise more than $500 billion over the next decade.  The top marginal income tax for working is 39.6 percent, but the top tax rate on corporate dividends and capital gains is only 20.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;The same as work.&quot; Interesting language. This will only damage small businesses that will be making even less of their meager capital. </p>

<p>Does no one understand that you can&#39;t take out AT&amp;T without an alternate form of communication in place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the trans agenda, it&#39;s rather simple why this is happening, but nobody really wishes to talk about it. Lots of attention has been given to phytoestrogens, ie, plastic, soy, etc, and while these things are not <em>good</em> things, the bigger issue is pharmaceutical estrogens and progestins basically manipulating the epigenetics of the human race. </p>

<p>A big example of this with a lot of information about it was DES. Diethytlstilbestrol. This drug, a synthetic estrogen, was used to prevent miscarriages in the 1950s. 3mg per day was enough to chemically castrate an adult male, and 15mg over the course of a rooster&#39;s life was enough to turn it into a &quot;chicken.&quot; The doses used for miscarriage prevention were sometimes up to 100mg per day. So, at least regarding males, many males born to mothers taking DES came out basically intersexed, with malformed genitalia, and generally very low testosterone levels. Even the current generation, third generation, suffer according to the CDC, higher rates of epididymal cysts, hypospadias, etc. With DES, likely the reason the 3rd generation is affected is because most of a woman&#39;s eggs are formed in the womb, so the eggs are exposed to DES. And many people were exposed to just this drug alone. Today other drugs, notably progestins are being used to prevent miscarriages and for IVF. So when a baby is exposed to these drugs, if the baby is a he, he&#39;ll have cut off testosterone production in the fetus for that time, thus neurologically he&#39;ll develop as a female until testosterone production is restored. This likely an explanation for the higher rates of &quot;autism&quot; today, you have people with in essence, intersexed brains. It&#39;s also why speaking as a generality, many men look &quot;softer&quot; today, and testosterone levels have plummeted. But for women, many of these drugs cause ovarian and breast cancers, along with PCOS, which is elevated androgen levels, basically masculinizing the women as well. Couple this with all the environmental estrogens like BPS/BPA, the estrogens being used in agriculture, widespread use of birth control (even if the mother is fertile again, the artificial estrogen metabolites are still loaded up in the body...) etc, and it&#39;s a giant perfect storm of gender confusion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my conclusion that this all was started purposely in the 1950s with the introduction of drugs like DES, birth control, etc, and then babies being natally exposed to these drugs. The pharma manufacturers obviously knew they&#39;d be messing people up and that the drugs did nothing to help infant mortality, but brought them to market anyway. So this leads me to believe that this was done purposely with the idea of it all being a ticking time bomb of sorts that&#39;s exploding now, and done as a giant conspiracy to confuse the genders and weaken people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very easy to see this as only just a moral issue, but I think that&#39;s quite the wrong way to look at it. It&#39;s a legitimate medical issue, and most of the people that are trans likely are because of these drugs biologically screwing them up, and they literally are stuck a bit between genders. However, part of it again that makes it a conspiracy, is that instead of standard treatment protocol being trying to hormonize people back from say, male, to more male, they&#39;ll say &quot;oh, you have GENDER IDENTITY blah blah blah&quot; and then the psychiatrists/etc will convince them to become females. It&#39;s very funny when a medical system makes it easier to get drugs to go from man to a woman or vice versa than trying to get, say, more testosterone to be more manly, which is what we&#39;re seeing in Western medical systems now. </p>

<p>Long post, but I thought it was relevant to this discussion. Most of these trans people have real medical issues, just it&#39;s all being framed in a psychological &quot;gender identity&quot; type of stupidity rather than saying &quot;yeah the reason you feel like that is some pharmaceuticals messed you up in the womb.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d also like to point out in athletics, they are allowing transgender men to compete as &quot;women&quot; without surgery, as long as their testosterone is below 272ng/dl. (Normal range 250-1200ng/dl, however in the 1950s when they started measuring, it was 400-1200ng/dl, so politicized there, too. Also my doctor was telling me they&#39;re thinking of lowering the range to 200ng/dl, wonderful.) A natural women&#39;s testosterone level generally is not over about 70ng/dl. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, they will deny a therapeutic use exemption for a man to use testosterone even if he is 200ng/dl or below in some cases. So it&#39;s very funny, they say 270ng/dl is low enough to be a &quot;woman&quot; but then deny men to go above it because it&#39;s &quot;normal.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mostly lurk around here but this is one thread that I feel obligated to comment on. While I fully believe the non elite are continuously being oppressed by many ways, along with believing in many of the major conspiracies discussed here - I have to call bullshit on the theory that it&#39;s a conspiracy.</p>

<p>At best, it&#39;s an election year. That&#39;s pretty obvious. But as a straight, married woman with a family, in no way to I see the acceptance of LGTB acceptance and rights as a threat to myself or my family. My sister is gay, along with a few of my friends. I don&#39;t knowingly know anyone who is transgendered, but that&#39;s beside the point. Aside from politicians reaching out for another vote, many people (both LGTB and straight) are pushing for equal rights. There have always been people who felt that they were born into the wrong body, just as there have always been people who have struggled with a sexuality that didn&#39;t fit the traditional mold. I could care less what someone&#39;s sexual orientation is, or how they identify. Whether they were born male and identify as female, or vice versa. In no way do I think the lifestyle of others threatens myself or my family any more than a &quot;normal&quot; heterosexual. </p>

<p>I imagine people feel like &quot;they are pushing the transgender thing&quot; due to recent issues regarding transgenders and which bathroom they can use. Recently Target spoke out and said they don&#39;t give a fuck, that people can use restrooms for the gender that they identify with. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, that it&#39;s something else that makes people feel like the issue is being pushed... But it&#39;s ridiculous to make that into it being forced.</p>

Maybe the youth are starting to step forward into the Age of Aquarius where gender, race, sexuality etc are all fluid... it could be the powers that be trying to destroy families... or maybe the powers that be set up strict patriarchal binaries in the the first place and we are seeing them be deconstructed... </p>

<p>Creating a society where trans people are treated like human beings, instead of treating them like joke punchlines in the media, and making their lives hell IRL and driving them to suicide.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s the 21st century, we have computers that can fit in your pocket and self-driving cars, but so many people cling to their antiquated notions of gender.  They&#39;d rather be hate-filled bigots than simply mind their business about something that has nothing to do with them or affect their life in any way.  Some of y&#39;all ought to be ashamed of yourself.  If being trans is a mental illness, it&#39;s not nearly as society-destroying as the mental illness of being willfully-ignorant bigots.</p>

<p>Um, no, there is nothing &quot;antiquated&quot; about our notions of sex and gender. What is actually &quot;antiquated&quot; is the idea that sex is malleable and humans evolution had no effect above the neck. It&#39;s the &quot;liberal creationists&quot; that believe in the &quot;blank slate&quot; theory that have &quot;antiquated notions&quot; about humanity.</p>

<p>It&#39;s 2016, I can believe we still have nutjobs thinking that they can fix a brain disorder by physical mutilation of people&#39;s genitals. What next, bringing back leeches to bleed people?</p>

<p>The rules here can boiled down to this. You can say controversial stuff, and voice very harsh opinions about pretty much whatever you want, as long as you don&#39;t explicity abuse/insult <strong>other users of the sub</strong>. This is to prevent every other post spiralling out of control into invective and vitriol.</p>

<p>The current media blitz foisting trannies on everyone is tedious, but there is no contra &quot;agenda&quot;, and we don&#39;t censor. However, don&#39;t expect other users of this sub to agree that anything pushed by governments and the MSM constitutes &quot;free thought&quot;! As I said, you can post whatever ideas you want (as long as they are relevant to the sub), just don&#39;t call people &quot;fucking idiots&quot; when they disagree with you.</p>

<p>Creating a society where white men are treated like human beings, instead of treating them like joke punchlines in the media, and making their lives hell IRL and driving them to suicide. (We r teh highest!)</p>

<p>It&#39;s the 21st century (Always this year/century dropping bullshit like brainwashed Manchurian candidates), we have computers that can fit in your pocket and self-driving cars, but so many people cling to their antiquated notions of race. They&#39;d rather be hate-filled bigots than simply mind their business about something that has nothing to do with them or affect their life in any way. Some of y&#39;all ought to be ashamed of yourself. If being a white male is a mental illness, it&#39;s not nearly as society-destroying as the mental illness of being willfully-ignorant bigots.</p>

<p>White men have always existed; Get over it.</p>

Studies consistently show that both androphilic and gynephilic male-to-female transsexuals show a shift towards the female direction in brain anatomy, intermediate between male and female.[105][106][107] Brain-based research has also shown that female-to-male transsexuals have several male-like characteristics in their neuroanatomy.[108]
The cause seems to be biological according to several studies as you can see. 
Also, I never said anything about unique gender identities? Can you explain why you brought it up?</p>
