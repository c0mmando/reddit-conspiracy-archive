<p>You&#39;ll notice many are prefaced by the word, <em>&#39;Project&#39;</em>, typically by the CIA or other international intelligence agency.  This may give you the idea that these are just &#39;typical operations&#39; of our government.  After all, &quot;the world is always at war and you need spies&quot;.  Or do you?  Especially in a technocratic world where everyone can talk to everyone, around the world.  I challange that assumption.</p>

<p>May I remind you that the definition of conspiracy is two or more operating in secret to cause harm.  So when the CIA assassinates world leaders in secret, it does harm to them but not to US citizens because they are operating on our behalf.  In this way, we justify their bad behavior. I want you to reevaluate the &quot;causes harm&quot; part behind their behavior.  By deposing dictators and playing chess with the planet, have they really made us safer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>me?  16?  someone is projecting I think.  the &#39;tea party&#39;  was a metaphor for the kind of action that needs to be taken.  a revloution does end up having to kill people if civil disobedience doesn&#39;t work first.  did you not pay attention in history class?  I said we don&#39;t need to kill people yet, not that it might not have to happen if things still do not improve.  pay attention to history and politics your freshman year of highschool, you obviously missed out so far.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being civil is the core of rational debate. You have no idea who I am, my level of education or IQ, where I&#39;m from, what life experiences I&#39;ve had etc. You also don&#39;t know that for the other posters.  But by doing this you reveal to me that you are antagonistic and therefore are psychologically weak also the fact you think others have been raised in a bubble means you believe you have not. Probably someone else in your life calls you these names and this is a way for you to vent. Probably easy to get you riled up. That&#39;s in Art Of War as one of the potential faults of a general.  </p>

<p>No, they have not.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not really. The Apollo missions were quite impressive, but what we know now makes it fairly apparent that <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf">the measures they took to avoid radiation exposure</a> were not sufficient for long-term missions like those that would take astronauts to Mars or the asteroids.</p>

<p>As far as the Van Allen belts go, getting through those regions is actually quite difficult and the method used by Apollo doesn&#39;t really work for modern missions which have very different weight profiles. Shielding the astronauts is key, but more importantly (if you want them to live at all) you have to be able to absolutely shield the electronics and still keep your craft light enough that it can carry sufficient fuel to inject it into its trajectory.</p>

<p>So yes, we&#39;re talking about a foil (the goal is to reduce weight as much as possible, so clearly if there is a metal that can work in thin sheets it would be used) but tin would not fit the metric (nor would aluminum which is what &quot;tin foil&quot; typically is made of).</p>

<p>This is incorrect. Of the Apollo-era astronauts a minority were Masons (which Masonic sites are all too <a href="http://freemasoninformation.com/masonic-education/famous/masonic-astronauts/">happy to list</a>). But the fact that any were is usually enough to stoke the conspiracy flames.</p>

<p>Read my sentence again. Not all that is called ad hominem meets the definition. </p>

<p>Let me tell you a story about illumination. When I was a kid, the very first conspiracy theory I ever heard about is that light bulb manufacturers collude to shorten the life span of their product so they can sell more. I still distinctly remember the reasons given for why that is a conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>Yet they did conspire. It is &quot;Wikipedia-true&quot;. </p>

<p>So when your reasons why NASA landed on the moon sound just like the reasons for why a healthy market will self-regulate and manufacture the best product at the best price, you are doing it wrong. </p>

<p>The point is you provided no real data. A strong technical, logical argument was presented, and you tried to distract from it. It was fair game to let lurkers know you are a sympathizer. </p>

<p>Well, a healthy market will self-regulate. That&#39;s not to say that any given market (or even any possible market if you&#39;re of a socialist mindset) is healthy. But I fail to see the &quot;argument&quot; that I made regarding NASA that sounded like an economic argument... All I did was point out the science and the fact that the science is pretty clear on this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point is you provided no real data.</p>

<p>Well, I did is the problem. Perhaps you&#39;ve forgotten. See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4g7jay/updated_compilation_of_confirmed_conspiracy/d2flv5b">my original comment</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A strong technical, logical argument was presented</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, let&#39;s look at that argument:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NASA have also implicitly admitted to their Moon landings hoax.</p>

<p>“We must SOLVE these challenges before we send people through this region of space!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the claim here is that someone from NASA said that, for long-term missions we have radiation-related issues to sort out in modern missions. This is then used to assert that in short-duration missions in the past, we clearly had not solved the radiation problems.</p>

<p>The issues I raised with this are a) the solutions to those problems are a matter of public records b) the problem with applying those to long-term missions that contain modern materials is also a matter of public record.</p>

<p>I linked to part of that public record and the rest is trivially searchable, now that you know what you&#39;re looking for. Have at it. You&#39;ll find that it comes down to materials science, weight, the extreme variability of solar weather (note the comments in the paper I linked to about this, it&#39;s key) and duration of mission.</p>

<p>I was once a huge NASA fanboi. If I defend the arguments against NASA hoaxery, it is not out of a belief system, but from drawing logical conclusions, and weighing the arguments for and against the conspiracy theory, and comparing them with other conspiracy theories on topics I&#39;m more knowledgeable about than rocket science. And there is a distinct pattern in the arguments for the plutocratic system, for the official 9/11 explanation and NASA VFX. </p>

<p>Within the context, a NASA scientist said they are working on a problem that <em>must</em> have been solved decades ago, at least in principle, if man <em>really</em> went to the moon. Whether the destination is Mars or Moon, the Van Allen Belt is in the way in either case. And it is just one of many problems with the official explanation, as so often. Bring them up all at once, they are dismissed as gish gallop. Bring them up one by one, each is just a &quot;coincidence&quot; or must be attributed to the &quot;crippled epistemology&quot; of the &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;. Be it the Ponzi scheme that usury is, be it the mechanics of top-down collapses of steel skyscrapers or be it the exploration of so-called &quot;outer space&quot;. </p>

<p>It is about the form of the argument, the pattern of handwaving, the style of discussion. You are using it. Schopenhauer would be proud. </p>

<p>We know well how the discussion went. You linked to a pdf that does not support the claim you are making. <a href="/u/Ambiguously_Ironic">/u/Ambiguously_Ironic</a> was even friendly enough to point out a reasonable argument why it might not be an ad hom in this case: &quot;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s really an ad hominem if you&#39;re a Mason like almost all NASA astronauts were/are. Masons often stick together and defend each other.&quot; </p>

<p>So the part you are missing is: it is not about the moon mission, you are probably opposed to a great deal of other conspiracy theories too, as you have indicated, because you have... &quot;facts&quot;. The issue at hand is whether you, as a member of a religious cult, would make an objective judgement of the case at hand... or whether your loyalty to a cause clouds your judgement.

<p>Correct</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NASA 201x: we gotta find out how to pass the van Allen belt first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect. You&#39;ve taken part of a statement out of context. For extended missions with radically different materials and radically different technologies, we have to solve different problems that become an issue in many places, the VA belt being one of those places.</p>

<p>In 1969 through the 1970s, the radiation exposures of the crew are well documented in the document I linked to. You&#39;ll see that the number of rads is quite variable and depends on solar activity at the time. In one mission, the exposure levels were quite high, amounting to a little more than the highest dose you would get in a modern CT-chest scan (the highest dosage used for non-radiotherapy purposes). That&#39;s not terribly good, but on a short mission it&#39;s entirely reasonable.</p>

<p>On a longer mission, it&#39;s an unacceptable starting point, however, and solar activity can vary even more... essentially we played the odds and won, but the more missions you run at those altitudes, the more risk there is that you will hit a solar event, at which point your crew is BBQ. <em>That</em> is the problem that needs to be solved.</p>

<p>The larger problem that needs to be solved is with respect to long-term missions. Even with the sort of shielding we can build today with light materials, the exposure over the course of years (which a mission to Mars would be, for example, is entirely lethal). There&#39;s just no way around that. If you take the exposure of the Apollo astronauts and multiply it by a dozen or two... that&#39;s unacceptable exposure.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the issue of technology. Modern electronics are much harder to harden than the sorts of equipment we sent up with Apollo, but today&#39;s space program couldn&#39;t really do the work it needs to do with 1960s electronics (just compressing a video feed requires electronics that are vastly more sensitive to high energy particles and radiation).</p>

<p>These are all hard problems. There are a number of solutions on the drawing boards, and lots of testing is necessary. Basically, if the Apollo program had been aimed at Mars or long-term missions to the moon, they would not have been able to succeed. It was their duration and a certain amount of good solar weather that lead to their success.</p>

<p>You misunderstand the nature of ad hominem. Ad hominem need not be insulting at all.

It doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s anything wrong with being from Stanford.

<p>It isn&#39;t cause and effect, and I haven&#39;t made that argument, but I would say that secret society members are automatically difficult to trust for obvious reasons.  And I find it interesting that a lot of the most famous astronauts in history were all members of the same one.  It&#39;s only one data point of many that make me distrustful of NASA, but if nothing else it shows how large of an influence masons have on society.  And not just &quot;society&quot; but specifically (as the masons in NASA prove) government, science, engineering, and space travel.</p>

I have many reasons for believing that to be the case from scientists like Tesla&#39;s work to the Thorium coverup to anecdotal evidence from engineers I&#39;ve been personally acquainted with, its not exactly proven, but fairly logical to assume that the supposed 5 year gap between civilian and govt tech is at least 15 and probably more true is that there are entire fields of study that have never gone public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m of that school of thought as well.  I think it&#39;s being kept secret and hoarded specifically because those who have it <em>know</em> it could help to free us and they don&#39;t want that.  Even if it&#39;s only as simple as the fact that it would cut into their profit margins if we were to move away from oil or rockets or AC current, that would probably be enough for those who own these massive corporations and this technology to try to keep it hidden.  And we can assume or at least speculate that there may be other reasons beyond simple profit as well.</p>

<p>Think of it this way.  We&#39;re in the year 2016 and we&#39;re still using Tesla&#39;s AC current from a century ago, we&#39;re still using rocket propulsion that functions in basically the same way as the rockets we had during WWII or the &#39;60&#39;s at the latest.  Where are all the advances?  Why was all of Tesla&#39;s work classified when he died and continues to be so until the present day?  There are reasons for these things.</p>

<p>Any questions you have I&#39;d be happy to address but the notion that we control the world the way you think is laughable.</p>

<p>But I do believe there are other factions in the world with their own agenda that control the media to placate the general public and divert attention away from themselves. </p>

<p>Your list has 10 of the most famous Apollo astronauts</p>

<p>Okay, great.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Masons are a tiny fraction of the population and yet the Apollo missions were full of Masonic influence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the 1960s, Masonic membership was still at its post-war heights and a larger percentage of war veterans were members than the average population because they tended to join Lodges while in military service. The numbers are not shocking if you&#39;re a student of history. Still, these are not a majority of the members of the program, not even close!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the secrecy that&#39;s the biggest issue, the non-transparency.  Symbols are just symbols and masons don&#39;t have a monopoly on them.  In fact, I don&#39;t even find most of their symbolism even very interesting or profound, most of it is just stolen from earlier religions and doctrines.  But secrecy breeds suspicion for obvious and justified reasons, and a lot of Freemasons have a defensiveness to them when questioned that doesn&#39;t do them any favors either.</p>

<p>I do agree that there are much higher levels of power than simply saying, &quot;It&#39;s the masons&quot;, but even so we have to acknowledge how many masons have found themselves in positions of vast influence over the last 300+ years.  To ignore it or act like it&#39;s a total non-issue is naive at best.</p>

<p><strong>Yes.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it completely outside the realm of  possibility that the scientist who in fact theorized, analyzed, and ultimately aggrandized their existence into the research field of magnetospheric physics, which would grow to involving more than 1,000 investigators in more than 20 countries; 11 years prior to the Apollo 11 lunar mission itself -- that any amelioration whatsoever wouldn&#39;t come about in this time?</p>

<p>Yes, there is deadly radiation in the Van Allen belts; this was hypothesized by the man after which they would be named. In 1958, James Van Allen had chosen to equip the Explorer 1 [the first satellite of the United States] with a Geiger-Muller tube, which would ultimately confirm his theory of radiation surrounding the Earth.</p>

<p>The Van Allen belts span only about 40° of Earth&#39;s latitude -- 20° above and below the magnetic equator. The diagrams of Apollo&#39;s translunar trajectory printed in various press releases are not entirely accurate. They tend to show only a two-dimensional version of the actual trajectory. The actual trajectory was three-dimensional. The highly technical reports of Apollo, accessible to but not generally understood by the public, give the three-dimensional details of the translunar trajectory.</p>

<p>Each mission flew a slightly different trajectory in order to access its landing site, but the orbital inclination of the translunar coast trajectory was always in the neighborhood of 30°. Stated another way, the geometric plane containing the translunar trajectory was inclined to the earth&#39;s equator by about 30°. A spacecraft following that trajectory would bypass all but the edges of the Van Allen belts.</p>

<p>Side-note: In July of 1962, Van Allen himself addressed the American Rocket Society on radiation and Apollo. The protons of the inner Van Allen belt, he said, could be a serious hazard for extended manned missions. But, he went on, it might be possible to clear out that radiation by detonating a nuclear payload in the vicinity. The additional material might give the particles the extra energy they needed to escape the Earth’s magnetic field. America’s nuclear testing program of the early 1960’s was called Operation Dominic. Within this program was a group of atmospheric tests named the “Fishbowl” events designed to understand how nuclear weapon debris would interact with the Earth’s magnetic field in the event of nuclear war. The highest of the Fishbowl events was one called Starfish Prime. This test saw a 1.4 megaton bomb detonate at an altitude of 250 miles. Rather than clear out the inner Van Allen belt, Starfish Prime added more radiation around the planet.</p>

<p>But even with Starfish Prime, additional research into the Van Allen belts determined they weren’t a deal breaker for missions to the Moon [by 1969, the high-energy electrons injected into the lower Van Allen belt by the Starfish Prime event had decayed to one-twelfth of its post-test peak intensity]. By February of 1964, NASA was confident that Apollo crews would be passing through the belts fast enough that the spacecraft’s skin and all the instrumentation lining the walls would be enough protection. It might seem foolhardy in hindsight for NASA to have accepted the risks of sending astronauts through the Van Allen belts without extra protection, but it was a minor risk in the scheme of the mission.</p>

<p>To monitor radiation exposure during the flights, Apollo crews carried dosimeters on board their spacecraft and on their persons; these readings confirmed NASA had made a good choice. Over the course of the Apollo 11 mission to and from the moon, the crew incurred ≥ .036 rem [roentgen equivalent in man], or 0.018 rads [radiation absorbed dose] which is far lower than the yearly 5 rem average experienced by workers with the Atomic Energy Commission who regularly deal with radioactive materials.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A question since you seem knowledgeable about this.  Isn&#39;t all of space awash in radiation?  Isn&#39;t the sun throwing out radiation in all directions at all times?  If so isn&#39;t the van allen belt not just a strip of radiation but a boundary after which is deadly radiation everywhere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thank you.  I imagine if they argued with it, the argument would be &#39;the cia needs to do these things to keep us safe&#39;.  And that is an argument that stems from paranoia and fear, not from courage and empathy.  It&#39;s how you know that the psychopaths are running things.  They are psychopathologizing the feeble-minded and uncritical non-independent thinkers (older people, left-brain dominant middle class (professionals, phds)) through media sound bites and attempts to &#39;fuzz&#39; history with readymade &#39;memes&#39; of abuse.  They are using language (nlp) and other sensemaking social pscyhology tricks to get people to a state of immediate, localized sensation so their broad (global) perspective is screwed up.  They try to bury the scale, or paint factitious effects of scale wrongly (isis, climate change).  A documentary &#39;the brainwashing of my dad&#39; explains this process through a personal story.  Corbett report talks about this also with &#39;stockholm syndrome&#39; and the climate change talks.  Sorry I kind of went off on a rant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad you asked.  The bodysnatchers are the establishment.  They&#39;ve managed to hijack most people&#39;s brains and weaponize them.  Just like the 1970s film with Donald Sutherland, Leonard Nimoy and Jeff Goldblum, where they go on the run from people who&#39;ve been taken over by alien pods and act like a &#39;networked school of fish&#39;.  </p>

<p>This is how I think of most people (people who aren&#39;t here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, basically).  That pods have taken over their minds and had them believe unreality of 9/11.   More specifically Fox news watchers, MSM people, most baby boomers, even ex- NYC firefighters who weren&#39;t there but knew people who were; even engineers who believe the story against all their knowledge of their own craft, physics, and history. The 322 is an implication that skull and bones society, or international ruling class/freemasons are the pod masters of the podpeople, perpetrating this ongoing psychological operation.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, the more I try to discredit my own theory by playing devils advocate and looking into &#39;their&#39; side, the establishments&#39; the more I seem only to further prove my original idea that is my namesake</p>

<p>P2 -- Propaganda Due : Massive-scale, Italian-Swiss-Argentine cryptofascist intrigue revealing an Italian Deep state</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, revealing a clique within the Italian government. I&#39;m not sure that calling it a &quot;deep state&quot; is anything more than dramatic license.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>operated out of a secret Freemason lodge</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Not a secret. P2 was no more a secret than any other Lodge in the Grand Orient.</li>
<li>Not a Masonic Lodge after its dealings with politics came to light. The Lodge was officially cut off and told to close down (of course, no one can force people not to meet, but they were no longer doing so as Masons).</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>run by Licio Gelli</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was one of the Masters of that Lodge. Lodges generally elect a new Master every 1-3 years, but Gelli is remembered because he was the Master of the Lodge when it was officially shut down by the Grand Orient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>attempted a coup of the media, constitution, attempted assassinations of several figures</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you&#39;re making some of this up...</p>

<p>P2 was implicated in a possible connection to one death. Their membership were also involved in some very shady international dealings and Italian/Vatican banking scandals. If you want to assert more than that, I&#39;d like to see your non-conspiracy sources.</p>

<p>I now have enough understanding to believe the user <em><a href="/u/Tyler_Zoro">/u/Tyler_Zoro</a></em> is a <strong><em>freemason defender shill</em></strong> who has been cropping up only lately to chime in and discredit anything that has to do with freemasonry.  He questions my claims constantly and whines about sources, which are not necessary in this case of P2 as they are all listed within the P2 articles on wikipedia and articles to which P2 links.  P2 claims are corroborated by numerous sources from mainstream news outlets using a simple google search.  </p>

<p>Simply casting doubt is one the tricks of a forum spy.  Because it&#39;s usually successful. But don&#39;t fall for it. (see source below)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not sure that calling it a &quot;deep state&quot; is anything more than dramatic license.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I parsed that sentence from several sources and restated as concisely as I could.  The idea of P2 being a deep state is WIKIPEDIA&#39;s which is as establishment as you can get.  They did not throw up a &#39;cautionary&#39; &#39;sensational dispute&#39; of the term, therefore, we&#39;re keeping it and agreeing with it.  </p>

<p>If you actually listen to MAE Brussell&#39;s podcasts you will get the scale and scope of this conspiracy P2.  It ties into ODESSA, Dulles and his cryptofascist henches and associates, Paperclip, the KKK, and beyond.  Listen to these podcasts, right now, and then you decide if TylerZoro is right or not (he&#39;s not).  Her sources <strong><em>were all mainstream, book-published, eyewitness/whistleblower or academic sources</em></strong> in her time.  If you don&#39;t accept that, then you&#39;ll believe nothing about anything.  </p>

</ul>

<p>Mae Brussell was one of the best, most pragmatic and well-spoken conspiracy researchers in modern history who never overstated her claims, even in the case of the King Alfred plot now widely believed to be a fiction.</p>

<p>When Hillary mentioned a &#39;vast right wing conspiracy&#39;, P2 and the cryptofascists in america is what she was referring to and nothing else.  She was referring to the right wing extremists at the very topmost levels of the government, and she should know because she, Bill, war criminal cryptofascist murderer Henry Kissinger and his wife get together often as they are close friends (likely for sex/death rituals, swinging, drugs and who knows what else.)</p>

I also believe wikipedia many times can be untrustworthy so I actually DO check the references and find that their articles on freemasonry seem to agree with freemasonic literature like morals and dogma, which I&#39;ve read among other things.</p>

<p>Also, if I&#39;m wrong, how come a freemason hasn&#39;t come to me personally and invited me to dinner to talk about stuff and explain to me &#39;how things really are&#39;.  I&#39;d listen.  But it hasn&#39;t happened.  I&#39;ve talked to a few freemasons and its very clear to me that they avoid certain things instead of engaging the public on them.  This is the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re low level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this one statement you identify yourself as having no understanding of Freemasonry whatsoever. This is the crux of the failure of the conspiracy theories surrounding Freemasonry. They honestly think that this is a statement that has any relationship to the real world, and because they&#39;re so deeply wrong from the very first assertion, they can&#39;t really go anywhere.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no such thing as &quot;low&quot; or &quot;high&quot; level that is <strong>physically possible</strong> in such a decentralized organization whose only universal structure is a loose-knit system of inter-recognition.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even a Freemason according to hundreds of thousands of people who identify themselves as Freemasons around the world. Should I be a high-level Mason in the Swedish system where members must be Protestant Christians? Should I be a high-level Mason in the Northern half of the US Scottish Rite system? I know folks who sit on the governing body of that latter group and let me tell you, they aren&#39;t going to listen to someone from the Southern half of the US&#39;s version of that organization who tries to tell them what to do! So which sort of high-level are you talking about?</p>

<p>When you make a statement like this, it becomes immediately obvious to the informed observer (be they Mason or not) that <strong>you&#39;re talking about a fantasy world</strong> that you and other conspiracy theorists have constructed, in which anyone who called themselves &quot;high level&quot; within Freemasonry would be anything but a laughing stock. It&#39;s a fine fantasy to entertain, and if only as a cautionary story about why the current loose-knit structure of &quot;Freemasonry&quot; is important, I find it fascinating. But you have to move past it if you want to discuss reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, c&#39;mon.  You&#39;re really bad at this.  There are levels of freemasonry.  Degrees.  Everyone knows this.  It&#39;s hierarchical and compartmentalized at each level due to the philosophy of holism.  </p>

<p>To make an analogy, you&#39;re trying to argue that once someone is in the CIA, they know &#39;everything&#39; because everything is revealed to you once you&#39;re &quot;in&quot;.</p>

<p>This is of course, stupid and wrong.  There are clearance levels.  Similarly, the degrees of masonry give you clearance levels.  </p>

<p>And in fact if you were being honest about masonry and not just a shill mason trying so hard and ineptly to discredit me, you&#39;d agree with me about how initiates are given the wrong interpretation of symbols intially and then are given different interpretations of those same symbols later on at higher &quot;clearance&quot; levels (higher degrees of masonry).  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re not a 32 or 33 degree freemason, then you won&#39;t have the real scoop and you won&#39;t even bother talking to me.  You&#39;ll just order the drone strike and be done with it.</p>

<p>Instead, they have you doing this busy work and causing you to struggle at it.  Look to your left, look to your right.  One of those people at HBGARY are going to blow the whisle on your ass eventually.</p>

<p>I cannot tellif you are legitimately frustrated with me spewing all this truth that you maybe didn&#39;t know because you haven&#39;t studied it enough yourself, or that you&#39;ve been dogmatically brainwashed into believing the &#39;cover story&#39;.  Or if you are just trying to look like you&#39;re doing your job.  &quot;Look brothers, I&#39;m wrestlying with him but he just knows too much&quot;</p>

<p>Read morals and dogma.  Watch that video I posted about masonry and enoch (son of cain).  If you don&#39;t get it, then by all means, please continue to stalk me everywhere I go and wrestle with me on issues regarding Jesuits and freemasonry.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Dude, c&#39;mon. You&#39;re really bad at this. There are levels of freemasonry. Degrees. Everyone knows this. It&#39;s hierarchical </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it turns out that what &quot;everyone knows&quot; is often wrong. The reality is that there are two degrees in Freemasonry that convey any kind of &quot;rank&quot; or &quot;status&quot; that&#39;s universal to regular Freemasonry (important to note that there&#39;s lots of irregular Freemasonry and a fuzzy boundary between the two): the first degree which makes one a Brother to all other Masons and the third degree which makes one able to travel to any other regular Lodge of Master Masons around the world.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s it. The Grand Lodge of Texas doesn&#39;t have any rank or status that lets one of their members &quot;out-rank&quot; anyone from the Grand Lodge of Iowa. There&#39;s no Grand Lodge of the United States, and so when the Grand Lodge of Texas does something that the Grand Lodge of Vermont thinks is wrong, Vermont can stop recognizing them as Masons if they wish, but that&#39;s all they can do, and they can&#39;t change how Nevada will deal with Texas, except via diplomacy.</p>

<p>So, where is this hierarchy and why can&#39;t it resolve these issues that periodically arise and often take decades to work out (or never are as with the Grand Orient de France, which has not been recognized by mainstream Freemasonry since the 19th century, but which mainstream Freemasonry has no power to shut down!)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;re not a 32 or 33 degree freemason</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so now we get into appendant bodies. Let&#39;s talk about those.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gone through about 70 degrees in my time as a Mason, some variants of each other, but in terms of unique degrees, it&#39;s more around 40. But they&#39;re not a hierarchy either and Freemasonry has just three. The Shrine has its own degrees. The York Rite has a series of 10 degrees, numbered 4-13 to make note of their dependence on their members being Master Masons first (3rd degree), along with various side-degrees. The Scottish Rite has 29 primary degrees numbered 4-32 and various side degrees including an honorary 33rd. You can be a 10th degree York Rite Mason and a 10th degree Scottish Rite Mason at the same time.</p>

<p>But this is all just in the US (some countries don&#39;t have one or more of those bodies, and some countries have different versions of each) and even in the US, those bodies are broken up into jurisdictions which operate independently. And a 7th degree York Rite Mason is not &quot;junior&quot; to some more &quot;senior&quot; 18th degree Scottish Rite Mason. There&#39;s no relationship.</p>

<p>So when you claim that you have to be a 32nd or 33rd degree &quot;Freemason&quot; to know the good stuff, you&#39;re demonstrating again that you don&#39;t know how Freemasonry works. Don&#39;t feel bad, most conspiracy theorists are equally unaware.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I cannot tellif you are legitimately frustrated with me spewing all this truth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heh. You can go ahead and say whatever you like. Conspiracy theorists make up lots of things all the time. We got used to it a few hundred years ago. It reached a fever pitch in the 19th century where making things up about Freemasonry become sort of a sport (c.f. the Taxil Hoax, one of the best known fabrications about us from that period).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Read morals and dogma</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have... I wonder, have you? Or have you read the bits that conspiracy theorists often take out of context? Or worse, have you read only the hoaxes about its author Albert Pike? M&amp;D is available on Google Books for Free. It&#39;s not a great intro-to-Freemasonry, and I&#39;ll be impressed if you can make it through the whole thing. It&#39;s a hard read, with lots of very deep symbolic philosophical analysis of the Scottish Rite&#39;s degrees that requires a true classical education to grasp. But go for it if you wish. I&#39;d actually suggest that you start with some of Pike&#39;s other works. His rebuttal to the Pope&#39;s Encyclical on Freemasonry, Humanum Genus, is well worth a read! He performed what was widely used as the definitive translation of that encyclical to English and then proceeded to respond to every point it made. It&#39;s probably the finest example of formal public debate I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you know what the Taxil Hoax was... there was no predictive element to it. Are you talking about the WWIII Albert Pike letter hoax? That wasn&#39;t even introduced until the mid-20th century, well after Pike&#39;s death, so it&#39;s really a non-starter.</p>

<p>That&#39;s like saying, &quot;if it turns out that you don&#39;t beat your wife...&quot; You&#39;re begging the question. You&#39;re also still stuck on Freemasonry as a monolith and that <em>still</em> isn&#39;t true.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Clearly you do not understand what the logical fallacy, &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance">argument from ignorance</a>&quot; is. </p>

<p>Again, the 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite isn&#39;t special.</p>

<p>The York Rite&#39;s 13 degree progressive system has the KYCH which is their equivalent of the 33rd. But conspiracy theorists don&#39;t get all excited about the KYCH because it&#39;s not a big number...</p>

<p>Still, even if I were a 99th degree member of Memphis-Misraïm (not offered in my jurisdiction, but it is in some Masonic jurisdictions, still) that number wouldn&#39;t be interesting either.</p>

<p>The core argument from ignorance is, &quot;None of the &#39;lower degrees&#39; contain the secret evil that we wish to ascribe to the Fraternity, but we don&#39;t know what the 33rd degree Scottish Rite Masons do, so Freemasonry is evil.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s an argument from ignorance, which can be discarded trivially. I choose to evaluate the Fraternity as I see it. When a good man who I know well and who cares deeply for his fellow man is awarded the 33rd in the Scottish Rite, I know his character, and I know that if he found anything morally repugnant in what was revealed to him, he would abandon the Fraternity immediately. The fact that he does not confirms for me the character of the organization.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor">Holodomor</a> - millions of Ukranians were purposely starved to death and there was a lot of shootings too because the starving people tried to scavenge for food.</p>

<p>The above was part of the larger famine, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_famine_of_1932%E2%80%9333">Soviet famine of 1932–33</a>.  It was treated as &#39;meh&#39; by Stalin, mentioning it was anti-Soviet propaganda.  He also denied that he was starving the Ukrainians to death, he treated the mention of it as an outrageous conspiracy theory and either threatened those people into thought control or had them excommunicated.</p>

<p>Stalin was the master of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge">Great Purge</a>.  The amount of conspiracies committed during the Great Purge is by its base nature alone a tremendous amount.  Stalin&#39;s secret police, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD">NKVD</a>, was lead by men like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Yezhov">Nikolai Yezhov</a> who gave orders to rendition innocent civilians, detain them indefinitely, torture them, execute them, banish them to a gulag to do hard labor, make them confess to crimes they did not commit.  </p>

<p>Stalin and his willing executioners like the bloody dwarf did not always have targeted killings though, like mass surveillance the Great Purge was generalized.  The &quot;I want 500 dead from this town, 50 dead from this town&quot; kind of thing - &#39;death by quota, not by name&#39; it has been called.  The NKVD would then round up anyone unfortunate enough to be in their designated hunting ground, and they came prepared with their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD_troika">legal system</a>.</p>

<p>Most people snared in the web of the Great Purge were either executed or sent to a labor gulag.  Some had to endure the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Trials">Moscow show trials</a>.  All of this was top-down state orchestrated conspiracies.</p>

<p>After all, &#39;conspiracy&#39; is nothing more than <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=conspiracy&amp;amp;oq=conspiracy&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65l3&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">&quot;the action of plotting or conspiring&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>When the communist party began to take power, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin">Lenin</a> had his enforcers the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheka">Cheka</a> use whatever means necessary - be it torture, summary executions, banishment to the gulags - to strengthen their grip of power and control.  The Revolution had ushered in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War">Russian Civil War</a> though and <em>a lot of people</em> died by the orders of Lenin, the other communist leaders and the men in charge of the Cheka.  Perhaps Stalin&#39;s inspiration for the Ukrainian famine came when Lenin made the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1921">Russian famine of 1921</a> worse because of his policies -- millions died.</p>

<p>Lenin&#39;s reign killed millions of people, possibly over ten million.  Stalin would exceed that far in excess.  Lots of conspiracies between the two.</p>

</ul>

<p>like 911, OKC, etc, it&#39;s just not there yet now.  And that is because of &#39;general consensus&#39; NOT evidence.  Evidence is overwhelming that these are false flags.  It&#39;s 100% irrefutable that 9/11 was a coverup.   In my mind it was an inside job, but vast majority disagree.  That&#39;s changing though, because of lists like these that show people their TRUE history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The phrase &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; was definitely NOT coined in 1967. <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=conspiracy+theory&amp;amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;amp;year_start=1800&amp;amp;year_end=2000&amp;amp;corpus=15&amp;amp;smoothing=3&amp;amp;share=&amp;amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cconspiracy%20theory%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bconspiracy%20theory%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BConspiracy%20Theory%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BConspiracy%20theory%3B%2Cc0">A quick search on google ngrams</a> shows that the phrase was used well before that. Look on google books for the theory and see that the phrase had much the same meaning even in the early part of the 20th century. </p>

<p>I am not arguing with the evidence that the CIA tried to discredit truthseekers with this title, but it seems pretty clear to me that the phrase was in use, with a similar connotation, before 1967.</p>

<p>Once I got into college in 2007, I don&#39;t know how it happened, but I started learning about how 9-11 wasn&#39;t a real attack by terrorists....been sinking down the rabbit hole for the past 9 years.</p>

If they aren&#39;t killing foreigners, they are killing americans who oppose them politically, whisleblowers and dissidents.  And that&#39;s a conspiracy also.</p>

<p>Then they go, &quot;Oh jeez alright you got us guess we&#39;ll stop being sociopaths and hand over all our wealth and power to you now gg&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give me a break dude.  You come into every thread spouting your nonsense and then someone calls you on it and asks you for specifics and you respond with some vague, half-baked &quot;remove their ability to make money&quot; argument with no details and no context.  How, specifically, are you going to &quot;remove their ability to make money&quot;?  And now that you seem to have realized that you have no good ideas, you try to run away from the conversation while implying it &quot;isn&#39;t worth your time&quot;.  So it&#39;s worth your time to say empty talking points in every thread but not to actually flesh them out or justify them in any way?</p>

<p>You say people waste their time doing nothing on the internet, yet you spend your time on the internet doing nothing besides telling others they&#39;re doing nothing.  You&#39;re like that guy who creates a &quot;fuck Britney Spears&quot; fanclub and spends more time on it than her own fans do.</p>

<p>Except that&#39;s what you do in every thread you comment in.  In fact, that was the entire point I was making when I just responded to you.

    <div class="md"><p>a cop would say that.</p>

<p>this is the top post on the subreddit.  i&#39;m new to r/conspiracy, read the comments, and felt that u/banthetruth is a little misunderstood.</p>

<p>since you can talk all you want i can too.  and i say that someone who ridicules others for reminding us of what is important is a bigger part of the problem than a lobbyist bribing a senator.  if he stopped because of you, then no one would be talking about a need to take action, and that doesn&#39;t get us any closer to our goal.</p>

<p>it looks like he wants us to take action and have our own plans.  he seems more concerned about the lack of action being put towards this end, than actually telling people how to do it.  which shouldn&#39;t be a problem, he shouldn&#39;t have to tell us what to do. we are adults, or we pretend to be, we should be taking care of this together already. he is doing enough by reminding us that action taken with new avenues is more important now than just talking and trying the same broken systems.  why does he need to have a plan if his only purpose is to warn others of a need to take action?</p>

<p>if the most informed people are this unwilling to take actions of their own, how poorly is everyone else going to do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that was more of a joke.  you know the one &#39;are you a spy&#39; &#39;no&#39;  &#39;a spy would say that...&#39;</p>

<p>well it was a joke, your desire to defend yourself with your post history makes it a little more suspect, bu it is irrelevant.  </p>

<p>i literally just found r/conspiracy went to the first thread, and read a bit.  from what i read it appears you wither don&#39;t understand his purpose, or you are trying to discredit him on purpose to keep people from taking the kind of action he suggests.  i simply wanted to say what i had to say on the topic.</p>

<p>the lack of action being taken says people are unwilling to take action.  i do have to agree that was is being done now doesn&#39;t fix the problem, so how can we say we are actually doing anything?</p>

<p>i also severely doubt anyone is taking money from corporations on the scale that is needed to make a difference, because the media would have been all over a internet hacker/terrorist story.  lastly, you said yourself you have no plan, which i assume means you aren&#39;t taking action, and since you only ridicule others who suggest action, this leads me to believe you are unwilling to take action yourself.<br/>
since this isn&#39;t an issue that can be solved with action that can be taken in &quot;everyday lives&quot;  i&#39;d say what you are &quot;doing&quot;  is either a lie at worst, or not helping at best.  </p>

<p>That which is so often called an ad hominem is not always necessarily a logical fallacy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a logical fallacy by definition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it can be a valid argument under certain circumstances</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In no circumstance is ad hominem a valid argument.</p>

<p>If I were presenting my own findings, then my qualifications would, of course, be valuable in weighting those findings. But as I&#39;m pointing out public information, my qualifications and affiliations are moot and the discussion should <em>always</em> focus on the data, not the speaker. To do otherwise is, by definition, ad hominem.</p>
