       I previously made a post about modern education in America and its issues. If you’d like to see it, here it is:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4c7qkz/what_is_wrong_with_modern_education_a_teachers/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4c7qkz/what_is_wrong_with_modern_education_a_teachers/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Check it out if you haven't yet!
      </p>
      <p>
       That post is more broad in relation to education. Today, I would like to discuss the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). I have had 5 years of experience with these standards, and I definitely think there is a conspiracy involved. As always, I would love to hear your thoughts and opinions on these standards and create a discussion piece. I also want to post this because I see a lot of shilling FOR the CCSS. I want to note that I have nothing against standards in education for teachers, students, or administrators (even parents!), but there is something deeper here.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Who really wrote the CCSS?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the CCSS official website, teachers were involved in the creation of these standards. Why aren’t specific names/credentials/etc. listed on the CCSS site? It is extremely vague. I found one site that claims that in reality, there were few teachers on the CCSS committee from
       <a href="https://dianeravitch.net/2014/04/28/mercedes-schneider-who-are-the-24-people-who-wrote-the-common-core-standards/">
        https://dianeravitch.net/2014/04/28/mercedes-schneider-who-are-the-24-people-who-wrote-the-common-core-standards/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       She writes, "Altogether, 24 people wrote the Common Core standards. None identified himself or herself as a classroom teacher, although a few had taught in the past (not the recent past). The largest contingent on the work groups were representatives of the testing industry."
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if that is not a concern to you, let’s take a deeper look. Jason Zimba, one of the creators, pushes that “The Common Core would drive publishers and test-makers to create better curricula and better tests and push school districts and teachers to aim for excellence, not just basic proficiency, for their students. And the guidelines would arm every principal, teacher and parent with the knowledge of exactly what it takes to get into college and succeed.”
       <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2014/12/29/371918272/the-man-behind-common-core-math">
        http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2014/12/29/371918272/the-man-behind-common-core-math
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What does that even mean? If you really look at that, it is a broad generalization with A LOT of implications. Why is proficiency a bad thing now? I am not against academic 'excellence', but I am when there is a larger agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Who funded the CCSS?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps it is not who wrote the CCSS that should be as much of a concern as who funded it because they could find anybody who wants the money to work for them. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation directly funded the CCSS, but why do we never hear about them in my staff development meetings? Why is the website so vague about the creation of these standards?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bill-gates-pulled-off-the-swift-common-core-revolution/2014/06/07/a830e32e-ec34-11e3-9f5c-9075d5508f0a_story.html">
        https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bill-gates-pulled-off-the-swift-common-core-revolution/2014/06/07/a830e32e-ec34-11e3-9f5c-9075d5508f0a_story.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation didn’t just bankroll the development of what became known as the Common Core State Standards. With more than $200 million, the foundation also built political support across the country, persuading state governments to make systemic and costly changes.”
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don’t know much about Bill Gates and what he believes/funds, then some simple research will give you some answers. I’m not going to link to any posts because I feel you have to be the judge of the credibility of websites, but Bill Gates has his hand in everything from mandatory vaccines to implementation of one new world order policies. I’ll leave you here to connect all the dots.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So, what is wrong with the CCSS?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a pretty good article that sums up some of the problems:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.tfpstudentaction.org/politically-incorrect/common-core/10-reasons-why-common-core-is-bad-for-education.html">
        http://www.tfpstudentaction.org/politically-incorrect/common-core/10-reasons-why-common-core-is-bad-for-education.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m going to focus on some of the areas that stand out to me as an ELA teacher first.
      </p>
      <p>
       •Move toward largely informational texts: The main argument is that students will be living in a world where informational texts will be more valued than ever. If that is true, then students should spend even more time with literary analysis. Not only do literary texts help students understand controversial issues, but they require higher order thinking skills that are not always present when reading informational texts. Basically, by 6th grade, we are pushed to teach half informational/half literally analysis. By high school, students are largely only supposed to be reading informational texts. In addition, these informational texts are often biased and clearly fit a certain agenda. I could probably share actual articles that are pushed for me to teach, but I don’t know if it would be smart to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       •Text-based evidence/No more critical thinking: There is seriously no more room for creative thinking. Do not get me wrong. I understand the value of students citing evidence, proving what they say, and making inferences from a text. Those are important skills, but that is all you do in English classes now. Creative writing has gone out the door. In fact, there is absolutely nearly no room for opinion-related writing, persuasive writing, or critical thinking outside the text. There is a level of rigor to this, but students are finding it increasingly more difficult to think for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Middle school classic example of an informational/argumentative essay: Develop a thesis to support a claim on a controversial topic. Be sure to include credible research for your position as well as a counter-argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       *CCSS modern writing prompt: The articles you just read make a claim that zoos are good for animals. Write an essay on the types of evidence the authors use. Cite evidence from the text to support your essay. (This is really an essay I taught this year).
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, I vary my writing curriculum even if my standards do not allow me, too, but there is that pressure for my students to perform.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think about the difference? I could give more examples, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       •Testing, testing, testing: This is endless. This is probably what you hear about the most. The more tests they give, the more money huge corporations make.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/03/30/report-big-education-firms-spend-millions-lobbying-for-pro-testing-policies/">
        https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/03/30/report-big-education-firms-spend-millions-lobbying-for-pro-testing-policies/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not anti-testing, but I’m anti-testing for corporate agendas to make money off of children.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can definitely get deeper into this, but the tests themselves are unfair to children of all backgrounds. New York is a great example of what is wrong with these tests:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/13/nyregion/new-york-state-students-standardized-tests.html?_r=0">
        http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/13/nyregion/new-york-state-students-standardized-tests.html?_r=0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       •Math mania: I don’t teach math, but I would never want to under the CCSS. There are so many problems with the math CCSS, I honestly think that if you said you supported them, I would automatically think you were a shill (oops, I didn't mean to include my opinion here!). I see thousands of articles like these:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2015/09/21/frustrated-dad-shows-why-common-core-math-is-awful/">
        http://thefederalist.com/2015/09/21/frustrated-dad-shows-why-common-core-math-is-awful/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.techinsider.io/insane-common-core-math-problems-go-viral-2015-10">
        http://www.techinsider.io/insane-common-core-math-problems-go-viral-2015-10
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The greatest argument for CCSS is it helps students understand ‘why’ or ‘how’ the formulas work.  In reality, I believe an overly complex, one-size fits all approach to teaching math undermines children’s development. This is well-stated:
      </p>
      <p>
       “It's an odd pedagogical agenda, based on a belief that conceptual understanding must come before practical skills can be mastered. As this thinking goes, students must be able to explain the "why" of a procedure. Otherwise, solving a math problem becomes a "mere calculation" and the student is viewed as not having true understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       This approach not only complicates the simplest of math problems; it also leads to delays. Under the Common Core Standards, students will not learn traditional methods of adding and subtracting double and triple digit numbers until fourth grade. (Currently, most schools teach these skills two years earlier.) The standard method for two and three digit multiplication is delayed until fifth grade; the standard method for long division until sixth. In the meantime, the students learn alternative strategies that are far less efficient, but that presumably help them "understand" the conceptual underpinnings.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/11/a-new-kind-of-problem-the-common-core-math-standards/265444/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you search problems with CCSS math, there are thousands of articles. The biggest problem I see is that students are being told it is wrong to have any rote memorization in math. Students that are far behind in math or falling even further behind. Math, a subject often notoriously hated by students, may not be in perfect shape, but the standards are NOT helping. When I do occasionally try to help math students with their homework, I am told my way of helping them is wrong, even though I will arrive at the same conclusion as them. What are they doing to our math curriculum and why?
      </p>
      <p>
       •CCSS targets poor schools: The CCSS were supposed to create equity in standards across the country, but that is a complete myth. This article does a really good job of explaining that:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/03/10/the-myth-of-common-core-equity/">
        https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/03/10/the-myth-of-common-core-equity/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As a teacher working at a title 1, poor school, the CCSS have not benefited my students, changed test scores, or showed changes in equity of my students. Test scores have stayed the same though we are working students harder. If there is a rise in test scores, it’s because we have been teaching to the test to the best of our abilities. I train my students for the type of writing prompts they will come across on the test. You can judge me, but my evaluation depends on my students’ scores.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I do admit that there are some lessons that are my rigorous, the students who cannot keep up are falling further and further behind. The only thing I can do is ‘secretly’ teach a different curriculum to students who are not at the level they are supposed to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       No Child Left Behind (NCLB) is still in place. Poor schools are still getting punished for poor test scores.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could even argue the ELA standards are not that bad, but in combination with a testing agenda, they certainly are detrimental to students.
      </p>
      <p>
       •The ultimate move toward privatization of education: A simple google search will yield thousands of results about the goals of privatization of education across the board, and I believe the CCSS is just one of the many ways this goal will be achieved. Even if they were to completely get rid of CCSS, something new will come along, all with the goal of standardizing education from a government/corporate force.  There are many reasons why privatizing education is bad, but I enjoyed this blog:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://nepc.colorado.edu/blog/why-education-must-be-public-not-privatized">
        http://nepc.colorado.edu/blog/why-education-must-be-public-not-privatized
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion:
       </strong>
       I could go on and on as always, but the CCSS is just one of the problems in modern education, in a movement toward privatization where corporate interests control what our students are learning. Not only is critical thinking becoming a skill of the past (unless you count CCSS math?!?!?…), but the curriculum is more and more controlled, with test scores still being used as the tool for how well schools perform, when in reality, they show little more than how many students are impoverished and come from difficult backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is going to do good on my state tests in a few weeks? I could print out a spreadsheet and mark my students with those that have involved parents, and those who do not. I could then mark the students who are poor and who are “rich”, and then I could compile all the data, and I guarantee the students from sound economic backgrounds with parent involvement will perform well, while the others will not.  That's what studies show!
      </p>
      <p>
       While there are many flaws in our modern education system, what is always overlooked is parent involvement. Parent involvement trumps class when it comes to achievement. There are thousands of articles on this, but I know it for a fact as a teacher. Though anecdotal evidence is often discounted, the students who have parents who can/will be involved care and perform better. Does our society create an environment for parents to actually be involved? Not when they are working full-time, often with single parent homes involved. Plus, I don't know how many parents come to me about CCSS math, wanting to help their students but just not understanding how. We need to create parent friendly schools - not schools where students are raised by the teachers and the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not that I know if there is much we can do, but I am finding the general population less and less aware in one of the arguably most important aspects of our society: education!
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not forsee a lot of good coming out of the future of education. I do not mean to be a pessimist, but I think the best I can do is write on these topics and hope that they touch people here and there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think one of the biggest arguments I'll get on this thread is that I fear change/rigor in education, but that is just not true. I have no issue having my 6th graders write an essay per week. What I do take issue with is we are creating students with certain skills that one might claim are 'better' and lead students toward' excellence', but in reality, these students will not be able to find a good career path for them. School should help lead students toward career pathways, not $60,000 in debt with a degree with no guarantee of a career. Sure, learn that CCSS math. Have fun doing your complex math equations at the cash register at Starbucks!
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, I have nothing against anybody working at Starbucks. I am against the lies students are being told and the faulty curriculum being pushed on them. Please don't tell me this is not a conspiracy, by the way!
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for reading all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: the colons in my title are bothering me but I cannot change it now!! :(

       Yes. I seriously realized that I'm teaching my students to just recite from texts...

       Which I get is what has always been done to an extent. But what makes this worse is the removal of free thinking, expression, and creativity in other forms.

       As a rule, the children of the wealthy go to private schools. Several years ago, I worked at a company that hired college students as summer interns. The interns that attended private high school were light years ahead of the public school educated kids.

       Would you be willing to divulge what changes you have seen in your school life? From 6th grade on would be helpful. Some of us have been out of school for so long... it would be nice to get a better perspective.

       Well we were just getting out of Accelerated Math at sixth grade it seems like. I never got very far with that, not quite Accelerating me. Accelerated Math was the thing with the answer card you put through the scanner and it graded it. It left you at the same section of math until you got it, so I never really learned higher math as all the other kids were. Accelerated Math made me scared of math, which follows me to this day. Math is my only subject I'm not taking an Honors or AP in. Through middle school wasn't terrible, except math of course. High school math has become ridiculous. Even the teachers say that it shouldn't be taught due to the irrelevancy of it. I guess that isn't really a change but I thought it was worth mentioning. Some weird social changes in High School I have noticed is that teachers don't give a flip about your phone or gum. Not really an academic change like I assume you wanted, but it's weird how quickly teachers became tolerant to cell phone usage. Sorry if I couldn't give you many answers you were hoping for, I didn't pay attention to school much till this year.. Which I regret. I also thought of something else (too lazy to put it back in the middle school part of this comment so I'll just put it here).. In middle school we had this thing where everyone brought a laptop and we would all chill out in a computer lab and do something called Carnegie Math.. which sucked. Carnegie Math was a program where you had different units of study to complete and it took forever. Middle school was the only place I ever brought my laptop, which is strange. Shouldn't I be using it more in high school? Also, something more school specific (I hope), is that they won't let you know your GPA. It's sort of important to know your GPA.. I got it by acting like a college was asking for my transcript and opened the envelope they told me to keep sealed and send to the college. I shouldn't have had to go to those measures to get my GPA. Another thing, is that teachers nowadays don't realize that we work for 8 hours at school, and then want some free time. Homework has taken over the lives of students. Personally I am up till at least 12 doing homework each night, if not more. That's because we are pressured into taking higher level classes by parents, teachers, counselors, and colleges. We feel a need to do more and more work to compete with the other kids who want to go to a good college and succeed in their career. That's about all the dumb/weird changes I have seen that I can think of at the moment. If you ask a more specific question I could probably answer it. Sorry this is all jumbled up and weird. I'm exhausted from school frankly. I'm gonna go do homework now..peace :(

       I was a pager man myself, but all such devices, if they were not silenced, or they were being used, would be confiscated on sight. You could pick them up at the end of the day.

       Hmm. I never had my own laptop at that point in school, but I had my own desktop. I had a computer class of some form, every semester of high school, so I used a laptop pretty frequently.

       Is that laptop your personal laptop or one provided by the school system?

       What? We received regular reports on our GPAs on a 100 scale (It varied every year from grade letters, to percentiles, to a 4.0 scale.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they ... nevermind... I can already imagine the logic behind that. Now all the kids are equally unable to know their grade. No one can claim that they have a higher grade than some other kid and perhaps hurt someone's 'fee fees.'

       Damn! I completed most of my homework during study hall, or in class as it was passed out. We occasionally had projects that required much of our nights, but I was able to work part time, go to HS and College all at the same time, from a drastic lack of homework.
      </p>
      <p>
       By my Junior year in HS, I would show up for 2nd period, leave at lunch to go to College, and get off at 4pm so I could go to work. I bet they wouldn't even allow that now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard complaints about increases in homework from everyone. My guess is that so much time is focused on getting students prepared for standardized testing (which defines federal $ for the district) that the actual lesson plan goes out the window, and has to be condensed into some form of homework. Maybe it's just more test prep homework...
      </p>
      <p>
       Test prep would take up a good 2 months of school time. I don't remember any required standardized testing past 8th grade, but I took as many tests as possible (less time in class.)

       My district eliminated AP classes my sophomore year, replacing them with dual credit courses. I used to tell my advisor: "If I'm not earning college credit for it, I'm not interested." I finished 30+ hours of college before graduating HS.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, most employers want an experienced worker that they can tolerate on a daily basis. If you've been working in your field, that looks much more valuable to them than just having a valid degree in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flip side to that, is there are some employers that will not even look at a resume/CV that doesn't show a degree from some university they personally respect. But that's the level of freedom those employers are allowed to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need a college education to succeed in life, but it usually helps. Also, planning a fallback position is a good idea. I wish I could fall back on say, underwater basket weaving, if I were unable to pursue my current career. Becoming a barber, comes to mind. We'll always have barbers, even as your self driving car pulls up to drive you to the automatic McDonalds, we'll still need hair cuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big thing, now, is to avoid a ridiculous amount of debt from earning a college degree. I was lucky, as I had scholarships to take care of the bulk of my costs. Also, college books were usually standard for a course, so you could buy a book, that would be valuable for someone else next year. Now, I see more and more instructor authored books that are required for any kind of a passing grade. They've really locked down on screwing over the student for education. It's worse now than I've ever heard of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck with your homework.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd feel bad asking for any more information since I now know how bad homework has gotten. Also, if you need any math help, I'm free.

       Thank you for this post and your other one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been meaning to look into how the educational system is set up in the US and your posts have set up a great foundation for me to start on.
      </p>
      <p>
       What alternatives would you recommend to the CCSS though? Are there any ideal teaching curriculum's in other countries or in general that you could point to as being a gold standard in a sense?

       Thanks for another great post! I really think we need to see more posts like this that talk about our own personal experiences rather than just to link to media articles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am fairly sure that a lot of this standards stuff is just an effort to monetize education. The efforts to change something important for society into just another business is so sad in my estimation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another factor is businesses desire for easily replaceable workers. If Joe Database wants a raise, we fire him over some trumped up charge and put in Johnny Databases at a new hire wage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that understanding in math is super important, but learning by rote has its role too. This goes for spelling in English too. Please teach spelling!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Another factor in all of this is the desire on the part of the 1% to dumb us down. Stupid sheep are easier to control than smart sheep. You can see this in the media that pushes drugs and "mass culture" too. It is one of their many technologies of control.

       Thanks! I'm glad somebody appreciates some discussion here. Links to articles are great, but there are more things to be said!
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I'm really saddened by is spelling I just not cherished anymore. I can't believe I would say this, but love for correct spelling is going extinct.

       Long have I been on this line of thought with schooling our youth. They are the future. Pretty much our time to change things in our life times (30 somethings) is gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a 7 year old that is in 1st grade. I have noticed one thing. The teacher has no one on one time to devote really. Its about shoving them thru the system with no reguard for learning the subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a 11yo girl next door. I think she is in 5th grade. She has a goddamn mountain of homework every night. On top of that she is in softball, basketball, and some other stuff. She doesn't get to be a kid. More and more is being forced on our kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its pressure that they are supposed to get used to at such an early age they learn to deal with stress. My son has homework every damn night save Friday. Sure its simple stuff, but that isn't the issue. Its the fact that he is at school at 8:10 and comes home at 4:45 that's a very familiar schedule isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife and I have been to have lunch with him. That was something else. NO TALKING! They must sit there and chew. No speaking and must line up. Always structure at each "evolution". I say it like that cause its much link boot camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have all individualism stripped away. Kids are velociraptor smart people. The lazy ones know they don't have to do a thing cause they are gonna go thru school anyways. I realize that hazing is part of growing up. I really do and even thou its wrong its just people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit is getting bad now cause for one parents don't give a damn. Do any of you realize that say you wanted to pay for another kids lunch well you can't. I know this cause I tried. The school wouldn't let me. Said it was against the LAW.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now another thing is that were I live (rural PA) they require tax returns for enrollment. Well they know what I made the year before. When my son started school we were expected to buy all the shit for his entire grade! When I said fuck off I was told that I should help out because of my income.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well sorry but I don't believe that. I said since the district won't let you teach failure I will do it for you. Sometime in these kids lives they are going to have to realize that their best just isn't good enough. Oh man they didn't like that at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really pissed them off. Lol. Been an ongoing battle. Recently we made a few invites for the kids my son wanted to invite to his bday party. The principal said that unless we invited the entire class then the invites wouldn't be handed out cause it will make some kids feel inferior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I give a flying fuck! Some reason we moved away from individual success and decided that feelz were more important as well as being left out. These kids never socialize with my son on a level he feels comfortable inviting them to his bday party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is that even thou I am an unstoppable object trying to move and immovable object I won't back down. Every chance I get I will fuck with them. We are at every HSA meeting. Each parent teacher conference and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't like me already cause I don't hold back. I tell them exactly what is wrong and they really don't like it. This one granola eating tofu smelling hippy bitch that looks like she combed her hair with a hedge gets on my nerves the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything she says that isn't factual I get her. I know its petty but sure makes me feel good. My son will have "those parents" all thru school. The other kids love us cause we realize that being a kid isn't about that 8 hour grind that we as adults should deal with. Its about experiencing life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its about running in the rain. Stomping mud puddles and getting cuts or even hurt cause you need to learn your limits. Putting kids into a padded room isn't gonna make their lives easier. Its going to make it worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       In closing.

       Don't take offence as I can tell you are not conforming to this system. Its the ones that think each child is equal that pisses me off. Hell I realize my son may not be the best reader or best at sports. Who knows what he is good at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its the ones that say all children are equal. That's bullshit. To be completely honest its all about mom and dad. They are the ones that can change a child's behavior next to peer pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have the answer because I don't know what you can do as a teacher. Short of making parents listen as to what you have no control over.
      </p>
      <p>
       See with our kiddo the teacher has a sign off sheet everyday in his take home folder. We have to sign it. Of we don't well she gets adamant. Up till she begins calling.

       I feel the comparison is foolish because for one I doubt any of us should bring the holocaust into anything of relevance today. Even if you don't believe the narrative. (I don't) The part I do not believe is the number.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was people that were persecuted for stupidity. Let's not try to compare mass genocide on multiple levels to "current year" education.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the frustration because I have it as well. I deal with this shit every goddamn day. The bullshit chants of

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        obey right away
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That was from the local police department last year. I fixed that real fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how "Obama is the greatest leader we have ever had" that was from another teacher. Fixed that bullshit as well. Now I try hard as I can not to bring my racism and belief of minorities into his day to day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its hard sometimes. I usually think about what I am gonna say or write it down before I say it. I am getting better because I know its his take on reality that matters. Being a father makes me one of the most influential people in his life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to be that fucking asshole. For me its fine cause I know the world as I take it. Maybe I am wrong thou...... Maybe he can see it different and make that change I can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       One time he said to me (wife was present)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Daddy I want to be just like you when I grow up!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I said
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Don't be like me. Be better then I am because daddy has made many bad choices turnout life and if you ever need to run something by me feel free. I will always be here for you.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       My wife almost cried. That is something my father never did for me. I want to be better. So I am doing best I can. As we all are I would like to think.

       Thanks. Absolutely. What I found is that kids often learn the same things over and over again from year to year. In the common core, from 6 to 8, the standards are nearly the same. I could explain more about this if anybody wants.

       I'm in school to become a teacher! 
Probably the #1 thing I've learned thus far is that education in this country is a huge conspiracy to perpetuate income and racial inequality (perhaps gender as well) and make students as complacent and apathetic as possible. I do truly think they're training children to accept authoritarian rule and be too dumb to do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Critical thinking is dead among most students I encounter in my observations and in the curriculum I see. I don't ever think critical thinking and true learning was ever the focus of American schools, it's a propaganda machine. You'd be amazed at what I'm not allowed to cover in history.  Schools are more like jails than places of learning and helping students become good people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Teachers are almost never involved in creating standards, tests or policy about their schools. Common core is the same repackaged garbage only this time instead of just impossible tests (which testing companies make harder if scores improve to get that
       <strong>
        bell curve
       </strong>
       ) it also includes scripted lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know 10% of high school graduates are functionally illiterate?
      </p>
      <p>
       50% of American adults cannot read at an 8th grade level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thousands of schools across the country are failing building health and safety codes and yet; are allowed to stay open because they're schools. Kids are exposed to asbestos, coal fumes, sewage leaks, toxic mold etc... All because of this.
