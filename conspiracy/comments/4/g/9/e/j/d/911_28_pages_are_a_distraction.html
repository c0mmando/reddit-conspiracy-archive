<p>They&#39;re trying to cover something up. The only question is what.</p>

<p>My guess as to what they&#39;re trying to hide, is that the FBI will recommend to Obama&#39;s Justice Department, that Hillary Clinton should be indicted for fucking over National Security, and he won&#39;t do it.</p>

<p>But, who knows what it actually is.</p>

<p>Edit: Is anyone surprised that they&#39;re trying to bury this post? that just tells me that I&#39;m right hahaha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it has to do with a broader agenda of cutting ties with Saudi Arabia. Because oil is a dying industry, the US is no longer reliant on the alliance as they once were. Or, Saudi Arabia did something to piss off the US. Haven&#39;t you noticed a big uptick in the anti-Saudi news articles? This is fine since the country&#39;s human rights track record is abysmal, but it definitely comes with a broader agenda. </p>

<p>In any case, my theory is that the US now wants to use the country as a scapegoat to mask its own involvement in 911. It&#39;s convenient--blame the event on a former ally now that there&#39;s nothing to gain from the relationship. The US gets to appear as &quot;proactive&quot; and placate the broader mass&#39;s growing skepticism of 911, make it look like it&#39;s case closed, and then hope such broader doubt goes away. </p>
