       Why the hell else would they randomly decide to not only acknowledge, but say that they WILL release them after over a decade and a half of ignoring them and pretending they didn't exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       They're trying to cover something up. The only question is what.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess as to what they're trying to hide, is that the FBI will recommend to Obama's Justice Department, that Hillary Clinton should be indicted for fucking over National Security, and he won't do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, who knows what it actually is.

       Edit: Is anyone surprised that they're trying to bury this post? that just tells me that I'm right hahaha.

       Yeah, you know it's a limited hangout because they are only going to release certain pages, not the whole packet of 28.  And those will be censored almost entirely.  Likely in a manner to lead to further confusion and speculation in a controlled direction.

       I think it has to do with a broader agenda of cutting ties with Saudi Arabia. Because oil is a dying industry, the US is no longer reliant on the alliance as they once were. Or, Saudi Arabia did something to piss off the US. Haven't you noticed a big uptick in the anti-Saudi news articles? This is fine since the country's human rights track record is abysmal, but it definitely comes with a broader agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, my theory is that the US now wants to use the country as a scapegoat to mask its own involvement in 911. It's convenient--blame the event on a former ally now that there's nothing to gain from the relationship. The US gets to appear as "proactive" and placate the broader mass's growing skepticism of 911, make it look like it's case closed, and then hope such broader doubt goes away.

       I suppose they could... but the most damning evidence comes from info Saudis wouldn't necessarily have (such as detonation of bombs inside the building, use of thermite, etc).

       Maybe they are slightly pissed off about Saudi pushing oil production and killing shale oil in the US? I would think they would be for it becuase it hurts Russia and Venezuela, but who knows?

       I doubt that those 28 pages contain anything any regular reader of this sub would consider surprising. I have noticed that teevee has grown increasingly more anti-SA over the last year. My guess is that Saudi oil is about to be "liberated."

       I slightly disagree. Any info is better than no info. The more threads we have the faster we can weave the tapestry. The 28 pages is not the end of the story but they are a step on the way.

       28 pages of bullshit from a bullshit report covering up the crime of the century. IMO the US is using it as a cover to impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia in order to take their copious supplies of oil off the market and restore oil prices.
