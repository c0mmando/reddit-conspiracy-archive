       Its all just a distraction so we dont focus on what's really going on.  Every time something major like this happens, people start focusing on that.  Meanwhile, no one is keeping an eye on what our government is doing.

       I was thinking more along the lines of the TPP or the fact Obama wants to send troops to Syria while denying to have ever said "No boots on the ground in Syria."  (there are videos of him saying this)  Maybe to hide the fact that China now has a gold backed currency.  Frankly anything that doesn't have anything to do with the election.  Imo, it seems like every time something major hits MSM, it's usually covering up something greater.

         r/Conspiracy has methodically been introduced to C3ns0rsh!p policies under the guise of p0lit!cal c0rrectne55, thereby slowly cooking the proverbial frog. Since Reddit was bought by
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">
          Advanced Publications
         </a>
         it has moved towards a more mainstream corporate mass media style of c3ns0rsh!p, !nf0rmati0n c0ntr0l and p|20paganda.

         </strong>
         All of Reddit, including  r/Conspiracy, now has a fully automatized algorithm system in place to detect and c3ns0r any n3gat!ve/revealing/damaging information about the US !ntelligence C0mmun!ty, US government, corporations, financial industry and key political figures. The algorithms scan for specific words, wordings and flagged links to alternative media outlets. If an undesirable element is detected, the system will automatically remove or discretely r!g the vot!ng pr0cess.

         truthful about the 9-11 attacks, illegal NSA surveillance, crimes committed by the CIA/FBI/Law enforcement agencies, financial crimes, economical inequality or US war crimes and genocides it will properly not end up the front page. And let us not forget the legions 5h!lls and 9und!ts. Reddit  controls the process minute by minute, the slip ups are getting fewer and far between, and they refine their already sophisticated methods for every day that passes by. The days when you could easily detect hamfisted blatant c3nsorsh!p attempts are over.

         did was to introduce a new and marvelous CE0, then they proceeded to removed all the troublesome administrators, after which they continued the process and removed all the undesirable moderators. And there was much drama!

         Then the ban-wagon finally hit the r/conspiracy forum, deliberately purging the intelligentsia, people who tended to post quality posts with lots of data and statistics, during and shortly after the height of the Mr. 5n0wd3n scandal, thus turning the forum into an echo camper for fools and idiots.

         Since the "great purges" the r/conspiracy forum has been absolutely spammed with racist anti-Jewish posts, often making up 20% of the volume on the front page, and the moderators are doing absolute nothing about it. On top of that legions of 9und!ts and 5H!ll5 has been allowed to down vote and 5pam any undesirable posts.
        </p>

       I agree that reddit is full of propaganda from all sides and that this sub isn't immune to it, but at least one of your points is just blatantly false.  Specifically #2, there is no "fully automatized algorithm system in place" on this sub to remove posts.  If you have any evidence of one by all means, let's see it.  I know that you don't have any though, because nothing like that exists here.  The only thing comparable which maybe has you confused is reddit's sitewide automod which does automatically remove posts from certain websites (like naturalnews, infowars, etc.).  We approve all of those posts manually though and are one of the very few subs that do.

         Blocking none corporate new media outlets might be the most blatant form of censorship. This is how the owners of Reddit,

         I have seen with my own eyes and talked to people getting banned for posting information about the intelligence community and their crimes against the American people. About 2-3 weeks later the censors finally gave up and the "Snowden scandal" broke the headlines. Absolutely abhorrent censorship. I almost quit Reddit that day. The rest is history...

       I don't really disagree with any of your points here, there's obviously manipulation and censorship on reddit.  All I was saying is that there is no algorithm in place on this sub to automatically remove posts.  Anything that gets deleted by reddit's
       <strong>
        sitewide

         I can see that 10-20% of the volume on the front page, more or less all the time, is nothing more than racist anti-Jewish slurs. The moderators never touch them. But I can assure you that if you post something new and revealing from the "alternative" or "independent" media about the most recent crime spree of the TBTF financial institutions, you will not reach the front page easily. Or about the USA, Turkey or Saudi Arabia transporting soldiers, ammunition, supplies and weapons into Syria. Or about the NSA committing crimes, covering up crimes or lying about them under oath. Or Google/Apple/Microsoft/Reddit applying 100% and working together with the NSA.

       It is a painful process of dumping down the conversation, reducing it to trivia, sports and celebrity gossip, and sparing the feelings of the supposedly opinionated majority. I guess I differentiate myself by actually trusting "the people" and opposing censorship. I know... crazy!

       Yeah but mods have no impact on what reaches the front page and what doesn't.  That's dependent on the voting or some hidden mechanism that only the admins would know about (like if they weight the votes differently for certain subjects or something).  Now obviously the voting on reddit as a whole and also on this sub is being manipulated and isn't reliable, and certain groups or marketers or shills or whoever else can and do influence what makes it to the top and what doesn't, but that isn't the mods' fault.

       I think it's an active campaign from one or more groups to upvote certain posts and bury others.  I don't know how organized it is or who the people doing the voting are, but the manipulation of vote totals is widespread and quite obvious.  There's a reason the top post is always something about political theater or race relations or police brutality or any other divisive, surface-level topic.  I think there are people who have programs to control multiple accounts and use them to brigade certain threads.  Some probably have some type of technology that alerts them to certain keywords too, so for example anything about 9/11 maybe gets an auto 5 downvotes when it's posted.  I have no proof of any of this but it's my best guess based on the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just too easy to manipulate votes on this site for us to assume it isn't being done.  And then add all of the evidence of vote manipulation and online shilling and it's impossible for anyone with their eyes open to deny.

       The obvious assumption is that it's either these entities themselves or people/groups doing their bidding for them.  Spooks are everywhere, shills are everywhere, "marketers" and propagandists are everywhere.  I mean... who else would it be who wants to censor that info if not the people who are implicated by it?

       Because they have all the money and technology in the world and are highly organized and compartmentalized.  reddit is also a very easy site to spread propaganda on because all the users are anonymous and what gets seen is determined by voting which can also be done anonymously and uses algorithms that only the admins and developers have access to.  And if you have the software to do it you could easily control 5, 10, 20 accounts yourself and help guide the narrative however you wanted to.  Now imagine a team of people with this same software and you can imagine how easy it would be to influence.

       You are not.  And it isn't a delusion.  reddit when I first joined was a much different place - the invention of subreddits was the beginning of the end.  The final nail in the coffin was when they took away the ability to see upvote and downvote totals on comments, made vote brigading much easier.

       Bending the truth is an especially stupid move if you want to be taken seriously with what you're doing. Just trying to help you, as usual, and as usual you get all huffy about it. Meh.

       You have displayed a clear pattern which shows me that you have a problem with taking constructive criticism. I'm about done trying to help you with your effort. :/
