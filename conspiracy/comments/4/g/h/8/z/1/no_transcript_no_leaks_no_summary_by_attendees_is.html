    <div class="md"><p>why do they not just whip up a fake transcript then which says what they want us to think they said?  it is clear that the clinton&#39;s are not above complete fabrications when they think they can get away with it.  this would kill 2 birds with one stone.  there was in fact a goldman employee who described one of the speeches.  she said it was like Clinton was a managing director of Goldman Sachs, and so now we can completely understand why she would rather take the fallout for not releasing them over the fallout of people finding out what she actually said.  remember romney?  yeah, look him up he was a politician.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve wondered this. But maybe there is a fear that someone would have proof that she&#39;s lying? Not sure why they wouldn&#39;t have shared it by now. My best guess as to why she hasn&#39;t released the actual transcripts, and <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/clinton-speeches-218969">from what I&#39;ve read</a>, she didn&#39;t say anything criminal but she does come off as more supportive &amp; friendly than he &quot;Wallstreet fears me&quot; act when she was running against Bernie. But honestly, if her fans can excuse all the other obviously corrupt stuff she&#39;s done then I doubt a positive wall street speech would be all that bad.</p>

<p>that&#39;s like saying conspiracies can&#39;t happen because someone would spill the beans. It&#39;s just not true.  There&#39;s probably not much to say.  </p>

<p>She gave a speech probably telling them that finance is an important sector in the american economy and gave some anecdote about how Sister Mary blah blah blah was able to earn enough money through investments to retire at age blah blah blah because of the great work they do.</p>

Why would she not want to give a speech? That&#39;s just bad strategy from her side. It&#39;s obvious, though, like you said, that the speech itself is not what&#39;s worth the payment.

    <div class="md"><p>Another theory being bandied about is that she announced her candidacy during the speech - if she did that, and collected the payment, she would have violated FEC regulations.</p>

<p>I think both the &quot;no speech&quot; and &quot;FEC violation&quot; theory are interesting and unfortunately plausible, but it could also just be that she blamed poor people for the crash (although it&#39;s weird that she&#39;d hold that back, because there are already public speeches of her saying this).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think she probably gave a speech but content of the speech itself doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s a red herring. And I have a good feeling that bankers at Goldman Sachs don&#39;t care what she has to say. </p>

<p>This is about legal bribery. This is about GS and other banks and corporations doing her a favor now so that she&#39;ll do them favors when she wins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its probably more likely that she has non-disclosure agreements that are air tight. If the transcripts were out there to be easily obtained, who would pay her to come and do the speech? Either than or its just dog shit and dribble. She isnt a politician by-proxy.

    <div class="md"><p>I read the story last night. I work in public relations, and this actually makes sense: </p>

<p>The contraversy with the speech transcripts is kept alive because it focuses the energy of critics on to this issue.</p>

<p>The fact is, most Americans really don&#39;t give a s*** about the speech transcripts. But, if she releases the transcripts, then critics will start to focus on other stuff, that is probably worse.</p>
