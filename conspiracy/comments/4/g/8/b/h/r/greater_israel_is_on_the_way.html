       Good bye Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, half of Iraq, Nile river, and some of Saudi Arabia.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS's job is simple. Kill and terrorize. Uproot the people from their ancestral homelands, put them on the back and integrate them into nanny states of Europe.Those that stay and fight, will die.

       This precisely describes plans for advancing Greater Israel undertaken by the US State Department, under Hillary Clinton, and Google.
       <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-edge/336408-google-this-hillary-clinton-emails/">
        "The fall of the House of Assad could well ignite a sectarian war between the Shiites and the majority Sunnis of the region drawing in Iran, which, in the view of Israeli commanders would not be a bad thing for Israel and its Western allies" Hillary Clinton's confidant, Sidney Blumental wrote in a 2012 email to Hillary Clinton.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me be clear; Hillary Clinton has a well documented history of using the power of her office to foment war and the overthrow of governments, in Honduras, in Libya, in Iraq and in Syria.  Her motives for doing so include the achievement of a Greater Israel.  Her means of achieving this include fomenting war between the various sects of Islam.  Millions have died, tens of millions have been driven from their homes and entire countries have been thrown into utter chaos.  She is perhaps the last person who should ever be given the power of the Presidency of the USA.

       "In a Wednesday op-ed in the Jewish Daily Forward newspaper in New York, she promised that as president she “will do everything I can to enhance our strategic partnership and strengthen America’s security commitment to Israel, ensuring that it always has the qualitative military edge to defend itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       “That includes immediately dispatching a delegation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to meet with senior Israeli commanders. I would also invite the Israeli prime minister to the White House in my first month in office.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton noted the latest wave of terror attacks in Israel’s cities, saying “this violence must not be allowed to continue. It needs to stop immediately, and Israelis and Palestinians must move back toward the path of peaceful reconciliation. All parties and the international community should condemn any political and religious leader who stokes tensions with irresponsible rhetoric. Many of us have seen the video of a cleric encouraging worshipers to stab Jews as he waves a knife in the air. This incitement needs to end, period.”

       And no hint at all that Hillary has any awareness whatsoever that she is talking about a theocratic nation which holds millions of people as virtual prisoners.  It's as if she's meeting with the jailers of millions of innocent people and trying to prevent the prisoners from even expressing the injustice under which they are imprisoned.

       I agree. I don't know how anyone could argue this when ISIS has literally never threatened Israel. Why would a terrorist group that goes on and on about an Arab world
       <em>
        basically
       </em>
       only terrorize Arabs (Middle East except...you know...Israel) and "1st world" countries (Europe).

       I wish more people understood this.
This has been planned for a long time and they're coming to their end game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other enlightened people on this board go as far as Alex Jones (controlled opposition btw) to say that "globalist" and "elites" are behind NWO.  They stop short of pointing out the true perpetrators are zionist jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's amazing that 4/9 of supreme court justices are Israel first jews. They control politics with direct legislation and cabinet seats as well as lobbyist powers (see AIPAC).  It's obvious they control the media.  The Fed (main source of their control) is completely dominated by them - last 30 years a tribal member has led the Fed and the hidden owners are of course, the Rothchilds. However, to point this out is called anti-semitism and is punishable by jail time in 14 european countries (in the U.S., though not yet an official crime it will end your career).
      </p>
      <p>
       We know all wars in the world are banker wars and we all know who the bankers are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great comments on this thread.  The Odid Yinon plan (for greater Israel) is unfolding before our eyes. Biblical and Judaic prophesies are coming true (even though I don't believe in religion this part is hard to deny, maybe it's self fulfilling prophesy?).
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, it's the zionist jews, it's always the zionist jews. Every conspiracy from JFK murder, Fed reserve, 9/11, ISIS, new leaks about Saudi complicity in 9/11 (Saudi's and U.S. were indeed involved but the puppet masters were the zionist jews) are all correct but unfortunately not correctly linked to the ultimate evil - The Synagogue of Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another great proof in point: Their PR campaign...google who killed jesus and top 10 pages will discuss that people are wrong, it was the romans and not the jews.  Amazing that zionist gentiles fall for this. In the Talmud it clearly states if you indirectly kill someone it is not killing - this is what they did by insisting the Romans kill Jesus for them and then by their twisted logic (and perversion of law they have created that is the basis of the American system to this day) they are innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       To see who rules over you simply see who you are not allowed to criticize.

      <p>
       The only true threat to humanity is this evil parasitic tribe.

       Jews want to bring the Kingdom of Israel back to it's original state:

       The crazy thing is... Jews think Israel means God's chosen people, but since Jesus has already come... you technically can't be a Jew in this day and age.  The funny law of Duality... The Satanist Jews call their physical nation Israel, as a mockery to the Lord, who's chosen people(who believe in Jesus) are called 'Israel.'

       Which is why the Jews resented Yoshua, they had him killed and don't consider him to be the son of God. This all happened right when Jesus threw shade in the bankers and money changers, right then and there the Jews realized this guy is gonna cause problems for us.

       It's also fascinating to do a study on what the biblical description of the antichrist spoken about in a Revelation as compared to what Judaism teaches what the messiah will look like. Almost identical.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe that powerful people who believe the following paragraph are actively causing disruption to bring these prophecies into reality. Little do they know they're orchestrating the circumstances for the antichrist.
      </p>
      <p>
       From 'What Will the Mashiach Do?'
      </p>
      <p>
       "Before the time of the mashiach, there shall be war and suffering (Ezekiel 38:16)
      </p>
      <p>
       The mashiach will bring about the political and spiritual redemption of the Jewish people by bringing us back to Israel and restoring Jerusalem (Isaiah 11:11-12; Jeremiah 23:8; 30:3; Hosea 3:4-5). He will establish a government in Israel that will be the center of all world government, both for Jews and gentiles (Isaiah 2:2-4; 11:10; 42:1). He will rebuild the Temple and re-establish its worship (Jeremiah 33:18). He will restore the religious court system of Israel and establish Jewish law as the law of the land (Jeremiah 33:15)."

       Strategically this photograph is approximately the area Israel wants, at a minimum. Gateway to three continents by land and two oceans by sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the precise reason why panama is just as important as Israel. Same reason Alaska and Iceland/Greenland matter. Same reason why South Africa matters. Same reason Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii and Japan mater. Same reason the poles matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is primarily about strategic positioning. Everything else is just propaganda to hopefully bring about the desired strategic positioning. It does not matter who does it first, just that these strategic nodes get established. As long as they exist they can be United-States, and eventually a New World Order or the United Nations — of Earth.

       They use war as a methodology to disrupt and weaken societies so they can take them over. Sometimes physically, more commonly, economically.
      </p>
      <p>
       The war will never come to Israel because war would destroy the infrastructure there. They want the war to be outside of Israel so the other society will be disrupted or destroyed and then easier to invade.
