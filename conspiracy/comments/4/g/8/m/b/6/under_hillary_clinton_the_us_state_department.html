        Hillary Clinton's emails reveal how the US State Department, ‘independent’ media and Silicon Valley have worked together to try and achieve foreign policy goals.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Particularly damning is a communication from Jared Cohen, the President of ‘Google Ideas’, (now called ‘Jigsaw'), which was sent on July 25, 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Please keep close hold, but my team is planning to launch a tool on Sunday that will publicly track and map the defections in Syria and which parts of the government they are coming from," Cohen wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Our logic behind this is that while many people are tracking the atrocities, nobody is visually representing and mapping the defections, which we believe are important in encouraging more to defect and giving confidence to the opposition," he went on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The head of Google Ideas added that his organization was partnering with al Jazeera "who will take primary ownership over the tool we have built."
      </p>
      <p>
       Cohen finished his email by repeating his warning: "Please keep this very close hold… We believe this can have an important impact."
      </p>
      <p>
       The email was sent to three top officials, Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns (a former Ambassador to Russia), Alec Ross, a senior Clinton adviser on innovation; and Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, Jake Sullivan, who forwarded the email to Hillary Clinton with the message: "FYI-this is a pretty cool idea."
      </p>
      <p>
       On August 4, 2012, Clinton sent the information to her aide Monica Handley. The title heading was: Syria Attachments: Defection Tracker.PDF.

       I wish we all knew who Google really is.  I am inclined to think that they are the tech department of the US Government.

       Yeah, curious meteoric riser just like FakeFook. Not substantial and grossly influential, 90 percent hype and market pumping. Fingerprints of the Shadow Government + Zionists. Funny, because I always thought Meteors fall instead of rise. Hmmm. There's rivers of government money from way back with Lockheed except that Lockheed earned it the slow and honest way. Just take a look at the housing market over the last 10 years in San Mateo county (which Google has a inflationary influence over), those prices are creating  a newfangled exclusivity nowhere on the east coast can reinvent. That's good cover for New Ops, because these engineers are already sociopathic narcissists.

       I have been in the tech game a long time, nearly 50 years, and am very concerned and disturbed by the way that the biggest tech companies behave these days.  I could write a book about it if I had the time.

       Once you get a company to that size, you can guarantee there is big government money involved in some way.
