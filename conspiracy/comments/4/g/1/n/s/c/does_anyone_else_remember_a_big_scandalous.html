    <div class="md"><p>Do you actually think Prince was murdered to distract the public from something that would lead nowhere regardless? I don&#39;t understand these types of theories, they really are coincidences because there&#39;s no need for a distraction. The populous is so fucking complacent that Obama could announce he ordered Prince&#39;s death and nothing would change in the slightest. Purely delusional. </p>

<p>Complacent -&gt; intentionally dumbed down and fully unaware of it</p>

<p>And yes, despite the likes of Prince being very independent and keeping out if the clutches of the main stream, at the end of the day he was never free. He was just given a free reign until a) he proved too much of an issue, or b) a lot could be gained by offing him at this particular time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I probably meant something more like apathetic.</p>

<p>But, just to clarify, you are in fact in the camp that the shadow government had Prince killed because he knew too much or was a liability or..? Feel free to correct me, I don&#39;t speak this particular dialect of crazy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not in the camp of Elvis drives a London bus on the moon.</p>

<p>But I do realise that the US drones (kills) people on the borders of Pakistan on an almost weekly basis and that in the eyes of those who might be called TPTB, the only difference between a celebrity and some guy in Pakistan on his way to a wedding is profitability and the ability to keep the public engrossed in irrelevant shit (MTV etc) so that people don&#39;t give a shit about real shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a logical extension of &#39;Bread and Circus&#39;.  Modern entertainments (sports, celebrities, TV &amp; movies, etc.) are encouraged in order to sate the masses while the ruling clique gets away with whatever they want.  Even the politicians are entertainers.  Look at Trump/Cruz/Hillary/Sanders and tell me which one of them isn&#39;t an over-the-top ham actor.  And the personal lives of celebrities of course can and are wrecked in the service of keeping the masses entertained.  Just ask Elvis (when you see him in the next life).</p>
