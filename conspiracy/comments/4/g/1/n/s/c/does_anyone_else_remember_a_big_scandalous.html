       Or maybe news outlets conspire to saturate the news of a celebrities death to take the spotlight off political news, the death of the celebrities having been coincidental and the exploitation of pushing news of said celebrity intentional.

       Do you actually think Prince was murdered to distract the public from something that would lead nowhere regardless? I don't understand these types of theories, they really are coincidences because there's no need for a distraction. The populous is so fucking complacent that Obama could announce he ordered Prince's death and nothing would change in the slightest. Purely delusional.

       And yes, despite the likes of Prince being very independent and keeping out if the clutches of the main stream, at the end of the day he was never free. He was just given a free reign until a) he proved too much of an issue, or b) a lot could be gained by offing him at this particular time.

       But I do realise that the US drones (kills) people on the borders of Pakistan on an almost weekly basis and that in the eyes of those who might be called TPTB, the only difference between a celebrity and some guy in Pakistan on his way to a wedding is profitability and the ability to keep the public engrossed in irrelevant shit (MTV etc) so that people don't give a shit about real shit.

       It's a logical extension of 'Bread and Circus'.  Modern entertainments (sports, celebrities, TV &amp; movies, etc.) are encouraged in order to sate the masses while the ruling clique gets away with whatever they want.  Even the politicians are entertainers.  Look at Trump/Cruz/Hillary/Sanders and tell me which one of them isn't an over-the-top ham actor.  And the personal lives of celebrities of course can and are wrecked in the service of keeping the masses entertained.  Just ask Elvis (when you see him in the next life).

       I don't find it interesting, at all. Prince was probably a "down low" homosexual and died of complications due to AIDS.

       Still, he was a great musician and performer and I've been a fan since I was a little kid. But, you know, it is what it is.
