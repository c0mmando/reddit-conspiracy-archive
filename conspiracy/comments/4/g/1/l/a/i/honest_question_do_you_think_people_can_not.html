I sometimes browse here because I enjoy thoughtful insights even if I don&#39;t necessarily come to the same conclusions. Do you think everyone who doesn&#39;t believe in x they are misinformed or do you think maybe something they say have merit? </p>

<p>I&#39;m avoiding specific examples because I know if I put one in I&#39;ll get run out of here or get in to a flame war over it. </p>

<p>Edit: considering this is sitting at 54% I can assume about half of you think either &quot;no they can&#39;t be intelligent and must be sheep&quot; or &quot;better silence them&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible for people to be very intelligent and claim that people don&#39;t conspire.  Conspiracies of some sort are revealed on a regular basis.  Hillary Clinton conspired to keep her emails away from FOIA.  Nixon taped his conversations in which he conspired with others.</p>

<p>Specific theories, like 9/11, may be points of disagreement.  However, for a person to state that conspiracies do not happen in government, they have to be fools.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy does mean the specific definition. The term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; was <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-02-23/1967-he-cia-created-phrase-conspiracy-theorists-and-ways-attack-anyone-who-challenge">coined in the 60&#39;s by CIA</a> to discredit anyone who disagreed with the findings of the Warren Commission. </p>

<p>People lose rationality when discussing conspiracies, and go as far as claiming the word doesn&#39;t even mean what it means; That a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is really always about intergalactic nazi lizard-eating hamsters. </p>

<p>That is another CIA tactic called &quot;poisoning the well&quot;. They take the most ludicrous theory they can find (or invent) that almost nobody actually believes and then say it is typical of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;.</p>

<p>To cut through this doublespeak we need to be using the denotative definition of words. This is English, not NewSpeak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming one is unintelligent because they do not believe in conspiracies is the same as someone saying one who believes in conspiracies is unintelligent. There are intelligent and unintelligent people on both sides of every conspiracy. Look at Global Warming, or Geoengineering.

<p>The facts that lead many to the conclusion it&#39;s  man made. </p>

<p>Based off the fact that it is warmer than 10 years ago.
Fact cars emit CO and that does contain heat. 
Fact cows emit NO and that&#39;s been shown to be worse than CO to the environment. 
Fact we&#39;ve been cutting down forests at higher levels and trees change CO to O.</p>

<p>The juries job is to look at the facts then come to a conclusion.  Facts are unchanging.  Theories are highly supported by facts. </p>

<p>Osama hatched a <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/conspiracy?q=conspiracy">secret plan to do something harmful or unlawful.</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This world would be entirely different than it is, if there weren&#39;t conspiracies of one type or another going on all the time, no?  For example, do you think we conspire (I mean our country) to war?  It&#39;s fairly apparent at this point we are in never-ending wars for profit.  We also conspire to warehouse people for profit.  We sure as hell don&#39;t try to rehabilitate people.  There are a couple.  For people not to simply <em>observe</em> things like this and not think, but know that something is very fucked up, is not just misinformed, it&#39;s disgusting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost everyone believes in some kind of conspiracy.  They just refuse to believe in any conspiracy that would upset their world view.</p>

<p>For example:  Many democrats believe GWB invaded Iraq under false pretenses and conspired with others in government to lie to the American people about the reasons for war.  Thats  a conspiracy they gladly accept.</p>

<p>But ask them about the conspiracy of HRC to steal the election from BS and theyll refuse to listen.</p>

<p>Its just humans doing stupid human shit.  Its very hard to open your eyes and admit you are wrong.  The vast majority of humans will just never do it.</p>

If so than I more than meet that criteria you asked.  However,  if I don&#39;t believe politicans will kill people on the same level to control gun debates (Sandy hook,  Scalia) or will kill thousands to go to war over oil  (911) do you think I can&#39;t be intelligent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion the Bush administration wanted war.  This gave them reason.  Plus they do have resources but I believe that was secondary.  I never said that couldn&#39;t be the reason why.  I just said I don&#39;t think they killed thousands of Americans and managed to keep it under wraps that long.  If you look at how badly the government hides bad activity it&#39;s not hard to believe they couldn&#39;t cover up something that would of had to of had thousands of people behind it.  </p>

<p>Examples of failed cover ups:</p>

<p>We know they wiretap</p>

<p>Numerous affairs</p>

<p>Clinton&#39;s private server</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia backing the hijackers</p>

<p>There are so many more so it&#39;s hard to believe the Bush Administration could hide murdering thousands in a larger plot to bring us to a war strictly for oil. </p>
