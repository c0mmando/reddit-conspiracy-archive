       I'm a skeptic on most conspiracies. I sometimes browse here because I enjoy thoughtful insights even if I don't necessarily come to the same conclusions. Do you think everyone who doesn't believe in x they are misinformed or do you think maybe something they say have merit?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm avoiding specific examples because I know if I put one in I'll get run out of here or get in to a flame war over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: considering this is sitting at 54% I can assume about half of you think either "no they can't be intelligent and must be sheep" or "better silence them"

       I don't think it's possible for people to be very intelligent and claim that people don't conspire.  Conspiracies of some sort are revealed on a regular basis.  Hillary Clinton conspired to keep her emails away from FOIA.  Nixon taped his conversations in which he conspired with others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specific theories, like 9/11, may be points of disagreement.  However, for a person to state that conspiracies do not happen in government, they have to be fools.

       Conspiracy does mean the specific definition. The term "conspiracy theorist" was
       <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-02-23/1967-he-cia-created-phrase-conspiracy-theorists-and-ways-attack-anyone-who-challenge">
        coined in the 60's by CIA
       </a>
       to discredit anyone who disagreed with the findings of the Warren Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       People lose rationality when discussing conspiracies, and go as far as claiming the word doesn't even mean what it means; That a "conspiracy theory" is really always about intergalactic nazi lizard-eating hamsters.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is another CIA tactic called "poisoning the well". They take the most ludicrous theory they can find (or invent) that almost nobody actually believes and then say it is typical of "conspiracy theorists".
      </p>
      <p>
       To cut through this doublespeak we need to be using the denotative definition of words. This is English, not NewSpeak.

       Assuming one is unintelligent because they do not believe in conspiracies is the same as someone saying one who believes in conspiracies is unintelligent. There are intelligent and unintelligent people on both sides of every conspiracy. Look at Global Warming, or Geoengineering. There are well thought out arguments for and against each, then there are people who spout nonsense in favor of each position. Intelligence is not the monopoly of one side or the other. People just process evidence differently.

       Is global warming real? Yes,  the earth is warmer than it was 10 years prior.  Is it man made?  Well we don't have a long standing assessment of what earth was like before the introduction of the automobile (so theory)
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts that lead many to the conclusion it's  man made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based off the fact that it is warmer than 10 years ago.
Fact cars emit CO and that does contain heat. 
Fact cows emit NO and that's been shown to be worse than CO to the environment. 
Fact we've been cutting down forests at higher levels and trees change CO to O.
      </p>
      <p>
       The juries job is to look at the facts then come to a conclusion.  Facts are unchanging.  Theories are highly supported by facts.

       You can't act like that was clearly a joke.  The way it's phrased in that context makes it seem more serious.  A better way to include the sarcasm you intended was "oh well,  you're only 30, once you hit a lot more mature and ripe age like 33 you'll see it different."

       Actually it varies.  CNN, RT, BBC, and a few different sites to get a broader picture.  I understand what you're trying to do but a simple answer to the original question could of been no.  You insult my intelligence "tie shoelaces" and assume I'm misinformed.

       Some conspiracies are real and have a wealth of evidence behind them, like the recent Fifa scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some events are conspiracies no matter which way you put them. For instance 9/11 is a conspiracy regardless of who you think was behind it. Be it the government, Osama or someone else - still a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to not believe in any conspiracies doesn't make much sense.

       Check the front page.  This place is pretty much "the biggest conspiracy is media" then use "other media" to prove "long term media" is lying.  If I read both and tend to side with long term media that makes me part of the problem correct?

       This world would be entirely different than it is, if there weren't conspiracies of one type or another going on all the time, no?  For example, do you think we conspire (I mean our country) to war?  It's fairly apparent at this point we are in never-ending wars for profit.  We also conspire to warehouse people for profit.  We sure as hell don't try to rehabilitate people.  There are a couple.  For people not to simply
       <em>
        observe
       </em>
       things like this and not think, but know that something is very fucked up, is not just misinformed, it's disgusting.

       Almost everyone believes in some kind of conspiracy.  They just refuse to believe in any conspiracy that would upset their world view.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example:  Many democrats believe GWB invaded Iraq under false pretenses and conspired with others in government to lie to the American people about the reasons for war.  Thats  a conspiracy they gladly accept.
      </p>
      <p>
       But ask them about the conspiracy of HRC to steal the election from BS and theyll refuse to listen.

       How many other conspiracies are also well documented and yet people ignore them? There are MILLIONS of people that believe, still, to this day, that Sadam had WMD and we were totally justified in "whooping his ass!"  They do not believe it was any kind of conspiracy.

       thinking the politicans are the smartest people we can muster, the most hardworking and the most honest ones and the media is absolutely objective and in no way work with the governments to sway news the certain way ...

       I don't think they are the smartest considering there are basically 0 scientists.  IQ tests are not a good way of checking intelligence.  If so than I more than meet that criteria you asked.  However,  if I don't believe politicans will kill people on the same level to control gun debates (Sandy hook,  Scalia) or will kill thousands to go to war over oil  (911) do you think I can't be intelligent.

       so why did we go to war if not for resources? (not just oil, money mostly) and not just US, I am not even american, and i still consider my self with "we" ... much of the western world went to war, for what exactly?

       In my opinion the Bush administration wanted war.  This gave them reason.  Plus they do have resources but I believe that was secondary.  I never said that couldn't be the reason why.  I just said I don't think they killed thousands of Americans and managed to keep it under wraps that long.  If you look at how badly the government hides bad activity it's not hard to believe they couldn't cover up something that would of had to of had thousands of people behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples of failed cover ups:
      </p>
      <p>
       We know they wiretap
      </p>
      <p>
       Numerous affairs
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton's private server
      </p>
      <p>
       Saudi Arabia backing the hijackers
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many more so it's hard to believe the Bush Administration could hide murdering thousands in a larger plot to bring us to a war strictly for oil.

       It's not the disbelief in conspiracy that makes me believe an individual is unintelligent, it's refusing to question and blindly believing everything our politicians and media tell us to believe.

       Check the front page.  This place is pretty much "the biggest conspiracy is media" then use "other media" to prove "long term media" is lying.  If I read both and tend to side with long term media that makes me part of the problem correct?
