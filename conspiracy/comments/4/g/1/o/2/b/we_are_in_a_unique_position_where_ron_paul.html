       Where both groups were galvanised by the relatively radical messages (Yes I know, it's sad) that these two (while different in their approach) presented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both groups of supporters however can agree that their votes and their voices were ignored and silenced through corruption and fraudulent election manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if Trump, Bernie and Paul supporters put aside their differences and worked together towards a common goal to revamp America's electoral system. Hillary's victory is inevitable and I fear that the nation will celebrate this as some sort of victory just because Trump didn't win - splitting the country between socially aware who feel they achieved something, and those who felt the election was stolen from them - their thoughts rejected and packaged alongside racism and ignorance when in reality they share legitimate concerns with Bernie and Paul supporters. We are too easily manipulated.

       It's happening to Trumps supporters too. I know that doesn't fit the narrative but the two most popular guys are being screwed over every chance the establishment gets. I'm blown away at the Sanders is being cheated circle jerk while the Donald getting cheated is looked over. It doesn't matter who you like the fact is the real people losing out on the whole process are the voters.

       I think the reason the "Donald is being cheated" narrative is being overlooked is because Donald is winning... Also because the states that he lost because of their silly delegate rules had those silly rules prior to Trump being viewed as a threat.  After he lost Colorado he went on TV and said that they changed the rules last minute, which was nonsense since the rules were in place since August, and made people question whether he had any legitimate grievance at all.  He knew the rules and didn't say shit about it until after he lost (presumably because he thought the rules would favor him since the way you win Colorado is by making deals with delegates and deal-making is supposed to be Trump's biggest selling point).  If he was talking about this shit since this past September it would mean a lot more.  He didn't say anything until he lost Colorado and then suddenly he is worried about the voters losing their voice.  Where was that concern before he lost?  If he was talking about this since September he could have possibly done something to change the rules to give the voters their voice back if his concern really was with democracy taking place and not just him winning a state.

       This needs like 1000 upvotes.
      </p>

       Am Canadian. Just as a friendly neighbor next door, it's pretty bloody apparent that the system is controlled against guys like Nader, Sanders, and Paul (sounds like a 70s band).
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to hang out at this pool hall and this old American guy used to hang out there all the time. This is when Ron Paul was running for president. Anyways, this guy was really into politics, and fairly conservative, and he hadn't even heard of Ron Paul. That's not surprising because Canadian media is just as controlled as US media and mainstream media only shows what they want you to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I showed him some youtube videos of Ron Paul's speeches and he was blown away. "Why have I never heard of this guy?"
      </p>
      <p>
       They're doing the same thing with Sanders. Our papers cover Clinton &amp; Trump and Sanders is only ever mentioned to point out that he doesn't have a chance. The exact same fucking line they used against Ron Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both Sanders and Ron Paul raised millions through small donations and it doesn't do shit. The corporate class has way more money and they can just keep throwing cash at their prize horses. It's fucked. The general public can not win a media war against the people who control the media.

       This is impossible. Even if "we" did, there will have to be fallout. After we get the schmucks out, we will then revert to our ideological differences and a vacuum will be created. Ron Paul and (we) the people who support him are very different than the Statists who support Sanders. Polar opposites. Bernie is more of the same (and worse). Ron Paul was a revert, and a true liberation to what we "have".

       It isn't impossible - that's a ridiculous unfounded statement. Both parties (hell even the Trump party fits into this) will find themselves with a common enemy and a common cause - a revamp of the US election system.

       Says who? The common goal is clear. The need to put aside philosophical differences to accomplish that goal is clear. You haven't established why this process will take place at all, you just stated it would, matter of factly without reason.

       Your only reason seems to be that Bernie and Paul's philosophies are in stark contrast and that this some how stops people from recognizing a common interest. That's simply not true. This country has harboured vastly different philosophies it's entire existence and yet operates thanks to the common goals it's people share.

       You know who would love to propagate your claim? The people in charge. Divide and conquering has worked extremely well.

       It's not though! These camps are very different. Bernie supports the FED (mainly) and Paul wants to get rid of it (along with other entities)....

       Yes, and the "left" is actively trying to stop these differing idealogies from being discussed. Because, it may hurt some fee fee's. We are diametrically opposed.

       We aren't talking about dethroning Hillary and uniting behind a common successor. We are talking about revamping the electoral process. Nothing more - nothing less.

       To revamp the electoral process. To allow people like Paul and Bernie a fair chance and maybe not even having to affiliate themselves with the R's or the D's.

       it's astounding for some one who claims they wont vote, you expend an awful lot of effort trying to confuse and dishearten people who still want to.
      </p>
      <p>
       almost as if you would prefer everyone stay home and not vote as some sort of effort to reduce voter turn out....

       There is one difference between the two.
       <br/>
       Sanders supporters have been subject to and aware of disenfranchisement and stolen elections  since the 2000 election.
       <br/>
       I have to admit, it is nice to see that some on the right are starting to recognize that a problem exists.
