       The strange thing is that what is considered "normal" is totally arbitrary. If everyone around you believes that Islam is infalable, you will probably believe this too.

       Considering Delgado's previous MKUltra work, it's probably whatever the CIA considers a "good citizen" to be. Drones who don't question things or think for themselves, I reckon.

       Yes, I think you are right. If you grow up in an environment where not questioning is normal, you probably will not question. But, all of this is 1974. It makes you wonder what they can do today... Of course, they are going to use more drugs than surgery.

       Actually, they're using EM waves. Delgado was famous for his use of a brain implant he called the stimoceiver. With it he could control people like puppets and make them feel the whole range of human emotions. He could even make boys wonder if they were girls and want to marry their interrogators.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all documented here:
       <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/bluebird10pg">
        http://www.wanttoknow.info/bluebird10pg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Much more frighteningly is the interview Delgado gave a few years before his death:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Psychocivilization and Its Discontents: An Interview with José Delgado
       </em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We take up Delgado's research on electromagnetic fields and their effect on people. "I could later do with electro-magnetic radiation what I did with the stimoceiver. It's much better because there's no need for surgery," he explains.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Do you remember how we thought of Franco?" says his wife. "Imagine being able to turn off the Generalisimo." Delgado responds "But who could have put the electrodes into the dictator? With electromagnetic radiation we could have controlled the dictator from a distance. We did some experiments at Yale where we influenced the brain from up to 30 meters away."
