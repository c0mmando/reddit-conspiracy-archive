        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As we are all most likely aware, r/Politics has morphed from a left-leaning sub to a full out Obama circlejerk in the lead up to the 2012 elections. This is undesirable as it is the main politics subreddit, and it limits serious discussion and the diverse ideas needed to make an informed decision. Krugman forbid any Libertarian post ever shows up on the front page. Any antiestablishment posts are downvoted into oblivion in minutes, and you rarely get to see posts that are anti-neoliberalist unless they have to do with popular topics such as privacy or drug legalization, and on the off chance that one does get up there, the first comment always changes the subject to Mitt Romney or the Republicans being worse or some other talking point.</p>

<p>Well, as this is r/Conspiracy, it is probably not a huge stretch of the imagination for us to believe that there is some sort of conspiring going on. I personally believe many people/bots are involved in some sort of PR manipulation through monitoring /new and downvoting just enough to not let it seem unnatural. It doesn&#39;t matter what entities are involved.</p>

<p>So, what can we do about it? Conspire of course! To maximize our efficiency I suggest we make a conscious effort to focus on the <em>top posts</em> on r/Politics and use sound logic to hijack <em>top comments</em> in each post if possible, and of course upvote if one is already there. It may seem like chilling in /new would help, but I assume our efforts will be thwarted by a very large participating group that can scale well, so we should instead use their strength to our advantage. Also, liberals will be more likely to read the comments on pro-neoliberalism posts because they desire instant gratification to help them cope with the cognitive dissonance needed to support Obama despite being &quot;liberal&quot;.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I assume that the vast majority of people on this subreddit are Libertarian, as small government reduces the possibility of corruption and decentralizes power. Thus we should also make a conscious effort to mention Libertarianism to subliminally and overtly influence readers into seeing the word often in order to desensitize them and break the left/right authoritarian paradigm.</p>

<p>Also, a heavy dose of the word &quot;Neoconservatism&quot; is in need because many people just don&#39;t know what it is, as well as comparisons between Obama and Romney that highlight their similarities, while listing alternatives like Paul and Johnson (hegelian dialectic anyone?). And of course throw in the Federal Reserve when appropriate.</p>

<p>Above all, use logic and fact instead of ad-hominem attacks that may be dismissed too easily. There is no need to mislead them as the truth is a very powerful tool, we just need to let it be seen. Every upvote helps.</p>

<p>To fight a conspiracy, you need a conspiracy. Please post any suggestions of course.</p>

<p>(P.S. place your bets on how soon until this shows up on r/Conspiratard, our leftist mortal subreddit enemy, shill-haven, and arguably a bigger circlejerk than r/circlejerk itself)</p>

<p>Hi. I&#39;m one of the circle-jerkers that subscribes to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. I know we&#39;re discouraged from commenting or voting on linked threads, but your characterization of that sub as a &quot;shill-haven&quot; intrigued me.</p>

<p>All this time I&#39;ve been making fun of conspiratards simply for the enjoyment of being exposed to and mocking their crazy ideas. If there is a way I can be paid while doing this, I am extremely interested in signing up.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a member of the shill army assigned to making fun of this community, please feel free to message me with the appropriate enrollment forms or whatever. My thanks in advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>R/politics has always been the default &#39;liberal/progressive&#39; subreddit.  Even when reddit was one long feed with no subreddits, there was a ton of liberal stuff upvoted and everything conservative downvoted.  They created subreddits mainly to reign in memes and politics posts and wrangle them into one place.</p>

<p>Then outside groups started trying to game the subreddit.  First it was redstate...I remember they actually had a call to arms like this one.  I wish the search worked better in my user page as I have the link somewhere...hilarious stuff.  They wanted to turn <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> red like they did with DemocraticUnderground.  They failed miserably.  Actually some of the dudes that came over in that &#39;raid&#39; never left and I still see them accruing negative karma :)</p>

<p>And then came the racists...they failed too and settled for pushing their nonsense on weekends when the liberal office class is at home (NOTE: if your gonna make some kind of inroads, concentrate on weekends when the traffic is lighter and your own raiding will have more impact.)</p>

<p>Next was the 2008 election and the Paul supporters. They were drubbed out by the Obama supporters, which was everyone at that point.</p>

<p>Then more redstate-type silliness in 2010 soon followed by the only real inroads I have ever seen an outside group make in r/politics: the 2012 Ron Paul campaign supporters.  They got a foot hold for a few months with crossposts and outside calls-to-action (dailypaul.com) but the liberals smacked them down quite thoroughly and by the end of it, their posts were getting the same treatment as any other outside stuff.</p>

<p>So your call-to-arms here? Nothing new.  And <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> being a conspiracy by liberals?  LOL - it has always been a liberal forum and they protect that shit like any other group would after years of being inundated by numerous groups advocating the same thing you are advocating here.  A bunker mentality exists now and I think that you are mistaking that mentality, that group cohesion for some conspiracy.</p>

<p>Actually, it is a conspiracy, a conspiracy of liberals sick of people trying to change the place and game it.  So go ahead, take your best shot.  All you&#39;ll do is lose karma, sound like little kids and create even more bunker mentality that will further keep the place Blue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until recently, America was the only first-world nation without socialized medicine. (We&#39;re still half-assing it.) Arguably, the police are a socialized security force. Basic Income experiments in Otjivero, Namibia helped living conditions at least as well as making people work for the money. Several Scandinavian countries provide free tuition for higher learning, which produces a more usefully educated populace than America&#39;s problematic solution of giving loans to promising individuals who couldn&#39;t otherwise afford college. </p>

<p>Or - and I know this is completely unthinkable for some users here - maybe you&#39;re simply outnumbered by people who think Libertarianism is a crock.</p>

<p>You are openly planning to spam and vote-game in a subreddit twenty-five times your size. Good luck with that. More importantly, though, you&#39;re encouraging people to be &#39;counter-shills&#39; in the absence of shills to counter. You&#39;re just advocating shillery. I have no idea why you&#39;d be comfortable with that.</p>

<p>Let me put it this way: If I were in support of Obama, and I was evil, that&#39;s what I&#39;d do, so I assume someone is doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That subreddit is so crappy. Most of the people posting there claim to be leftist, but under all the rhetoric they support the same pro-corporate, pro-war, pro-evil policies as those on the right. </p>

<p>I.e. certain very academic criticisms of corporations, US War-making are permitted. But the moment you swing out of the ivory tower type critical comments are start actually making real comments on the actual state of things in America, you get downvoted enmasse. </p>

<p>I just had a huge disagreement with some dudes who were lionizing walmart for donating <em>gasp</em> 20 million dollars post Katrina. Then there was some crappy post about how walmart is being progressive and awesome because it shut off a supplier that treats its workers even worse then Walmart. Woohoo, Walmart rocks!! woohoo. Not even to mention the constant posts talking about how the federal reserve really has your best interests at heart. </p>

<p>/end rant</p>

<p>Basically many of the people who call themselves leftists really aren&#39;t of the left at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The left/right labels are old hat. They now only apply to social issues while most people nowadays are authoritarian in nature because they want free stuff from the government and don&#39;t understand where the money comes from, so they support giving the government more authority in order to get their free stuff faster. I blame the TV and educational system.</p>
