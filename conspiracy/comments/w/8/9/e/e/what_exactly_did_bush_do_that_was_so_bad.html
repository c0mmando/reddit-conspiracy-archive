       I wonder if the quote was meant to be taken more as "we essentially created terrorism by accident, we never thought about the blowback of our actions. We messed up royally."
      </p>
      <p>
       So he wasn't actually admitting to sinister secret actions but saying that what they thought were positive actions for the country created a whole mess that if the American people knew about, they'd be outraged that that they hadn't accounted for the consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this type of stuff isn't usually accepted here but I think it's important to think about things from all sides and see if there is an equally as rational explanation without there being a conspiracy. Hanlon's Razor, if you will.

       No, he wasn't. That idea came from a complete misunderstanding of
       <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/document/document_20070723.shtml">
        this BBC program
       </a>
       back in 2007. If you listen to the whole program, it doesn't say that Bush had
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       to do with the Business Plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it says is that Bush was a director of the Hamburg-America line, and that this company was investigated for Nazi ties by the same committee that investigated the Business Plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is everything that was said about Bush in that program:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Later in the McCormack-Dickstein report, a shipping company called Hamburg-America Line was accused of providing free passage to Germany to American journalists willing to write favorable copy on Hitler's rise to power. The company is also alleged to have brought Nazi spies and pro-fascist sympathizers into America. John Buchanan has studied this latest section of the report and has discovered that one of the company's managers came from a very famous family. "The thing that surprised me most was to discover in the documents of this company that Hamburg-America Lines had, in fact, been managed on the U. S. side at the executive level by Prescott Bush as part of a web of Nazi business interests that were all seized in late 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy Act by the U. S. Congress and Prescott Bush is the grandfather of the sitting President of the United States." [John Buchanan]
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, at the time it was perfectly legal to have dealings with Hitler's Germany. Prescott Bush was not called to account for this until America entered the war.
       </p>

       No, man.  Clinton did this.  I remember when he did it and I was really pissed about the hypocrisy of it.  If Clinton had needed student aid and got caught "not inhaling" then he would have been ineligible for student loans....but then again he didn't need them.

       From your article:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1998, Congress amended the Higher Education Act of 1965 to restrict eligibility for federal financial aid to students who have been convicted of certain drug charges under federal or state laws.

       Bush didn't take office until 2001.

      <p>
       On October 7, 1998, President Clinton signed into law the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 (Pub. L.105-244) that amended the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA).

       actually, Blackwater deployed their men without a government contract after Katrina and only received the contract a few days after they were already stationed there.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's right, a private organization took it upon itself to deploy mercenaries with military grade weaponry onto American soil after a national disaster without first securing a government contract for their deployment.

       I haven't read any of the links above, I don't like Bush (I'm an anarchist in fact) and I stay out of the political controversy surrounding that natural disaster. My question is, what did Bush do and/or bumble with Katrina? It seems obvious that he didn't cause the hurricane, so I'm suspecting that it has something to do with the response. Do you believe that it's the role of the federal government to response to every natural disaster? Did Bush only fail in New Orleons or did he fail all along the coast and with every person?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, I'm an anarchist and I think people treat the government too much like an omnipotent god.

       OK, there was a link for "bumbling Katrina" which linked to wikipedia. The gist it appears is that the federal government is responsible for responding to natural disasters. Again I don't like Bush, but I don't think this is a fair criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       New Orleons is a city that is below sea level and therefore a problem waiting to happen. The state government is the one that is responsible for preparing for these types of emergencies, because the federal government can't individually tax these people for living in such a dangerous city.

       Thats not true though. If you look at the details of FEMA, they are not responsible for everything in a natural disaster, but rather as support. The primary responsibility still remains with the state governor. If someone should be criticized, it's the governor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I find it ironic that you want to criticize me for not living in reality in r/conspiracy and while you're trying to make Bush out to be the anti-christ.

       FEMA simply can't respond better than a state system though. There are limits to the number of personnel a federal agency can bring in from out of state to help. The best thing that FEMA can do to help most of the time is to provide a few administrative and logistical tasks and monetary support.

       So how was Bush supposed to know that this was not the best person? This means that the worst criticism is that he's a bad judge of character.

       Digging a bit deeper, you'll find the decision on Iraq to be the cause. That money could have kept America in line as a first world country. Is he bad? What an understatement! He set our country back more than any of us can individually fathom.

       "Yet after 2003, the flow of federal dollars toward SELA dropped to a trickle. The Corps never tried to hide the fact that the spending pressures of the war in Iraq, as well as homeland security -- coming at the same time as federal tax cuts -- was the reason for the strain. At least nine articles in the Times-Picayune from 2004 and 2005 specifically cite the cost of Iraq as a reason for the lack of hurricane- and flood-control dollars."

       I think the most revealing thing about Junior was how he sold his Texas ranch for a gated mansion as soon as he left office. Why spend all that time clearing brush (remember they built an office there so he could say he was working, and not on vacation) only to sell the property the minute you no longer need to pretend to be a cowboy? Also, notice he has never been seen in a cowboy hat again. This proves everything about the man is staged. The entire family is lying liars.

       His ranch was very secure. They even built a situation room to act as the Oval office, as he was rarely in DC. The ranch in Crawford was purchased for the election of 2000, it was a prop. Like in the movies. Fake, orchestrated to make you think Bush is just a normal guy in a cowboy hat clearing brush, everyday. Once that image was no longer needed, he sold his prop and moved into a gated community. Nothing a Bush does should be taken at face value. If they are hugging little african kids for cameras, you can be sure it is for another reason. Either to scrub their image, or perhaps even to just place them somewhere so as not to be suspected of involvement elsewhere. They are disgusting people, leeches to society, and have been for the better part of a century.

       You're right, but he is the person we appoint the responsibility to.  If we don't blame him, we have no one to blame at all.  Truth is, we need to START with holding the president accountable and move out to find the real seeds of power and start holding them accountable.

       At this time, there is no way for us to hold them accountable. A nation of 300+ million doesnt hand its decision making over to a new person every 4-8 years, and the people who really make the decisions will always hide themselves behind talking heads so that they can never be held accountable.

       Many of these are just opinions he had and things that actually had no effect on anything. Condemning someone for victimless crimes like doing coke is pretty absurd imo. Comprehensive list? More like exaggerated and drawn out list. That being said, Bush Jr was a pretty fucking terrible human being that played a crucial role into turning the US to the pseudo growing facsist/communist slave state that  we see today.

       <p>
        In December 2005, a long-time friend who worked in the Bush White House tipped me on a meeting the President had with some top GOP leaders. During that meeting, a worried Republican aide told Bush that the USA Patriot Act represented a threat to the Constitution.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bush, whose temper is always close to the surface, exploded:
       </p>
       <p>
        "Stop throwing the Constitution in my face," Bush screamed back. "It’s just a goddamned piece of paper!"
       </p>
       <p>
        After confirming the story with two other White House sources, I published it on December 10, 2005.

       Certainly everything he did as president is consistent with this. So I believe it.

       That's hardly a source.

      <p>
       Just read that article, for christ's sake!  The author himself says that he just heard it from a friend, and later on down in the article he says something that amounts to "fuck you guys, our stories are true!  How dare you ask us for a verifiable source!  Our hearsay is fact, screw you!"

       I don't consider Doug Thompson to be a journalist in any sense.  From this article I see he has no regard for the truth, and will believe anything as long as it supports his worldview.

       Yet later, he retracted the story.  Other journalists have pointed out that his sources are still unconfirmed and the claim remains unsubstantiated.

       The author of your article has also said...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I started taking more chances with stories, jumping on ones with sketchy sources, always trying to outdo the last "big" story. I had people willing to help me and they would send me info that I used often on their word alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        . . . I wrote stories based on emails from sources I never met. I would meet self-proclaimed "important people" in out-of-the way bars, taking what they told me at face value. Washington is a breeding ground for phonies and wannabes. Too often I printed what they told me because I was so full of myself that I was sure it was true and did not require further verification.

       I especially like the one about Cheney/halliburton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheney lies about his financial ties to Halliburton and then, when caught:
      </p>
      <p>
       "He has pledged to give after-tax proceeds of the stock options to charity."
      </p>
      <p>
       IE: He's just using his compensation from the company he had improper relations with to pay his taxes.

       The Bushes get around: two Presidents, a VP and CIA Director, a Gov. of Texas, Jeb the Gov. of Florida where the vote was contested... Then there's Marvin Bush, the guy in charge of Twin Tower security on 9/11. Then there's George W. Bush’s cousin, Judge John M. Walker of the 2nd Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals, who is part of a three-judge panel hearing the case of April Gallop vs. former vice-president Dick Cheney, former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers. Also, George W.'s grandfather, Prescott Bush, not only made money supporting Hitler's rise to power, he also aided an attempt to bring Nazi-style fascism to America.

       Bush and his father are responsible for the deaths of over two million  Iraqis. They are responsible for the wounding and injuries of between four  and five million. When I think of the Butcher of Bagdad, I don't think of Saddam, I think of the Bush crime family.

       It looks like this idea started to take root back in 2010. At that time bush had over 1000 vacation days and Obama's most recent number was 26. I couldn't find any more recent numbers for obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the story
       <a href="http://www.politicususa.com/obama-bush-vacation.html">
        http://www.politicususa.com/obama-bush-vacation.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some more numbers here:
       <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2010/01/president-obamas-vacation-days/">
        http://www.factcheck.org/2010/01/president-obamas-vacation-days/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The numbers do vary depending on how they're counted. For example, some people don't count trips to camp david when other politicians are there since that's business. Some people don't count any camp david visits, others count all of them. Either way you count it, it seems like bush might still have more. Frankly, who cares who had more vacation time... the results are the important thing.

       You are really gonna let that "1000" stand?  'At this time' that would mean he spent pretty much -every- day in vacation.  You are the problem.

       Not sure where you learned math, but 1000 days of vacation over 8 years  would be less than 1/3 of his time

       "At this time" would seem to mean a similar point in the administration term.  Otherwise the comparison is stupid as fuck from the start.  So, ~3.6 years, 1000 days.  You see the problem?

       look , as someone who firmly believes in the validity of many so called conspiracy theories, THIS is what pisses me off, people who run their mouths without facts, or those who always take it that step too far that takes away credibility.... take alex jones in his bohemian grove documentary, good crazy shit, video to back it up.... but when hes standing outside screaming we respect your dark powers into a megaphone, regardless of what happens at bohemian grove, that destroys some credibility
