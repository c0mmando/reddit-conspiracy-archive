        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">57</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-06 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../user/anononaut.html">anononaut</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sometimes I think reddit is just being maintained as a time wasting honeypot by opponents of free speech who want to keep people who care busy thinking they are communicating when secretly they are being shadow banned and no one is seeing anything important they post.</p>

<p>First of all now you have shadow banning which keeps posters posting without knowing their stuff isn&#39;t even getting put up. 
That&#39;s so dishonest that there really is no excuse for the practice unless you want those people to think they are engaged and keep them busy.</p>

<p>The old &quot;stops spammers&quot; excuse is and has always been moot since real auto spammers who use many many accounts get around it and there never was true spam on reddit to begin with.</p>

<p>Now long time posting friends of mine some of whom have some of the top ten all time scoring posts on reddit and 5 yrs and tens of thousands of post khamra are being banned from r/politcs because of one post only one possible nubie mod disagrees with .</p>

<p>They just have to say &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;editorialized&quot;  which are completely opened ended terms that are used to shut down posts now.</p>

<p>A quick glance at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/moderationlog">www.reddit.com/r/moderationlog</a> shows how prevalent that practice is. Virtual NONE of the posts removed from r/politics or most subreddits are actual spam nor is the title mischaracterizing the link or editorialized.
(and quite frankly no readers of r/politics ever decided by vote that they WANTED things that were editorialized removed from reddit  anyway - people come to reddit to see readers catches or insights within stories that are often overlooked in a short newspaper title not just reporting of verbatum news story titles) </p>

<p>The posts are clearly being removed because of someone who may have no history on reddit or less kharma than than poster.</p>

<p>This is a huge problem.</p>

<p>and it is not one solved be the OP arguing the merits of each post in some other subreddit - that&#39;s a huge time waster and up votes and downvotes by the readership is supposed to do that.</p>

<p>And lets not forget there are now banned lists of link sources which exist which no one knows about unless you happen to read <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BannedDomains">http://www.reddit.com/r/BannedDomains</a> .And these aren&#39;t just small fringe sources but huge publications like The Atlantic (did you know they were banned form reddit for a while?) And even small fringe website links shouldn&#39;t be banned either because they often break stories first - which often get main stream coverage after the story got huge attention on the former Reddit. </p>

<p>edit: let&#39;s not forget this incredible time waster which pops up and keeps you hanging until you can post again &quot;Looks like you&#39;re either a brand new user (actually no - I&#39;m not) or your posts have not been doing well recently (again wrong) . <strong>You may have to wait a bit to post again.</strong> In the meantime feel free to check out the reddiquette or join the conversation in a different thread.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>None of this makes sense unless your goal is to keep people busy spending time posting stuff that won&#39;t be read.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Literally the methods do not make sense if a website is trying to promote communication of ideas among readers or whose goal it is to make it easy for users to use</strong> which is why the ORIGINAL reddit was established before being purchased by Conde NAste and altered</p>

<p>So is it possible Reddit is just a honey pot to suck energy yet designed to keep people from actually leaving because when they look at their submissions list it seems as if everything is fine and their stuff is being seen?</p>

<p>Is that reasonable to think?</p>

<p>Well Honeypots exist all over the internet for many reasons.</p>

<p>As long as shadow banning of posts exists and as long as long time users who have proven they post what people want to read by their kharma are able to be silenced by one person without warning, the only conclusion a logical person can come to is that reddit exists to have people spin their wheels without reaching a large enough audience to make a political difference.</p>

<p>I gotta say it&#39;s a genius honeypot.</p>

<p>Of course you won&#39;t know this if this post gets shadow banned or the prevalent posters on reddit keep disappearing through bans.</p>

<p>edit</p>

<p>More proof direct from reddit admins that time sucking distraction of posters who are censored is the true goal of Reddit.</p>

<p>EVEN BOTS DESIGNED TO DETECT CENSORSHIP ARE NOW CENSORING THE SHADOWBANNING </p>

<p>The bot which used to tell people they were censored is now NOT telling people they were censored if they were secretly banned (shadowbanned). Again the defense is &quot;Spammers&quot; but spam has never been a problem on reddit and true spammers don&#39;t read messages and design around such things easily.</p>

<p>What this does is it just keeps the real person who has been secretly shadow banned from knowing their time is being wasted posting to reddit .</p>

<p>This is just what a time wasting honeypot design would want and NOT what a website concerned about communication and ease of use would want.</p>

<p>More proof direct from reddit admins that time sucking distraction of posters who are censored is the true goal of Reddit while maintaining the APPEARANCE of being an open forum so people keep reading it and are &quot;protected&quot; from the important stories.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on reddit since 2007 and it is waaaay different. It used to be user generated content with not too much obvious moderation. Now...it&#39;s all astro-turfing, shadow bans, lots of subreddit rules, tons of over-moderation and the one line circle jerks, negative comments and other general nastiness get the most up votes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been fascinating to watch the slow descent.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you what I observe. My IP changes every 5 minutes, at that time my cache is scrubbed and I&#39;m logged out of whatever reddit account I&#39;m using, of which I have hundreds. I can then immediately see whether or not the votes I&#39;ve made, up or down, have actually been recorded. A 1 was a 2, then I&#39;m logged out, and it&#39;s a 1 again. Of course, there is the &quot;velocity&quot; of votes, which reddit observes, and this plays into vote count. What I am unsure of, is what type of logs does reddit maintain and for how long? Do they know the IP I was using for a post 5 years ago? I dunno. I do know I never keep an account for more than a week, and I never hit reddit with the same IP twice. Let&#39;s not forget that this site and everything you type into it is owned by a multinational corporation, and we have no real idea what they will ultimately do with it and all our countless lives typed out over the course of years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it would take a lot of effort to shadow ban lots of people and keep them fooled into thinking they are still visible. Also, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary. </p>

<p>I think the idea that reddit is here as a time sink is quite plausible. Even with active discussion between lots of people that care, it&#39;s still keeping you yolked to your PC instead of being out and doing something. No deceit is necessary. That&#39;s why I started limiting my reddit time. I love the site and yet I think it&#39;s something of a mind poison. Same goes for TV and video games. These things are enjoyable but ultimately unproductive. I think reddit and much of the internet in general are just new ways to keep populations occupied and pacified.</p>

<p>The other thing is data. If you look at askreddit, a lot of questions get repeated quite a lot with only slightly different wording. These are often quite personal too. I don&#39;t trust the motivations behind that and it would be easy to mine all that data from one thread, or put together comments from any one user.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to my other post, having worked as a mod for a different site - a more old style forum, spammers can be a real hassle and are hard to stop. It&#39;s a fine balancing act between making it harder for spammers without inconveniencing the users too much. I&#39;m not making any sort of excuses here. What can look OTT or just plain wrong might not be intended that way at all. In which case, you&#39;re going to need to nag the mods involved and discuss it with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is being run exactly the way Democratic Underground was.  It&#39;s the same playbook.  After the 2008 election, they slowly turned up the heat, banning anybody who showed a conscience, until it was just a fake playground.</p>

<p>Then they used it to test talking points against Obama&#39;s critics, who were ironically the people who worked to get him elected in the first place.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a bunch of animals using temporary money/power to try to consolidate their power.  Humans must always resist these animals.</p>
