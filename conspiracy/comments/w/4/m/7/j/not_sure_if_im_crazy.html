       I've been noticing a lot of things the U.S. has been doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I began thinking about it a few years ago, when I saw a video about a concentration camp being built in the U.S., along with millions of coffins stockpiled. Google helped to prove that there are TONS of camps all over the country. A few years later, the SOPA/PIPA outrage. This is around the same time the 2012 NDAA was passed, basically nullifying the Bill of Rights. Shortly after, SOPA's big brother, CISPA, was passed in a more hushed manner after Congress realized their fuck up of publicity. Now, it's illegal to not have healthcare, and you will be fined for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, when you add all this together, there is the ability to fine people who don't have money, which obviously aren't going to be able to pay that. And, when you can't pay your ticket, you go to prison. When the prisons get full, you're shuttled off to a spanking new camp. And when people point it out, CISPA will be watching you until they nab you for being a "terrorist" and throw you in prison until you rot, with all your civil liberties dead.

       I honestly feel a war coming. A real war, not this Iraq oil-grab bullshit (no offense to vets, I respect soldiers but hate the motives behind the puppeteers). It's still a gut feeling, but I think the 2012 bullshit is going to have a part to play, with people freaking out and such.

       On the fine aspect you are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fine is pulled out of your tax return.  If there is nothing to pull out of it, or its insufficient there is literally NO ADDITIONAL PENALTY.  This is a huge economic flaw in the ACA (and could cause deficit issues long run) but far from a flaw in justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now for CISPA and NDAA - I agree.  They serve as legal ground work for a grave threat to our ability to rule ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also - I thought the Prison Camps were all but debunked as Alex Jones hypertensive bullshit...?  Am I wrong?

       Not sure where that number comes from but theoretically IRS agents already look at your personal info.  This is literally just another line item and worksheet on our taxes every year... Nothing really scary about it, or rather nothing more scary then getting a tax credit for student loan interest or for having dependents or any of the other millions of details we give them.  Rather mundane actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there are more agents they'll probably be deployed to go after tax abusers as the US has let them off the hook for over a decade w/ almost no penalty.  Most are the ridiculously wealthy who just ignore rules or actively try to hide their income.

       Well, Im also a small business owner and have never had any issue with the IRS.  The state on the other hand...  And what you describe is completely false.  They dont have enough IRS auditors  to nail every mistake to a wall and they havent since early Bush days (maybe as far back as Clinton - he was rather lax too).
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as government 'control' (in this case control over abusive insurance companies) I'll take those any day if they serve to limit the power of monopolistic corporations.  The only thing worse the monopolistic corporations are feudal or dictator based governments (same thing larger scale).  This is actually government in the opposite direction since it targets the dismantling of an anti-capitalistic monopoly power in favor of individual benefits (this is the sole purpose of a people's government).
      </p>
      <p>
       Government control is why we dont have children losing limbs in factories, its why our rivers have usable water in them again (sort of - this is failing now thanks to corp lobby power) and its why we dont have to fear walking outside or driving on the road.  Where do you think those services you use to make your money come from?  Who do you think educates your employees?  Its simply stupid to think we're capable of ruling ourselves in our current state.  Most people cant even let each other merge on the highway and you propose we can pool money for mutually exclusive long term benefit w/o government?  That lacks insight, hell it lacks common sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no I dont want fascist overlords, but those are usually derived by corporate power infiltrating government, not government just suddenly becoming vested in corporate interests (there is a heavy motivator one way and nearly none the other way - until its invited).  Check it out its all through out history since the fall of monarchies (which derived their power from church - a kind of mini corporate/fascist interest).

       Sorry, but there's a difference between federal and local agencies. The things you mention (roads, rivers, etc.) usually (and should) be handled at a local level, not a federal one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I oppose large federal government. I feel they don't do much to enhance my standard of living. Firefighters, local police (usually), and other such things are usually good. ATF, CIA, and a lot of other federal agencies are not as beneficial in my opinion.

       Well I had a nice long response but lost it b/c reddit is shitty w/ sessions.  Summary: At the end of the day corporations will wreck your shit 1000x more frequently then governments.  History has shown it.  In fact most government 'wrecking' comes from corporate interest interfering with it.  Limits on corporate power (small fascist organizations) are far more important the being paranoid about a 3 letter acronym that has not and will not ever have any real interest in you.   The only reason a government will treat people like cattle in modern times is because a company want free slave labor. Its as simple as that and rather short sighted to think otherwise.

       I disagree. 98% of the time I feel a lot happier (and treated better) coming out of AutoZone, Cabella's, or any number of these evil "corporations" than I do coming out of a courthouse, the DMV, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, there are certainly evil corporations out there, but I usually have the choice whether or not I support these companies. I have no option where my taxes go. For example, I don't buy Microsoft, who I consider pretty evil, products. I use Linux and try to do everything I can there. I can't boycott government agencies. They have the only true monopoly in the US, any other monopolies stem from the Government.

       Actually its standard business practice beyond a certain level of growth to seek out monopoly power while appearing not to have it.  This is with or without government help.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may feel better coming out of a corporation but that doesn't mean much in regards to how you are being used or actually treated.
      </p>
      <p>
       A government that derives its power from people has an inherent motivation to serve those people to the best of its (unwieldy) ability.  A corporation never derives its power from people, it derives its power from profit (in capital markets such as the western world).  In some cases people drive those profits, as in your feel good scenarios, but after a certain level of vertical and horizontal integration the profits are no longer derived from people as much as sucked out of people using ambitiously manipulative tactics of various types.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I agree 100%, the local pizza place is a perfect example of actual capitalism working correctly to provide a good service.  But once you get beyond local service you are no longer beholden to your customers, youre beholden to your shareholders.  And before you think I dont know about this, I am a small business owner myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes a special kind of corruption and infiltration for a government of the people (non-dictatorships etc) to be turned against the people.  In the modern world its not a natural progression.  It takes only the standard model capitalistic pursuit unhindered by regulation for a corporation to be turned against people - they will naturally seek to extract more profit from less costs which will inevitably cause harm to people (environmental, labor, land, resource etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont get me wrong - these are generalizations for a purpose.  There are plenty of examples of the reverse being true.  The point is, when trying to find the source of our fucked up situation, you have only to look at the natural tendencies of the machines we've created (organizations with self fulfilling purposes) to determine the root cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our governments greatest corruption always stands along side the rise of the most powerful companies and cartels throughout history.  The cruelest fascist regimes always stand side by side of some resource extraction mechanism which favors a company or corporate interest be it bannana in south america, cheap labor in china, rare earths and diamonds in africa or computing in europe.  All of the ugliest governments with least regard for human liberty were propped up by corporate interests in the resources under those people's feet.  And when those are gone or dwindling, the only resource left will be the people themselves.

       As far as the camps, I don't have an actual source. But an old train station in my city was "bought," rebuilt and now has stood empty for 3+ yrs yet has 24/7 security. I don't know of a private company that would invest in all that to use it for nothing.

       When they do, I think we should get rid of a lot of inter-city infrastructure. Keep some, of course, but the constant importation/exportation of goods should cease. It's a drain of resources and constant pollution, whereas we should focus more on production for individual cases rather than mass production and waste.

       Hell, chicago could realistically be powered on solar and wind farms alone, of course everyone thinks having wind power over the lake would be an eyesore, but we don't need the big three bladed turbines, I think a vertical column with sails spiraled down along the outside (think barber pole) to conserve space, as well as being astetically pleasing. I don't care if someone steals the idea, just make it happen!

       Desinis,

      <p>
       I highly recommend an AKM, this is the modernized version of the ubiquitous AK-47 rifle. I need not spend much time discussing the functionality of the Kalashnikov series of rifles as their utility is somewhat of a gold standard for small arms.
      </p>
      <p>
       The AKM rifle will serve you well:
      </p>
      <p>
       here is the most common and least expensive AKM available, it is made in Romania of military grade parts:
       <a href="http://www.aimsurplus.com/product.aspx?item=F1CAKGPWASR">
        http://www.aimsurplus.com/product.aspx?item=F1CAKGPWASR
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a more expensive and higher quality AKM produced in the Izhmash industrial works where Mikhail Kalashnikov still works:
       <a href="http://www.atlanticfirearms.com/storeproduct838.aspx">
        http://www.atlanticfirearms.com/storeproduct838.aspx
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These are both fine rifles that will likely continue to operate long after you and I have both been killed by the scrofulous globalist scum who seek to deny us our rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why you should get an AKM and not an AR15:

       If you consider the cold war a state of war (and judging by our military spending during it, it was) the US has been in a state of constant war since ww2 except for some brief periods after the USSR collapsed. Chilling. So I don't think your crazy. I'm not going to say your are right in the exact details, but in the big picture you are.

       It never really went away. Even in the touchie-feelie 1960s, the height of the civil rights movements, if you didn't pay your taxes, you were put into prison. That's debtor's prison. A person could stiff a local business or his credit card company by declaring bankruptcy, but he couldn't declare bankruptcy to evade his taxes. Today, there is a creep back to the concept of a more general debtor's prison system. If you don't pay back your student loan, for example, you can be punished under the law for it. No exemptions. And this will spread to other debts .... BECAUSE the people who are owed the money are the same people who own the government and the courts. Debt is not true slavery if there is any way to escape it, and they want you as their slaves.

       Debtors prisons are defacto and not Constitutional.  Sounds like people need to wake up and realize their rights... unless you knowingly sign away your rights... well then that's your own fault I guess.

       So if you're pulling in 15k a year you may as well just pay the $95 fine right? Then you can just hope each year the fine doesn't increase.

       Here's one for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       The kind person acts from the heart,
      </p>
      <p>
       and accomplishes a multitude of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The righteous person acts out of pity,
      </p>
      <p>
       yet leaves many things undone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moral person will act out of duty,
      </p>
      <p>
       and when no one will respond
      </p>
      <p>
       will roll up his sleeves and use force.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Tao is forgotten, there is righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       When righteousness is forgotten, there is morality.
      </p>
      <p>
       When morality is forgotten, there is the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The law is the husk of faith,
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        and trust is the beginning of chaos.

      <p>
       Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter;
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals;
and everywhere life is full of heroism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially, do not feign affection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars;
you have a right to be here.
      </p>
      <p>
       And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be,
and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.

       Forgive my ignorance, but I've been out of the country for a few years now and am coming back soon (sigh) with no job and no health insurance. Will look into a bit more myself but am I at risk for being fined/harassed? I know I am on accident away from being financially ruined for life, but that's a risk I will take...

       I figure need to get a job/income before I can afford luxuries like health insurance...

       You will be able to get tax credits to pay for your health insurance if you cant afford to buy it your self.   Essentially you do the foot work but the federal government pays the bill.   No you will not be harassed if you dont buy in, the 'fine' will just come out of your tax return.  No additional penalties apply.

       where do you think the federal government gets the money to pay "the bill"

       the federal government cannot "make money", they can only collect tax

       Thats patently false.  The federal government makes money on interest and all sorts of things.  Bailouts, loans etc come back to the treasury with interest.   Its not a frequent mechanism but it exists.  Do you think we just throw that money into 3rd world countries for nothing?  The international bank gets billions with no return?  Thats silly and simply false, we get returns.  Its not a huge mechanism but it does exist and the government can 'make money'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the CBO report if you want to know where the money comes from... its not your paycheck.  Stop crying about what you dont seem to understand and read the actual numerical analysis.

       I've also heard there is millitary training for torturing people in a similar manner to concentration camps. Not sure how true that is though, and I lost the source. But you can always google it.

       There was a story on another subreddit about this today. It was describing how people are going to jail because they can't afford to pay the fines they are now receiving.

       Personally I think the prison camps are in preparation for an OWS event nationwide.
