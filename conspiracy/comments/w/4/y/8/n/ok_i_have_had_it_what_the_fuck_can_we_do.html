<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/w3hns/bush_in_zambia/">http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/w3hns/bush_in_zambia/</a></p>

<p>The comment thread is an orgy of &quot;Bush is an ok guy&quot;. Any comment that cites any of the horrible fascist-inducing actions he made are being bombed to hell. </p>

<p>The top comments about how great of a dude bush was/is are 1200 votes above the actual content of his presidency. It claims that no matter what your political background you should love dude for some shit he is doing currently in africa. I would argue the opposite, that regardless of political bend most hate Bush....but I digress. </p>

<p>Read through the thread. You will rage, I promise. </p>

<p>My point in posting this is: I am really fed up with reddit being gamed beyond belief. I value the <strong>concept</strong> of reddit more than I value the current site.</p>

<p>How can we get this back? How can we connect with other redditors who avoid r/conspiracy because of our fabulous aluminum headgear but would otherwise join us in some fashion to retake control of the site? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was fairly shocked to see that reaction as well, especially with a picture of Bush hugging a kid that&#39;s clearly terrified and uncomfortable about it. And tons of comments going &quot;Wow, I know my hugs and that&#39;s a real hug!!&quot;.</p>

<p>I think the default subreddits are beyond help. You&#39;ve got over 2 million people subscribed in <a href="/r/pics">/r/pics</a> and all the less savvy Reddit users are among them. Reddit has grown so big that you really get all kinds of people. Over in <a href="/r/canada">/r/canada</a>, not even a default subreddit, I find myself arguing with people that defend Fox News. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is a marketing tool of the democratic party (Obama circlejerk) and no meaningful discussion happens there. </p>

<p>The days of Reddit being a site of like-minded people is long gone, if it ever existed. I suggest you find subreddits that you appreciate and that have a good level of discussion, unsubscribe from the trash subreddits and use <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> when you want more general interest links. This at least prevents you from being bombarded with utter crap unless you&#39;re actually open to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a voluntary army. There&#39;s no reason they or their friends have to die. If they did a little more critical thinking on the motives of the army and were more skeptical of joining it, they wouldnt be dead or in emotional pain. i wish the best for all people, including troops. unfortunately troops kill people so that makes it hard for everyone else at times. and it would be best for the troops if they never became soldiers. and yes, i do think people who join armies are tribalistic idiots.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll agree there. I liken it to American Idol. </p>

<p>Candidates get on stage, perform their routine and then you, as a viewer sitting at home, take in all of the edited material and contrived <em>bullshit</em> to make a decision on who you&#39;d like to vote for to make it to the next round. Is it reality? No. Does it come across as though it is? Yup. Or at least it&#39;s made in a manor to make you believe it is. </p>

<p>This whole idea that the two party system is honest and fair is of course, a complete farce.</p>

<p>The rigging of GW&#39;s election should have had people kicking in the doors of officials around the nation. It met little to no resistance. And then people were surprised when he was reelected. </p>

<p>Guhbuhdurrrr.... </p>

<p>I can&#39;t find the words to express my feeling of complacency with the whole situation. It&#39;s the age old maxim: you get what you pay for.
And in a society that&#39;s peppered with hypocrisy and corruption, who the hell would be put in a position to represent you fairly? Fucking <em>no one.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone wants a large mass of reddit&#39;s usersbase. The large mass is the problem. Every site suffers from this. Initially you want to attract as many users as possible, and then they come, and you realize just how stupid the majority of your fellow human beings are. At that moment any loyalty or passion you had for your site goes out the window and your only concern is how to manipulate and take advantage of your userbase to realize a monetary return. TBH, if I owned reddit, I&#39;d suck whatever money I could out of these idiots and sell the site to South Korea or some shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what we&#39;ll deem: your <em>beginning</em> investigation into the improprieties of the US foreign <em>policies</em>.</p>

<p>While the beginning Bush&#39;s tenure in the White House had a promising start: a &quot;humbled&quot; foreign policy, lowered taxation; it didn&#39;t take long for the megalomaniac to emerge.</p>

<p>Below I have listed some of the <em>heavy</em> crimes committed by Mr. Bush and his administration.</p>

<p>While these are not his worst actions, they are a good start - a light read if you will.
If you find that these implications indeed make sense, I then suggest shifting your gaze to his aberrations of judgement/true involvement in 9/11.</p>

<p>Really, both of these places are a starting point as the rabbit hole does go quite deep. But I must also note that GW&#39;s administration was laden with nefarious blood-thirsty dicks. Start looking at Cheney&#39;s record: it&#39;s enough to make a dark man blush.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having spent as much time as im assuming you have doing the things on your list, I still fully disagree with you. I would say the vast majority of my waking hours are spent under governance. 
I will make this point first, society does not persist in the absence of government. Hierarchy is a natural unavoidable outcome in nearly all social species on this planet. The interactions with other members of your species (or lack thereof) you consider menial are actually behaviors establishing your position in this hierarchy. </p>

<p>Now the luxuries and activities you insist upon being anarchist are provided to you by a governing body. For instance if your internet provider decides there is only enough energy for you to get 1 hour of reddit in each day and they have the ability to fully stop your internet access, then that&#39;s all the time you would get to spend on reddit each day. Not to mention the system which keeps any business running is a hierarchy system. You can even stack these hierchy systems side by side with examples such as: business/hierarchy A is a road building bsuiness, business/hierarchy B sells asphalt and thus the success of business/hierarchy A is dependent upon the propper governance of business/hierarchy B. Society becomes an interwoven network of small hierarchys. So now that we see that a form of government is at work in nearly every example you mentioned, how much time have you really spent in pure anarchy today?</p>

<p>I agree, but there is a difference between voluntary (peaceful) and involuntary (coercive) hierarchy. The job I pick is voluntary, if I serve on a jury that decision is involuntary.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not true, if they did that, then I would change internet providers. This is like saying that if you had a girlfriend that didn&#39;t like to kiss you or have sex, then you&#39;re out of luck. The reality is that you can change girlfriends.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>business/hierarchy A is a road building bsuiness, business/hierarchy B sells asphalt and thus the success of business/hierarchy A is dependent upon the propper governance of business/hierarchy B.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, to a certain degree this is true. Thats why I made this example about you. I suspect that you don&#39;t own a road building business. So while some peoples lives might be more heavily governed, I still peg yours as less than there business people. Again I&#39;m relying on your honesty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Society becomes an interwoven network of small hierarchys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These same hierarchies though can be accomplished voluntarily and produce superior results. This is the classic story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Pencil">&quot;I, pencil&quot;</a> which highlights all the trivial aspect of a mere pencil and how it&#39;s impossible for government to control each of these aspects. While you might claim (and I would agree) the government interjects a few rules in the thousands of decisions every day, it&#39;s impossible for the government to control everything. </p>

<p>Hey, if you want a government bureaucrat to decide who you marry, how many children you have, what you eat, when you sleep and what kind of car you drive, then more power to you. I on the other hand enjoy making these decisions in my own life and feel I make better ones than any bureaucrat might.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>You missed the whole conversation. I wasn&#39;t imply that these things occur today, but the exact opposite. My point was that 95% of our lives are without government control (i.e. anarchy). To be afraid of taking over responsibility for that other 5% is irrational.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anarchism requires that every member of society be anarchist. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>not the case. Government is a monopoly on the use of force. Anarchy allows for everyone to defend themselves. Therefore if my next door neighbor declares himself a state and hires men in blue uniforms to arrest me, then I can easily defend myself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Considering 2, anarchism requires heavy ideological similarities between society members.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a valid point. Thats why I speak to people about anarchy. Once people get over the initial fear, then they start to more easily accept that it&#39;s much better than our current system.</p>

<p>Again, if my neighbor hires guys in blue uniforms to arrest me, anarchy does require that you don&#39;t recognize that these blue uniformed bullies have any legitimacy. When I shoot them for bullying me, I don&#39;t want your criticism. It doesn&#39;t serve me much good to scare you away from me, because you think I&#39;m a murderer for defending myself.</p>

<p>So yes, we need a society that doesn&#39;t accept things like the TSA at airports as normal. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: Anarchism requires everyone behave a certain way; totalitarianism. This is the antithesis of your goal, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again not really. If a majority of people agreed that people in blue uniforms are not some experts in justice, then  we don&#39;t need 100% compliance. If 30% of the population fears me as a murderer, then that still leaves me 70% to which to associate with. I just need enough like minded individuals in order to live my life. What percentage that is I don&#39;t know, but obviously it would have to include people from all the different essential services that think like me (e.g. a farmer to supply me food).</p>

<p>Like I said to the previous commenter, you don&#39;t realize it, but 95% of your daily life is already anarchy.</p>

<p>I agree it is a made up statistic, in that I get to decide where I drive my car, yet the government oversees the road. In my daily life though, I rarely have a need for those roads to be government owned as opposed to private ownership. My point being that my direct interaction with government as they exert their influence over the roads is trivial. For all that it matters to me, it could be a private owner that just followed the exact same procedures. </p>

<p>Calm down dude, lol. Regardless of context, there are violent people with differing ideologies who will use violence to achieve their ends. </p>

<p>Wait wait. I thought we were talking about anarchism. Since when does private property exist in anarchism? Besides that, the private owner <em>would not be bound in any way</em> to follow the same procedures. It would instantly lead to ghettos as the poor could not pay the fee to even get to work or decent areas. Bad idea.</p>

<p>Secondly, if we institute anarchism, but retain private property, what is the point? All that does is allow capital to completely run rampant. Instant paupers of the most of us, with no support from the rich, and no state either. Sounds bad.</p>

<p>Yes and no. Modern firearms allow for some very good odds. Also the aspect you said, where a certain proportion of people need to have common values to band together. In other words, if there is a mob that can possibly assemble to rape me, then an equal mob might assemble to defend me.</p>

<p>besides that, if I really have a need for a police force, then I can always hire a private police to fight off the mob for me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Anarchy means absense of government, not absence of society. The term you&#39;re thinking of is chaos. Chaos != anarchy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Besides that, the private owner would not be bound in any way to follow the same procedures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree. McDonalds is not bound to serve Big Macs, but they do so because it benefits them. In the same fashion the owner of a road (i.e. toll road) would be interested in providing a big mac road to it&#39;s customers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All that does is allow capital to completely run rampant. Instant paupers of the most of us, with no support from the rich, and no state either. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>you&#39;re assuming that the government today works for the benefit of the poor and not the rich. I think the 2008 bailouts of the rich should have dispelled any myth about that already.</p>

<p>besides that, like I said already, 95% of your life is anarchy. If private owners were to run rampant over your life, they would have already done so by now. McDonalds has no incentive to force you to buy their Big Macs, because it&#39;s easier for them to simply get your willing participation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing. What you are seeing is the death of reddit. Every online community goes through stuff like this before it breaks down. Digg might be the most recent and well known example, but I have been frequenting forums and boards for over 10 years, this is usually how it ends. At least we have <em>somewhat</em> independent subreddits which will survive much longer than the decline of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. </p>

I remember watching a speech Obama gave and then he worked the room signing programs and such for everyone and I remember thinking this guy is good man, he&#39;s got it. He shook everyone&#39;s hand, smiled and had relevant remarks and I think everyone who interacted with him was genuinely won over. Ive heard the same about Bill Clinton. 
It&#39;s just a shame they&#39;re not more successful in actually leading the country to a more positive place. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You imply that currently a bureaucrat decides who I marry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You missed the whole conversation. I wasn&#39;t imply that these things occur today, but the exact opposite. My point was that 95% of our lives are without government control (i.e. anarchy). To be afraid of taking over responsibility for that other 5% is irrational.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anarchism requires that every member of society be anarchist. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>not the case. Government is a monopoly on the use of force. Anarchy allows for everyone to defend themselves. Therefore if my next door neighbor declares himself a state and hires men in blue uniforms to arrest me, then I can easily defend myself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Considering 2, anarchism requires heavy ideological similarities between society members.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a valid point. Thats why I speak to people about anarchy. Once people get over the initial fear, then they start to more easily accept that it&#39;s much better than our current system.</p>

<p>Again, if my neighbor hires guys in blue uniforms to arrest me, anarchy does require that you don&#39;t recognize that these blue uniformed bullies have any legitimacy. When I shoot them for bullying me, I don&#39;t want your criticism. It doesn&#39;t serve me much good to scare you away from me, because you think I&#39;m a murderer for defending myself.</p>

<p>So yes, we need a society that doesn&#39;t accept things like the TSA at airports as normal. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: Anarchism requires everyone behave a certain way; totalitarianism. This is the antithesis of your goal, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again not really. If a majority of people agreed that people in blue uniforms are not some experts in justice, then  we don&#39;t need 100% compliance. If 30% of the population fears me as a murderer, then that still leaves me 70% to which to associate with. I just need enough like minded individuals in order to live my life. What percentage that is I don&#39;t know, but obviously it would have to include people from all the different essential services that think like me (e.g. a farmer to supply me food).</p>

<p>Like I said to the previous commenter, you don&#39;t realize it, but 95% of your daily life is already anarchy.</p>

<p>Control them for what? Do you want the use of force to defend yourself or compel others to serve you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but when those choices directly interact with the products of a non-anarchist state,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree it is a made up statistic, in that I get to decide where I drive my car, yet the government oversees the road. In my daily life though, I rarely have a need for those roads to be government owned as opposed to private ownership. My point being that my direct interaction with government as they exert their influence over the roads is trivial. For all that it matters to me, it could be a private owner that just followed the exact same procedures. </p>
