       Hello r/conspiracy,
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious as to whether anyone here actually battles it out with the powers-that-be to retain their sovereign rights and how does that work out for you?
      </p>
      <p>
       What I mean is actually being heard in a common law court if you're not involved in loss/destruction of property or harm to another being instead of abiding by
       <a href="http://home.iae.nl/users/lightnet/creator/martiallaw.htm">
        Maritime Admiralty courts
       </a>
       in which you are consenting to by identifying yourself as
       <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread346428/pg1">
        YOUR NAME
       </a>
       (Capitis Diminutio Maxima). Does this actually work? Can anyone explain to me how knowing your rights and not submitting on behalf of your
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME7K6P7hlko">
        Straw Man
       </a>
       actually works in the real world. I just see a lot of jail time and headaches for anyone that tries to exercise these rights whether we're dealing with a fraudulent system of government or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been running scenarios in my head for years and life just seems to get in the way. Here are some scenarios...
      </p>
      <p>
       "Officer, this is my lawfully owned automatic rifle(in California) and it doesn't have to be registered."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Time to take a ride in the police car."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Judge, I am a natural being and shall be heard in a common law court."
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm throwing this book at you-- it's going to hurt."
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.mindwarpsectorfour.com/creditcard.html">
        "I will not pay this credit card debt unless you show me an original instrument of indebtedness."

       I believe it's related to a little idea called Staying in Honor, if you can believe that?  I've been listening since around November last year, and I've even called in a few times if you would believe, and it's changed my life.

       This is just another way to "throw yourself against the gears" of the machine.  It's like the income tax even though you are right and have the moral authority doesn't mean you will always win because there are plenty of corrupt judges and uninformed sheeple.

       I completely agree, The first guy who evaded income tax via this eventually got struck down. But I can't tell you home many freemen and Moorish sovereigns i love watching. Bewildering judges with their "seemingly" ,legitimate claims. But as you said- and the more honest videos show, it doesn't work, at best it buys you time and you'll get retried in a month. Maybe you can argue the same thing again. I've seen it work twice, then judge got fed up with jurisdiction- you aren't the person, they aren't an authority of the person/a you are.

       The ONLY reason that guy in the video got away in that situation was that the cops were in a small town with laid back cops. Try that in Southern Cali and you're going to get tasered.

       law isn't what's on the books it's what people believe. The man was right in he had no obligation to pay taxes, yet eventually he was charged by the state supreme court years later. If the IRS wanted to pursue you they will. let's say it went to the supreme court of the us, let's say your defense was that dedicated, and they somehow heard your case. Do you believe they would find in your favor? Of course not. Maybe on smaller charges, in towns were the judge is honorable, or fearful they're making an error. but I would never push my luck so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just not the law. The law is what the people believe or can be convinced of. sovereignty is a fair and honorable argument, thus true in this light, and can convince people it is not true law because its not the consensus (i.e. democratic) understanding. In this country the people are law. but what the majority of people stand up/ lay down for is law. if people don't stand up for you then it is not law. this is why people protest, and expose fraud. if consensus is contrary to law, the law will change, but consensus cannot be made if people don't first know, second are convinced of it, and third stand up for in mass. because our officials are elected, they will be on the side of the majority, unless the believe they can convince you their non consensus decision was correct through advertising, speaking, and other programing.

       Couple things I believe about living "sovereign" 
Truth is self-evident. And Controversy's are created via claims, but if you make no claims, and only ask questions, how have you authorized or refused anything?  People just give up to those asking, or rather, acting AS KING, at least I believe, and who can tell anyone what else they should believe?

       I fully understand making or not making claims, but I just do not see any law enforcement or judges letting anyone off whether you claim nothing or not. I have a right to keep any arms, pay no taxes and own what is mine, but if it conflicts with the codes and statutes of the U.S. I just don't how my refusal to lay claim will keep me out of imprisonment.

       Well how do you know you're conflicting with codes and statutes of the U.S.?  Have you ever met the U.S. and asked him if there was a controversy?  How do you know? In court, aren't you allowed to face you're accuser?
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't making a claim a way of giving someone authority over you? Atleast I believe, when someone is telling me what they believe, they are asking me for what I believe?  Maybe them Judges aren't there to decide who is let off or not let off, as you say? Maybe they are there to decide who's making a claim?
      </p>
      <p>
       If a man is just asking questions, how has he given anyone authority over him, and at the same time, how can anyone have authority over what he does?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you want to do that you think people don't want you to do? And how are they getting involved?
Maybe the problem is between the ears?

       Some codes and statutes I can think of are authorities finding out you own firearms deemed illegal in your state(whatever happened to 'shall not be infringed'). Even if you don't claim anything, I can easily foresee leaving a court room in cuffs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or driving your car and having it impounded because you don't think you have to register the vehicle. You're going to be arrested trying explain why you don't have to register the car or even have a license.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the problem might be between your ears if you think you can consistently exercise your rights in these regards. Prove me wrong, show me proof.

       What makes you think I've got registered plates on the car I use? There was another gentleman in california allegedly, who drove for 30+ years with none of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're driving and "get pulled over" and the cop asks you "Do you know why I pulled you over?", have you ever thought to ask, "What do you mean you pulled me over, I thought I was in control of this vehicle and when I saw emergency lights come on it might be a good idea for me to pull over? What's the emergency officer? --- If he says  there is no emergency, that's a good time to ask him why he had those lights on?  If i'm not mistaken, isn't it believed by those officers that it is a Felony to use emergency lights for non-emergencies?
      </p>
      <p>
       And the Gun, what do you mean in "your state"?  What's a state and why do you think it's mine?  If one is born in a girlscout camp, does that make one a girlscout?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if truth is self evident, and first hand testimony by a witness is the only real evidence, then should I be able to go where these allegedly believed borders are and see them?
      </p>
      <p>
       I might also ask the cop what makes him think I am under those statutes or regulations or laws, or how he knows they apply to me?
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to call up the alleged department of water and power and ask them if anyone can turn my power off? I will tell you from my first hand testimony that I was told "No one other then the one who authorized the resources to be turned on, can turn them off."  At which point I think is a good time for the next question, and that's if no one can turn them off, then what am I paying for? Isn't energy neither created nor destroyed?  And if so, they might say you're paying for the "delivery" or whatever through those things called pipes, etc.  But isn't that just what they believe? I mean, I didn't actually see anyone lay any pipes, creation that is older than me could have come from anywhere, and last time I checked it was a felony punishable by death in this alleged country for anyone unauthorized to cut off the flow of natural resources, why not ask those questions and see where it gets you?

       This sounds great in theory, but real world application would see differently. I know full well that driving with expired plates gets your car impounded and no amount of logic will sway a cop. I can hardly think of a cop that would actually think about what you're saying for more than a second without just getting angry and telling you to step out of the vehicle. What logical argument are you going to use when you don't want to exit your vehicle?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking questions. I ask a lot of them and I would love to apply this knowledge to my benefit, but I'm still convinced that theoretical situations like these are more optimistic than the real situations ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with your arguments wholeheartedly, but I would like to find ways to reduce time in courts and in jail while exercising my rights. I think it's worth the trouble for every free man to go through the b.s. to show others that we have rights and they're being infringed so that they can follow suit, but the counter-scenarios I'm putting forth are not only discouraging for the common man with modern problems-- the scenarios are going to happen more often than not. Can anyone show me free men with consistent wins against the state or a lifestyle with very little hassle from people that want to shove their legal authority down our throats?

       For one, maybe you should make sure those words you use mean what you think they mean?  Who you driving? I don't drive anywhere, I travel.  Travel and operate the vehicle I use, but I never drive if you can believe that? Are you a taxi driver or a chauffeur?

       have you ever paid, or did the name pay and you just helped it happen?  what evidence is there that you "own" anything, and how can someone pay anything unless they "own" something?

       You're being duped by nonsense.  The "sovereign rights" theories have zero basis in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The law is not some magical secret totem, by which if you say the right magic word and give a secret handshake you don't have to pay your bills or taxes.  It's statutes and cases and codes, etc.
