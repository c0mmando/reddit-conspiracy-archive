       I’ve read a lot about the Olympics, the theories and everything from floods and false flags to aliens have a lot of plausibility behind them. They’re great theories, all of them. There are so many people willing to read between the lines and investigate deeper than what appears on the surface and for that, we should all be commended. We don’t just make an argument without some evidence. We then debate it, which is the point of this and many forums.The 1948 UK Olympics being the same year that Israel declared its independence, coupled with the new Jerusalem and the Zion logo for the 2012 UK Olympics is very intriguing. The weird one-eyed Alien mascots are very odd. The amount of police, army and security, coupled with the surface to air missiles is just bizarre.Noah’s Arc on the Thames and the freak weather across the world gets the mind going. The companies, organisations and ‘dignitaries’ relocating/locating themselves outside of central London makes me wonder. The Shard (represents the penis) and the giant womb/boob, which is the O2 Arena are fascinating.When we tie it all together I’m not sure what to think. The things that we cannot debate are the amount of security forces in London for the coming weeks, the plans for the opening ceremony and the Zion logo. I think the whole Olympics is yet another giant ritual that 90% of the population will just think is something truly awe-inspiring and amazing. The Israel President is not attending the opening ceremony, a ceremony that is inspired by the hymn‘Jerusalem.’ The final two words of Jerusalem are ‘Till we have built Jerusalem In England’s green and pleasant land.’To quote the London 2012 website, the “Stadium will be transformed into the British countryside for opening scene ‘Green and Pleasant.’” Obvious connection, no debate needed. The ceremony will include real farmyard animals. The Noah’s Arc sailing down the Thames during the Olympics and will also carry real animals. Noah is a Jewish character – another Jewish connection.
“Her Majesty the Queen will be greeted by Jacques Rogge,” Jacques, a man who refuses to acknowledge the Israel athletes who were murdered in 1972, which has infuriated many in the Jewish community.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Olympics is about the fall of Israel.The conspiracy theories are deflecting attention away from where our eyes should be focussing on – Israel. The Olympics is hailing in the New Jerusalem. So something must be about to happen in old Jerusalem. Out with the old, in with the new. The ceremony is about discarding Israel and pronouncing England, particularly London, as the New Jerusalem. The Olympics is fulfilling a prophesy, a prophesy in the form of a hymn. “Was Jerusalem builded here, among those dark satanic mills?” Yes, it’s about to be – satanic symbols are everywhere, the shard being the new one. Bring me my bow of burning gold, my arrows, my spear, my chariot of fire (bring in the army, the police, the missile batteries). “Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand” – (we are prepared) “Till we have built Jerusalem in England’s green and pleasant land.” The green and pleasant land is the setting - it is the early stages of the Olympic ceremony – it is London. Jerusalem will be built in this, on this. It will be built here when Old Jerusalem / Israel falls.Now, read the order of play for the music in the Olympic ceremonyThe order is interesting – it tells a very interesting story, it tells the story of our past, our present and our future. It’s a long list but I’ll talk a few tiny chunks. This is how I decipher it in small snippets:Pre-Olympics: “Big Ben Chimes, God Save the Queen and then… London Calling”…Olympics: “Jerusalem, Nimrod and the arrival of the Queen of Sheba” … “Dambusters March, 'Music for the Royal Fireworks, James Bond Theme” (This is the start of a Middle East War and Britain getting involved).Post Olympics: “Blue Monday, Relax, Back To Life” (For most people the Olympics ends and it is ‘blue’ and ‘back to life.’)Then… the war spreads across the world… The world war begins….Late 2012: “Uprising, Random Antics, Pass Out” … “Galvanize, Take Me Out, I Predict a Riot” …Millions die but the end comes and ‘heroes’ are born….“The End, Hey Jude, Heroes” ...It all ends with “The Liberty Bell, Absolute Beginners.”The one world government brings ‘liberty’ to the world. It is the beginning of the new world order and we are left in a world where we feel like absolute beginners.So for now, we need to watch Old Jerusalem. We need to watch Israel over the next two weeks. On tele today says: “Hundreds of tonnes of Syria's stockpile of deadly nerve gas could fall into the hands of terrorist groups if the regime of Bashar al Assad falls apart amid widening concerns that Israel could go to war to try to stop this 'Doomsday threat'.”It continues: “The deadly chemical weapons have been successfully 'weaponised'. This means that conventional artillery and missile warheads have been fitted with delivery systems for VX gas. These include Scud B, C and D missiles.”
“These rockets are capable of hitting any location inside Israel and are capable of spreading VX gas in bomblets similar to those seen in cluster munitions.”“Syria has backed the Lebanese Islamist movement Hezbollah for decades. In 2006, Israel launched a bloody invasion of Lebanon in response to Hezbollah rocket attacks.”“Today, intelligence sources say that they conservatively estimate that Hezbollah has a stockpile of more than 40,000 new missiles.”“Israel is deeply concerned that Assad may deliberately give Hezbollah chemical weapons - or that they could end up in the hands of other terror groups. In either case, this could lead to a regional war, Danny Yatom, the former head of Mossad warned.”My gut feeling is that NOTHING destructive will happen in England or London, not yet anyway, not until the new world war spreads at least. For now London is simply the stage, the setting, to welcome the NEW Jerusalem. It is a massive ceremony. The armed forces are part of the ceremony, The Shard is the ceremony, the Olympic ceremony is the ceremony! Noah’s Arc is even here to show the world that London is the NEW Jerusalem.These shadowy characters use symbolism in everything. Everything is symbolic. ALL of our attention now should be on Israel, Syria, Iran, Hezbollah. The Olympics is purposefully deflecting our attention – we’re all falling for it! Let us watch the Middle East with acute attention for the next two weeks – tell us what you see in the news. I suspect that before the Olympic ceremony closes, old Jerusalem won’t be here anymore. The reason the President of Israel is not coming to the games is that he will be the ultimate sacrifice. The music in the Olympic ceremony tells us the story that is unfolding and what is to come. It tells of what we should expect. Old Jerusalem is about to go, the New Jerusalem stage is set. The world will be plunged into chaos. Focus our energy on this and we will see the bigger picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       For now…
      </p>
      <p>
       "And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountain green?
And was the holy Lamb of God
On England's pleasant pastures seen?
And did the countenance divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among those dark satanic mills?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bring me my bow of burning gold!
Bring me my arrows of desire!
Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold!
Bring me my chariot of fire!
I will not cease from mental fight,
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,
Till we have built Jerusalem
In England's green and pleasant land."
      </p>
      <p>
       We have set the stage... Watch the illuminati plan unfold. Don't be distracted by Aliens and terrorism. It's a smoke screen for the ceremony we are all about to witness.

       Probably because it was inducing rainfall early, not "changing weather".
      </p>
      <p>
       Could also be because the techniques used have been around and used widely since the 60's.

       I mean a month back in the sense of that is when I made the comment.   there hasnt been much rain that I can recall for the last few weeks.  I've just been looking at the

       I don't understand why people believe that these all powerful people, who must be pretty fucking smart, want to have anything to do with fairy tale satanic rituals. Surely they know that Satan doesn't really exist...or at the most no one can prove it.

       A long time ago there was a mind-full, accomplished, self-certain monk who arrived at a temple for training. The Master poured tea. The young monk gestured and gestured to stop pouring, but the Master kept pouring tea until the cup overflowed. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Master explained, “When you arrived, your cup was already so full, there was no room for new. Empty your cup. . .”
      </p>
      <p>
       This can be understood in many different ways, but my point with this story is. You have already concluded that you know what you need to know and excluded the possibility of there being an existence just because you haven't seen it with your own eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we lived in the old times before science, and I asked you; "Do you believe in air?" would you say yes? You probably would. But you can't see air, how do you know it is there?
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, if you want to gain knowledge of these things, you have to have an open mind or else you will quickly reject anything you learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you still want to learn after that, then I suggest you read about firespirits also called Djinn. When you have understood the concept of the Djinn, read a little about dimensions and how they work. It is very interesting and exciting stuff, and yes a little scary as well.
      </p>

       When you have read all this you should know enough to see what I mean

       I pride myself on keeping an open mind. I also pride myself on being skeptical. I'm not absolutely certain about much of anything and I don't think many are. Hence why I was asking those questions. I'm going to look into Djinn. This stuff is just theoretical right?

       I am glad of that, too many people reject the possibility of things that we don't yet understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am actually quite certain about the existence of Djinn. However that hasn't been proven in the traditional ways of science.. yet. But almost every culture believe in the Djinn, except for the modern. The egyptians, the greek and roman, the mayan and aztec, the native americans, especially Islam where the concept of Djinn comes from (before that they were known as "gods"), the babylonian and byzantian and even the sumerian which is supposedly the first civilization in the world known to man at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that when we look back on these civilzations or cultures if you will, we see them as superstitious and without any logic in their beliefs. Granted the human mind wants to believe in something "higher", but these beliefs still have to come from somewhere, that much is only logical yes? Furthermore, the fact that they all have so much in common points to the at least possibility of there being something that they have their ideas from. I personally believe that every legend or myth has some truth in it, some more than others of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Quran says that Shai'tan/Iblis or simply the devil as people of the western world know him is in fact not a fallen angel as christians believe. He is a Djinn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the dimensions that is scientifically proven. We humans are 3 dimensional beings but we can only perceive the 2 dimensions. Supposedly the Djinn are 4 dimensional beings and perceive the first 3 dimensions, allowing them to see us but we can't see them. So while the dimensional theory is widely acknowedged by most experts or scientists, of course the existence of Djinn is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to know more, I would be glad to explain everything I have learnt from studying this for a few years.

       First, understand that the Illuminated are themselves slaves to the Nephilim who form the foundations of human ideas about theology. Satan is merely another word for the trickster god. Loki; the mischievious brother of Thor. This is the Sumerian Enki, whose reign will end when the planet Nibiru passes through the solar system and his brother Enlil, rightful heir to the throne of Earth and the god about which the Old Testament speaks, will take his position as head of the council of twelve. All Satanism and Luciferianism is opposed to this idea of the original god, ruler of Earth and destroyer of men, arriving here to take up the sceptre of power. Enlil will not allow this to happen without a fight. Enki has many allies, including many of we humans. We match the Nephilim in their technological abilities, so our weaponry will aid Enki in the battle. But thousands of years have passed on Nibiru and Enlil will likely descend with weapons we cannot imagine. He will unleash them upon the world and destroy the followers of Enki who call themselves the followers of Yahweh (Sumerian YHWH), the followers of Zeus (Jupiter), the Hindu followers of Dues Pitar and the followers of the murdered grandson of Enki, whose name we know as Christ but whose true name and existence occurred many centuries prior to year zero in 600BC.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the Illuminated Satan does exist. And indeed he does. But he is our ally, not our enemy. The god of the Old Testament is about to fall upon us. The devastation will be absolute and the Earth will crumble in the great war that draws toward us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We cannot prepare. It is unprecedented in all human history. From the moment we were first conceived by Enki and his sister, the geneticist whose love for the Adama gave true procreating life ability to the uplifted cro magnon man and whose love protected him after he was banished by Enlil from ED.IN for mingling his lesser seed with that of the pureblood Neffilim. Enlil, whose love assured the continuation of our species when he gave to Zuisudra the specifications for a submarine and thus saved him from the great deluge, the breaking of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and subsequent global tsunami that enveloped the Earth and destroyed humanity in the near east. Not by Enlil's hand would we have perished, but by his omission to warn us. Enki is our saviour. Enlil is the true demon prince and into his dominion we will pass on January 1st 2013.

       In terms of places to establish a one world government, it's pretty sweet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean think about it. It's entirely self-sufficient, easily defended (water plus huge submarine / naval fleets) and has the least dangerous topography and animal population in the world. It also means they can pull the plug on the US / China / Russia / Africa / most of Europe without having to worry too much about consequences.

       I mean self sufficient in terms of agriculture and livestock. If push came to shove, everything necessary for human survival is easily obtainable in the UK. There are many other places which can do this too, but not many good sized islands.

       Easy, they werent dependent on the system and technology in the same way. Simple. It's kinda sad actually but that's how it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the price of flying high. The higher you fly the deeper the fall or something like that.. Point is we are very dependent on the system, and this was a deliberate and very important move from the higherups. Make people so dependent on the way everything goes around that when it suddenly stops going around there will be mass panic.

       I find it incredible that people think this is obvious. It certainly looks like "ZION" when you move all the bits around but I could do the same to almost any word or glyph.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same kind of mentality arises in numerology, there's always one guy who adds up a bunch of arbitrary numbers and then subtracts some others and comes up with something seemingly meaningful that is now deemed "obvious".
      </p>
      <p>
       By your logic the logo is also "obviously" a picture of Lisa Simpson giving Bart a blowjob, I mean once it's pointed out to you, it's OBVIOUS and therefore must have been intentional.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now we are in the realms of Matt Groening being in on all of this, he must be illuminati, I mean after all didn't The Simpsons also predict 9/11. I think the Simpsons must have been created as a way to spread some kind of message of the ancients.  Just look at the character's names;
      </p>
      <p>
       Homer is an ancient Greek name and means "Hostage", creepy right? Also Homer was an ancient Greek poet who wrote about Odysseus whose name means "Trouble" and from Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Odysseus' heroic trait is his mētis, or "cunning intelligence": he is often described as the "Peer of Zeus in Counsel." This intelligence is most often manifested by his use of disguise and deceptive speech. His disguises take forms both physical (altering his appearance) and verbal...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sounds like modern politicians and the illuminati powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look at Bart, or Bartholomew JoJo Simpson.  Bartholomew was the
       <strong>
        12th
       </strong>
       apostle to Jesus, the current year is 20
       <strong>
        12
       </strong>
       and Lisa is blowing Bartholomew in the logo. Lisa is his sister and incest leads to genetic birth defects which is a way of producing an underclass that the illuminati can rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Matt Groening's first comic was Life in Hell, he's clearly a satanist.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so the madness goes on...

       This is known as pareidolia, which is when people see vague stimuli like images or sound, and their mind perceives them as being significant. Same reason why people think they hear satanic things when you play musi backwards.

       If you understood that we exist more on a subconscious level than a conscious level, you would understand why this is so important. They intentionally left a dot where the 1 should be...why is it there? The financial elite love astrology/numerology for a reason, it works. Things that happen to line up aren't "just a coincidence" they are there intentionally, whether that is the weather or the design of a logo...EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON. The elite know this, and that is why astrology/numerology/sacred geometry is HUGELY central to how they operate. They understand that nothing in this world is merely a "coincidence" because everything has meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, for the record, I noticed it said zion the first time I saw it, I never needed anyone else to point it out. It's pretty obvious it's intended to do that too, there is no reason for the dot above what should be a 1 unless they wanted it to look like an I to our subconscious.

       The dot is Bart's penis, I already explained this - to me it's very obvious. If you would just open your mind up to the reality that Matt Groening is in league with the illuminati you'd start seeing this Simpson's Luciferian stuff everywhere.

       Ah, but you see what you have stumbled on is the fact that The Simpsons has been used as Zionist propaganda for the last decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever see those numbers that flash up on the cash register in the intro. Symbolism.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have used the image of Lisa sucking off Bart to form the numbers 2012 which when squinting your eyes with your head tilted while wearing a metallic crucible upon your cranium obviously form the words Zion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously.Its symbolism man. Its obvious.

       It's a remarkably similar phenomenon to religious zealotry. The myriad layers and plays true-believers see in the shadows pulls to mind the detail from scant sources of Catholic dogma and saints. Unflinching acceptance of anything that supports a predetermined world view is strongly reminiscent of religion too. It makes me giggle with irony any time I hear 'wake up sheeple'.

       It is backed up by self supporting conclusive evidence. It's how the elite work, manipulating your subconscious right in front of you. If you can't accept that, fine by me, but it's well documented that subconscious manipulation is one of their strongest weapons in keeping the populace asleep.

       <em>

       Based on what you consciously see sure. But the fact is that your subconscious picks it up as an I, not part of a 2.

       I really don't think the subconscious is capable of naturally separating out the characters, arbitrarily rotating some of them and then placing a dot on top of the 1 to make Zion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if your subconscious does that automatically you have more problems than you are aware of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore 99% of the world populace doesn't even know what Zion is or means, consciously or subconsciously.

       No, that was the designer that separated the characters and made it look like an I. Your subconscious does the rest. As for people not knowing what it means, that's not necessary, the power is still in the symbol...again...subconscious.

       Do you accept the same design could possibly have been made without anyone intending it to read "Zion". Even if it was the tiniest possibility, could you imagine a child drawing a very similar logo in class?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would the "Zion" still then be obvious? If the answer is yes then you have to accept you are possibly seeing obvious things where they are not intended and indeed there is no way to infer what is an intentional and what is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way the "Zion" message becomes unambiguous is if you are 100% certain of the intentions of the people who produced it. I don't think you can be certain, the nature of the conspiracy means you have to make assumptions to get to your conclusion.

       All you can really do is be aware such things are "possible" and act accordingly.

       It could be theoretically possible, albeit HIGHLY UNLIKELY that a child would end up drawing a 2 that looks like an N with a dot on the side. Very very very very very unlikely. In fact, it's such an unlikely design choice, that ODDS ARE it's intentional.

      <p>
       Correction, there is no way to 100% confirm what is intentional or not, but it is quite easy to make an educated guess. Considering all other illuminati symbolism in the olympic games, it is highly likely this was intentional as well. It's preeeeety straightforward logic im using here.

       You answered your own question/problem. The nature of ANYTHING is that you cannot be 100% certain but look at supporting evidence and information, and draw conclusions...basic scientific method if anything. So thus although I can not be ONE HUNDRED PERCENT certain, I can make a pretty good educated guess that this design was intentional, again...considering all the other illuminati/masonic symbolism in the games.

      <p>
       Zionistic symbols are evidence of zionistic intention and zionistic intention is evidence of zionistic symbols.

       That's crazy.

       No, illuminati symbols are illuminati symbols. Pyramids around the complex, eyes for mascots, tower of babel outside the stadium etc. Given these OBVIOUS symbols, the odds of the logo looking like zion seems to be pretty intentional.

       Not all pyramids are necessarily illuminati symbols. I can actually easily accomodate in my mind such structures being completely innocuous. I can see an architect sitting at his desk thinking, you know what would be cool - triangular shaped lighting rigs! Triangles are pretty common geometric shapes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for the eyes on the mascots, just because they have only one eye they have to be symbolic of Horus?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me your logic goes something like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Some olympic stuff
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be interpreted as illuminati symbology.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The symbols must be illuminati symbology it would be far too coincidental for them not to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The symbols prove illuminati are involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The illuminati are involved, that's why their symbols are all over the place.
      </p>
      <p>
       My problem is with step 2, it's an illogical assumption especially given the incredibly ambiguous foundations that you base the symbols on (a triangle, single eyes etc.).

       How is it illogical? We know full well what illuminati symbolism looks like. Again, as I mentioned earlier, coincidences or co-incidences are there for a reason. EVERY COINCIDENCE IN LIFE HAS MEANING. I recommend looking into Carl Jung and his concept of synchronicity for further understanding of the importance of coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        We know what illuminati symbolism looks like.
       </li>
       <li>
        A whole lot of stuff all across the board of the olympics from the stadium to the mascots to the tower outside the stadium to the logo to the opening ceremony to the advertisements on the tv etc. etc. etc. looks like illuminati symbolism.
       </li>
       <li>
        The logical conclusion to this, is that it IS illuminati symbolism. There are far too many coincidences for this to be "merely a coincidence". In the face of overwhelming evidence, are you still seriously contending that even though there are literally HUNDREDS of occult overtones to the olympic games, that "it's an illogical assumption especially given the incredibly ambiguous foundations that you base the symbols on"?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I mean, it's not ambiguous at all. And even if it was, HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS of olympic overtones that COULD be construed as anything will still naturally point to the illuminati, simply because of how many there are. If it was one or two things id say sure, but the sheer number of occultic overtones is simply staggering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument in this case is highly similar to people defending Jay-Z and other illuminati puppets by saying that their symbols are "just hand gestures" and whatnot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch this video (a whole 9 mins) and see how obvious it is if you know what you're looking for. If you insist that all of the hand gestures, masonic handshakes, masonic symbols created through the hands, masonic overtones in the lyrics, and BAPHOMET RANDOMLY FLICKERING INTO HIS MUSIC VIDEO FOR HALF A SECOND.....if you insist that all of this is mere coincidence and im simply seeing what I want to, then there is nothing more I can do...you are willfully keeping your head in the sand.

       The song Jerusalem was based on a poem by William Blake who was a apparently a
       <a href="http://www.philipcoppens.com/blake.html">

       William Blake is also one of the better known British Poets/Artists/Illustrators and an iconic British cultural figure... you've probably seen his surrealist illustrations for Dante's
       <em>
        Divine Comedy
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The dude was also a forefather of Anarcho-Communist theory... unless the NWO's plan is free-love, social equity, and the distruction of modern industry, I wouldn't put William Blake on my list of NWO conspirators.

       Thank you immensely for pointing this out. Blake is about as far from a spokesman for world domination as you can get. Additional note, by the way, the title "Jerusalem" was not Blake's; it was given that title by Hubert Parry when he set it to music in 1916. It's actually the introductory verse to a poem titled (by Blake) "Milton."

       fine.. but it sucks to discourage people from posting because of some arbitrary convention not being followed in the format.. if he wants he can reformat it himself and post it in a comment.. maybe some type of paragraph nazi robot.. reddit loves those.

       I have to admit, this was an insanely hard thing to read. But with this being your first post, I'm kinda on the fence about how serious you are, given the fact that you're just listing every single conspiracy heard so far about anything happening at the Olympics.

       Even if this is all true and they want to create a 'New Jerusalem' what is the point in adverstising it?

       They want to keep this hidden from the populace so why make a massive neon sign that says Zion?? and place it all around the world?

       A lot of people never figure it out. I am not claiming all of these conspiracies to be true, but the existence of illuminati for example is a fact. 9/11 being an inside job: fact.

       Actually doing just a tiny bit of research and not coming to the conclusion that there is an elite controlling many of the major events in our world is being blind.

       I just watched the new movie "savages". Terrible film, like most hollywood block busters; awful plot and character development, sickening levels of needless violence while desensitizing freaky lifestyles, all the while jammed packed with symbolism. BUT GET THIS! I noticed a completely unrelated scene that flashed for a quick second -- long enough to show the "london underground" sign... right dab in the middle of the screen!! Why? the movie had nothing to do with london, or the underground rail.... WTF?
