    <div class="md"><p>I think DHS is the main perpetrator behind the increase in military-grade weapons, police brutality and harassment of the average civilian. They&#39;re probably putting out new policy and white papers to encourage the average officer to act more authoritarian. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s merely a coincidence that cops all over the country are suddenly starting to crack down on people trying to video them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually watched a very interesting episode of &quot;Need to know&quot; on MPBN which was about the US border authorities and how ruthless they are to people trying to get across the border. A group(cannot remember the name sadly) puts out food and water containers and after some were empties/slashed they started using hidden cameras and the border guards were kicking them and giving the water to their horses.  </p>

<p>Up here in Canada it&#39;s a bit different as we don&#39;t have the Patriot act(we still have to be presented a warrant prior to search and seizure or it is thrown out in a court of law) or the NDAA(fiscal 2012). I am a bit concerned though as if the TPP(trans pacific partnership) is passed wouldn&#39;t it become law in all three countries that would amalgamate into one? Hope someone can clear that up for me.</p>

<p>The arab countries knew that eventually the dollar would be worth nothing, which is why they wanted to start trading oil for gold with the gold dinar. The establishment didn&#39;t like that too much, so they started the &quot;Arab spring&quot; to topple these regimes. </p>

The US government buys their own worthless bonds to make it look like they&#39;re a sought after instrument.

<p>Agreed there, I think 9/11 was the litmus test of: How can the people be best controlled? Then the &#39;death&#39; of ol&#39; Osama was another test.

    <div class="md"><p>i go to the internet. i constantly read hundreds of websites and information streams. You cant just have one news source. you&#39;re just asking to be manipulated. most important is to tap yourself in to many different interpretations. the more these interpretations differ, the better you become at comparing and contrasting to come to a meta-perspective that has a much higher chance of being closer to reality than either interpretation, since each individual perspective just becomes data in a larger, more comprehensive view.</p>
