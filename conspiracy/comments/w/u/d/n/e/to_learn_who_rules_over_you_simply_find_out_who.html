    <div class="md"><p>The thing is that there is a weird cultural attachment to the Jewish victims of the holocaust.  My mom once told me that if there were anything she could change about history it would be to prevent the holocaust (and she did not mean anyone but the Jewish people).  My response was &quot;gee mom, why not waive your magic wand and stop all of WW2?  Or heck, just go back and kill Bismarck, nip the whole thing in the bud.&quot;  </p>

<p>Whoever nickland is calls this phenomena Hitlerism:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this regard, rather than Satan, it might be more helpful to compare Hitler to the Antichrist, which is to say: to a mirror Messiah, of reversed moral polarity. There was even an empty tomb. Hitlerism, neutrally conceived, therefore, is less a pro-Nazi ideology than a universal faith, speciated within the Abrahamic super-family, and united in acknowledging the coming of pure evil on earth. Whilst not exactly worshipped (outside the extraordinarily disreputable circles already ventured into), Hitler is sacramentally abhorred, in a way that touches upon theological ‘first things’. If to embrace Hitler as God is a sign of highly lamentable politico-spiritual confusion (at best), to recognize his historical singularity and sacred meaning is near-mandatory, since he is affirmed by all men of sound faith as the exact complement of the incarnate God (the revealed anti-Messiah, or Adversary), and this identification has the force of ‘self-evident truth’. (Did anybody ever need to ask why the reductio ad Hitlerum works?)</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you even talking about, this is so factually incorrect I don&#39;t even know where to start.  Let&#39;s see.  I&#39;ll start at the beginning.</p>

<p>&quot;Jews have always made themselves outsiders.&quot;</p>

<p>Um, no.  Jews have consistently been excluded from society.  In the 14th century and earlier, many laws were passed requiring all Jews to wear identifying badges, and later horn-tipped hats to identify themselves.  Other laws prevented us-yes, I&#39;m Jewish, but don&#39;t worry I&#39;m not plotting anything-from working in nearly all professions except moneylending, grave digging, and occasionally retail.  Because according to Church doctrine, lending money at any reasonable interest rate was considered a sin (although the percentage constantly changed), the banking industry depended on Jewish lenders.  As Barbara Tuchman says in her book &quot;A Distant Mirror,&quot; &quot;if the Jews had not existed, they would have had to be invented&quot; so that the economy could function.  One result, however, was a negative backlash that exacerbated existing prejudices, and which apparently persists to this day, as shown in your belief that it was &quot;manipulation&quot; and &quot;conning&quot;.  Another result?  Jews congregated in small areas for protection, and later were forced by laws to live in these ghettos, which persisted into the 20th century in many places.</p>

<p>Furthermore, during the plague years entire settlements were wiped out, Jews died by the thousands.  How can you possibly see this as historical backing for exploiting society?  The same pattern, as you say, was repeated throughout the years.  The Inquisition, Russian pogroms, the Holocaust-Godwin&#39;s Law, I know-all specifically targeted Jews for reasons since established as base racism.  &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; is a hoax.  We didn&#39;t poison the wells.  We aren&#39;t executing some sort of global conspiracy.  And we are certainly not immune to criticism.</p>

<p>Anti-semitism is not uncommon, and it is not fringe.  Growing up in the Midwest, my synagogue had swastikas painted on it; when I was 9, somebody cut the brake lines on the schoolbus to Jewish day camp.  We still have to have officers stationed outside during larger services.  Say what you want about Israel; I&#39;m not defending them, and that isn&#39;t the point here.  I&#39;m not sitting here crying &quot;woe is me,&quot; mind you.  But the idea that Jews deliberately hold themselves outside society is just absurd, and the support for this kind of attitude is nauseating.  Are Jews, as a whole, more successful than average?  Yeah, maybe so.  Since when is that a crime?  Isn&#39;t that the goal of any cultural group, to overcome adversity and succeed?</p>

<p>Anyway, I don&#39;t expect this to change anyone&#39;s beliefs.  In fact, I&#39;d imagine that I&#39;ll get hit with some flames, or accused of being One of Them.  Which I suppose I am, given this view of the world.  I would just prefer that, if you want to espouse that kind of viewpoint (as is your right, of course) you would base it on the facts, instead of vague, unsupported concepts of usury and self-imposed exile.  We give you plenty of valid reasons to dislike us, like Adam Sandler, and the songs from &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; getting stuck in your head.  You don&#39;t need to make things up.  Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I hope any responses will be at least vaguely constructive.  </p>

<p>EDIT: Okay, LIBOR might actually qualify as a global conspiracy, but that isn&#39;t our damn fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Jews have excluded themselves from society by being a tight-knit ethnic religious group with a thirst for power.</p>

<p>I mean, even if I converted to Judaism, I would still be considered inferior, simply because I don&#39;t have Jewish blood.</p>

<p>It seems to me the Jews have been conducting one of the longest running eugenics programs in history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or, alternatively, we became a tight-knit group because we were excluded from society, and gained power because the only professions available carried power with them.  </p>

<p>Also, blanket statements like that you &quot;would be considered inferior&quot; are just incorrect.  Maybe some places you would be.  Then again, as a Reform Jew, so would I.  Does that speak for &quot;Judaism&quot; as a whole?  Of course it doesn&#39;t.  Every ethnic group has its zealots; to judge the group as a whole by its worst members is lunacy.  In the synagogue I attend, you would be treated the same as anyone else.  My son&#39;s mother wasn&#39;t Jewish, and he has never--not once, over a decade of attendance--been treated differently than any other kid there.  My girlfriend, who is not Jewish, has attended services there and been welcomed with open arms.  </p>

<p>As for eugenics, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re using that word correctly.  There&#39;s no &quot;culling of the herd&quot; going on, nor is anything else sinister happening.  Sometimes there&#39;s a simple explanation for things: like all small ethnic groups, Judaism encourages its members to marry other members to avoid dying out.  You see that same pressure in many, many minorities.  </p>

<p>And what is this &quot;thirst for power,&quot; anyway?  Since when was it a negative thing to raise successive generations to value education and achievement?</p>

<p>Not everything has a deeper meaning.  Sometimes, groups of people are just trying to make the best of things.  Most importantly, though, you can&#39;t lump all members of a broad group together.  Just because some Jews would judge you doesn&#39;t make Judaism judgmental; does the fact that some white people don&#39;t like to work mean that &quot;white people are lazy&quot;?  Of course not.  C&#39;mon, man.  </p>

<p>But I enjoy the confessions of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGTp1Q162Gw&amp;amp;list=PLFFB05929141EE377&amp;amp;feature=plpp_play_all">ex-Jewish convert Brother Nathanael</a>, as seen in this video discussing why he left Judaism. (I suggest watching more of his videos, he might be considered Extreme to some, but he does bring up valid discussion, regardless of your religious affiliation.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to offend anyone, I am being sincere here and trying to learn more.</p>

<p>Did you study the Talmud in your synagogue? </p>

<p>I happen to be sitting in Berlin right now.  There&#39;s a very very good reason that Germany does this - and that&#39;s because the Germans, at least, are very aware that within living memory, they slaughtered millions of Jews.</p>

<p>So free speech in Germany <em>does</em> come with an asterisk - &quot;free speech, but no Nazism&quot; - and this is a perfectly reasonable penalty to pay for setting up a death machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was my point. The quote says &quot;not <strong>allowed</strong> to criticize.&quot; Then the post says <strong>&quot;never, ever criticized&quot;</strong>. The OP correlated the two, not I. </p>

<p>I think the OP&#39;s intended point was probably not &quot;let&#39;s list those groups that are never criticized,&quot; rather, &quot;let&#39;s list those groups that the media chooses never to criticize / is too afraid to criticize&quot;. </p>

<p>i.e. of course you can criticize Buddhists all day. But it&#39;s not like there&#39;s some secret power or force at work that forbids any criticism of Buddhists in all media, books, movies, and news at all times and in all places. </p>

<p>And now to put on my tinfoil hat:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Scientology <strong>can</strong> be criticized, but not without dire consequences. Not much of a surprise when you consider how many people in Hollywood are Scientologists. Comedy Central had to pull re-runs of South Park&#39;s Trapped in the Closet because Tom Cruise threw a hissy fit and threatened to not promote Mission Impossible 4 otherwise, and it worked. And that&#39;s just one Scientologist.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve noticed not much attention is being paid to how the banking industry got their asses handed to them in Iceland, even to the point where Iceland hired a bounty hunter to track down the rogue bankers who fled the country. The LIBOR scandal and other banking related crimes are being either underreported or trivialized as not that big a deal, or seemingly portrayed as some kind of freak occurrence, like it was a sinkhole suddenly opening up in Times Square and not the clandestine uber-crime it really was. Also underreported are all the whistleblowers who for at least a decade screamed dire warnings about an impending collapse / crisis. </p></li>
<li><p>For all the negative, demonizing mainstream press that Wikileaks gets, Bradley Manning gets very little attention. I mean you think there would be more attention paid to the fact that he&#39;s been in solitary confinement for nearly two years without a trial. Solitary confinement triggers psychosis in as little as two weeks. </p></li>
<li><p>Forget what <em>isn&#39;t</em> being said or reported in the MSM. The timings of certain overhyped celebrity scandals is too hilariously and perfectly synchronous to real news events to be coincidental. Tom Cruise and Kaite Holmes&#39; divorce being the latest non-news shite. People can only pay attention to so many headlines at a time. If you can&#39;t censor or silence one headline, you can drown it out with a few dozen non-headlines posing as actual news. I dare you to tell me it doesn&#39;t look that way the next time you watch TV or browse a newspaper.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>if we can come by a definition of a &#39;nigger&#39; that we all agree upon, based on a negative stereotype of a violent hood rat with his ass hanging out, then hating someone like that is not racist. most people&#39;s hatred of thuggish hood rats is based entirely on their dress and conduct, and doesn&#39;t in any way overlap onto the majority of black people, who frankly i find to be worth admiring. (though in my case it does spread to asian/caucasians who adopt the mannerisms i must admit.) it&#39;s no different than loathing hipsters, people who are conforming to a specific trend.</p>

<p>it&#39;s always funny how the people who scream &#39;RACIST&#39; the hardest are the ones who try ever so hard to slap people with labels. many people are capable of discernment, and still hating those who make the world a shitty place through their actions. hood rats, zionists, the first baptist church, scientologists, banksters, the walton family, al quaeda, MS-13, the people who cancelled arrested development, hipsters....many people simply are worth hating.</p>

<p>... because it&#39;s fucking racist.

If you were in here whining about &quot;niggers run the world because Americans can&#39;t criticize niggers&quot; then not even bumblingmumbling would back up your bullshit. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure Voltaire would be impressed with you quoting him like he spoke the word of God. Didn&#39;t Voltaire say that a witty saying proves nothing?</p>

<p>There are many possible reasons why it is taboo to criticize the Jews. I think the true reason is because the statement is meaningless. It is impossible to honestly criticize all Jews, only certain Jewish groups, cultures or individuals. Anything else is ignorant to the fact that Jews consists of a group of individuals with varying behaviours, ideas and personalities.  People therefore don&#39;t criticize &quot;the Jews&quot; because they are smart enough to realize that it is not meaningful or constructive. It actually diminishes the individual merits of specific Jews when you generalize them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>March 15, 1940, Himmler stated</strong> All Polish specialists will be exploited in our military-industrial complex. Later, all Poles will disappear from this world. <strong>It is imperative that the great German nation considers the elimination of all Polish people as its chief task.</strong>[7]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did they want to <em>exterminate</em> all Polish people? Did he have a good reason to as well? </p>

<p>It&#39;s good to know what he said his reason was for persecuting the Jews, but it&#39;s clear that we cannot draw any conclusions from that about the Jews. We can only conclude about his personal vision of reality. His premises were not based in reality but supremacist mythology.  </p>

<p>I prefer the sociological approach for understanding Jewish behavior and their relationship with the German people. Hitler&#39;s opinions are only interesting and important from a historical perspective. </p>

<p>I see one statement by one deranged politician. What I don&#39;t see is the follow-up similar to what happened to the Jews. Yes, there was a lot of killing of eastern european ethnic groups, but none seem to compare to what they did with the jews. </p>

<p>If you want to convince me otherwise, then give an example of where they would separate out the poles from a group of people the same way that they separated jews from groups.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I disagree. As with almost every criminal activity, I think we just need to follow the money. Even in the quote you gave, he says that they will exploit the poles economically in their military-industrial complex.</p>

<p>IMO the whole racial superiority was merely a cover for their slavery and economic oppression. The same could be said about the &quot;made in america&quot; slogans we hear today.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t understand your point here. Are you suggesting that there was a stronger impulse among the german population than Hitler blaming the Jews for their economic troubles? What was this other impulse if not economic?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a complex question. Quick-ish run down. Following WWI the treaty of versailles included economicly crippling measures, which led to rapid massive inflation in Germany. Desperate people began borrowing large sums of money from lenders inorder to afford even the base essentials in life. Many of those money lenders were of the jewish faith. So, when the nazi party proposed eliminating the jews many either greeted that with enthusiasm or turned a blind eye. Simillar to todays hatred of the banks. People just want to see their crippling debt disappear. Also many jews throughout Eastern Europe were pro communism and the Nazis were not keen on that.</p>

<p>Dont forget that France was attacked and occupied with extreme predjudice in WWII. Also due to their role in the strictures of the treaty of Versaillis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Central European antisemitism goes back for centuries. Martin Luther wrote screeds about them after the Reformation. They were consistently a successful but insular subculture of &#39;heathens,&#39; so they were blamed for all sorts of problems, real and imagined. See: blood libel. This was exacerbated by laws about &quot;usury,&quot; i.e., lending money with interest. Christians usually weren&#39;t allowed to because of something or other Jesus said that modern religion ignores, so if you were borrowing money, it was probably from someone Jewish. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why Hitler didn&#39;t just blame the banks for Germany&#39;s problems in the interbellum - they were mostly owned by Jews, and he grew up in a culture entirely willing to make scapegoats of them, so like our racist buddy bumblingmumbling here, he saw correlation as causation and blamed the whole damn ethnicity for the actions of a few rich opportunists. Bear in mind they were hardly the only group he &quot;picked on.&quot; I&#39;d love to see one of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s friendly neighborhood bigots try to connect the homosexuals and gypsies to their endless rambling about boycotts and fiat currency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, I hadn&#39;t heard that angle before. If the claims are true (I&#39;ve never seen them stated so obviously before), then that would make a lot of sense. Nowadays it would be comparable to a Republican hating all environmentalists, because they&#39;re Democrats. I think this is plausible.</p>

<p>However I think this ties into a greater concept of economic and political cancer of corruption. When people see the failure of their government, they start to blame their political opponents. Like you&#39;ve pointed out, this could all be just political, but I think the fact that bankers were primarily jewish brought this other facet into play. </p>

<p>Just like today we blame corporations and bankers for corrupting politics, I think this could have been at work with Hitler just the same. OWS and the Tea Party are the people fighting in the streets, just like what Hitler witnessed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more than that. While some more of the educated elites might have connected communism with jewish leaders, I doubt the average german on the street connected these dots together. IMO the average german was disgusted at the economic conditions and Hitler pointed the problem at the jews. People saw wealthy jews, a lot of whom were in banking and it resonated with them. </p>

<p>nowadays we talk about the 1% being the evil doers and don&#39;t really tie it any particular race, but we do tie it to bankers. </p>

Even if I bought 1000 shares of a bank, I would represent a ridiculous minority.  The banks work for the group of people that own that cumulative 51%.  Probably 30 individuals who own all that stock, all of them sitting together smoking cigars and drinking cognac on occasion.  And all of them wealthy enough, and connected enough, to sell all their stock at the same time, for minimal losses, while the rest of the shareholders, divided amongst many thousands of people, get fucked bad. 
Hypothetically, anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that&#39;s why I put the quotes around &#39;everyone&#39;. My point is, there is no conspiracy about bank ownership, and the owners&#39; motivations. It&#39;s pretty obvious: they are motivated by profit. This is the same for every public listed company in existence; it is the job of the company to create profit for the shareholders, whether those shareholders are many or few.</p>

<p>Although you have got me thinking about how much sway individual shareholders have over the actions of CEOs. It also makes me wonder about the similar relationship between The Queen and the government.</p>

<p>just like any other people group.</p>

<p>Can you imagine?</p>

<p>&quot;Any person who has job in front of the cameras in any of the major television networks does not dare to criticize blacks. They do not dare. They are terrified of even saying something by accident that might be taken as criticism. Terrified. If they do make such a mistake, they grovel on their hand and knees in apology in the hopes of saving their jobs ... but their bosses usually fire them anyway. You cannot criticize the blacks in America without being automatically shunted from the mainstream to the fringe&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people who run the banks and investment firms come under much criticism because of their foolishness with money and their ridiculous salaries. The people who are never criticized however are the people who actually own all the money invested in these banks. It is not taboo to say someone earns too much, but it is taboo to say someone <em>has</em> too much. What would happen if we started playing around with the idea of how much people could have? If we started to think about who actually owned all the money we would find it was, for starters a short list of families that controls a vast, vast majority of global wealth and has for a long time, but we would also find that many of our own politicians which we blame for being &quot;bought out&quot; by the big banks are actually the ones who have their entire livelihoods invested in them. In other words, they do not need to be bought out, they are the ones perpetuating the institutions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trying to apply this quote from Voltaire to modern times is pointless. Voltaire lived at the hight of royal corruption in france. He lived under the same royal rulership that led to the french revolution. Most other nations at that time were run by royalty as well. His statement was directed toward his own times not ours. The king or queen could not be criticized. What they did and what they decided was law.</p>

<p>The examples given here by commenters do not come close to exemplifying anything like that scenario. People today can criticize anyone they want. The repercussion of (it may be frowned uppon, or it&#39;s not very P.C) is not on par with. The king will have you killed outright for calling him an idiot. </p>

<p>The context of time period and political climate are essential to the reality of this quote.</p>

We are free, that is why we go to war, to bring democracy to other countries that are not as free as we might be. </p>

<p>The Government is conspiring against its citizens my ass. What made you people so fucking crazy? maybe lay off the crack or the marijuana, it causes people to become schizophrenic and believe this nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Your in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and you are talking to like minded people. This is how you address people? Maybe lay off the prescription medication that kills millions? What about alcohol which causes grown men to beat their wives and kill their babies? The drug war has done amazing things for our economy, But guess what, PEOPLE STILL LIKE DRUGS!!! It&#39;s an endless war that is draining money from more important task like free college education in America. If college didn&#39;t send you into debt maybe more kids would have a better chance at life than ultimately turning to drugs and crime. Did you even think before making that comment? Seriously? It&#39;s a motherfucking conspiracy subreddit, What do you think we are going to discuss, How awesome everything is with the world and why we should all get along. MFW this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, We ask questions, We raise awareness, We provoke that naughty little thing called freedom of thought. and most of all WE DON&#39;T TRUST THE POWERS THAT BE TO BE DOING THE BEST JOB THEY CAN I.E. THE MOTHERFUCKING ENDLESS DRUG WAR FUELED BY FEAR INSTEAD OF A FREE MOTHERFUCKING COLLEGE EDUCATION IN THE UNITED MOTHERFUCKING STATES OF MOTHERFUCKING AMERICA! MOTHERFUCKER!! DOWNVOTE MOTHERFUCKER!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if we can come by a definition of a &#39;nigger&#39; that we all agree upon, based on a negative stereotype of a violent hood rat with his ass hanging out, then hating someone like that is not racist. most people&#39;s hatred of thuggish hood rats is based entirely on their dress and conduct, and doesn&#39;t in any way overlap onto the majority of black people, who frankly i find to be worth admiring. (though in my case it does spread to asian/caucasians who adopt the mannerisms i must admit.) it&#39;s no different than loathing hipsters, people who are conforming to a specific trend.</p>

<p>it&#39;s always funny how the people who scream &#39;RACIST&#39; the hardest are the ones who try ever so hard to slap people with labels. many people are capable of discernment, and still hating those who make the world a shitty place through their actions. hood rats, zionists, the first baptist church, scientologists, banksters, the walton family, al quaeda, MS-13, the people who cancelled arrested development, hipsters....many people simply are worth hating.</p>
