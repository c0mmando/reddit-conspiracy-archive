       If someone mentions 9/11 I ask if they heard of building 7, and if they haven't I just say it's the 3rd building that fell and see where it goes.
I think diesel meant something similar.

       Not really. Capitalism isn't what got us into this mess, fractional reserve banking, usury, and all of the crazy financial devices like mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps did. As long as a regulatory body can ensure that companies and banks are accounting for their externalities and commit to sound banking capitalism works fine. People will read that and think that idea is a pipe dream, but it's really an indication of how far we've strayed off the path from sustainable economics.

       Also, you can print money without needing to back it with anything like gold and silver. Colonial scrip and Lincoln's greenbacks are a perfect example of how money that is unbacked can be used with success without indebting the country to any banker. This is the reason why we had the Revolutionary war and why Lincoln was assassinated.

       Sure. When mad King George was fighting Napoleon he was spending way too much money borrowed from the Bank of England. In order to repay the debts, King George leveed taxes heavily on the colonists. He also ordered them to stop circulating colonial scrip and BUY currency from the Bank of England, immediately debting the colonists to the English bankers.

       Thanks a lot for this info. I kind of have a feeling that the English and the City are the prime cause of all suffering in the world, not the only cause, but the prime. It is interesting to see this working out in another time period that I was not aware of.

       There are many sides of the story that the establishment historians have purposely left out. Napoleon eventually lost that war and was exiled. He escaped and wanted to finance another war against the British, but refused to be financed by the international bankers (the Rothschilds) who had financed him the first time. These same bankers decided to finance the British more, ultimately causing the British to win. So Napoleon sold all of the French territory west of the Mississipi to the US and we sent him I think $3 Million in gold bullion. Now you know how the US got so lucky with the Louisiana Purchase, literally pennies for an acre. When Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo, a courier paid by Nathan Meyer Rothschild immediately left the battlefield to bring the news to him, but to nobody else. Everyone knew that this battle would decide who would be the reigning military and financial power in Europe. When Rothschild began selling and pulling his money out, Britain panicked thinking that they had lost Waterloo and stock prices and values dropped. Rothschild then bought all of them for literally pennies on the dollar, and when the news from government couriers had returned that Napoleon was defeated, investors began putting their money back into the markets, but into the market that Nathan Meyer Rothschild owned and would profit from. And that's how the Rothschilds took over England.

       I have read this story about how he got the information before the rest of the market and was able to make a killing before in some books and on the net. I know that the Rothschilds are megarich and control a large/perhaps major part of the City and other European cities/markets, but I don't have a very good feel for about how much of the City they control vis-a-vis other actors in Europe. There were/are a lot of rich Christians in Europe and they must have had a certain amount of control as well, but I don't have a very good feeling for it. The royal families clearly have a lot of say and control as well as money to do things with. I find these historical facts very interesting and wish that I knew more than I do. I know that we know even less than we know about history about what is going on right now. They have better control of the information and better tabs on the opposition.

       Capitalism is a defunct system. 95% of all jobs can be replaced by machines easily. The only jobs machines cannot do are ones that involved creativity...and usually jobs involving creativity are the ones people like to do regardless of montary reward. It is very shortsighted to think that capitalism is the be-all and end-all of humankind.

       Betting on animal fights and prostitution. Both are products of a monetary system. Once you answer those questions we can move on to theft and organized crime.

       Lol yes, they are an intrinsic part of capilalism. In a montary system people are going to do whatever it takes to make money regardless of ethics. The "free market" is never going to be able to accomadate 100% of the population with "jobs" so the people who do not have jobs are going to resort to devious ways to make money. Capitalism is a competitive, dog-eat-dog game, where everybody works towards their own selfish self-interests and nothing more. And the government can make anything illegal but that does not actually change anything. Marijuana is illegal, but just look at r/trees. As long as the montary system exists there is going to be drug trafficing, human trafficing, scarcity, organized crime, and much more. You cannot pick and choose what are "aspects" of capitalism. All the problems in our world are aspects of capitalism.

       If I bust my ass and work hard, why should I be expected to have your kids over for a swim and hot dogs because you dig ditches? Taxing me to feed and clothe you is unfair to me and simply enables your laziness.

       Don't confuse capitalism with corruption. The vast majority of success in life is based on smarts, hard work or both.

       Not many who dig ditches have done so in accordance with a career plan. Did you take excavation 101 last term? It is a job of last resort much of the time. The laziness aspect I speak of is in the lack of planning their career or investing in their own education.

       I think it's best to just drop a tidbit of info here and there to get people thinking.  Never align yourself with people like Alex Jones, even if you do like his info.  Link to his sources instead.  While his confrontational style is entertaining, to the unitiated it will just make you come off like a conspiracy nut and everything you say will be invalid at that point.  Joe Rogan does a good job on his podcast of bringing up conspiracies in a way that's more inclusive to those not used to it, if you wanna give his broadcast a listen.  I'd recommend the Michael Ruppert, Rick Ross, or Adam Kokesh episodes.

       Stopping corruption itself is a really tough thing to do, especially for one person... I think it would be easier to focus in on one thing you want to change and work towards that.  Drug laws, justice reform, militarism, The Fed, etc.  Then again you may turn out like Julian Assange and do a pretty decent job attacking a broad problem like that... but it's pretty tough.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really at this point the best thing that anyone can do for any issue is to raise awareness about it.

       Be patient, be dilligent, and go to school. Play the game and always learn for yourself the truth but keep it to yourself. Then one day when you graduate. Play the adult world game, and make a mass fortune of about 60 billion. Even if it means that others think you disgusting. Play their game of deception, and then when the times is right. Form your own network to counter the evil in the world, and crush the enemy. Keep your friends closer, but your enemies even more closer. You hit the enemy when, and where they least expect it, and to come with overwhelming force. Study the Art of War by Sun Tzu.

       If you can't feel you can do that. Then try your best in your own way, but at least enjoy the good things in this world. What you make your own spiritually they can't take away. They can only take worldly things.

       They use fear and deception. But their main play is political labeling and division. Remember united we stand divided we fall? That was said for a reason. Liberals against conservatives, blacks against whites, republicans against democrats. We are all people and the labels tell us how we should think. Think for your self on every subject.

       This is really good advice. There is truly an Art to working that self-dialectic where you continuously question yourself and then reintegrate new knowledge.

       Don't take any predictions of imminent catastrophe too seriously. They have been going on forever. But don't wait before making an impact yourself. If you can't be radical and anti-establishment when you are young then when? But do constructive things rather than destructive things. Be part of a new solution rather than fighting against the problem.

       Capitalism is just fine ... corruption is the problem. The Arab Spring and OWS is essentially the same thing - the system is more profoundly unfair to greater numbers of people in Muslim countries and this has given that political movement better results. Transparency, the internet and justice are crucial. You are in a unique position. If we can maintain control over the web, the banksters, corporations and politicians will be knocked down a few pegs, sooner than any of us can imagine.

       Seek out the contradictions in the world and actively work to make the business models that prop those contradictions up obsolete. Start looking into alternative currencies and begin thinking about non-profit business models that can be used to holistically help those whom are needy within your community.

       Understand the value of the classical liberal-arts Trivium. Develop a sound vocabulary and knowledge-set (grammar), sort out where there are contradictions or fallacies in your knowledge-set (logic), and develop your abilities of peaceful communication so that you can more effectively teach others what you know (rhetoric). Good Luck, my brother or sister.

       Actually, that's good advice. Learn that many of those supposed evil, global and eons-spawning conspiracies are simply the resulting actions of stupid, corrupt humans trying to make a fast buck or attempting to cover up their asses when they make a (sometimes fatal) mistake. Both in the public and private areas, this happens everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Natch, those ARE STILL CONSPIRACIES. Two guys meeting to plan a cover up or making an illegal profit is a conspiracy. No alines, cults or holograms needed.

       Join the NWO and rule over the sheeple, apart from being concerned about you and your family, most people don't want to be helped, they are braindead zombies, so you can have much more pleasant time just ruling over the sheeple.
      </p>

       No wonder the NWO considers us all cockroaches, when you have the large majority of people sound asleep and stupid as fuck, of course they don't consider us worthy.

       Heck they can get beat up by the police all day long and tomorrow they will call for more government and more police to protect them, when government and police are the ones beating them up, but people just don't compute that.

       You need to do what the Christians had to do in the last days of the Roman Empire -- withdraw yourself from contemporary society. Be in the world, but not of the world. Look after the moral and ethical motives of yourself and those dependent upon you, and merely observe from a distance the moral decay of those others you cannot help. Our society is being deliberately corrupted. You as an individual cannot stop this, but you can take yourself out of the process.
