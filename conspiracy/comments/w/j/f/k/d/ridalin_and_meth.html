        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Does anybody know about a potential link between the rise of ADHD diagnoses in the 90&#39;s, the increased prescription use of Ridalin, and the way that Meth has eclipsed other drugs like crack and heroin in the 2000&#39;s? Is it a coincidence that 5-15 years after minors are almost routinely prescribed Ridalin in schools Meth becomes so popular?</p>

<p>EDIT: Complete conjecture - I think as more and more states decriminalize marijuana and the public figure out that weed is harmless the establishment need a new source of income. Weed prohibition is good business for big pharma, those threatened by hemp cultivation, and for-profit prisons. Maybe the government is replacing pot with meth? It would be much more effective at destroying the wealth and lives of the poor since it is incredibly addictive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a friend who was on Ritalin all the way up to high school.  He finally quit, and he went through some of the WORST withdrawals I ever seen in my life.  We played together in a band at the time, and he would just stop drumming in the middle of a song and have a thousand yard stare on his face.  He is a devout Christian, so other drugs were out of the question for him.  It was a pretty bad time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know any facts or figures but i was perscribed adderall for ~6 months. Took 40 mgs a day. I couldnt eat, couldnt sleep, i itched at my head so much scabs started to form and started picking at those. (ive been off adderall for about 3 years now and i still pick at scabs on my head.) i became serverely under weight, depressed, disturbed. Killed two pet rats i had (not on purpose, just when you stop eating you forget other things need food) after that i requested therapy and never took the shit again. And all this was when i was 13. Ive been on soooo many antideps/adhd meds/mood stabilizers. Theyve fucked me up so bad, effected the things i love to do, that i swore all scripts off and now stick to medicating with weed. TL;DR all amphetamines do the same shit. And it&#39;s awful. You turn into a zombie who only wants to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright there mate, I hear your story. Have you tried St John&#39;s Wort? Up there with weed as one of God&#39;s gifts, if you ask me. 6 weeks to take full effect &amp; withdrawal is non-existent if you solve the issues behind the need. The fun thing about the SJW is that it doesn&#39;t sacrifice any part of you like the SSRIs, amphetamines, etc, I&#39;m sure you know what I mean. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like its job is to make your life-force stronger, if that makes any sense? Increase your chi levels, to help that way, instead of hacking off a part of your soul &amp; hoping that&#39;s the defective bit. Plus, if you&#39;re an American, or someone else who doesn&#39;t have access to state healthcare, that stuff is cheap, if you get the powder, it works out at $25 for 6 months supply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the late reply my friend, only just got your message. I would argue that heavy usage of any recreational substance is only going to be detrimental to one&#39;s noggin over the long term, if someone is depressed, weed deals more with the symptoms than the cause.</p>

<p>With St John&#39;s Wort, the solution is deeper, it increases one&#39;s light, without negative effect. When that happens, weed consumption can go way down, because what one is feeding with the drug isn&#39;t so greedy any more.</p>

<p>I am by no means anti-cannabis, I&#39;m for all out legalisation, but with any drug, if you do it every day, there is a deeper issue at hold &amp; patching that over with weed may make one cope, but it&#39;s not good for you. I believe that the solution is to take those issues on at the core, that power is within each and every one of us.</p>

<p>The narrative round these parts, that weed is a wonder drug for everything is pretty much totally true, but the dark side of this line of thinking is that it is harmless &amp; that simply isn&#39;t true. </p>

<p>Meditation, running, yoga, St John&#39;s Wort, these are the tools which help one deal with many of the less severe forms of mental illness which stalk this world. A clear mind is essential to navigate the horrors &amp; the beauty all around us.</p>

<p>Much love,
partiale</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It is a vegetable...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just like alcohol is just a drink, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marijuana is anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antimicrobial, as well as a neuroprotectant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No argument from me here, I totally agree. That&#39;s not the point. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>not even spiritually</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, when you&#39;re high, your pathways shine, but afterwards it has a real habit of clogging things up. It&#39;s really useful for showing energy channeling &amp; the like, but these things can be done, also, without external help, it comes from within.</p>

<p>Doing any drug daily is an addiction, which in its self is negative towards health. Using it to deal with mental issues (which was the point I was making originally) only makes sense if there&#39;s a point down the road when the problems can be fixed. I don&#39;t believe that you have to be hooked on a substance (whether it be SSRIs, weed, booze, cocaine, butterfly homicide, or whatever) all your life due to something deep &amp; dark within, depression is a curable condition.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re happy in the first place, then none of this counts, if you can honestly look long &amp; hard into the very depths of your soul &amp; see only light, then fucking good work. But if we&#39;re talking about using drugs as anti-depressants, then there&#39;s a different matter, then there must be a path towards healing, towards being free.</p>

<p>If my reading of your username is correct, &#39;fiendishness&#39; is not a healthy state of mind, it implies need. The funny thing about addiction is that we play these games with ourselves to justify them, but in our hearts we know we&#39;re lying. Where does the fiendishness come from, asks random internet person? </p>

I hear your story, your obviously someone who&#39;s very strong who&#39;s been through more than is fair on anyone. As a fellow pre-teen big-pharma fuck-up (and hyphen addict), my heart goes out to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really, really don&#39;t care that you see my use of marijuana as a crutch. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you&#39;ve got a good point here, what &quot;I&quot; think is pretty much irrelevant all the time anyway, let alone talking with someone I don&#39;t know online. We all do what we have to do, what I look out for is people in their early twenties, who get stressed out about these conspiracies &amp; have this <em>420 4 EVA!</em> attitude, because there&#39;re a lot of unhappy people around these subjects, I want to help, maybe share some paths which could be fruitful, but what (the bleep?) do I know? You sound weighed down by the world (er, join the club) &amp; I&#39;ll only do it again this one time, the st john&#39;s wort is lightening, what&#39;s 6 weeks &amp; $20? Worth a try. It&#39;s one of the natural medicines which really works, which sounds like it might be an area of interest for you.</p>

<p>Oh, and you don&#39;t like the idea of getting the cancer? You caught the cyanide theory? There was that chap around 120 years ago, who was curing cancer left, right &amp; centre with apricot stones? I really hope apple pips keep me safe, as they may have just enough cyanide to be good for you, as it were.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our spirits are indomitable, it does not matter what we do to them, they only get stronger.</p>
