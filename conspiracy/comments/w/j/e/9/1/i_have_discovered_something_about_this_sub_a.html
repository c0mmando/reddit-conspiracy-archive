       The surefire way to bring out the shills, disinfo agents, and sockpuppets.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 2 types of posts that never fail:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Anything critical of Jews or Israel
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Photos of or discussion of chemtrails
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Try one of these and watch them crawl out of the woodwork like cockroaches when you turn out the lights. People who never comment in this sub suddenly have things to say when you post one of these two things. The same tired, lame rebuttals are regurgitated again and again, with personal insults peppered in for the hell of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry guys, but you are pretty easy to spot. You are failing in your quest, and you always will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe get a hobby/job that doesn't include making a shittier world for the people you love.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - Welcome, trolls from r/conspiratard, you come when you are called. I love the responses.

       Magic trick = successful, like there was ever a doubt.

       Assuming that everyone who disagrees with you is a shill is hardly a reasonable conclusion to draw. People post in threads about Israel because there tends to be extremely antisemetic posts made (Not anti-zionist, specifically antisemetic). People post in photos of chemtrails because they don't believe in chemtrails.

       Here's where the confusion is coming from:
      </p>
      <p>
       You gave two types of posts that bring out what you call "trolls." It is implied that you are both critical of Jews/Zionists, and a supporter of chemtrails, and trolls are trolls because they disagree and argue.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the implication of your post, and if you can't recognize that, you have a poor grasp of how human language works.

There are tons of studies on that, but if you're this deep into conspiracy theories you probably don't care about facts, science, studies, or anything else anyone will give you. You'll either dig yourself out at some point, or age into a sad and paranoid old person.

       Like I said, show me a CURRENT study that shows a direct correlation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll save you the time, none exist.  The studies you've likely read are old/outdated and flawed.  I have been drinking distilled/reverse osmosis filtered water for 10 years now and have been using natural non-fluoridated toothpaste, haven't had a single issue with my teeth (i'm almost 40).

      <p>
       here's a 2010
       <a href="http://worldental.org/dental-news/health-ministry-finds-that-fluoridation-does-not-reduce-tooth-decay/1300/">
        article
       </a>
       from NZ stating the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       In australia those tooth decay numbers are now in dispute based on a flaw in the stats.  In areas without fluoridation, kids have their adult teeth come in on average 1.5 years earlier than kids living in fluoridated areas

       This is the most retarded dick-waving I've ever witnessed. I specialize in catalysis, so no, I cannot speak from first-hand research, but I can point you at people who can:
      </p>
      <p>
       Log on to 'web of knowledge' or 'google scholar' and search for 'water fluoride epidemiology' and you'll find thousands of peer-reviewed articles on the benefits of properly fluoridated water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I know these aren't twenty minute rambling YouTube videos, so maybe they don't count as evidence in your book. But then again, it's not my problem that you're retarded.

       and no, none of those articles will explain why INGESTING fluoride with every glass of water will improve oral health.  And this is why cities all over the country are lowering/eliminating it from the public water supply

       You're so stupid that you fail to see your own stupidity; this is great.  Longitudinal studies following children exposed to treated and untreated water have been continuously conducted over the last fifty years.  So, yes, the exact opposite of what you said.  Are you twelve years old?  Do you know how to read and think critically?

       As you should. Nutrition is a big part of my life. The general rule of thumb is: if it's hard to pronounce (full of complex chemical agents for example) or
       <em>
        sounds
       </em>
       like it's an unhealthy addition to your active systems, it probably is. Asking questions about the things in your diet is essential. A skeptic eye is a tool that everyone should employ when scanning grocery shelves.

       Given your source, it's quite apparent.

       You're the guy that will go see 10 different doctors, all working with their own data sets drawing their own conclusions; 9 of them will tell you that the growth on your back is cancer, the other will tell you to wear a bracelet to ward off the heeby-jeebies. You'll go with the bracelet because the other doctor's clearly conspired against you; how else could they have come to the same conclusion?!

       You do not understand the science that you so horribly attempt to debunk. But when you believe homeopathy is valid, I suppose dilution can be a confusing concept.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I never said homeopathy was valid, moron!

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You're right, but it doesn't matter. It's all the same pseudo-scientific nonsense that can't stand the test of peer review.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Peer review? You mean the scientific circle-jerk of paid off government liars?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Right. Because anyone who works in scientific research is paid and controlled by the government, except for those that disagree with the consensus. Because that's logical.

       The thing is, you're somewhat correct: there are dangers with vaccines. Fuck, there's dangers with literally EVERYTHING. However, the dangers you ascribe to them are simply not true or severely exaggerated. The dangers that actually exist you can find in any objective study on vaccination. But the lives they have saved far outnumber those that they danger.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases">
        Here is a list of the diseases that have been wiped out globally, regionally or are currently being battled into extinction through use of vaccination.
       </a>
       When I say far outnumber, I mean that you are likely alive today because of the use of vaccines. It's really that simple.

       You are an irrational human being with irrational beliefs. They are all the same as they utilize the same fallacies: all of them. You are indistinguishable from a troll to anyone with a knowledge base located in reality. While your disinformation is a slight to the intelligence that this universe has gifted humanity, you as a thinking human are simply a failed mind; it's likely not even your fault.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is a reason that so many people think you're crazy: it is impossible to reason with a crazy person. You are impossible to reason with. I'm not saying that I think you're crazy, I'm simply explaining to you why most everyone you know thinks that you are.

       You've clearly made it your mission to smudge my personal character. And that's ok, it really is. You're entitled to defend your position, perhaps even to take it a little further. But to extrapolate and evaluate my mental health based on this trite, one-sided argument is both malicious and based purely fictional, anecdotal data you've constructed yourself.

       wanted to convey that, we do
       <em>
        not

       have all the answers when it comes to science. Speaking in a long term, generational POV, many ingredients in vaccines (or food for that matter), can have possible detrimental effects on the gene pool in a long term sense. Look at hormones in dairy and meat and their connection to earlier, more rapid development in prepubescence.
      </p>

       I'm not really sure how you were able to paint such an extensive, detailed picture from such limited information. I'm utterly vexed as to where any of that came from... Absolutely astounded at how you just
       <em>
        ran

       with your evaluation. Couldn't be further from the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homeopathy? Really? 
Peer review? Where have I slandered that?
The scientific community is abound with astute minds that I hold in high respect. Don't paint me out to be some sort of
       <em>
        anti-science

       mongoloid just because it serves your Reddit ego.

       UV causes sunburn. Visible light at useful brightness doesn't burn over any length of time. It's still radiation. Similarly, the radio waves currently coursing through your body don't interact in a meaningful way with meat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first 13 seconds of the ad you posted describe potential side effects for a treatment that stopped a life-threatening illness. Ionizing radiation (as used in the treatment of cancer) is dangerous. Anything below microwaves won't affect you unless you stick your head in the middle of a megawatt emitter.

       I don't follow much of the conspiracy world regularly, but am thoroughly interested in Fukushima and the cover-up. I can see this fella being interested in it, too. I have like 4-5 things I check up on daily with a general search of all of the reddits, but rarely look at the other stuff here.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Fukushima

       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Not because I don't believe it
       <strong>
        could
       </strong>
       be true, moreso because a lot of it is either: weird youtube videos, generalized illuminato/free mason stuff, Rothschild/Rockefeller reposts, "omg gmos r bad," applicable 1984 quotes, "hey guis i just found about op. nwoods," "REDDItS MODERATorS delEteD My POSt. THEY IN ON DA CONSPURSEAS," "new clear cover-up in da tenneseers, 1 pint of coolant spilt11!" or "More new proof that has building 7 falled lol."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the problem is, the same fucking shit is posted and upvoted day after day. You know how Fox News makes up stories and makes stuff relevant that's been long dead? This subreddit is kind of the same. I don't think the posters are crazy, I don't think they're irrational, and I don't think they're necessarily wrong. However, you can only talk about the same shit for so long.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need to wake up every morning to have someone tell me I still have 10 toes, I don't need someone to tell me every morning I can still see and I don't need someone to show me algebra still works. A good majority of the stuff here is reposted on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I appreciate the hard work and constant digging people do into this stuff. I don't think the subreddit should change either. Without it, you couldn't find the truth, but so much of it is just pointless reposts. There's almost as many
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       posts per hour (Maybe like, 60%) as there are
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       . There's not that many "new" conspiracies worth talking about on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, the desire to find "truth" turns into outright paranoia and people accusing other people of being shills. Do you think this helps the truth get told when half the community is attacking each other on a daily basis? Agree on the facts, disagree with the inconsistencies, but don't start attacking your fellow community members for some paranoid shit. If that's the standard way information disseminates and you truly believe in the illuminato/nwo stuff, don't you think that's what "they" want? Don't you think "they" want to be able to just say "Wow look a shill" if anything comes out? If enough people accuse and discredit someone with ad hominem attacks, their whole point will be thrown out. Stop attacking the person and instead attack the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or does that make me a shill too?

       I don't think it's fair to blame this trend entirely on shills. There very well could be shills, and I personally believe there are, but in addition to this, I see a lot of really misguided, ignorant talk about Jews and Zionism and whatever, and it sometimes inspires me to disagree and ridicule posters, just because I find the ignorance repulsive. I'm sure there are a lot of others out there who also respond like this - disagreeing vocally, but only when posts are especially senseless. The most senseless talk I ever see in this sub typically involves Jews, Zionism, chemtrails, and/or vaccines, in that order - so it's not surprising you would see this trend, whether it's shills responsible or not.

       The societal paradigm of the times depicts what's 'ok' to discuss, and the

       of acceptable fringe conversations is clearly drawn with that paradigm in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a topic reaches CNN headlines once or twice, it's ok to talk about it, but to assert and opinion that takes it further down the rabbit hole will still meet direct opposition. If that same topic gets more coverage, from various news agencies around the country, that fringe boundary opens up a little wider - OKing discussions a bit further.

       Can you fully disprove most of themselves aforementioned theories? If you can I'd love to hear it, because there are many holes, in many of the theories we hold as

       Evolution and the theory of gravity are both suspect. Gravity is the best example of a universal constant that is widely accepted, but not fully understood. In the merging, or seeking of common ground, between quantum and Newtonian/Relativistic science further proves this.

       The burden of proof is solidly on you here. There's no mystery in the underlying mechanisms for the commonly-accepted explanations you're trying to frame as conspiracies. The effects of a wing on water vapor are demonstrable. It is irrational to demand that everybody else somehow prove there's
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a secret plan to poison the air or whatever, because it's possible to construct an infinite number of mutually exclusive unfalsifiable theories requiring arbitrary amounts of perfect secrecy. See: Russel's teapot.

       I'm not. You asked, "can you fully disprove most of the aforementioned theories?" Those theories included chemtrails.

      <p>
       My central point stands regardless: we have no obligation to "disprove" these ideas. Our explanations fit better and there are eventualities that could prove them wrong. "The aforementioned theories" are ridiculous and could stretch to fit any evidence or none.

       In the absence of falsifiability, the possibility is meaningless. If a theory isn't affected by reality then it does not affect reality. As I said, I can imagine an infinite number of conflicting theories that are categorically impossible to disprove, and every last one of them will be some invisible-pink-unicorn nonsense.

       This isn't about outside-the-norm possibilities. This is about, as Autocoprophage put it, "unsubstantiated garbage." It's about ideas that have nothing to support them and recognize no possibility of being wrong. There is no rational discussion possible for a proposition like chemtrails - a hypothesis which sees artificial clouds formed by aircraft vortices as undetectable chemicals being dropped on the entire civilized world for purposes ranging from population control to hiding entire planets. All you can do when someone suggests something so baseless and impossible is tell them to come back when their rambling bears any connection to observable reality.

       Chemtrails and similarly kooky nonsense remain the topic at hand. I don't expect you to defend it. It's indefensible. I expect you to defend your insistence that I need to say more than "it's kooky nonsense" to dismiss it.

       No, it took evidence. It built credibility by accurately predicting the outcome of relevant experiments. The theory and its acceptance were built on observations that could not be otherwise explained by existing models. When the common consensus better explains an alleged conspiracy and proposed experiments are not just absent but

       I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. Some discussions aren't productive, aren't informative. Sometimes they are simply about contentious topics and it becomes rational to speak against them - whether I'm a shill or not.

       Just to be clear: I do not support Zionism or any Jewish agenda whatsoever, but I do support honest and rational analysis. I often see discussion and accusation about Zionism and Jews and it is very irrational and dishonest, and for this reason I shake my head at it and disagree with it. My disagreements may seem to be the work of a shill to paranoid or ignorant people - I have been accused before - but I'm no shill and I don't even have my own position on the matter at all. If the discussion is sensible, I will not disapprove, but, often, the discussions are not sensible.

       I would find it highly unlikely they have the time or manpower. Pay off a few journalists? Sure. Bush paid bloggers to write positive stories without them saying anything to their readers about these sponsored stories. But directing and shaping discussions in real time all across the internet? That's going to take a lot of time and people. Most of the federal bureaucracy is engaged in being, well, bureaucrats.

       I'm not too bothered about Jews and all that palaver, because it has no effect on my life, plus it's all such a mess now that no side is without blame of some sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'll frequently dive into chemtrail discussions, because let's face it - along with crop circles, it has to be one of the most
       <em>
        incredibly lame
       </em>
       conspiracy theories ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you have some of the highest quality loons clinging to it!
      </p>
      <p>
       For example its ever-mutating stupidity now features "slyphs" which appear to be some form of flipping
       <em>
        air elemental
       </em>
       that eats chemtrails (one unproven claim defeats another unproven claim - colour me unimpressed!), and those absolutely out-of-their-gourd nutjobs spraying vinegar into the air!
      </p>
      <p>
       Where else could I find novelty and mental shenanigans of this level?

       While you have a point, the chemtrails thing I've put a bit of time into researching and I'm still unconvinced. This video seems pretty convincing though

       You have to research things to gain an understanding of them. Planes leave condensed vapour trails, that much is certain but some seem to behave more differently. Basing a solid opinion on mere assumptions is pretty ridiculous and totally counter productive.

       Hallmark of a sensible approach. Sure, make all the assumptions you want it's fun, I do it all the time but don't ever misconstrue these things as fact all of a sudden. Then you have become deluded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean to point out when I said solid opinion I meant a fully held, factual belief. I think it's good to voice your assumptions for the most part but not with any degree of certainty for they are just assumptions.

       Since when did "condensed vapor trails" last for hours whilst spreading out to meet up with other trails laid down, usually in tandem if you watch but then why am I arguing on the internets with a shill, troll or fuckbucket. It only matters is that I know something isn't right.

       "condensed vapor trails" only lasts for a few miles behind the Airliner and then they disappear.

       Guess I'm the latter. It's good to question, it's good to be suspicious but to treat your suspicions as absolute fact is not beneficial that's all I'm saying.

       I know right, some videos such as

        this

       seem so damning it's almost evidence but I've found the presence of a cold front
       <em>

       have created this. It's really hard to know but there is more evidence to suggest they're just oddly performing contrails. I'm undecided on the issue.

       Nobody is monitoring anything. People reply disagreeing with you because you are a known anti-semitic nutjob. You love conflating the actions of Israel with all Jews. You also use incredibly biased sources (same goes for your buddies bumblingmumbling, Ijob911, and Occidentalist) and occasionally you flat out lie (such as when you insisted Mein Kampf was actively suppressed and censored in the US).

       I also "show up" whenever pro wrestling is mentioned (I'm a fan - say what you will). Does that make a "pro wrestling shill"? Or perhaps I just hate seeing anti-semitic bullshit and so I comment on it. Ever think of that?

        I've noticed what you're saying, since I often comment on posts about Zionism. You get posters that you never see anywhere else, and often two of them will do a tag-team on somebody.

       The same could easily be said about bumblingmumbling and what not. You guys hate jews so you comment on 'jew' threads. I've nothing against jews and know there'll always be some bigotry or interesting conspiratorial nonsense, *so I comment on them. I find 'jew hate' and holocaust denial, and their corresponding justifications interesting. A study of 'people' if you wish.

       Neither of the exactly hide their bigotry. I can find more examples if you'd like. While the majority of the users on the subreddit are fine, this subreddit has a serious problem with racism and antisemtitism mainly in about five posters.

       There's nothing that really can be done. It's upsetting, yes, but short of banning them there is no way that this can be stopped, and I seriously doubt that they will be banned any time soon, nor would I be supportive of such a ban.

       While I disagree with just about everything you post in this sub, you at least substantiate your claims. You are a regular poster, you don't call someone an anti-semite who needs to die, then run away. I don't know that name-calling is one of your go-to tricks (other than anti-semite) either. I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about people who don't post here, popping up like a "Someone used the word Jew...attack!!" alarm went off on their screen.
