       We are currently gridlocked by a status-quo machine that is comprised of the richest humans in the world. They enjoy having relatively more than others and lack human compassion and knowledge to change their behavior. They are unfortunately the largest reason why human progression (which can be measured in universal quality of life) is nearly stagnant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The machine primarily is one of control. Control of all resources in the world. Water, food, energy, housing, healthcare, education and transportation are all artificially scarce in accessibility because of this machine.
I recognize the potential for us to all increase our quality of life, be more free, have greater access to these aforementioned resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are those who have gone to great lengths to ensure that they retain control. This is in the form of managing public percpetion via corporate media productions, propaganda, misinformation, distractions, entertainment and deliberate deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recognizing these issues an important step towards growing as a race and us all living a better life.
Since plants cannot grow healthily in the wrong environment, we humans also face the same issues. What environment would humans require to all be better off?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have infinite potential to explore space, consciousness and create more cultural artifacts to share and benefit each other. The internet is the mechanism much of this cultural exchange occurs through.
The more we exchange culturally, the more difficult it is to see other groups of humans different from ourselves.
Many of us recognize there is something systematically wrong with the way things are. This causes many to experience anger, sadness, depression and hopelessness. Those in charge, wanting to retain their power realize that people must have an outlet for these emotions and they would rather turn people against each other than face these angry people headon. This is called divide and conquer. One of the biggest reason for wars. They actually entrench their control from their ill-gotten gains and the cycle continues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that we have the internet though, it's getting more and more difficult to keep secrets and avoid accountability for their crimes agaisnt humanity. This has given birth to a new kind of war, war against truth. The soldiers of this war are paid mercenaries that create "Fear, uncertainty and doubt" They are not so much interested in logically defeating truths but distracting, gimping and minimizing the damage of said truth. Misinformation and distraction entertainment is the biggest weapon in deception currently being perpetrated against the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, once the pressure is put on the right right people in the right way, you might see these greedy individuals change their behaviors. Unfortunately, most of the individuals are yet to be widely recognized. As people continue to suffer they too will look for the root cause. It is an inevitability.
The most fucked up part is that those who are most capable with the most resources at any point could help humanity yet they choose not to. This is robbing humanity of its potential. We face a new kind of darkage, one where truth and significant contributions to humanity drown into obscurity in a sea of LOLCATS and American Idol.
Knowing is half the battle, in which case we are on our way to paradise.

       It is not that anything is scarce or not scarce.  It is undeniable that physical things are scarce in the sense of not being inexhaustable, but he control system in one way or another dictates access to these through law and money.  Yes its a control grid.  But what are the alternatives?

       A long, hard battle awaits. Whatever happens now, they will not abdicate power easily, if at all. The Internet is the perfect weapon and is now in all four corners of the globe. That must scare the piss out of them. Or not. It's absolutely in our hands now, because the previous generations have left us a bag of barely managed, overstretched, corrupted shite. Ta mum, ta dad. Left unchecked everyone will suffer unnecessarily and to me that is unconscionable. Interesting crossroads we humans find ourselves in...

       Look entertainment is not created out of thin air and forced on the masses, we all need entertainment and fun, else we'd all be depressed and commit suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       So can you please stop with the fake crap about entertainment. You can say individuals who don't understand anything and only watch entertainment are a threat, but not entertainment itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       So stop using entertainment as an enemy, its not an enemy, its a human need.

       Of course entertainment is a human need. It's the current form of popular entertainment being USED that's the problem. The best kind of entertainment is thought provoking, tells a good story, gives the viewer ideas and incites emotional responses. What do we have today? Storage Wars, Cajun Pawn Stars (yes, there's a CAJUN Pawn Stars now), Toddlers and Tiaras, Jersey Shore. It's clap-trap drivel meant for you to stare at and turn your brain off, which is exactly what
       <strong>
        they
       </strong>
       want, for you to be hypnotized by the slanderous and provocative nature of these shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Entertainment should be engaging,
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       disengaging.
