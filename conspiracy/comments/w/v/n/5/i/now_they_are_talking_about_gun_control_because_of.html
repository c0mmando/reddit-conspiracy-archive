    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is, I think, the most salient point.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t want any possibility that the massive numbers of public citizens could potentially rebel AND have weapons to do it with. It makes their job of oppression that much easier when their guns are the biggest.</p>

<p>I think they lead to a tightly controlled, always monitored society where you&#39;re never not plugged into the system. Your entire worth (your bank account, credit score, standing with the law) will be tied into a chip, which will first be in your wallet, and then under your skin in the form of an RFID chip. If you do something they don&#39;t like, they just disable your chip, and bam, you can&#39;t buy anything.</p>

<p>It sounds crazy, but that is my opinion as for where we&#39;re headed.</p>

<p>We can still alter our path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gun control advocacy stems from a fundamental ignorance of the nature of guns, crime motivation, and the criminals ability to circumvent said laws. These people are akin to ambulance chasing lawyers. Guns are not the issue, it&#39;s the people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both sides are wrong.  Effective gun control can significantly reduce gun violence, like in england.  It is possible to regulate away gun violence.  But areas that already have guns cannot have effective gun control, it is forever too late to try and regulate the issue away, in which case having more for everybody helps even the play.  The us is in the latter catagory so... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference between guns and bombs is a power thing. Symbolically, the gun is an extension of personal power. You point it. You decide when to pull the trigger. Someone dies because of your specific, individual choice. Bombs, by contrast, kill indiscriminately. They are impersonal killers. They do not so much project the power of the individual as they create chaos and panic. That&#39;s why terrorists use bombs so much more often than guns. They want to create chaos and general panic, whereas the gun killers want to project their own personal power of life and death onto an individual whom they target.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So far NYPD&#39;s Police Chief and the Mayor of NYC, have called for tighter gun control. As if either of those people&#39;s opinion is relevant, or needed. Instead of gun control, let&#39;s talk about the worthless people this country creates. That is the problem worth talking about.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about the lack of accountability on the part of politicians and policy makers. If you can defraud an entire country, an entire planet, and then go play golf, that is a fucking problem we should be talking about.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guns end up in the wrong hands regardless. Hell, the US government is responsible for ensuring that a large number of them get into the wrong hands. And now (with added furor and &#39;evidence&#39;, pointing to this shooting) they want to remove our ability to defend against this kind of evil.</p>

<p>It only would have taken one or two well prepared gun owners to take that guy out. I can&#39;t say for certain that they would have been able to kill him before he did any damage, but someone who carries a gun is almost always prepared to use it if the situation should arise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If everyone owns a 9mm, then the criminals go out and get ak47s and body armor etc etc.  </p>

<p>Perpetual escalation is not the answer.</p>

<p>If you get guns off the street, at least crazies like this guy won&#39;t have easy access to weapons.  </p>

<p>Incorrect, this guy was armed with body armor and a high powered rifle.  They would have been massacred. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why arming everyone doesn&#39;t make the world a safer place.  If anything, it would make criminals pull the trigger faster, because they know that everyone would have a gun.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, guys like that will still be able to get weapons if they want them. It will be a little harder, but they&#39;ll still be able to get the guns. The only thing that happens if you prevent responsible citizens from owning guns means they aren&#39;t able to defend themselves from the people that don&#39;t have a problem obtaining illegal weapons.</p>

<p>We obviously don&#39;t give a shit since we are shipping weapons into Mexico and the government is fully complicit in this. Don&#39;t you think that should be stopped before they start taking weapons out of the hands of law abiding citizens?</p>

<p>But since criminals are always going to be one step ahead, they wouldn&#39;t really be defending themselves!  Look at how this guy was armed.  Body armor, head to toe.  No amount of legal gun ownership would have saved those people.    The criminals are always going to have better weapons.  Citizens would have to start arming themselves with illegal weapons and body armor to compete.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s why this is sorta silly.  The thugs are always going to get better weapons and kill faster, you can&#39;t compete with illegal heartless motherfuckers.  Trying to turn the average citizen into a miniature crime stopper is going to get people killed for nothing.  </p>

<p>At least when you strictly control guns you lower the chance of crazy motherfuckers going on shooting sprees.  Look at all the high casualty shootings over the past 10 years, they&#39;re never done by armed criminals.  They&#39;re all crazy sick fucks that had easy access to firearms. </p>

<p>This would change if we had stringent laws on gun ownership and purchasing and actually enforced the laws.  It&#39;s basically a free for all, anyone can buy a large automatic weapon, no questions asked.  Most guns used by the cartels are American made for this reason.  </p>

<p>No something does not need to be done. This is perhaps the most idiotic utterance in the history of humanity. It is prelude to every misguided, misled, mass-manipulated movement ever. Just because one theater was attacked does not mean we&#39;re all too scared to see a movie and must sacrifice more liberty.</p>

<p>Get a grip and learn some basic statistics you fucking cowards.</p>
