       No, to believe in the devil you have to believe in god and since i dont believe in god i cant possibly believe in a devil, in a literal sense, metaphorically speaking however yes i can see how people would use the devil as a symbol for various aspects of the industry and the darker side of human nature.

       dwelve deeper past the modern christian analysis of what the devil or satan is, back to pagan tradition. Lucifer represented knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Selling your soul to the devil? Propaganda in itself. I've the eye of lucifer represented inside of an ouroborous dragon tattooed on my leg. It represents knowledge, and the sadness that accompanies many of the great truths of our world. To consider the trade off between knowledge and happiness is where the christian belief comes from, and the backlash that accompanied the dark ages only propagated this opinion.

       when celebrities talk about "selling their soul" to the devil, they mean they're signing long term contracts with large companies to become famous.
      </p>
      <p>
       those companies use their power and money to promote celebrities and make them famous, but the celebrities are now obligated to work for the companies exclusively for a set amount of time, maybe years, maybe decades, before they'r released from their contracts. the companies therefore "own" their "souls".

       Not to an exact devil deity. The devil is merely a metaphor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel you can see your soul to gain characteristics of those that worship the dark. Dark traits being based around fear. Similar to what some would say would be like the devil.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could all be human made though. It could also be real magic... I don't know, but I choose to keep an open mind.

       crowley was nothing more than a hyper rational and logical philosopher. He studied human emotion and how to manipulate it. This is all the dark arts are in persuit of. It's labeled with an imposition of fear, hatred, and evil as a means of keeping the populace away from such things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you imagine what would happen if the western civilization was capable of rationally thinking of what is happening to them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Books like the secret even start hinting at some of crowley's "ancient knowledge of the universe". Which again, is really just philosophy and methods of manipulating your subconcious mind into a state of awareness.

      <p>
       "The most infamous of them all" in this case seems to refer to "devil worshippers". No one would just randomly say someone was the most infamous of them all without referring back to what it is they mean...

       The point behind all of this is not your misinformed opinion, it is your willful ignorance, earlier in the thread (and still), where you decided you did not need to read Crowley to fully condemn him as a "devil worshiper".

       in my opinion, he is the most infamous. How is that a lie? And in that post, I didnt even mention Satan or anything about Crowley, only Mj's friend that was supposedly so. Oh, and since Christianity is in your belief a social control system, falsehood, etc without a shadow of doubt... Who's to say you're right, and I'm wrong? Facts rent opinions.

       It is not that science can explain everything - it can't. It can however explain

       that the Christian religion is based on falsehood and only a system of social control.

You never explained why you can't make your own and debate your wise intellectual and factual opinions there. All I wanted answer in my post was reinstated in the question. Is that too much to ask? Why waste your time with your silly rantings when you already know I, the person who asked the question, does care for? :)

       a guise to wisk away the ignorant. If people have a pre-imposed notion of what you are, you can dismiss the people you don't care about simply with a bit of that color.

      <p>
       Take the baphomet, that upside down pentagram goatfaced fucking thing.  It represents change, the primal orgies of man, and has been used by pagans for a hell of a long time to ward off ignorant christians from homes when you don't care to debate your beliefs with a narrow minded class of human beings.

       Who says Crowley is a devil worshiper?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you read a single thing Crowley wrote?
      </p>
      <p>
       Crowley developed a metaphysical system unrelated to your Christianity, and by virtue of that was not a "devil worshiper". If anything, he claimed to be the devil himself (666 the great beast).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, if you want to know about Crowley, read Crowley.

       There are mny, many things that you can research in life. But is all of it worth your time? No. Do Christoans exist? Animal worshipers? Pople worship almost everything. Do I have to prove that to you too?

       You seem like quite a sociable person in real life. Maybe if you speak that way to everyone, how vastly superior in intellect you are, they would respect you so much more. I mean honestly, look at you. Keep going man.

       If you are going to cite something to back up a claim, then yes, you have to offer evidence. This is basic stuff dude.

       I never said that. I said, repeatedly, that I actually read stuff. You said, repeatedly, that you don't need to. Intellect has nothing to do with it, unless you mean the raw brain power it takes to read a book.

       Sure you dedfinitely didnt imply it either. Since I'm the stupidest person you have encountered, why dont you take it somewhere else? I didnt attack you for being agnostic, so why are you?
      </p>
      <p>
       You havent cited a source either. But you dont have to, because it has nothing to do with my question. Go take your wisdom somewhere else, where a less stupid person will completely agree youre right.

       When did I even say you attacked me for being Christian? You attacked me because you think your opinion is far superior, typical of someone thinks that small minded idiocy is because people dont see the world the way they see it. Continue being agnostic, hope you can earn some respect from people you're shootind down.

       Great job. Not only have have you failed to convince me anything, you didn't answer my question either. What was your purpose to continue posting here? If you are going to shoot down anything I said, why don't you make your own post and debate with others of your equal intellect since I have nothingof value to contribute in a one-sided argument, in which you seem to know so much. What was your point?
      </p>
      <p>
       To make an enemy out of me? Well, you've done it. One wonders how you're going to make anyone agree with your viewpoint by putting them down. Have you noticed I haven't insulted you personally? Work on your people skills man, then more people will like you and appreciate your opinions meanwhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and yes, I didn't think you attacked me. It's plain as day anyone who wants to read your comments.

       You are in fact the stupidest person I have ever encountered. Why do I believe this? Because you said something that was not true. You were then told it was incorrect. You then claimed you were somehow exempt from having to do your own god damn research.

       You refuse to educate yourself about Crowley, but cite him as an example of the foundations of your question. Your question is stupid. Your refusal to accept that you might be wrong is stupid. You, are stupid.

       Here are my thoughts...
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in the charkra system. Infinite points that connect your body and soul, with 7 main ones. Top to bottom wisdom, knowledge, communication, love, power, change, existence. Everything you do is a transfer of energy between these points. Love is the center. I believe that lack of love is evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that when you are working with love you are using 7 and that is perfect. But if you work without love you are using 6. Which is imperfect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that the number of the beast is 666 because 6 is imperfect 66 is more imperfect and 666 is the most imperfect. I feel the beast represents our money system because it exists without love.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel selling your soul to the devil is pledging yourself to this system

       You do understand that there are documented satanic worshipers. If you think Christians exist, do you think the opposite doesn't? And refrain from calling other people's opinions idiocy, yours isn't any better. Being atheist doesn't make you anymore smarter than anyone, nor not believing the devil.

       Show me. Are you talking about the Church of Satan? They claim up and down that they are using Satan as a metaphor. Or do you mean "devil worshipers" who are teenagers, high on television, who think that some kind of satanic seance is going to bring them girls and beer?

       Find me reference to the Devil in the hebrew of the old testament. You can't. He isn't there. "Satan" is from the hebrew "ha satan", which translates as "the accuser". There was no devil until Christian leaders invented him and retroactively pressed him into the mythos.

       It is far more believable if you have taken time and weighed the evidence. I am assuming you have never studied science or any of the evidence of evolution, or the size of the universe. There is no Christian God. This is a simple fact to arrive at if you actually use your brain and do your own research.

       Your beliefs are your beliefs. My beliefs are my beliefs. There are a lot of grey areas, and many things that can be tudied. There is no single truth for anyone. Facts? Sir, just because that was what led you in your research to believe is right, doesn't mean it's the truth for everyone. My research as led me somewhere very different. 
So, who's to point at anyone for saying they can't handle the truth? You seem to think your opinion is far superior than mine, without even mybe considering that my research has been just maybe done as much as yours?

       Have you even looked at the link I put there? That sums up one side of the coin on Crowley. There is a reason why there's two sides on the perspective of this man.

       Yes, there is a need. You believe falsehoods and refuse to educate yourself otherwise, but seem intent on continuing to spread said falsehoods.

       You must mean Animism. Anyway, show me an organized "religion" based on Animism that exists today. Outside of revival pagan stuff, you won't find it.

       I have been an active participant in Thelema (crowleyist magick) since I was 17. That was 16 years ago. I have read
       <em>
        damn near everything
       </em>
       Crowley wrote, or has been written about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to you, you have not even read a single thing he wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am going to just go ahead and assume I have a more informed opinion than you.

       Yes, because that link clearly does not say, NOT SAY, thst Crowley said he served the Greater Master Satan. Oh wait, that doesnt make a devil worshiper in anyones eyes. Nope. Im sure no one in this country that opinion but me.

       All I asked was the above. I dont really care for the enlightment about Crowley. if I did, I would start a post about it. i have no problem with what people said in my comments, abiut chakra, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as SOON as you insult me personally for my idiocy because I dont see it your way, I could care less with what you're saying. I would think if you're trying to persuade someone, you would do it without the insults? Then again, he may make good points, but who cares what someone has to say when they say you're the stupidest person they've encountered anyway? :)

       Lol, ok.  You've been struggling through a pitiful and losing argument for 6+ hours, and I comment twice and need to calm down?  Please,  I've spent my last hour at work amusing myself with this, in addition to making a friend who seems to be an expert on Satan worshipers, or something like that.  Visit trees, really.

       Mountains of evidence for evolution. The number of times the Christian church has been wrong (gravity, geocentric theory, space, race, sexuality). Quantum physics. The gospel of Thomas and the rest of the Gnostic Gospels. The creation of the Vulgate. There are over 36,000 denominations of a religion dedicated to "one" god. The complete lack of contempory references to anything in the Jesus myth. The fact that lesser gods in the middle east had already: walked on water, turned fishes and loves into enough to feed 5000, healed the sick, raised the dead, and been crucified and returned from the dead.

       Please, go on, you seem to have the ability of time travel. And since not only the Bible, but Quran, Torah, have inconsistencies, they must be all wrong, no? Despite what consistencies, we will only look at what's incorrect. Because science and everything we know has no contradictions ever...

       Good point. However you use a lot of buzz words (your conception of Crowley, for instance) that are lifted directly out of Christianity.

      <p>
       Also earlier you were offended when I said Jesus Fucking Christ.

       And you seem to believe the devil is a real thing.

       Yeah, so maybe you are struggling - but i am going to go ahead and conclude that there is some form of Christianity still kicking around in your head.

       You research you want answers to, and stop when you think you've found your answer. Unless you are Crowley yourself, my opinion of him does not change. Like I said, there are two sides of a coin. You believe he isn't satanic, Christianity is a socia control system, blah, blah blah. Make your own post for someone who cares instead of calling others stupid for not agreeing. You seem like one of those people who think the truth for them is the truth universally. It isn't. Take your head out of your conceited behind and accept that your opinion isn't worth more than mine, whatever your pathetic claims and attempts to make me feel lesser. Take it away to someone who cares.

       No, I just happen to know 1. that you don't know anything about Crowley, and 2. you claim you don't need to/don't want to actually read Crowley.

       Well, since they're no such thing as a soul, much less "the devil".

       I'd say that if you can find some braindead religious fucknut willing to pay you for your "soul" its easy free money.

       I think the banks are like the devils of the stories. Both give you whatever you want in exchange for your life (you give a bank a steady flow of cash for 30 some-odd years sometimes 60 for just a home) unless you're smart about what you do. Gratify instantly in exchange for pain along the way or in the future. No emotions, and faceless. They can destroy everything a person has worked for a past contract.

       Oh, this comment that started it all
      </p>

       if you wtch the Snoop Dogg music video, it gets relly literal. And MJ was known to hang out with a supposed devil worshipper who followed Crowley, the most infamous of them all.
