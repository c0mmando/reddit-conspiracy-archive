    <div class="md"><p>Its not a convient excuse, its reality. Look lets be real here there is going to be a HUGE number of people coming into London over the next month for the games and its only prudent that any and all medical facilities have some planning done just in case. Its the smart thing to do and it has nothing to do with some shadowy government conspiracy. Why is it that so many people on this subreddit seem to find conspiracy around every corner and coverup behind simple benign stories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I think it&#39;s safe to say that you received this due to the Olympics; however, it&#39;s not likely because of a conspiracy whereby someone <em>knows</em> some incident will occur. When there is any major event in an area, the risk for a &quot;Major Incident&quot; is increased. Although there is a small likelihood of it occurring, even a minor incident would put a strain on various infrastructure. Either way, incident or no incident, your census at that hospital will probably increase a great deal, simply because of the tourists. </p>

<p>With all the above said, who really KNOWS if something WILL happen at the Olympics? Anyone here is purely speculating. I think it will be interesting to see what else happens in the world under the media cover of the Olympics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>^ What this guy said.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more of preparing just in case, not, because it&#39;s already known.</p>

<p>With an event this big, it&#39;s really not strange to see them telling people to be on their toes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work at a South West NHS hospital and I can tell you categorically, that &quot;major incident&quot; planning has been part of each hospitals routine operational planning since forever.                    </p>

<p>A Major Incident can be any situation that endangers the safe running of the hospital but primarily A&amp;E. This could be anything like a large RTA with many casualities, a train/plane crash, a chemical spill or a terrorist attack. Who the terrorists are would be unimportant.<br/>
What is important, is that the Major Incident Plan is in place so that key staff are quickly informed and relevant action taken. During office hours, all the key people will be on-site. Out of hours, people like directors, site managers. clinical directors et cetera, are contacted. Overflow wards are prepared and pharmacy stocks checked. You get the idea.<br/>
In essence, it prepares A&amp;E for a large influx of patients and tries to manage the situation without breaching waiting and transfer times.     </p>

<p>It would be negligent for any hospital not to practice for a Major Incident with an event as large as the Olympics taking place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in the facilities dept. (don&#39;t want to specify further) and we would be issued with guidance when necessary.<br/>
In other words, if I worked at your London-based hospital I would expect Major Incident guidelines to be updated/confirmed with an event as large and as important as the Olympics looming.                    </p>

<p>Even if there is a terrorist attack being planned (and again, who&#39;s responsible is unimportant), no conspiracy would delve so deep as to involve the running of local hospitals.<br/>
And, if there is an attack planned, I&#39;d be much happier knowing that my local hospital was as prepared as possible to cater for large numbers of injuries.                       </p>

<p>I believe in some pretty esoteric conspiracies. But I think it highly unlikely that this has a connection to any.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nonsensical question.<br/>
We, the public, had no foreknowledge of 7/7 or 9/11.<br/>
We&#39;ve known for years that London is to host the 2012 Olympics.<br/>
And, as I&#39;ve said before, it would be remiss for any hospital to not plan for the worst possible scenario when catering to an event as large and as important as the Olympics.                     </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that there will be no attack and that there is no conspiracy involving the 2012 Olympics. None of us really know and only time will tell.<br/>
All I&#39;m saying is that if there is an Olympic conspiracy on the cards, this hospital preparedness plan is not connected.</p>

<p>how is an event that is happening all the way across</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I live in the US, on the west coast. I have heard almost nothing but stuff about the Olympics and the possibility of a false flag during it. If such an event were to happen, it is silly to think the US would not respond in some way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone posted something similar a few days ago. The symbolism of the olympics with London as the New Jerusalem. He theorized that while all attention was focused on London, something big would happen in Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well - biblically speaking, there is an order of prophetic passages that seems to line up: </p>

<p>Ezekiel 36 - already happened 1948</p>

<p>Ezekiel 37 - already happened 1948...next comes 38,39</p>

<p>Isaiah 17, complete destruction of Damascus in one night; </p>

<p>Isaiah 18, destruction of a &quot;a nation tall and smooth, To a people feared far and wide, A powerful and oppressive nation&quot;, which repents after devastating attack; which correlates with:</p>

<p>Ezekiel 38 - attack against Israel by Russia, Iran, and an alliance of &quot;many&quot;.....God destroys all attackers....
and what appears to be a simultaneous attack on a second nation, described as:
&quot;the land of unwalled villages...those who are at rest...that live securely...all of them living without walls and having no bars or gates....to capture spoil and to seize plunder, to turn your hand against the waste places which are now inhabited, and against the people who are <strong>gathered from the nations</strong>, who have acquired cattle and goods, who live at the center of the world.’..</p>

<p>No divine intervention is mentioned for this nation.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know about the New Jerusalem/London stuff - beyond that there are a lot of people who view things this way. </p>

If anything DOES happen over there...we have so much proof that it was already planned...so in the end, if we.. the &quot;CRAZIES&quot; are right...which I hope we aren&#39;t on this...we can use stuff like this to prove it like bosses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me tell you, save that letter and store the images online on multiple hosting sites, if something happens on the Olympics like a bomb going off or something, it may be valuable evidence. That said there is plausible deniability here with the letter, so its not going to be major evidence or anything, but coupled with other evidence it will be valuable. </p>

<p>So save the letter, someone should possible save this website page, just in case.</p>

<p>When 9/11 happened no one was ready and look how people still exposed it was false flag, but this time we need to be ready and if nothing happens, then all the better. We win either way!</p>
