    <div class="md"><p>This topic was inspired by a comment I made a long time ago where I said the same thing basically. I got a bunch of comments in reply that are quite similar to this thread. </p>

<p>Some people were astounded I was asking that question, like it was absurd or something, that anyone could ever be racist. Some people were angry at me for asking it, I got negative downvotes after a while. And then I had some people affirm what I had asked, started telling me I actually was evil.</p>

<p>Jew&#39;s are clearly a hot topic for everyone, whether they&#39;re angry it&#39;s brought up, dismissive that extreme racism could possibly stem from this, or whether they&#39;re racist. I can only deduce that there is a high level of racism here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I&#39;ve wondered the same thing when reading stuff in this sub. This is the first time I&#39;ve commented in this sub, and this is a new account I made for that purpose, but I&#39;m in here lurking every day trying to figure out what&#39;s going on. (And I would like to say, that despite all the craziness thrown around, I&#39;ve really been able to find a lot of good info!)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to figure out why these types of attitudes bother me, and it&#39;s not just because of the hateful language used all over the place. The broad-brushing of an entire fucking religion is what bothers me. I feel the same way when I hear people use the word &quot;Muslim&quot; to mean &quot;terrorist&quot;. Then, the other day, someone made a comment on an article around here that said basically &quot;Not all Zionists are Jewish&quot;. That comment really helped my thoughts on the matter come together.</p>

<p>In my opinion is that yeah, there may be some powerful group of bad people trying to move society in the direction they want, but just because some of them (Or a lot of them? It doesn&#39;t matter really) happen to be Jewish, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re evil BECAUSE they&#39;re Jewish.  The hate that comes from these kinds of attitudes is exactly the kind of shit we&#39;re supposed to be trying to stop! It&#39;s not about what fucking name people choose to call &quot;god&quot;, it&#39;s about bad people preying on the weaknesses of the rest of us.</p>

<p>I think about religion a lot. There are teachings/attitudes from every religion I&#39;ve encountered that I really do respect, and there are ones that I don&#39;t. I think that a large portion of people who claim to be Jewish or Christian or whatever are actually the opposite. Religion is supposed to be about community and love and personal growth isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Sorry this got so long. I hope this makes sense to people. I&#39;ve just begun to attempt writing about how I see the world behaving, and there&#39;s so much info it&#39;s hard to not ramble. If/when I can get my thoughts together and figure out a format, I&#39;ll definitely share here first. All I want to do is try to stop people from hating each other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technically, I suppose that&#39;s right. Racially speaking Ashkenazi Jews are Europeans. There is a small genetic component that gives them some slight distinguishing characteristics, but they are minor and often not there at all. There are blond-haired, blue-eyed Jews. Yet they link themselves to some ancient tribe that lived in the Middle East during the rule of the Romans more than two millennia ago.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the tribal factor is the primary unifying factor for Jews, stronger even than the religious factor because more and more Jews are atheists, particularly Zionist Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel that in the more mystical aspects of Judaism, there is a lot of good information about how the world works.  I believe much of the secret knowledge came from the Egyptians.  This secret knowledge allowed those that were at the top of the Jewish power structure to feel that they were chosen by God.  I believe the Jewish god is more of a demiurge.  A demiurge that spawned three global religions.  Obviously a pretty powerful one.  But a demiurge is a very limited expression of the universal power that is at the core of creation.  </p>

<p>To answer your question, I don&#39;t harbor any hate for Jews.  At all.  But I do think that the Jews have a limited secret knowledge from their history and that they have used this knowledge for their own cultures benefit at the expense of the rest of humanity.  The belief that Jews are chosen by God is a detrimental belief, as it puts them above all others in their belief system.  </p>

<p>In general, this creates resentment and hostility.  It has through history.  But over the course of time, much of the secret knowledge of Judaism has leaked out into non-jewish societies.  The Order of the Golden Dawn for one, the Templars for another.  So, because this knowledge that was originally safeguarded by the Jewish people became a method for elite secret society control, there is more resentment from those that have gotten deep into those belief systems.</p>

<p>But still, all the secret knowledge of Judaism was based on the Demiurge being the whole shebang, therefore the secret societies have unintentionally fed the Demiurge of Israel.  This makes Israel more important in modern society than she would otherwise be and also leads the serious student to a place where Yahweh is the root god of a lot of systems of control.  So many people, finding the root, blame Israel and &quot;the Jews&quot;, when in fact the secret societies that sprang from that liberated knowledge are not uniform in culture or race.  They are pretty uniform in class, but that&#39;s a result of utilizing the secret knowledge.</p>

<p>But the real fucker at the root of the game is Thoth.  So the real root is a now defunct Egyptian empire.  Thoth turned the Cathara Grid to the Kabbalah grid, which based on deliberate omissions is more of a way to garner power-over based on secret knowledge rather than a liberatory, spiritually empowering understanding of the universe in macro and micro.</p>

<p>So, I don&#39;t blame the Jews.  Plus, I believe that since many of the elite have been using the wrong universal template, that they are very close to collapse.  A broken system of magic is about to be replaced.  The new power is going to be power-with.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No race is better than any other race. No one is inherently evil. Perhaps it is that some Jewish people think they are superior because they believe they are gods chosen people, so they have no respect for anyone else. This lack of respect causes non Jewish people to take note of the complete disregard of human life and rampant racism by some of these Jews towards other races like Arabs. Then this legitimate criticism is labeled as anti semitism because it is easier to label someone a racist than argue the merits of their bad policies. I speak out against any country that has bad policy and disregard for any life. Especially my own country.</p>

<p>Do you regularly oppress, or condone oppression of people based on a divine commandment?

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you could educate me a little .  Not religious, but I&#39;ve read bits and pieces and the impression that the talmud is similar to the old testament and to take it&#39;s instruction literally would be pretty barbaric but the torah and new testament are less primitive.</p>

<p>Even this interaction right now...it&#39;s is a bit much. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve done anything to deserve have you attack me for being a shill and I honestly think your combative diplomacy can be explained by me being Jewish and you being racist.</p>
