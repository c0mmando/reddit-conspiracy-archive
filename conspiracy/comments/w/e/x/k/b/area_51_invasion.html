    <div class="md"><p>Well you want to attempt to invade government facility by force, which for miles around it is monitored so they will know that you are coming, which is also no doubt guarded by the military.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but I would want to do that with hundreds of thousands of people. Like seriously just have everyone who wants disclosure come up there and do this. Also we could be supported by like Media to make things harder for them. And lastly I want to ask why would a government try to keep secrets from it&#39;s population, I see no reason and as far as I am concerned the government should work for the public and thus expose ALL their projects since we are all affected in some way by them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be in vain, a direct assault on a military compound without military strength backing you up, is akin to suicide.</p>

<p>On the other hand, getting enough U.S. Citizens to voice their concerns on military black budgets, state secrets, etc etc. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the government should be about keeping secrets, because it breeds distrust. If ALL governments took an open info approach, and worked with people, we would be in a whole new age of humanity, instead of stunted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I figured that and the fact that they could just let us in an move everything to make a big fool of us.

    <div class="md"><p>... Live Mainstream media wouldn&#39;t show up, it&#39;s a taboo to televise anything that contradicts the official vetted stories they have been handed. A few live stream bloggers is about as good as you would get. Then there is the actual idea of people showing up to something like this, I some how doubt that 80 million americans believe in UFOs, maybe they believe in the mathmatical probability that there is other life in the universe, not specifically in UFOs. Again, this is a milatary facility, armed guards, surveilance, barbed wire fences, artillery, you name it. They don&#39;t do tours, they don&#39;t let the press in, they don&#39;t let people look through the fences. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t take too much offense to this, but where have you been living for the last 5 years? America is in so much more turmoil over the economy, the dollar is weak, banksters have been manipulating rates to make a huge amount of profits on nonexistant money, and you think people will organize and overthrow a military base for a chance at seeing a UFO, or something else of extraterrestrial origin?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m Italian. I can see it would be hard to get so many people there. But I am sure that I could get around 100/200 k believers to show up with some non so popular media coverage. I think that would suffice personally. If they shoot at us it will only mean that there is something there that we don&#39;t need to know and that thus is constitutionally illegal. I also think this could bring hope to humanity and arise it spiritually. Lastly, consider this would only be a first step of taking back our planet in our own hands. It will not be easy, and that&#39;s for sure, but we need to do this if we don&#39;t want to end up badly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Military compounds aren&#39;t like a library or other public buildings, where you can approach with a mob of people safely. Something like this, you had better bet that they will have sights lined up before you get within 100yards. A large group of people even in a motorcade convoy would be intimidating for soldiers to see approaching, all it would take would be a few agent provacateurs, and they would have enough cause to waste the entire group. It would be seen as an act of rebellion even without provacateurs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They could have infiltrator and have them provoke the &quot;war&quot;. I figured that, but I&#39;m pretty sure that if we approach their border and just sit down in front of it would be ok. If somebody provokes then they can get arrested. The rest will peacefully occupy that territory outside of the compound. We will then try to negotiate something to have at least a few people inside or something. Also I want to point out that whatever project they are working on is property of the american people who have payed for it, so I am pretty sure that we have all the rights necessary to go in and have a look.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>... Because it is government funded doesn&#39;t mean that just because you pay taxes, you have a right to it. That is like saying because you pay taxes, you should get to fly a fighter jet. </p>

<p>It is Military. It is above civilian clearance. Area 51 probably doesn&#39;t hold anything alien anymore anyways, it has probably been relocated to a deep bunker, probably under the mountains in south dakota. </p>

<p>If aliens exist, and the government is holding out, it is obvious why. Because Aliens would prove most every religion wrong. The techs they could introduce would change the entire world, but currently, the only techs being released as viable, are the techs that corporations can make bank on. </p>

I know what would happen to religions and to a big part of religious people, but I personally think this is included in the natural selection thing and thus needed for the rest to evolve.

<p>Here&#39;s something to try. Since you&#39;re so optimistic that you could rally hundreds of thousands of people and somehow overcome the military grade defenses I&#39;m sure would be awaiting you, how about you start smaller. Say 100 people. Plan an event, any event, that pulls even 100 people and I&#39;d be impressed. Now once you see how hard it is to get people to come to something normal, try imagining how much harder it is when you&#39;d have to find people who don&#39;t care that they&#39;d be ruining their lives by getting arrested, or worse, just to make it to the walls of some buildings that would require keys, cards and other security methods to enter.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, this is not a plan. It&#39;s an idea. An idea of disclosure from our governments. I think it&#39;s a step humanity has to take if you want to get any type of disclosure. Maybe getting hundreds of thousands of people to Area 51 is optimistic, but I think that with the internet and some proper advertisement it would be possible? Why not try? Besides I would like to point out what whatever they are doing there is actually ours, since WE the people payed for it. Also the soldiers work for us as well since it is us the ta payers that give them their salary. </p>

Also, yes we are paying their services and we are also paying for whatever project they are doing. If for example they are building a new aircraft, they will do it with our money, so if I spend money on something I will have full rights on it. Simple as that.</p>
