    <div class="md"><p>Scopolamine is an anticholinergic drug used in a transdermal patch to treat motion sickness. It is not exotic or rare and thousands+ of Americans use it every day. In higher doses it induces a state of delirium. I suppose that you&#39;re more susceptible to suggestion. Maybe you lose your inhibitions. But it&#39;s not a mind control drug. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly this. Inducing anticholergenic delirium is NOT going to enable you to mind control someone. That is simply absurd. Hell, if you really want to, you can see first hand what this drug would do in significant doses by taking a whole bunch of Benadryl. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it, but it (probably) won&#39;t kill you and will probably thoroughly convince you that it could not be used for mind control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As the kind gentleman above me said taking 300-600 mg of diphenhydramine will induce incredibly unpleasant hallucinations. From a medical standpoint we typically differentiate the hallucinations from this high dose of diphenhydramine from other hallucinogenic drugs by calling it delirium. Your brain is just so overloaded from the anticholingeric input that nothing is making sense. </p>

<p>It is something kids in high school do when looking for a shitty high. It is not going to mind control anybody.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To elaborate, a state of anticholergenic delirium can roughly be described as a kind of waking-dream state where the subject experiences full hallucinations (that is, hallucinations that are entirely independent of sensory input. Other hallucinogenic drugs primarily amplify and distort sensory input) that they are incapable of differentiating from actual sensory experiences. The entire experience will be largely dream-like in that it is often incoherent and draws upon seemingly random bits of stored information. The most common and consistent hallucination is that of people. Subjects can have full conversations with a hallucinated person and largely interact with them as if they were real. It would probably be easy to take advantage of someone in this state, but there is no way it could be used for meaningful &quot;mind-control&quot;. To think otherwise is to blatantly deny reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re being downvoted. While there are stories of people being coerced into doing strange things while on scopolamine, it would be horribly ineffective as a mind control mechanism for something like that. Frankly, MKUltra is probably one of the more reasonable theories than scopolamine. </p>

It is documented and not a myth that mothers in one South American country tell their kids not lie under a certain tree that produces the drug. When you look up data on this tree, multiple sources confirm the effects.  There was some documented police report where a mother had been drugged and her child taken. Other reports where someone was drugged and his housekeeper reported that the guy had simply given his valuables to the perps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The James-Town Weed (which resembles the Thorny Apple of Peru, and I take to be the plant so call&#39;d) is supposed to be one of the greatest coolers in the world. This being an early plant, was gather&#39;d very young for a boil&#39;d salad, by some of the soldiers sent thither to quell the rebellion of Bacon (1676); and some of them ate plentifully of it, the effect of which was a very pleasant comedy, for they turned natural fools upon it for several days: one would blow up a feather in the air; another would dart straws at it with much fury; and another, stark naked, was sitting up in a corner like a monkey, grinning and making mows [grimaces] at them; a fourth would fondly kiss and paw his companions, and sneer in their faces with a countenance more antic than any in a Dutch droll.</p>

<p>In this frantic condition they were confined, lest they should, in their folly, destroy themselves — though it was observed that all their actions were full of innocence and good nature. Indeed, they were not very cleanly; for they would have wallowed in their own excrements, if they had not been prevented. A thousand such simple tricks they played, and after eleven days returned themselves again, not remembering anything that had passed. – The History and Present State of Virginia, 1705</p>
