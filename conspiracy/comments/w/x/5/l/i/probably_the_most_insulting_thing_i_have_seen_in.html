        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;I work in the Senate, so this is a throwaway account to protect my identity and job. The shortest answer is this: The vast majority of people who contact their elected representatives are raging idiots. I&#39;ve been to townhall meetings where people shout at the Senator, rant and rave about this and that. I&#39;ve answered constituent mail... 90% of it is garbage. Form letters, petitions is half of it... another load is ranting from crazy people. Calling us communists, ranting about the President, totally uninformed whacko garbage. It&#39;s gotten worse with email... most emails are just all caps, no punctuation rants. And then there&#39;s always the conspiracy stuff... FBI is reading my mind, etc. That said- there are many well written and informed constituent letters. And they all get read and get a response. But when one person writes about an issue, it&#39;s a drop in the bucket of crazy. Things still get done though, there have been cases where constituents brought to the attention of us things we didn&#39;t know, and we made policy decisions based on that. Organization and numbers helps. Form letters are ignored, I recycle them immediately. But take the SOPA/PIPA debate. Thousands of informed people wrote about their concerns. The letters were well written, polite, informative, and short. There were so many we&#39;re still answering them. So it can make a difference, but form letters and crazy ranting make it hard to stand out. I choose to believe the smart people are too busy/disinterested to write. The other option is to accept that most Americans are crazy uninformed lunatics. And yes, we do listen to lobbyists and advocacy groups. Why? It&#39;s not because they meet with us in a dark room and promise us money. It&#39;s because lobbyists are also policy experts who know their shit. Yes, I did pay attention when the nurses lobbying group came in. Why? Because they showed me studies from the New England Journal of Medicine supporting their position, they highlighted a specific piece of legislation, and they showed me where it has worked in the past. They made a compelling case. The average citizen can&#39;t seem to form a correct sentence. I&#39;m sure this will be buried, but that&#39;s the truth nobody can ever admit on Capitol Hill. And it&#39;s an unpleasant truth, but it&#39;s the truth. It falls on you, the citizen, to change it. edit: a word&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/wvimu/why_dont_my_elected_representatives_listen_ill/">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/wvimu/why_dont_my_elected_representatives_listen_ill/</a></p>

<p>I find it truly mind-blowing that somebody who works on behalf of the people, and being paid by taxpayer money, would have the nerve to refer to any part of their constituency as &quot;raging idiots&quot; and &quot;crazy people,&quot; and that &quot;The average citizen can&#39;t seem to form a correct sentence.&quot; This is the attitude that we don&#39;t see when the incumbent comes to your city to beg for your vote. This is the attitude we never hear about when the challenger says he/she is on your side and has your interests at heart. Sure, believe the lobbyists or the unions when they give the politician all the right information to make their case and nothing that would hurt it. These people, the lobbyists, union reps, and special interest groups are being PAID to do this. It is their JOB to persuade (or in many cases, outright lie and bribe) the politicians into supporting them. Are they really policy experts? Well they must be if it&#39;s their job right? Sure. So my question is who is getting paid to represent the interests of the people? Shouldn&#39;t it be the government itself? Of the people by the people? Well, apparently not. There you have it folks, an admission of how corrupt the government is by its own nature. The fact that YOU the constituent are not taken seriously, but these professional rhetoricians are is proof enough. </p>

<p>I suppose all of these &quot;raging idiots&quot; have no right to be angry? I suppose that they have nothing better to do than to write &quot;garbage&quot; to their senators and representatives. Yes, that&#39;s right folks. The truth is you don&#39;t matter, unless you have enough money as a corporate lobbyist, have enough votes in your union, or have enough of both in your special interest group. If such is not the case, you are just another &quot;drop in the bucket of crazy.&quot; </p>

<p>So if you have an opinion, watch out because you might be &quot;uninformed&quot; according to whoever is in charge over there. You might also be crazy and stupid to these people, regardless of what you have to say. The truth is, you are too broke and unimportant to make a change. And THAT, is why this government is all fucked up. But keep paying your taxes! These people that insult and ignore us need to paid!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for starters, nowhere close to a majority of constituents writes their representative.  next, no one should expect a congressman to follow the advice of the letters he gets, even ignoring what outside interests might influence him.  they were elected on the prevailing ideology of the voters in their district based on what they said they said they would do and how they said they would vote.  finally, this is more about how staffers handle incoming mail, not necessarily the actual representative.  i cant imagine too much of the incoming mail from the people actually hits his desk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good thing &quot;I think you&#39;re stupid&quot; is just your opinion, but I&#39;m glad you can entertain yourself. I think you are either angry and speaking irrationally, or you lack a lot of understanding. Average Americans are ignorant to what&#39;s going on. Our education system is shit, doesn&#39;t teach to think for oneself. That&#39;s a &quot;conspiracy&quot; in and of itself. Media is fucked. Many politicians are paid to say and think a certain way. People think that their vote won&#39;t make a difference because they really don&#39;t know any better. There are a lot of nut bags out there and even if &quot;intelligent&quot; and &quot;with it&quot; people call in angry and ranting, they won&#39;t be taken seriously either.

    <div class="md"><p>What?</p>

<p>I know the system is corrupt, I was just ranting over the fact that this paige or intern or whatever would have the nerve to insult the people paying his/her paychecks with that tone of arrogance. People who write to their representatives may lack the appropriate social skills or maybe the language skills to communicate effectively, but they care and are trying to make a change. They should not be discounted as loons or idiots. They are citizens and everybody has the right to have their opinions and their intelligence respected. The most hypocritical part is that the culture of corruption in DC think they know what&#39;s best, regardless of what we have to say.</p>

<p>I have a very good friend who was born and raised in the Philly area. He is a good man and volunteers at youth counseling and charity foundations. We have had many conversations about what is going on and the backwardness of the system. He tells me that his biggest problem is trying to communicate his ideas in a way that reaches people. He doesn&#39;t have a great vocabulary, he&#39;s spent most of his life speaking in slang and he didn&#39;t go to a particularly great school. Also remember that a large group of Americans are in similar situations, so they are disadvantaged when they have to speak to politicians. Ironically, these are the same people that receive the brunt of failed economic policy and broken promises. These are the people who feel disenfranchised and abandoned by our government. This is why they often times choose not to be a part of our system of government- they know they are being ignored and looked down upon.</p>

<p>Sir, I am not a communist. I am also not a socialist. If you look at my comments you can see that I defend capitalism, although not the form we have now. </p>

<p>I&#39;m an anarchist for this very reason. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Writing words on a piece of paper isn&#39;t going to change this truism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, we have a Constitutional Republic. The key word is constitution, and the people are supposed to share absolute power. The laws enacted in out judicial and legislative system are designed to protect the minority from the majority, but not empower the minority over the majority.</p>

<p>These people forget who they work for. They work for us, they are our public servants. When they forget that, we have to keep them in line by booting their asses out of office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so your two points are that we&#39;re a republic more than a democracy and that the politicians work for us. I learned all that in school just the same as you. Now that we&#39;re in the real world though, what evidence do you have to support these two claims?</p>

<p>My point is that our current government is not what we were taught it was supposed to be. The piece of paper with words on it (i.e. the Constitution) didn&#39;t stop them from changing things as everyone expected it would. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>?</p>

<p>I know the government is corrupt. I&#39;m asking why people see the disparity between what we were told and what is going on but do nothing about it. A republic is based on laws. The constitution isn&#39;t just words on a paper, it&#39;s the base of power for the people. It represents a line in the sand between the gov and the people. We know that if the government attempts to take away our rights by infringing on the constitution, they no longer work in our interests. We have a system that has been built up around our actual government that has perverted it with bribery, coercion, and absolute control over money, public opinion, and information. This isn&#39;t government, it&#39;s an oligarchy. </p>

<p>You say you&#39;re an anarchist, are you prepared to back your rights with force? You&#39;re right, a document itself can do nothing to protect you, but are you going to fight to preserve your rights? Even if it means using violence?</p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering that as well. Why haven&#39;t you done anything? I haven&#39;t because I&#39;m afraid of getting hurt and/or thrown in jail.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The constitution isn&#39;t just words on a paper, it&#39;s the base of power for the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this is true, then again why haven&#39;t people used this power to achieve their goals? You&#39;ve already acknowledged the real power is from violence (or threat of violence).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say you&#39;re an anarchist, are you prepared to back your rights with force?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. However I recognize that the deck is stacked against me at the moment. The evil and corruption I see makes me believe that it will all collapse soon, at which point I will have a better chance of success. I have no reason to slow down the car heading towards the cliff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not the government recognizes the constitution is based on what the people are willing to fight for. The methods of dividing and distracting the people has worked, as well as instilling apathy and disenfranchising parts of the population. Also those who would enable us, the judges and the politicians, are bought. Maybe the greatest accomplishment of the Obama regime is how many they have coerced and forced into dependency to the system.</p>

<p>I have done something. I&#39;ve been spreading the truth to as many as I know. That&#39;s all that can be done right now, let them draw first blood. This is a battle for public opinion. If the people are not receptive to the NWO, they will either have force it on us through violence and coercion or delay it even more. The latter, for whatever reason, is not happening, but the former would be disastrous to the establishment if the people remain armed and have a combative attitude towards domination. The preference is docility and compliance, not fascism. They know that if they break from the game, the jig is up and they need to have control over all of the variables if they are going to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, like you said the deck is stacked against us. The establishment have the benefit of military and LE. When it comes time where the citizen has no choice, it would be beneficial to have more people on your side than you had yesterday or last year. Just the threat of a dissident population is enough. I&#39;m not in the habit of trying to save people for purely altruistic reasons, those people would probably be useless to me anyway.</p>
