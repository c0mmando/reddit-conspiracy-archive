If I were to commit this crime, I would have done it a helluva lot more efficiently.  I would have made pipe bombs for the mass of people.  I would have chose a different theater.  </p>

And also this isn&#39;t the first time there has been a shooting or a shoot-out in that area.  You bring up some good points and they&#39;re points i&#39;ve been thinking of since yesterday.  why does it all seem so convenient and simple for the police to wrap up?  i guess also iv&#39;e been bothered by this because i can&#39;t tell you how many times i&#39;ve been to that theatre( i used to work in aurora and still have family that live there)</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying that many cops would have come quickly and he, for some reason, wouldn&#39;t have killed any of them.  But maybe if the police station was further away he would have?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t  kill any of them.  The fact that he chose that theater shows stupidity, because logistically it&#39;s a terrible location in terms of escape...unless he had no intention of escaping.

    <div class="md"><p>According to what Ive been reading-Holmes was just a shitty person. Complete megalomaniac and sociopath. I am sure he just wanted to have his name recorded in history. How he got into Med School I am unsure.. Also it is weird that he was working on a PhD in Med school... Thats the part of the story that strikes me. (MTV Claimed the med school/ PhD thing).. Also the comments about being a quiet shy/guy don&#39;t fly with direct statements by family saying he was a manipulative asshole who would even claim people abused him if he didn&#39;t get his way. His family was begging the state to take the worthless shit while he was under 18.</p>

<p>Bet he lied his way into school and was failing-hence the drop out and attack. Had to feed the ego.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there&#39;s lots of illogical shit they are reporting.  Why would you take the effort to rig your apartment, and then tell the police about it? Why would you be so methodical and chose such a shitty location, just down the street from the police station?  Why would you not use explosives on the crowd?  A a few pipe bombs would have killed many more people.  It just so happens all of this occurs a mile away from a military base with top secret facilities.  Also why would you just stand there and surrender?  If he ends up dying while in custody, I&#39;d be pretty confident he was a patsy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was an asshole before he moved to Aurora btw :P Aurora is also a cheaper subburb of Denver if I understand correctly, makes sense for students to setup shop there. As for the rest: Doesn&#39;t matter. If the objective is to be famous for all time then to be caught easily and go through a public trial is the way to go. Initially he was even trying to manipulate people by saying it happened cause he played violent video games.
IMO the political parties are all using the event of a complete asshole (he isnt crazy, but he def is sociopathic) to further agendas.</p>

<p>Edit to add: Explosives would def bring a terrorism charge. I think this shithead wants to try and game the system and claim that he was abused so bad and broke under the stress of school in an effort to get off on the charges. He wants it public and messy. Also, given he seems to be a control freak-explosives would have been dangerous to employ in a closed area as he obviously wanted to be taken alive.</p>
