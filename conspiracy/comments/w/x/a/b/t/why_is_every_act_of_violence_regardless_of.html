       Be it the Tehriki-Taliban setting off a bomb in Lahore or a "falling down" type suburban mass shooter, there is always someone in the conspiracy movement screaming FALSEFLAG like others post "first".  If you guys are such free thinkers, why is this so predictable.  Even assuming false flag operations were something that happened all the time, it doesnt chage the fact that there are a metric fuckton of people just unstable enough to take 20 people with them when they decide to end it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this kind of behavior not looked down on here?  There are a lot of claims about you guys being the "real skeptics" but hang around here for longer than a day and you realize these threads are more about circlejerk conspiracy time than actually asking questions and checking facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have respect for some of the members here because some of you have the same thirst for information as I do but by in large I run into people who are into conspiracy because "blame it on the NWO" is easier to learn than all the ins ands outs of regional geopolitics.

       Once you realize that some operations are false flags, all operations have that possibility. It is difficult to differentiate between actual operations and random violence, because random violence might be terrorism. You question some things and then you question every little thing. You get paranoid. You get plied with misinformation. You get attacked for your beliefs. You see patterns in noise. You see patterns that are there to see. It is not easy when you have the resourses of a state to play the intelligence game. As an individual, it is almost impossible.

       Is seems to me that Conspiracy theorists really only question the commonly accepted or perceived reality, but never the idea that their own alternative view of reality is only perceived. If your really searching for the truth, don't you need to do both?

       You fall into the trap of posing your own suggestion that other people are unquestioning as itself a black and white truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of people who weigh very carefully what they read from all sources and attempt to rationalise things for example the fact that the universe is underpinned by numerolgy in its purest form: pi, golden ratio, geometery means certain things will occur naturally. If you build a circular building it will encode vast arrays of mathematical data implicitly. However if you look at the great pyramind of Giza that encodes mathematical ratios on many many levels and astrological alignments and true north then making it all out to be conincidence becomes increasingly tortuous.

       I agree with all this. I would like to add that the government brought this onto themselves. If we had a transparent government that never did false flags, then we'd never accuse them of any of this. It's because we have such a corrupt and secretive government that we must always jump at shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO if people are not suspicious, then they don't have a clue at the power or history of the government.

       I don't consider myself paranoid. I consider myself paying attention.
If conspiracy theorists are "paranoid", so was Woodrow Wilson in 1913:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         "Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men’s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the Field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.”
        </em>

       Could it be argued though that ironically as it may sound to say, It is our freedoms and relatively peacful and stable life that allows us the opportunity to question our own government without reprisals.

       Until that right is completely taken away, yes.  Every free country has the right to question their government and call them out on corruption without consequences such as being sent to a prison or getting on a no-fly list.
      </p>
      <p>
       We still ended up with the Patriot Act and NDAA and new bills popping up like ACTA so it's obvious that they are trying to take more rights away.

       I agree with that. It's the nature of our country that allows us the luxury to expect more. We just have to look at North Korea to see a stark comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thing though, the US wouldn't have been much of a success without these things in place at all. IMO the reason the US is declining in power and prestige is because we're betraying all these founding principles of transparency, individualism and fairness.

       So you're saying because a majority of incidents statistically can't be false flags that means non are? I guess because the Christian God is a lie that mean God doesn't exist as well? Not mad just trying to get a handle on what you meant.

       What I'm saying is simple. There are people who look at the news and see signs from God. They see prophecy. Or they see government propaganda and disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these people assume their preferred conclusions before gathering any evidence. They only focus on facts that may support their ideas. And they violently reject the facts that contradict them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are more concerned with being first than being correct. They are more concerned with how many people believe them than the truth of their claims. They employ tactics of fear mongering and heavy doses of speculation to promote their own agenda. And they always have some sort of self important agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       A real skeptic is patient and willing to allow the evidence to shape his conclusions. Not the other way around.
      </p>

       Irrelevant. There is none in this case.

      <p>
       To assume a conclusion without evidence is just wild speculation. The real question is why would anyone be willing make such a leap?

       Pretty sure he understands the meaning. What he is pointing out is how every event is now labelled a false flag. There is no reason to support this. There rarely is. It is like everybody thinks Operation Northwoods is run multiple times a year.

       because you cant prove a negative, so if some ever come out to be actual false flags, everyone can be like LOOK I TOLD YOU GUYS, without risking being proven wrong all the other times.

       too much blind acceptance going on in this country, brought about in part by exploitation of peoples' trust in the media. See also here:

       These people have been given hearsay and media reinforcement as proof of the death of the most sought-after villain of the past 10+ years. Whatever 'evidence' we were given was horribly fake and not intended to be looked at with scrutiny. Because scrutiny is largely dead among the masses.

       People don't know either way and are free to post whatever they want.  Talking about the possibility is better than dead silence or just sitting around and saying "oh that's a sad situation" without trying to analyze it whatsoever.

       Sure there are the lazy ones that will always say it was the Illuminati or satanists and move on but you can ignore stuff like that.

      <p>
       Somehow it offended you to the point where you had to make an entire post about it but all that does is show that your mindset is different than that of others which is the same level of maturity as the people you're attacking.  You just need to get over that some people will always say that it's the Illuminati or some shit like that.  There are plenty of trolls that deliberately try to make this place look bad too.

       I totally agree with you and in other posts have asked why is it that some of the people here think that just about EVERYTHING is a conspiracy in some form or another. Sometimes bad thing happen for no other reason than they are commited by bad people. But we really need to stat not only crying wolf everytime somethnigbad happens, but we need to stat looking at the world with a bit more rational thought. Do i belive that the goverment is doing things that are bad. yes. Do i belive that there are sme big time corruption and coverups? Yes. Do i thinkthat everytime a politician sneezes or does something its because they are out to enslave all of us? No. Do I think that the Aurora shooting was a set up? No. Lets at least wait for the bodies to be identified and the investigations happen before we start screaming things like False Flag or cover up ok?

       No offence meant but I've noticed you calling people out on this before. Not saying you are wrong or anything but people can have an opinion that is wrong in yours or most others opinion and not be a shill or purposefully muddying waters.  There are all types of personalities and different motivations and even face to face it is difficult to size people up and so doing it without the benefit of body language is difficult to say the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found OP's tone and  method of enquiry reasonable and people should be able to ask these questions without being accused of something on a hunch , don't you think?

        "Be it the Tehriki-Taliban setting off a bomb in Lahore or a "falling down" type suburban mass shooter, there is always someone in the conspiracy movement screaming FALSEFLAG like others post "first".

      </p>
      <p>
       So anytime someone says "falseflag" you want them to associate it with the idiocy and pointlessness of a person posting "first", based on what?  This sounds like an emotional ploy to manipulate a person's perspective into supporting whatever your main point is, instead of you having a real argument that is worthy of listening to.
       <br/>
       Lets read on to find out.

       <em>
        "If you guys are such free thinkers, why is this so predictable."
       </em>
       <br/>
       These are not mutually exclusive concepts, your questioning statement is invalid.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Even assuming false flag operations were something that happened all the time, it doesnt chage the fact that there are a metric fuckton of people just unstable enough to take 20 people with them when they decide to end it. Why is this kind of behavior not looked down on here?"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if we go ahead to assume that FFO's are frequent, you're asserting that by virtue of there being the opportunity for any common person to attempt such an 'attack' would somehow invalidate the reality that a government entity could be involved?
       <br/>
       Again, your assumptions are baseless and disconnected, so of course, yes, we do look down on your incompleteness here.

        There are a lot of claims about you guys being the "real skeptics" but hang around here for longer than a day and you realize these threads are more about circlejerk conspiracy time than actually asking questions and checking facts."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you sound more like an uninformed fool, or a government misinformation tool.   You call into question a communities ability to be subjectively skeptic, yet you provide no examples to back your wild and grand claims, this is a pattern for you.
       <br/>
       Using buzzwords like "regional geopolitics", "taliban", "falling down", "circlejerk" and "conspiracy time" in an attempt to make the community look foolish, serves to illuminate your own ineptitude in regards to being able to form a coherent opinion on the state of the users here on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "I have respect for some of the members here because some of you have the same thirst for information as I do but by in large I run into people who are into conspiracy because "blame it on the NWO" is easier to learn than all the ins ands outs of regional geopolitics."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is another example of your attempts to confuse the issue by acting as though the concept "thirst for information" transposed with a person who would be "into conspiracy" or could "blame it on the NWO", are, again mutually exclusive concepts.
       <br/>
       Claiming you have respect for some of the community here is a farce, you're not showing it with your half baked rhetoric of "all conspiracies are wrong" and your other F.U.D. attempts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the off chance that you're simply misguided, perhaps this can illuminate why people
       <strong>
        consider
       </strong>
       theories about attempts by the government (or non-government entities such as the CIA) to perform FFO's as a means to political gain.

       You do have a point , but I am not sure people are taking it too seriously at the moment.  Conspiracy people can tend to feel like amateur MI5 spies , always looking to peel away the layers and get to the truth.  So naturally mostly or often discount official versions of events.

       No. I didn't. I said that someone who automatically attributes an outlandish explanation (i.e conspiracy) to ANY occurrence is mentally ill. Are there some conspiracies? probably. is everything happening IS a conspiracy - absolutely not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, If you tell me this r/conspiracy is about creative thinking, playing the devil's advocate or analyzing what-if scenarios then I think it's great and interesting. but if unproved theories here are treated as absolute truths - then yes, mental illness all the way.

      <p>
       with a statement like this its hard to take you seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       you're attempting to demonize the practice of being cautious when assessing a situation, such that if a person considers that an event may have been planned (a.k.a. conspired), then clearly they have a "mental illness"
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not about devil's advocate, perhaps occam's razor as of late has tended to indicate The State as being the defacto (default) perpetrator of so called "terrorism", but that would be if you're open minded to the possibility that somewhere, people in power are talking (conspiring), to DO THINGS in relation to expanding their power.
      </p>
      <p>
       in this case, gun laws, anti video game legislation, promoting F.U.D.
      </p>
      <p>
       so yes, it is rational to consider that a government who routinely creates False Flag ops, would continue to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       but hey, we arent all rational people here, so i accept your flawed views for what they are.

       I agree with all this. I would like to add that the government brought this onto themselves. If we had a transparent government that never did false flags, then we'd never accuse them of any of this. It's because we have such a corrupt and secretive government that we must always jump at shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO if people are not suspicious, then they don't have a clue at the power or history of the government.

       Is seems to me that Conspiracy theorists really only question the commonly accepted or perceived reality, but never the idea that their own alternative view of reality is only perceived. If your really searching for the truth, don't you need to do both?
