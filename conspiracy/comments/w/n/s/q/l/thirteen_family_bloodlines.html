       Astor family
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        John Jacob Astor and his brother George (b. Walldorf/Heidelberg 28 April 1752; d. London December 1813), known as 'George &amp; John Astor', were flute makers, who came to England c. 1778 from Walldorf, Germany. In 1783, John Jacob left for Baltimore, Maryland, and was active first as a dealer in woodwind instruments, then in New York as a merchant in furs, pianos and real estate. After moving to New York, Astor met and married Sarah Todd.[1]
Another brother, Henry Astor also emigrated to America. He was a horse racing enthusiast, and purchased a thoroughbred named Messenger, who had been brought from England to America in 1788. The horse became the founding sire of all Standardbred horses in the United States today.
During the 19th century, the Astors became one of the wealthiest families in the United States. Toward the end of that century, some of the family moved to Britain and achieved great prominence there. During the 20th century, the number of American Astors began to decline, but their legacy lives on in their many public works including the New York Public Library. In fact, the family remains the seventeenth wealthiest family in history.[citation needed] By marrying into two British noble families[citation needed], British descendants of the Astors hold two hereditary peerages: a viscountcy and a barony.

       Du Pont family
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The Du Pont family is an American family descended from Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours (1739–1817). The son of a Paris watchmaker and a member of a Burgundian Huguenot family, and descendant of a minor noble family on his mother's side, he and his sons, Victor Marie du Pont and Eleuthère Irénée du Pont, emigrated to the United States in 1800 and used the resources of their Huguenot heritage to found one of the most prominent of American families, and one of its most successful corporations, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, initially established by Eleuthère Irénée as a gunpowder manufacturer. Various members of the family managed the company well into the twentieth century and to this day family trusts constitute a substantial portion of the company's ownership. This and other companies run by the du Pont family employ some five to ten percent of Delaware's population. The family also played a very large part in politics during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and were responsible for the idea of the Louisiana purchase. During the 19th century, the Du Pont family maintained their family wealth by carefully arranged marriages between first cousins[1] which, at the time, was the norm for many rich families.

       A primary purpose of sinking the Titanic was to take down the Astors since they were an obstacle in forming the Fed. The US Federal Reserve system was formed the next year. Seems as if infighting occurs between the elites from time to time.

       What's the suggested mechanism by which these 13 bloodlines have allegedly communicated and enforced their will down through each generation?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if my great-great-great grandfather had left instructions for me to follow some particular plan, there's nothing to say that I would follow it, and why should I?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the descendants of these "bloodlines" be any different?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a general question by the way - I've never seen anyone discuss this aspect of it before, so would be interested in any intelligent replies.

       I think they might stand to gain a lot if they follow the instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine being born into a family and religion where you are the king if you follow then rules and nothing if you don't.  That alone would ensure that most would follow.  Easy enough to take care of the rest. JFK

       I doubt it would be "nothing if you don't", since these people are likely quite adept at hiding away money. And are you implying that the rest are

       Oh look at what research brought in... Not only does it happen, it is actually encouraged:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Pseudonyms are also used to comply with the rules of performing arts guilds (Screen Actors Guild (SAG), Writers Guild of America, East (WGA), AFTRA, etc.), which do not allow performers to use an existing name, in order to avoid confusion. For example, these rules required film and television actor Michael Fox to add a middle initial and become Michael J. Fox, to avoid being confused with another actor named Michael Fox. This was also true of author and actress Fannie Flagg, who chose this pseudonym; her real name, Patricia Neal, being the name of another well-known actress, and British actor Stewart Granger, whose real name was James Stewart."

       Here is more:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Another action star by the name of Tom Cruise sort of goes by his real name. Tom Cruise used the same method as Angelina Jolie. Cruise dropped his last name and uses his first and middle name. Tom Cruise's given name is actually Thomas Cruise Mapother IV.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also very common for rappers to use a different name other than their given name. After all Trevor Smith doesn't really sound like a good name for a rapper. That is why Trevor Smith goes by the name Busta Rhymes. Most people know by now that 50 Cent's real name is also Curtis Jackson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plenty of other musicians don't use their real names either. Alicia Keyes is not really Alicia Keyes. Alicia Keyes is really Alicia Augello Cook. Barry Manilow isn't really Barry Manilow. Barry Manilow was actually named Barry Alan Pincus. Even Bob Dylan and Elton John didn't use their real names. Bob Dylan and Elton John were born Robert Allen Zimmerman and Reginald Kenneth Dwight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using fake names isn't a new trend though. Celebrities have been using fake names for a long time. Many people are familiar with Cary Grant. But not many people know him by his real name, Archibald Alec Leach. Judy Garland also went by a fake name instead of her given name, Frances Gumm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using fake names has become very popular from actors like Carlos Irwin Estavez, also known as Charlie Sheen, to comedians like Scott Thompson, also known as Carrot Top and the trend to use fake names instead of their real names probably won't stop any time soon."

       Imagine being born into a family and religion where you are the king if you follow then rules and nothing if you don't.  That alone would ensure that most would follow.  Easy enough to take care of the rest. JFK
