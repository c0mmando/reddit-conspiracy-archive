       The latest edition of The Guard Experience, the National Guard’s official magazine, features a cover story titled, “The Threat at Home.”
      </p>
      <p>
       While the title itself is quite shocking, the ideas presented are seemingly meant to desensitize guard member readers to the idea of pursuing and capturing Americans on American soil.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the article, author Susan Katz Keating stakes the claim that the American people, and their military, can never let their guard(s) down due to advancing internal terrorist threats that constantly plague us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right from the git-go we know exactly what type of propaganda we’re in for. The article will attempt, through the telling of various narratives, to paint the picture that the few Americans that have orchestrated terrorist events inside the U.S. in the past are the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article introduction begins as follows: “The mission to prevent terrorism on U.S. Soil starts with al-Qaeda, but it doesn’t end there. Homegrown terrorists, hostile nations, and lone radicals present perils, too. And the methods of destruction are vast. Ask homeland security experts about the dangers, and you’ll get a range of answers. But one thing is clear: The hunt can never stop.” (emphasis Keating’s)
      </p>
      <p>
       Before reading further, the introductory excerpt tells us it’ll hold the terrorist pretext that 9/11 provided as the basis for the never-ending war against the American public. Al-Qaeda will, yet again, serve as the boogeyman by which our rights will be stripped away, in our own country no less:
      </p>
      <p>
       “And what threatens us most here at home, within our borders? A number of actors come to mind, but the primary “who” is clear, experts say. Most officials, including Sen. Susan Collins from the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, point to al-Qaeda or al-Qaeda-inspired adversaries.”
      </p>

       We have to be alert, because entire large cities in the US are populated by al-Qaeda!  For example, the city of Mohammadburka, California, which has a population of 800,000,000 Muslims all armed and carrying bombs. And that's why we need train station checkpoints where they search you after you get off. And why police need military vehicles and machine guns. And why we need 750,000 drones watching us. And indefinite detention without charge or trial. And more money for Republican Congressmen who own defense industry stocks. And more guns for National Guardsmen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, there's no need for terror attacks because we're already being terrorized by our own government.

       I work in the Coast Guard and it's a very strange middle ground between a military service and civilian law enforcement. I cant be specific, but right now I work at a unit designed to protect something important from a terror attack. When you're watching and waiting for something to happen, you need to keep your guard up, a terrorist wont walk up to you with a sign that says "terrorist", and an unfortunate reality is that I have to treat the average joe-boater as a suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that said, despite my mission, I personally think that the probability of a terror attack is very low. But it's not my call, so I do the job to the best of my ability.

       I feel bad for the National Guard. I really do.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, they were people that were here to defend the country and its borders, the most noble calling I can think of. Then, some jackass decided that defending the country involved tours in the middle east to bolster the regular ground troops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, they are going to be the internal response to any really bad emergency, and at some point, some douchebag is going to take a shot at one. After that, I fear, it's on. I don't think the Nat Guard will start thinking the US citizen is an enemy, but I think they will get there.

       You've hit the nail on the head. It's the appeal to authority logical fallacy ad infinitum, where by these individuals feel that having this silly, official-looking costume allows them the privilege to violently coerce others. Whether those "good-intentioned" officers would agree with that or not doesn't really matter. The power-trip is there, even if it lingers in the subconscious.

       All that said, despite my mission, I personally think that the probability of a terror attack is very low. But it's not my call, so I do the job to the best of my ability.
