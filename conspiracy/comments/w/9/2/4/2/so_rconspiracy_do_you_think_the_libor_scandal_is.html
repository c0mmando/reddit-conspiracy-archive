<p>If anyone ends up on charges for the LIBOR rigging, the date of their crime will over-ride the date of their departure.</p>

<p>I think it is about something further down the road, that doesn&#39;t have dated documentation that can be tied to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the confusion of an ever changing ensemble of ceo&#39;s and cfo&#39;s, along with people in other management positions will innevitably make it more difficult to track.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say if your expecting a collapse, you plunder as much as you can and ensure the collapse will be large enough to cover your tracks. If you plotted to do this, you know the scope is large, varied, and not simply orchestrated by you alone. You know that you can push it off on others for a while. It wouldn&#39;t be hard to disapear in the world really, with lots of money and given the connections you would undoubtedly have in such a position. Whats a little plastic surgery cost in india anyway?</p>

<p>Leave the rest polarized and at each others throats, tactically seperated and ready to riot, bring in the military and ensure order. Seems like the rich people might come back then, but in yet another corrupt position. </p>

<p>I know that in the states jpmorgan, boa, and probably a few others will prove guilty of this due to other recent court battles. Jp morgan has already been in the court over a matter similar to libor, USA v. Carollo. Rolling stones covered it quite well.</p>

<p>Violent, blood in the street anarchy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anarchy has nothing to do with violence/bloodshed. Anarchy is self governance. </p>

<p>It makes me sad that so many conspiracy theorists use the word anarchy negatively. You surely understand the power of giving &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; a negative connotation. What you are doing on that page is exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>Might I suggest &quot;Violent, blood in the streets revolution/insurrection/uprising/coup&quot;? </p>

<p>This is not so well kept secret under the official secrets act is used as a vehicle for certain entities to buy and sell shares anonymously along with making money from the issuance of coinage and collection of base interest rate when they act as lender of last resort e.g. quantitative easing...  </p>

<p>The question will be if the media is on side to probe and expose it. It will cause &#39;&#39;very real&#39;&#39; change in the process and also have a knock on effect to other &#39;privately owned central banks&#39; ;)</p>
