    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what reddit is. It&#39;s actually worse. There&#39;s a certain amount of social pressure, and group consensus, and potential positive reinforcement that causes a person&#39;s outward behavior to change from one form to another. What reddit is able to do is quantify just what causes the change, statistically, over time, by making comparisons between people with similar voting habits and identifying common factors which cause identical behavior variations in different people. Doing this allows these factors to be isolated and introduced to larger audiences, producing similar behavioral changes in users with similar voting profiles. This data would potentially be useful in creating links we are more likely to click, comments we are more likely to upvote, or even links which will increase the likelihood we will click a certain kind of content later. Any behavior that is correlated by statistical analysis can be engineered with our reddit votes.</p>

<p>This is basically what I meant. Those imaginary points mean that someone approves of what you are saying, and to some people approval is more desirable than anything else, so they mold their outward attitude and views to match that of what they know will earn them points (hence the circle jerk).</p>

<p>I would bet money that there are tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people who use Reddit that have radically different views or more extreme versions of their previous views than they did a year or two before they started, especially those that subscribe to many of the default subreddits (gaming, world news, politics, atheism)</p>

I couldn&#39;t give a flying fuck about what you think about what I think. I think what I think with good reason most of the time. I may seem stubborn and arrogant but that&#39;s because I won&#39;t pick a fight I know I can&#39;t win or back up, and if I&#39;m wrong or lose I&#39;ll reevaluate why I believe what I believe and alter it according to what I learned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to add something. The points aren&#39;t really meaningless. When you&#39;re awarded upvotes, it&#39;s as if the people in that thread/community are accepting you. The more upvotes you get, the more accepted you are. In reality, they do mean a lot. Social acceptance is something we desire as humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, and that&#39;s kind of my point, but more than that it&#39;s an exercise in how easy it is to manipulate a large amount of human beings to believe some pretty ridiculous things. The general attitude of Reddit in regards to politics, religion, sexism, etc etc are all on extreme ends of the spectrum from an objective standpoint. I think it just proves how simple it really is to cause things like the Nazi party rising to power or how easy it would be to manipulate large portions of the world into some pretty atrocious ideological views. </p>
