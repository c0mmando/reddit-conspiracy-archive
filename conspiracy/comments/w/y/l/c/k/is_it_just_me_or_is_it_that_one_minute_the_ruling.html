       Globalization is the biggest bullshit ever spoken, people need a sense of community, and that is achieved locally. Good faith and a reputation is achieved thorough hard work, not connections. People trusting their 401k need to realize it's being gambled with daily.

       Tons of the super wealthy are just been given money since day 1, people made rich in the 80's now have 30-40 years old that never EVER had it ''rough''. And now they are realizing they would need to work because all their money is in paper. Even the over valued assets they own will come crashing in value, now one need a micro condo for half a million in a hip town. family needs affordable houses to live in.

       Because they are not superhuman, and at the scale they are running on when you make a mistake its going to be a rather big mess. If i give 10$ to a panhandler and then find out they scammed me the repercussions are small. If a power player gives 10mill to the wrong psycho then it has a bit more effect.

       Those "mistakes" are not mistakes at all.  We have to assume that whoever the hell is pulling the strings is doing everything for a reason.  A better question would be "What is my instinct response to this?",  Then analyze how your feelings could fit into their plan.

       They are not smart at all, they are actually very stupid and child like, its just that the general public is even stupider and deliberately lied to and fed propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       the "elite" is as 14yo kids and the general public is like 10yo kids. Thing is they've got the system on their lies and when you have many people invested and so much corruption, its hard to break through.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean if the general public just grew 2 more grams of brain and got 10% more informed, we can beat them easily and remove their corrupt system. You know, break the matrix.

       The elite are not all wise, intelligent, or smart. Some may have a predatory cunning. But because they have money and power, they can hire smart people to do the hard thinking and planning for them. So many Institutes are brain trusts for the elite to aid them in their desire to rule the world.

       I really don't see them fucking up that often. Fast and furious getting exposed was terrible and they're getting held up in Syria by Russia and China but eventually I'm sure they'll overthrow Assad. I guess Iceland is one major failing for them but Greece didn't get out of the euro and Ireland voted in the right direction from their perspective so the union didn't implode.
      </p>
      <p>
       They continue to consolidate more power within Europe and even though a lot of banking corruption has been exposed there have been no repercussions that will effect how the industry runs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I see them pushing ahead on almost every front and even when they do get caught out nothing ever really changes, the agenda continues.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are ultimately degenerate psychopaths but I have a lot of respect for their intelligence and guile. You should never underestimate the many intelligent people they have in hundreds of think tanks and foundations calculating every aspect of what they do.

       I judge their competency not on their motives but on their ability to push forward their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may think the guiding ideals behind what they're doing are unbelievable or crazy but for all i know it could be true. I'm sure there is a lot of information within secret societies that a layman can't fathom but is actually based in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah sometimes the minions act like immature idiots, take people like Hillary Clinton threatening Russia or Susan Rice walking out of UN meetings but I don't think these people are the top of the pyramid. I'm sure the higher levels are more controlled and methodical.
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally agree though that they are just chained into the system. Only the people at the top have serious power in changing the agenda, the rest just do as they're told.

       It's an insidiously easy to spread condition called being human. Look at religions through out history and you'll see that even the gods make hugely ignorant mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example in the holly bibble the judeochrislamic god says to Noah that if he'd known humanity would turn out so vile, he might not have created us. Then there's his fumble in the garden of eden where he creates a tree of knowledge of good and evil and then holds adam and eve responsible for om nom noming it's fruit even though they couldn't understand that they were doing wrong before they ate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What this shows is that even in our
       <em>
        fantasies
       </em>
       of unlimited power, humans can't imagine something without error. The people running the show, even at the top of the trapezoid aren't infallible geniuses, they're human fucking beings.

       They ain't all that.  Plus, a lot of the occult info is now out and about in the interwebs and through rebels that had been in the secret societies.  Remember also that at the tops of the pyramids they've been getting more and more inbred.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their position is dependent on the bottom and middle of the pyramid holding their asses up.  As people, especially the people nearer the top start realizing the blatant criminality of their "superiors", consent gets wthdrawn, and the whole edifice crumbles more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parasites at the top feed on our fear and create nightmares from that energy.  Overcome fear, withdraw consent, and inform yourself and others.  Build networks based on power-with rather than power-over and within a few years those inbred fuckers that worship the God of High Places will be an shameful historical anomaly.

       No theory, true. No conspiracy either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Main-stream media aren't trying to condition people by using the term 'conspiracy theory' most of the time they are simply using it as journalistically appropriate euphemism for 'stupid people believe'.
