       He had a pretty huge sum of federal grant money for his education. Also, 20,000 is a pretty ludicrous number. The AR15 rifle itself is under $1,000 retail and the armor/mask would have been much cheaper than that.

       His behavior seems odd? I'm not sure how else to describe a mass murderer. Anyone who plans the murder of that many innocent people isn't someone I'd expect to have all his shit together. He may have planned an escape or some sort of shootout initially but given up on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he planned to live on and had no intention of dying or committing suicide, it makes complete sense that he'd surrender to the police. If he shot at the cops, he'd most certainly be dead now. He had left things like "Will you visit me in prison?" on his match.com and adultfriendfinder profile so I don't think he intended to die, something that would inevitably result from a shootout with police. Nothing odd about that, we don't know anything about his motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       His current age is around the time when most people who would develop schizophrenia would begin to suffer from it. On top of that, many mass killings (that aren't black ops conspiracies) are perpetrated by disaffected persons that feel they have been wronged or haven't lived up to their perceived potential. Such as people who were divorced, fired from a job, failed to be recognized for something, etc. An unemployed grad student who has spent his whole life being praised for his outstanding academic work and getting nothing but debt in return for it is certainly expected to be under a lot of stress and is quite right to be frustrated or even angry.

       I always find it strange however that thes lone wolf schizos never seem to take DIRECT revenge for the percieved injustices comitted against them.
Its always a random act of violence comitted against completely uninvolved innocents and it usually involves children.

       Armchair psychology here, but maybe the attention they gain from a killing spree is a way of making up for the attention they did not receive in life that they feel they deserve due to being a genius or whatever

       plates are 500 each and require a license, and he was decked out in them.
and the claim is almost 20k, with what he had on him and at his apartment, that's about right.

       Was he wearing trauma plates?  So far I've not seen anything to suggest that, would love to see where that came from.

      <p>
       Side note, you're flat-out wrong on the plates requiring a license.

       To ship them OUTSIDE the US requires an export license, but the only requirement (federally) for a civilian to buy is that they not be a felon.

       Any other restrictions on sale are purely manufacturer/seller restrictions, not legal ones.

       His loan/grant money could have surpassed 20,000 and he may have maxed out several credit cards. Absence of information about how he purchased all of his equipment isn't grounds to assume he was provided with the equipment by a third party.

       Other bulletproof equipment does not require a licensing. Are you certain he was equipped with those specific ballistic plates? (which are around 200 dollars on this website)

       The neck gear/everything is legally purchasable.
      </p>
      <p>
       What claim is 20k exactly? You can find all the weapons around a price of $500-700 dollars, the tactical equipment might have come out to around $1500 or $2000, but adding all that up falls well under the 10K mark much less 20k. Unless he bought an insane amount of ammunition and chemicals/bomb making materials (he had access to a university lab, he may have stolen equipment as well) that's a really really high figure. Even if he did spend 20K it's not at all unlikely that he could have used grant money/credit cards for this. It's also suspected that he was living below his means, which might be intentional if he was planning to spend huge amounts of money on weapons.

       Also ceramics only take 1 hit albeit at lvl 4, lvl 3 armor is about 500 and can take an average 6 shots.

       and everything you just pulled out of your ass is also far fetched, to equip oneself like that and execute the operation as he did requires study and preparation, it's not something you can just decide to do one morning, you yourself went for the ceramics off the bat.

       So he premeditated it for a while? You don't think one person is capable of researching and purchasing a bulletproof vest or some tactical gear without assistance? That's ridiculous. There is no evidence that he woke up one morning and decided to kill people, evidence obtained from his home indicates to the Aurora PD that this was planned months in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not shocked a PhD student was calculated in his approach to this. I'm not completely disregarding the notion that this is black ops but the evidence just isn't there (unlike Columbine). It is completely reasonable that one person could have purchased this gear.

       A decent AR-15 rifle costs $1,000 or more all by itself. The shotgun and handgun might run another $800 total. Spare mags, sights, slings, and so on will run you at least another $1,000 across three firearms. The bullet-proof vest is easily another $800, and the cost of the bomb-making gear is anybody’s guess. With all the specialty body gear, ammunition, booby-trap devices and more, I’m guessing this is at least $20,000 in weapons and tactical gear, much of which is very difficult for civilians to get in the first place.

       The firearms would have to go through an FFL, but as I don't have a criminal record, that's an easy process.

       I don't see anything indicating that this is a restricted item and it's nowhere near $800 dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're assuming another $15k or so was spent on materials to make IEDs and extra ammunition? Where is your evidence for that? You're just speculating wildly.

       A decent AR-15 rifle costs $1,000 or more all by itself. The shotgun and handgun might run another $800 total. Spare mags, sights, slings, and so on will run you at least another $1,000 across three firearms. The bullet-proof vest is easily another $800, and the cost of the bomb-making gear is anybody’s guess. With all the specialty body gear, ammunition, booby-trap devices and more, I’m guessing this is at least $20,000 in weapons and tactical gear, much of which is very difficult for civilians to get in the first place.

       So, just want to take a sec to tally things up.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        AR15:
       </strong>
       A decent AR absolutely WILL cost upwards of 1k.  A not-so-decent AR can be had for ~$700, but since we don't know the make lets assume $1000.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Shotgun and handgun:
       </strong>
       That's probably a fairly good guess at $800.  Glocks can be picked up for $400-$500, shotguns anywhere from $150 and up.  Assuming $300 for a Mossberg 500 (as its a very common shotgun) I think $800 is probably accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Vest:
       </strong>
       Also probably accurate, though I'd also include the ballistic helmet in that price (vest are going to vary WIDELY).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Ammo:
       </strong>
       Depending on exactly what the rounds were for, this is going to vary.  Lets aim high and say he bought non-shit 5.56.  Say, 3 crates of 2000rds of Lake City.  $770 per 2k rounds, so say $2,310.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Mags, sights, and sling prices:
       </strong>
       No way in fucking hell did he pay 1k for that.  AR mags go for $20 for midrange, glock mags even less.  Assuming he got a REALLY REALLY nice sling, add another $80.  We don't know what sights he had, if any, so assume worst-case a $400 Eotech on the high-end.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, where does that leave us?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        $1,000 for AR
       </li>
       <li>
        $800 for shotgun and pistol
       </li>
       <li>
        $800 for body armor (assuming no ceramics, which I've ONLY seen mentioned in this thread)
       </li>
       <li>
        MAYBE $600 for the mags/sights/etc
       </li>
       <li>
        $2,310 for ammo
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        GRAND TOTAL
       </strong>
       - $4,910.
      </p>
      <p>
       A decent chunk of money, but nothing even APPROACHING the 20k you're pulling out of thin air.  Granted we have NO idea what types of chemicals he purchased, but $15k work of chemicals would be a bit overkill for booby-trapping an apartment, don't you think?

       Sorry, but I've seen this "how could he afford all that stuff" idea popping up everywhere. I know as little about what happened as anybody else, but the money shouldn't be some sort of red flag. Despite the meltdown, America is still a very easy place to rack up debt.

       I'm surprised he didn't use a drum mag.  Coulda easily had 75+ round magazines instead of the 30 round ones he used.  Couple that with NATO green tips and he coulda done alot more damage shooting through walls and everything else.

       plates are 500 each and require a license, and he was decked out in them.
and the claim is almost 20k, with what he had on him and at his apartment, that's about right.

       Also ceramics only take 1 hit albeit at lvl 4, lvl 3 armor is about 500 and can take an average 6 shots.

       and everything you just pulled out of your ass is also far fetched, to equip oneself like that and execute the operation as he did requires study and preparation, it's not something you can just decide to do one morning, you yourself went for the ceramics off the bat.

       This was in no way a one man operation.

       A decent AR-15 rifle costs $1,000 or more all by itself. The shotgun and handgun might run another $800 total. Spare mags, sights, slings, and so on will run you at least another $1,000 across three firearms. The bullet-proof vest is easily another $800, and the cost of the bomb-making gear is anybody’s guess. With all the specialty body gear, ammunition, booby-trap devices and more, I’m guessing this is at least $20,000 in weapons and tactical gear, much of which is very difficult for civilians to get in the first place.

       I always find it strange however that thes lone wolf schizos never seem to take DIRECT revenge for the percieved injustices comitted against them.
Its always a random act of violence comitted against completely uninvolved innocents and it usually involves children.
