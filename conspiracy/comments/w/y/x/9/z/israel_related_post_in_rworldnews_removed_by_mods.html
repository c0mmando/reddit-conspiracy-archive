       Nice try but I've been around a while , I was in the process of responding to your cleverly written blurb then I realized it would take more effort then im willing to put in at this hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont know what you consider elite but having complete domination of the media
       <a href="http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/jews-do-control-the-media/">
        http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/jews-do-control-the-media/

       this include all forms of media, print, music, Hollywood, porn, google ,facebook ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we have banking , what source would you like me to insert, lets put it this way type jews banks into google WOW seem like they top all the lists of the banking elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you referring to the sock puppets that get elected
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway this going to prove futile debating with you after reading what you have wrote.

       Action is something I would like to see more of as well. We will have to wait for the west to crash. Then it will happen, people are still ignorant about who and what is causing it.. but they will find out. Jews have painted a target on their back all by themselves and its only a matter of time. Greed seems to be the most broken of all the Jewish sins.

       Any reason is sufficient. My guess is: friends of Israel complained that it was not "news" because it was a two year old story.

      <p>
       If you want to post criticism of Israel or zionism you have to post here in r/conspiracy and then "they" get to complain about how anti-semetic r/conspiracy is.

       Is this the first time something has been removed like that? I mean usually their reason is "the title was editorialized" or "bias website" but this time its an Israeli paper and the OP used the same title the newspaper used.

       Not the first time and not the last. There are people who believe everyone is always thinking of ways to hurt them. They try to "defend" themselves against this by always looking for suspects. It is a cultural phenomena that cannot be reasoned away. They have
       <em>
        not

       "infiltrated" r/conspiracy. They are valued members of this community. We just disagree on the nature of reality and the reality of history.

       You misstated my position slightly. It is more like: "Hey you are insane but thanks for giving me an opportunity to point that out to others". You are not going to motivate them to change their religious beliefs. They are going to continue being insane, alone or in company, no matter what you do.

       Zionism is racist supremacism (
       <em>
        the belief that a particular race, species, ethnic group, religion, gender, sexual orientation, belief system or culture is superior to others, and thus entitles those who identify with it to dominate, control or rule those who do not
       </em>
       ). You do not fight supremacism with supremacism; that is the mistake that the zionists made.

       Killing people for having beliefs that differs from yours seems like supremacism to me.

       Common sense does not allow us to believe that all truth and wisdom is or was or will be held by any single culture - unless it is our culture. Every culture makes the same claim to legitimacy, if not supremacy. Do we have to kill people to prove they are mistaken in their beliefs?

       We could see this more clearly if, for a moment, we change the subject from zionism to American Supremacy. How many people have been killed by the American war machine? Should we kill all the Americans who believe in their country (right or wrong)? Americans seem to go out of their way to find people to kill. If they can't coexist peacefully with their neighbors, should they be wiped from the face of the earth?

       OK you missed the point. If you substitute Americans for Zionists your idea of killing people for having beliefs that lead to the deaths of millions of others does not make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone, you, the Israeli zionists, the Christian zionists, think they know "the one and only truth". You want them to pay for their beliefs with their lives. How is that any different from what they believe?

       I am not going to change your mind. Neither would I change the mind of a zionist about their beliefs. But I can express a different opinion and hopefully influence the mind of the lurker [yes you] to see more than one side of the issue. I do not call for the death of anyone (not even you) for having a different belief system. It seems like that is what I want to end not perpetuate.

A false belief is not considered to be knowledge, even if it is sincere. A sincere believer in the flat earth theory does not know that the Earth is flat. Later epistemologists, for instance Gettier (1963)[2] and Goldman (1967),[3] have questioned the "justified true belief" definition

       I guess the question was should belief in zionism be punishable by death. Obviously it is a false belief but is it a crime? And if a crime does it rise to the level of deserving of death? And if so how many other beliefs should likewise be punished?

       The "ends justifies the means" is literally Machiavellian. It means doing anything whatsoever that is required to get the result you want, regardless of the methods used. It does not matter whether these methods are legal or illegal, fair or foul, kind or cruel, truth or lies, democratic or dictatorial, good or evil. Isn't that the world of the bankers, corporatists and globalists? Do you really want to live in that world?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about this: think what you want; believe what you want; know what is true (for you); expect to be held accountable for what you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       (even if it God told you to do it).

       How do you feel about iraqis, afghanis, pakis, libyans or syrians? How about the death and suffering of these people? Don't you think the death's, and suffering these people are experiencing warrants a bit of oppositional extremism?  Do you have more right to life than they do?

       Any religion that espouses killing other people who do not belong to the religion needs to be mediated. People can have their own beliefs as long as that affects only themselves, but if they claim a right from god to kill other people, in the interests of our self-preservation that needs to be mediated, moderated, or stopped dead.

       For one, relentlessly opposing their lies with truth.  And by exposing their operatives and their methods. And maybe we need a counter-term to be used each time they slam out 'anti-semite' as their universal derogary term. And frequent exposure of the many criminal beliefs in Sanhedrin.

       OK, now you are talking my language. That is what I do. As a matter of fact when I started posting here about a year and a half ago this place was run by a Hasbara agent and his sycophant accomplice. There were bury brigades. I started posting as many provocative links as I could find and engaging them in endless desultory banter. In order to get their comments noticed they had to up-vote my posts. I drew attention to r/conspiracy as a place where
       <strong>
        REDACTED
       </strong>
       ideas could be discussed. When readership doubled from around 26,000 to over 52,000 I decided my job was done.

       The only way I can think of is creating an unmoderated subreddit for world news but I think it would be very hard to get it to have enough subscribers to make it worth it. What should happen is that the subreddit gets changed to a default 'reddit' tag and the post should dissapear from worldnews but not the front page. I doubt this will ever happen.

       almost every news source in the states is owned by jews. did you remember when mel gibson went on that tirade? it was reported on every single news show back to back for days. they had been waiting for a chance to get him back ever since passion of the christ made jews look bad.

       look at seth rogan complaining about bad jewish characters in the movie drive. you almost never ever see bad jews in anything and this fucker has the audacity to cry about this.
