    <div class="md"><p>Technically, they were supposed to get public approval for the full body scanners.  They told everybody to eat a dick.  now the government is asking questions.  All of a sudden the TSA is frisking retarded kids with cancer from make-a-wish.  That&#39;s what caught my attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a reddit <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/wcpls/this_i_my_friends_son_being_searched_by_the_tsa/">article</a> so I wouldn&#39;t cal it evidence.  But my point wasn&#39;t the article.  My point was, that it made me realize how we are always bombarded by a slew of articles, about the TSA staff doing outrageous shit, right before some new invasive tech is rolled out.  Google TSA cancer.  It&#39;s full of articles designed to piss off the public.  Now they are rolling out laser spectographs and pushing the full body scanners without going through the proper channels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not in the USA and the TSA don&#39;t exist here, but it does seem like there are a lot of truly absurd and elaborate &quot;terrorist plots&quot; which seem to immediately demand the use of new equipment and investigative powers that nobody could ever fathom the existence of.</p>

<p>Underpant bomber?  Bring in the body scanners.
Shoe bombers?  Take your shoes off.</p>

<p>Seems remarkably convenient, I would have said.  Another mark against the aviation industry - I absolutely abhor the idea of going off on holiday and being treated like a fucking criminal just to get my transport whereas I can get on any train in the UK with moments to spare (no having to &quot;check-in&quot; 10 000 years in advance) and not be molested or have my bags searched.</p>

<p>Who would bother flying these days?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but that&#39;s what worries me.  They introduce these super high tech surveillance systems at airports.  The public gets use to the complete lack of privacy but they feel secure, then boom, train bombing or whatever.  Now they have facial recognition and laser spectrometers in subways and train stations.  Then maybe sporting events.  Why not the mall while we are at it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why I believe the TSA has some affiliation with Islams. Islams  tell us to take off our shoes when we go and pray to god and the TSA wants us to take off our shoes when we go and &quot;pray&quot; to them! They&#39;re so stupid they can&#39;t even hide there agenda to get Americans to praise Islam!</p>
