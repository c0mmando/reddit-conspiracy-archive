        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, i&#39;ve been debating on posting this for a little while now under a throwaway or not, but decided since anyone could easily look up the post i&#39;ll talk about in a sec, i&#39;d be easily identifiable.</p>

<p>So, if you check my submitted stories, I posted a link to a site about the Morgellon&#39;s disease.  Well, after posting that link, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because I became more aware of the symptoms or what but i&#39;m a morgellon&#39;s sufferer, and didn&#39;t know until after I started researching it.  Maybe 6 weeks ago I suddenly started having stomach pains, not like stomach flu, kind of felt like really, really, really, <em>really</em> painful gas pain.  It would in the hip area, literally like the line where usually your waistband goes, in between the belly button and <em>God&#39;s gift to Women</em> (sorry, have to have some kinda humor to keep me from driving myself crazy from this) right on the waist line is where this pain occurs, in the localized area.</p>

<p>So, this lasted a week or two, sometimes so bad i&#39;d literally use &#39;lamase breathing&#39; I learned from Hollywood TV and movies to try and curb the pain a little, it lasted only 30 secs - 1 min at a time, maybe 4-7 times a day but it was ridiculous pain.  Well, it gradually stopped and I had read about Morgellon&#39;s a year or two ago and I used to read alot on it because it REALLY fascinated me, the people afflicted is horrible and i&#39;d definitely take them never being exposed to this as opposed to being able to study/read about this but alas....</p>

<p>So, I was on a &#39;conspiracy kick&#39; one night about a week after the stomach pains and I was reading random conspiracy theories and searching google for top 10 conspiracy lists, etc. to see if there was anything I haven&#39;t read about, decided to look at Morgellon News and such to see if they had discovered a treament, cure or hell even a CAUSE.  I went to some sites and I read the new material on it, well, I SWEAR to GOD, like 2 weeks after that, maybe 1 1/2 weeks from today, I was getting out of the shower at night, I brushed my hair and I swear I thought I seen my hair making twitching moves in the brush, but took some adderall that night so chopped it up to that, then Morgellon&#39;s thought came into my head.</p>

<p>I remember when burned they don&#39;t burn like normal hair, they melt quick and leave a golden tip most of the time, I burnt a few of them and I about went to the gun cabinet to play russian roulette with a 9mm glock.  Golden tips on everyone, so immediately get online and read symptoms and I had most that I had attributed to other, different causes.</p>

<p>I had these skin lines popping up from nowhere some like this <a href="http://www.sodahead.com/united-states/is-morgellons-crawling-skin-disease-purely-psychological/question-2419757/?page=5&amp;link=ibaf&amp;q=&amp;imgurl=http://images.sodahead.com/polls/002419757/morgellons-67613187540_xlarge.jpeg">http://www.sodahead.com/united-states/is-morgellons-crawling-skin-disease-purely-psychological/question-2419757/?page=5&amp;link=ibaf&amp;q=&amp;imgurl=http://images.sodahead.com/polls/002419757/morgellons-67613187540_xlarge.jpeg</a>  with no scratching, like i&#39;d be watching tv and grab a drink and happen to catch a glance at my arm and have multiple lines up and down my arm and leg and shit.  Others looked kinda like scars, but they weren&#39;t and they were indented, like when you wear a watch too tight that has a stretch band, if it catches a piece of skin and holds it long enough, when you take it off the indent is on it.  Well they looked like that, but nothing making them, they&#39;d be like from my shoulder to my bicep and on the back side of the bicep, not the front.  and from my elbow to almost my wrist.  Also i&#39;ve had signs of carpal tunnel which I attributed to coding and the 20+ years online, until I read when the lines and such are exposed more there, it&#39;s usually because that&#39;s the central location, if I would use 35% peroxide on a little cut or any open part of skin near that wrist or on my hand, it&#39;d fix that.  What do you know, the fibers started rolling out of that little hole that by the time I was finished that the little paper cut I poured the peroxide in, it was at least 10x the size it was from being strecthed so much, the width/radius of a pencil eraser.</p>

<p>I started checking body hair, I noticed these hairs longer than others and when held up to a light, same clear color and burned with a gold tip that the brush hair had.  Then I noticed two days later my legs being kind of a purple color, and the itching sensation was the worst it has been yet that day and I itched every 2 or 3 seconds, no exaggeration.  I looked up baths and the like, finally decided on vinegar, peroxide, salt bath.  Jesus, I just mixed it up in the tob with some really hot water and rubbed my legs with it and you should&#39;ve seen the things on the ground after going over them 2 or 3 full wipes.  Black &#39;granules&#39;, they&#39;re so easy to dismiss too, which I did even like the day before when I found such things randomly on my skin after a itching sensation that felt like a bug crawl and that was there, it is really hard, like literally a indestructable micro seed and I figured dirt until I seen pics online, Granules all over the ground, hundreds of those fibers, although mine were only clear (that I found), there was this strange thing it was almost like sharp ass glass, a mini piece, I had my socks off and all, I and cleaned the floor before I started, as to stop being contaminated as soon as bathing, and after I rub my legs really, really good, I step on the floor to get more salt step on it and cut my foot and pick it up, it glistens in the light, easiest explanation was glass.  So, I finally felt so good after that though, I passed out on the couch, sleeping on a clean blanket and the like, well woke up that night and ate a mini crunch bar, which I later found out sugar is like viagra for whatever this is and I started feeling like the &#39;crawling&#39; all over me, I even got my next symptoms, micro insects exiting your body....</p>

<p>I started checking out what works for others as I didn&#39;t wanna take a vinegar bath everyday, started reading on herbs and spice and alkalinity and the symptoms really eased off, ALOT.  It was almost to the point I almost convinced myself it WAS the adderall, if it wasn&#39;t for that gnat, I would&#39;ve been convinced already, but my symptoms came back two days ago, really yesterday as they were suttle.  </p>

<p>More of the skin indentations showed up, circles too this time.  The itching, then the swelling so last night after not finding many fibers on me lately, I checked my arms &amp; legs right off, yep, there they are.  Check my chest, all over, yep.  I even had one growing out my face this time, which is the first time I had one up there.  Took a vinegar bath last night, your legs &amp; arms look KIND of like this after one of those baths:  <a href="http://brandytwirl.multiply.com/photos/album/1/Morgellons_Pictures_Before_and_After_Treatment?&amp;show_interstitial=1&amp;u=%2Fphotos%2Falbum#photo=56">http://brandytwirl.multiply.com/photos/album/1/Morgellons_Pictures_Before_and_After_Treatment?&amp;show_interstitial=1&amp;u=%2Fphotos%2Falbum#photo=56</a>  except not raised up, it&#39;s like indents, like something was there creating pressure and it raises off, like if you hold quarter with exceptional force against your skin for a while, the shape will stay on your skin yknow?  Multiply that shape 1000x or probably more everywhere you rub the vinegar and there you go.</p>

<p>So, I pulled most of the LONG fibers out, found some black ones this time, the long ones seem to be the ones that connect the others, if ask any patient, you can pull these fibers out of your skin, from every part of your skin and put em close together on paper, a table, anything, wait about 2 minutes or so, and pick one hair up and they&#39;ll all be wrapped up together, even if you lined up the hairs parallel to one another.  </p>

<p>I had my first lesion today:  <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=667&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=YOGKvqmTez058M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.wnd.com/2008/05/64266/&amp;docid=Qafe3LWCylThrM&amp;imgurl=http://www.wnd.com/images/morgellons.jpg&amp;w=303&amp;h=260&amp;ei=Hnv4T5f7Hc_l6gHu0en4Bg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=339&amp;vpy=322&amp;dur=50&amp;hovh=208&amp;hovw=242&amp;tx=200&amp;ty=123&amp;sig=106324717799290954871&amp;page=2&amp;tbnh=149&amp;tbnw=207&amp;start=15&amp;ndsp=16&amp;ved=1t:429,r:5,s:15,i:142">http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=667&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=YOGKvqmTez058M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.wnd.com/2008/05/64266/&amp;docid=Qafe3LWCylThrM&amp;imgurl=http://www.wnd.com/images/morgellons.jpg&amp;w=303&amp;h=260&amp;ei=Hnv4T5f7Hc_l6gHu0en4Bg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=339&amp;vpy=322&amp;dur=50&amp;hovh=208&amp;hovw=242&amp;tx=200&amp;ty=123&amp;sig=106324717799290954871&amp;page=2&amp;tbnh=149&amp;tbnw=207&amp;start=15&amp;ndsp=16&amp;ved=1t:429,r:5,s:15,i:142</a> looks like that, the one on the top with the yellow, except not as big and not as much yellow, basically not as bad, yet.</p>

<p>These are where the &#39;pods&#39; where the fibers are growing from and protrude out the skin, people have pulled the &#39;pod&#39; out and watched the fibers be sucked under the skin as the lesion is extracted.  I&#39;ve been slow to embrace the nano tech theory, as who honestly wants to admit they basically have an unwanted robot living inside of them, unable to completely get rid of it?</p>

<p>But i&#39;ve been reading more &amp; more about nanotechnology and descriptions of materials, and you find almost every single material, quantum dots, nanotube, everything on your skin or inside of you, or pretruding from your body:  <a href="http://www.rense.com/morgphase/phase2_1.htm">http://www.rense.com/morgphase/phase2_1.htm</a></p>

<p>So, I just wanted to post this because I haven&#39;t talked to anyone about EVERY symptoms, I mean who wouldn&#39;t think someone saying that bugs are falling out their nose and the others.  And to let everyone know this is real, stop eating GA food, genetically altered, and eat organic, stop the insane sugar diets, etc.  Read about this, please, everyone who has tested themselves with redwine and peroxide method has at least something.</p>

<p>EDIT/UPDATE:  Here&#39;s a pic of the lesion, my symptoms were flaring up again last night pretty bad and I took another vinegar detox both and it pulls out most long fibers, so it was hard to take a decent pic with this cell phone cam, give me a day or two for em to come back up and i&#39;ll send one.  Also, if anyone has PS that can lighten this photo just a little so everyone can see the center where the &#39;pod&#39; that has the fibers coming out of it is.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I don&#39;t mean to be critical, but it seems like confirmation bias abounds with morgellon&#39;s sufferrers. I have met many of them and their symptoms are always in a lull, but then they spike later that week or they just got over an episode. Very few sufferers produce useful media, it&#39;s pretty much the same pictures from site to site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s one thing I do agree with, not alot of pictures, but i&#39;m more than happy to take pictures of mine, I just gotta get a better camera soon.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link to the research given on Morgellon&#39;s at the conference by recognized medical professionals including CEHF Associate Director, Greg Smith, a pediatrician from Georgia, Dr. Amelia Withington, a Psychiatrist from Pennsylvania, there&#39;s more doctor names on the page.  Just a site to show everyone the light, that&#39;s all I can do.  Whether you choose to use the light to your advantage is your choice.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve made the best case for it being a real and terrible disease with the resources I have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking that too. The only reason I don&#39;t immediately jump to the conclusion that she&#39;s crazy, is because of what I know about and who I know with multiple chemical sensitivity. This is another kind of disease that pretty much everyone in the medical field says &quot;nope, you&#39;re just nuts&quot;. This seems like it should be easier to verify though if you actually get lesions and weird spider webs under your skin... Some of those pictures of sores and rashes look bad. I think if you went to a dermatologist looking like that and didn&#39;t say &quot;I think I have this&quot; they would have to give you some answer other than &quot;go see a shrink&quot;, right? Have you gone to a regular doctor while this was acting up (without giving your input as to what you think it is) and heard what they have to say?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You assume because something is so today that is was always this way. Show me that there was any interest in a red wine test pre-morgellons. Because everyone tests positive for something means that it must have always been that way and must be naturally occurring right? Yes, you claim it is skin cells, but what you were really trying to say is that the tannins in the wine were reacting with the protein in your saliva. Since you don&#39;t even know how to make your own point I will help you out. You can read more about this reaction <a href="http://khymos.org/wine.php">here</a>. While you are there maybe you can take note that the precipitate in the photo does not resemble the results of the red wine test. Sorry, but looks like you&#39;ll have to revert back to insults and accusations of mental illness to prove your &quot;point&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried &amp; succeeded 2 or 3 times in convincing myself I was just imagining the shit or it was something else, but the symptoms always return, always the same and always look 70-90% like the other pictures documented, but it&#39;s just a good PS job.  </p>

<p>Can you guys explain why you can believe that bin Laden isn&#39;t dead, that the Rockefeller&#39;s and Rothchild&#39;s are trying to dominate humanity, and the Bilderberg&#39;s make every major or semi-major event occur and how this disease, with pictures, videos, microscope pictures ,testimony, and more is SO hard for all of you to believe?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to criticize anyone, before I had ANY symptoms I liked reading about it, but I found it a little hard to believe, even with ALL the evidence.</p>

<p>Just sayin, believe what you want to believe, just try the Red Wine and Peroxide test and spit it in a petri dish or a dish or something and keep it covered and then check it out,  It&#39;ll be a lot worse looking if you have a microscope.  <a href="http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/bio2011-3.htm">http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/bio2011-3.htm</a>  Check that out, that&#39;s a picture of someone who tried the test after the 1st time he heard of Morgellon&#39;s and the Peroxide test and this is what he found in the petri dish, also, it&#39;s <em>verified</em></p>

<p>I know it&#39;s hard for you to deal with individuals on a case by case basis. I don&#39;t believe any of those things.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again. Academics and Doctors LOVE Nobel Prizes. If this were a real thing and not a psychological ailment then they would be all over this attempting to find the cause and win the prize. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a bunch of doctors researching this disease themselves sometimes coming out of their own pocket because of being refused grant money.  If you google your exact questions a few sites come up with links to Grant Applications for Morgellon&#39;s Research that have all been denied.  Most Academics don&#39;t come out of their own pocket for a nobel prize, they&#39;re too greedy.  And if you add in the fact the CDC said it&#39;s all just an illusion then what do you expect?</p>

<p>I mean, honestly, what are the chances that on all six continents with documented cases, every &#39;delusion&#39; ends up with mostly the SAME symptoms and the same fibers and &#39;pods&#39; and all of that shit that by the way CAN&#39;T be identified by any modern lab yet.  Plus, add the fact that all these fibers and pods and granules and shit look so much a like under the microscope and can be seen moving and such with the naked eye.</p>

<p>Now truly think about how much of a miracle that would be for all the cases to have everything in common, even under microscope, even ones without internet access.  So, what should I think then?  If the pharm companies refuse to grant grants for research, then most researchers won&#39;t pursue that avenue, and the sufferers and symptoms keep on since there&#39;s not even a fraction of what would be researching something that could be prescribed a new medicine.  There&#39;s a potential for millions there, what money potential is there for Morgellon&#39;s Research for the pharm companies?</p>

<p>They don&#39;t even know a cause, cure, treatment or even what the hell everything is, so why the hell would they want to dump money into something like that?  They&#39;re not the Red Cross.</p>

<p>You may not know you&#39;re crazy since you don&#39;t know the world works obviously.</p>

<p>The internet makes it possible for Munchausen&#39;s sufferers the world over to fabricate a disease because they need attention.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how Morgellon&#39;s &#39;sufferers&#39; always seem to lash out when they are told that they have a mental illness and should seek counselling.</p>

Why do you think we don&#39;t go see alot of random doctors?  That behavior is the exact reason.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll even play along, can you send me a wiki to a mental illness that has all those symptoms?  I&#39;ll go see a therapist tomorrow if so, i&#39;d rather BE mentally ill than deal with this every day, that&#39;s the main point.  I&#39;m a normal person mentally minus the symptoms.  No hallucinations, auditory or visual, no tremors or anything, no involuntary movement, no seizures, great memory, no paranoia, etc.  So what mental illness do you think I could be suffering from, any ideas jump out at ya?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems like an excuse to me.  The only thing/symptom resembling any of that is just that the physical illness creates more anxiety which in turn makes the physical illness worse.  I googled Somatoform fibers, somatoform fiber delusion, somatoform open wound, etc. and didn&#39;t see anything even remotely close to anything I have.  Like I said, I&#39;d be glad if it was a mental illness, I don&#39;t mind researching but how can you tell me that I have that disease which I have no unique symptoms of and no symptoms that have appeared in other patients of the disease (somatoform) and not the disease where I identify with 9/10 symptoms and has 15,000+ people with basically the same symptoms...</p>

<p>Don&#39;t just tell me &#39;You have a mental illness and you need to get treatment&#39;. That&#39;s no explanation.  I&#39;m not mad or arguing, I like hearing everyone&#39;s point of view and if you can point me in another direction, I would be happy to go that way, I don&#39;t want fucking Morgellon&#39;s.</p>

<p>Also, would Somatoform cause everyone to spit out fibers with the Red Wine-Peroxide test also?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you sir, need therapeutic treatment as you don&#39;t know anything you&#39;re talking about.  That&#39;s definitely not dead skin that comes out, if it is i&#39;ve never seen dead skin be able to shift itself/move.  All the microscopic pictures with dead skin or hair beside the fiber you can EASILY tell that the two are nowhere close to alike, not even having ONE common characteristic. </p>

<p>So, what are the pod&#39;s that come out of these lesions I have?  After a week or so of the wound being open, you can pull it out without as much pain and they always, ALWAYS look like or closely resemble this:  <a href="http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/sherry5a-RS.jpg">http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/sherry5a-RS.jpg</a> and the fibers grow from these.  All lesions from the sufferers look exactly or almost exactly like this: <a href="http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/images/ktrk/cms_exf_2007/_video_wn_images/8519901_448x252.jpg">http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/images/ktrk/cms_exf_2007/_video_wn_images/8519901_448x252.jpg</a> By the way, that&#39;s a CDC picture, since you believe things only the CDC/Government will tell you is real.</p>

<p>So can you come up with a mental illness that makes those appear on the body?  How about the objects that resemble all sorts of shapes that are hard such as:  <a href="http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/pinkhexagon.jpg">http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/pinkhexagon.jpg</a>  or  <a href="http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/clear%20hexagon-RS.jpg">http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/clear%20hexagon-RS.jpg</a> or even <a href="http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/Clear%20diamond%20shape%20in%20goo-RS.jpg">http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/Clear%20diamond%20shape%20in%20goo-RS.jpg</a> or how about <a href="http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/paisly2-RS.jpg">http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/paisly2-RS.jpg</a> or even this one <a href="http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/triangcryst-RS.jpg">http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/triangcryst-RS.jpg</a>  ?</p>

<p>I myself have had two hexagon shaped and one circle shape object come from under the skin, I even watched the circle.  No lab has been able to tell us the material these are made from either.  These don&#39;t come from clothing so...?  What else could it be?  Somatoform?  Our brains creating these inside of us?  I watched the circle literally after I felt a sting and then thought I saw something move where I had a circle skin line, it basically just rose up slowly over an hours time until it was fully out.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing that I haven&#39;t tried to be derrogatory or at all to you but you keep on with the attitude and the sarcasm.  You won&#39;t even offer me one shred of proof that MIGHT be true that all of us are experience a mass delusion.  You just keep repeating the same things over and over.  It&#39;s not real, it&#39;s not real, it&#39;s a mental illness, over and over and over.</p>

<p>You&#39;re really starting to sound like what I would assume a chemtrail disinformation person to sound like.  You can&#39;t even argue your point, you just keep repeating it.  And I still wonder how you can even consider that point right as the only basis for the delusion theory is the CDC which Govt. run.  Other doctors are doing massive amounts of research on their own and spoke out against the article you linked as &#39;encouraging dematology doctors to misdiagnose morgellon&#39;s and delusion and that&#39;s not helping us get closer to any answers.&quot;</p>

<p>So I really hope you have some kind of proof/article/doctor statements from anyone other than CDC doctors that explain everything that people with whatever this is have coming out of their body.  If it was JUST fibers, sure I could see it being clothing or something.  But just let me know what kind of mental illness, rather how those would get in my body naturally?  Clothes or bed sheets or what and i&#39;ll gladly go right along with it&#39;s all not true....</p>

<p>Actually if you could just tell us all in this thread how things like these get into our skin and then make their way out and it is natural assuming it&#39;s a mental illness, they&#39;d have to be natural objects sinking into our skin I would assume...  <a href="http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/karenad4-1RS.jpg">http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/karenad4-1RS.jpg</a> this metal object taken apart AFTER coming to skin surface...hmm, that looks pretty natural to me.   <a href="http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/karenshurikenglyph1.jpg">http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/karenshurikenglyph1.jpg</a>  or this, it even looks like it has a serpent picture on the back, it may just be the way it was made but either way, that seems like something that could easily get into our bodies without us knowing and then thinking we had a disease, correct?  <a href="http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/karens%20yellow%20nano1.jpg">http://www.morgellonsexposed.com/images/karens%20yellow%20nano1.jpg</a>  How about that?  So assuming your theory is true, then these things must be on our clothes, on our sheets, on something that they could get into our body without us knowing and if it&#39;s just random objects with no link then they should be basically natural objects, right?  They wouldn&#39;t be made of unknown materials.....so, any ideas?  Or you going to just give us the canned CDC response &quot;Everything is fine.  There is no disease.  Keep eating the food.  Oh, we didn&#39;t make that cloud just now, the cloud was being filtered in and out of the jet engines that&#39;s why it looks that way, keep moving.  Nothing to worry about here.&quot;</p>

<p>Jesus man, seriously, the more I type the more I see how much of a fucking idiot you really are and how much help YOU really need to open your eyes.  If you can provide me ANY theory to explain anything besides the fibers that are &#39;dead skin&#39; then i&#39;ll go right along with you.</p>

<p>So what are these metal objects that the FBI database that has 200,000+ chemical make-up&#39;s/compound&#39;s from cotton to metal&#39;s found only on meteor&#39;s cannot identify the materials these things are?   Especially if they were natural objects, that contradicts itself...</p>

Document the good stuff, maybe one of those vinegar baths or something, and this&#39;ll be as close to first hand knowledge we can get on the internet. This is great for r/conspiracy. Thanks dude.</p>

<p>Two things about the wound/gouge thing. 1 I notice an arc running around it. Is this normal or a separate thing? 2 is that more further down and to the right, or just the picture?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, I don&#39;t know what &#39;arc&#39; you mean?  Do you mean the part that kinda looks like a arc running kinda parallel to the lower part?  If so, that&#39;s part of the lesion, the weird thing is it&#39;s like a open sore right?  Then you see where my skin is?  Well, the arc is part of the sore, it&#39;s an open wound, it skipped that skin, which makes me wonder why it skipped, not just open it all up?  </p>

<p>Alright to the proof comment, I took that at like 4 am in my kitchen and it&#39;s a cell phone camera, if I had a better camera, I woulda pictured the bath last night, not TOO, TOO much shit in there, but fibers with little things in the middles of the fibers that people familiar with it call &#39;granules&#39; they say these are the same black things or things that come out of the skin.  I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t have a microscope and really don&#39;t want one as i&#39;m still coming to terms fully with this aspect, checking out every single thing under a microscope that came off me I would probably end up like Bobby Fischer or Syd Barrett.</p>

<p>Lol, all jokes aside, i&#39;m very happy to see that picture helped one person to believe that I may believe I have it.  I&#39;m not asking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to believe me and believe every theory and thing I say about this, but I can&#39;t believe most of the people in this thread won&#39;t even CONSIDER the idea to be possible.  From conspiracy theorists at that, I mean the same guys who know FOR SURE NASA FAKED the moon landing and the Govt. did 9/11 find MY idea TOO FARFETCHED or a DELUSION?  </p>

<p>And they think their helping &#39;stop the NWO&#39; by talking about Bilderberg and Bohemian Grove, look at how much they have you snowed in that EVEN you guys deny this, so really, who in their right MIND who knew that conspiracy theorists denied it&#39;s existence would believe a sufferer?  NO ONE!  They got you all doing what they NEED you to do, and most of you are falling in line and claiming because you have convo&#39;s on JFK assassination, Nasa moon landing, Nicaragua Drug Running, 9/11, bin Laden death, and other things that you&#39;re &#39;unique&#39; and working to stop the &#39;NWO&#39;.  They push these theories so you&#39;ll look at REAL events like this as just a theory and pretty much believe it impossible.</p>

<p>Goto Google.com and search for &#39;Morgellon&#39;s objects with writing&#39; I don&#39;t know the specific search term(s) or YouTube.com also, they have video&#39;s and pictures of these &#39;granules&#39; black, beige, etc. and other objects that had fibers wrapped around and fell off the skin after the vinegar baths that have English writing on them.  One even looks to say NASA, now I don&#39;t know if I believe all of it to be true, plus that pic only has half the granule like it broke, but I guess this is all &#39;part of the delusion too&#39; right?  The writing SHOULD prove to you guys this thing is REAL and MAN MADE.</p>

<p>After this comment, i&#39;m done preaching trying to convince, people here believe what you want but think about that you can&#39;t even weigh the possibilities this could be real, and then consider how much influence the NWO REALLY has on your thoughts/actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gotta buy some red wine, I don&#39;t have any here, I googled to see if there was anything I could substitute with....I really dread doing it, I don&#39;t wanna end up with something like the entire petri dish full of thousands of fibers.  You know?  I eventually will do it though, although my face is the least affected area from it&#39;s start, and i&#39;ve never had anything like a noticeable symptom in or on my mouth that I noticed.  Worst thing on my face/head was a fiber on my face and fibers growing with my hair, I hate the feeling of your own hair moving, only the &#39;sufferers&#39; know this feeling, it just feels so.....creepy, just imagine it.</p>

<p>Oh shit, I shouldn&#39;t have said that, now no one here will EVER believe it.  Really?  Hair that moves in another way then back in place?  No, it&#39;s not hair, I call it &#39;hair&#39;.  But there&#39;s not much movement today as I did the vinegar bath last night and I don&#39;t have to deal with all the bs symptoms today.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can photograph me pulling a fiber out, no video camera, I only have a cell cam though, hmm, picture of the lesion do?  Maybe a few skin lines if I can hit the right light?  I mean honestly I don&#39;t really care who believes me but I planned on doing this anyway to let everyone know i&#39;m not trolling.  If cell phone pic&#39;ll do, lemme know and lemme know what you want to see.   Not too many unusually long fibers atm, since I just did the bath last night.  They&#39;re clear and a FEW black ones, which my body hair is black and the clear ones basically use the color of the real ones, it&#39;s like you see through to the other ones colors.  They like to stay twisted together, when they&#39;re long if you like straighten em all out and watch em, 3 minutes at the most they&#39;ll be all twisted back together, curled alot sometimes, like they&#39;re trying to hide their unusual length.  If I can find a big enough patch of some that are twisted/long then i&#39;ll take a pic of that too.  </p>

<p>Good enough for now?  If anyone wants to buy me a nice ass digi cam or nice ass webcam or something i&#39;ll be WAY more than happy to document everything wrong with me atm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, never heard a doctor say I ever had &#39;too many symptoms.&quot;  And like I said, it only happened once, and even if it had just flew in and out of my nose, it was still strange.  But if it did just fly in and out and the gnats are just normal fruit gnats or whatever, there is the theory and sufferers notice insects around them or &#39;following&#39; them around.  The theory is that when you die or there is sick tissue it gives off a certain odor/protein to alert the bugs and others to start the food chain/circle of life, and when the skin is being opened up by fibers and the lesions coming out and the whole hair moving thing messes up our bodies natural balance, so they think we&#39;re sick/dying because we don&#39;t have the normal &#39;healthy&#39; aura.</p>

<p>Like I said, a theory.  One thing does amaze me, how people in this forum for &#39;conspiracy&#39; can believe farfetched conspiracy theories (if you guys don&#39;t then sorry) by authors unknown, yet scoff at the very idea i&#39;m telling the truth.  When my dad gets home i&#39;ll at least show you guys a pic of the skin lesion...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be at ease my friend. You are almost certainly telling the truth. Many researchers here in America have proven it&#39;s real. I&#39;ve been having symptoms of something for roughly 3 months now. It all started as I was having a bowl of cereal one night.</p>

<p>I was just sitting here having a bowl of Toasted Oh&#39;s when I noticed the sensation of a hair in my mouth. I was able to work it in between my lips and pull it out. It looked like a long, semi-clear clothing fiber. I got rid off it, and finished the bowl of cereal. Later that night in bed I had a stomach ache that felt a bit like gas or cramps. Over the next few weeks I began feeling these really painful, sharp, immediate pains as I was trying to go to sleep.</p>

<p>I remember one night laying there trying to go to sleep, and all of the sudden it felt like someone stuck a needle in my big toe! I sat straight up, turned my bed light on, and tried to figure out what the hell just bit me. I looked through the covers thinking it may have been a spider or something. I found nothing. It was also at this time that I started having problems sleeping on my stomach.</p>

<p>If I tried to lay on my stomach I&#39;d get a horrible stomach ache, and a TICKING SENSATION right underneath my bellybutton. It felt as though some little muscle was convulsing, and it was so strong that I could feel my stomach rubbing against the covers, matching the rhythm of the tick. It was INCREDIBLY ANNOYING, and I began researching the symptoms. </p>

<p>I came across an ailment that described a potential aneurism  in one of the main artery&#39;s in the stomach. The symptoms matched, and I became very alarmed as it is considered very serious and life threatening. I went to the doctor the very next day even though the ticking was mostly none existent in the mornings. He didn&#39;t seem to take me very serious as he gave me a short once-over, basically a half-assed physical.</p>

<p>He said there was nothing more he could do other than schedule me for a sonogram at another office, and sent me on my way. That was months ago, and I never went. The ticking is mostly gone these days unless I try to lay on my stomach, which I can&#39;t do at all anymore, as the pain, and strange ticking returns. It may not even be related, or, it&#39;s compounded by other strange things I&#39;ve been experiencing.</p>

<p>I already mentioned the biting/pinching/stabbing sensations I get as I try to go to sleep. I also get the UNMISTAKABLE feeling of things crawling underneath my skin. This is the symptom that has bothered me the most. At first, every time I felt it I&#39;d grab the flashlight I began keeping next to my bed, and start looking under the covers like a madman trying to figure out what it was. I never found anything, even looking very closely through a jewelers loupe. I never discovered anything.</p>

<p>The crawling sensation is virtually maddening. It frequents certain parts of my body more than others. The part that always alarms me the most is the fact that when I feel these sensations, I can feel my skin rubbing against the blankets, as though something is literally moving along, right underneath my skin, ALWAYS IN BED. I&#39;ve lost countless hours worth of sleep over it, but hey, I&#39;m starting to get used to it. </p>

<p>Now when I feel something I just lay there. I&#39;ve read a lot about Morgellons, and other ailments. We&#39;ve always had a MERCK Manual on hand, and as a family, have always prided ourselves on being at least semi-knowledgeable on issues concerning our health. Just to make things nice and clear.</p>

<p>I bath regularly. I sleep on 500/600 thread count sheets washed <em>and ironed</em> weekly, and every bed in this house in no older than 6 months. My clothing is washed regularly and also ironed, and our house is clean. At first, I started putting natural chemicals on my body before bed. I tried essential oil of cedar, lemon, cinnamon, and eucalyptus. All to no avail until I began to worry that I was poisoning myself and stopped. Now, I just deal with it. Though I&#39;m currently trying to raise my bodies PH to about a 7, maybe even 7.5 (if possible). It is worth mentioning that ever since I started taking Sulforaphane and (bio-available) Curcumin, the symptoms have degraded.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my opinion that the level at which the symptoms/disease present themselves is related to our immune system. A weakened immune system = more intense symptoms. It&#39;s also possible that it&#39;s a variation of a disease that has existed for hundreds of years known as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUOpIjJ2lYM&amp;amp;feature=related">Harsh Hairs.</a> I have never found any lesions, or hairs coming out of my skin, and I pray I don&#39;t. I&#39;m just chalking it up to having a strong immune system (I hope).</p>

<p>EDIT: I also want to add that I&#39;ve gotten a shocking sensation on the tips of my fingers that has woken me up several times. Literally like touching two spikes (-/+) real close together with one finger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa, I hope you never see the lesions either, I didn&#39;t get one until I had to cut my skin open a little because something like a metal splinter got stuck basically all the way in with just the eye sticking out at the pore, like level with it.</p>

<p>But i&#39;ve never felt my skin move on the covers or anything, that would trip me, i&#39;ll probably feel it tonight though since i&#39;ll notice it because of you!  LOL!  Have you tried Nutrasilver?  I&#39;ve heard alot of great things about it and here&#39;s a good message board that really gave me a lot of tips that have eased my symptoms TREMENDOUSLY, the &#39;crawling&#39; sensation was so aggravating/scary when I first felt it, but now if I even look or touch it, I just rub it with the palm of my hand, I feel like scratching might help it spread more like scabies or fleas..  <a href="http://www.morgellons-disease-research.com/Morgellons-Message-Board/">http://www.morgellons-disease-research.com/Morgellons-Message-Board/</a></p>

<p>Alkalinity is a great tool they say too, i&#39;ve also been working on this.  If you want the websites they sent me with herbs to eat to ease the symptoms, PM me and i&#39;ll send it, ever since I started using them they&#39;ve eased.  I talk there because I don&#39;t have anyone else I can talk FULLY about this disease.  I can tell my mom I think I may have it for a few reasons, but i&#39;ve never mentioned the gel on the skin, the ridiculous skin moving, I showed her the fibers on my arm when I first found em and when I showed her wrapping themselves back together (they don&#39;t move like insects or anything, they move like they gravitate sort of towards each other, like maybe hair just going back in place?) but you can even pull a bunch of single ones out from all different places on your body and put em in touching distance of each other, in 10 minutes you pick one up and you pick em all up tangled together.  </p>

<p>The worst feeling I get is the ears, it&#39;s not often or anything but when I feel it, it just feels so disgusting. I do MY BEST to keep my hair out of my eyes, i&#39;m cutting it VERY soon, I just needed to find my hair clippers since i&#39;m afraid of going to the barber with it.  Do you have any hair issues?  Alot of sufferers seem to.  That&#39;s tied for worst feeling, the hair moving, I have long, shaggy hair, and it curls right at the end and I liked it for a while until when I noticed the fibers I started looking on my neck and i&#39;d move my hair out of the way, i&#39;d be damn if I couldn&#39;t literally feel it getting closer or tightening for a lack of a better word closer to my scalp and back into a curl, like trying to get as close to my ears as possible.  Insane.</p>

<p>Like, I said pm me if you want the links or just wanna chat man, because I know what it&#39;s like having this shit and keeping it mostly a secret from people you&#39;re close to because literally it sounds like you&#39;re going crazy.  &quot;Bugs inside you crawling around&quot; with all the other symptoms, Oh and you can&#39;t see any of them except the fibers that look EXACTLY like my hair!</p>

No thanks, there&#39;s currently no known cause, treatment or cure for this disease so there&#39;s no point in visiting a doctor unless he would at least admit that the possibility of morgellon&#39;s MAY be real, but not on such a big scale.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to go to a doctor and be misdiagnosed, especially a doctor who don&#39;t believe in &#39;Morgellon&#39;s&#39; especially now since the CDC said it wa s delusion, but no point really.  Until the doctor at least BELIEVES me about the stuff I find on my skin or in the bath tub after I get out, then hell no, i&#39;ll pass on the doctor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone needs to try the red wine test. It is not necessary to mix it with peroxide in order to extract fibers. Hold some red wine in your mouth for three minutes and spit it into something that will make it easily observable. You can then filter it through something to get a better picture of the fibers. The fibers look like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9TFvh.jpg">this</a>. Here is a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/iZwuM.jpg">closer look</a>. Everyone needs to try this and see for themselves.

    <div class="md"><p>You guess that&#39;s what it is? And you are content with that? What properties does wine have that would cause clumps of skin to detach from your mouth&#39;s inner lining? Acidity? If this is the case then the same should work with something like vinegar, which is far more acidic than wine. As OP pointed out these things have been testing and proven to be inorganic in nature, with no explanation yet as to what it is. The EPA refuses to analyze and identify it, which should tell you something. There is plenty of research that has been done at carnicorn institute. But you don&#39;t even need to look there, it&#39;s in your mouth just try it. Do the wine test and see for yourself, don&#39;t just reassure yourself with explanations you cannot completely validate. I am not trying to trick you. I am not trying to waste your wine or your time. I am just saying that until you try it for yourself and come to your own conclusions that way, you are the one promoting mass hysteria, not us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Swish ANY liquid around your mouth for five minutes and skin inside your mouth will sluff off and consolidate due to the swishing motion. Ever had &#39;wine mouth&#39; or hack up stained phlegm after drinking red wine? It&#39;s from how the wine reacts to mucus and saliva. Basically, your &quot;test&quot; just gives people a severe case of wine mouth.</p>

<p>edit - You might want to look into the effects of tannin in red wine on proteins in saliva. This is why the so-called test works every time.

You cannot do this with ANY liquid, if you had tried it, you would know this. Do it with some water, you will see no such fibers. Your claim that it is tannins reacting with proteins in saliva is also not feasible. I posted about this in <a href="/r/wine">/r/wine</a> to see if they had an explanation and they had the same reply. The problem with this is you can spit into some wine and observe the precipitate and you will see it looks nothing like the fibrous strands that are present after the wine test. You can look <a href="http://khymos.org/wine.php">here</a> where they discuss the chemical reaction and show the precipitate. Seriously, just try it yourself!

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, as I noted above, i&#39;ve yet to meet anyone who hasn&#39;t spit out at least SOME fibers, they might not have symptoms but always fibers.</p>

<p>One thing strange though, my symptoms started after I read about the &quot;Morgellon Detox Baths&quot; and I googled just homemade detox baths I figured it&#39;d be good to clean out my pores and such, my skin felt different the entire next day after that and then I started seeing the fibers, so it&#39;s like the symptoms of it are when it&#39;s being threatened and needs to reproduce, sustain life, or at least it thinks it&#39;s does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t know there was a technique for drawing them out of your skin, thanks for sharing. I have never experienced any symptoms myself, but I came across the red wine test and decided to give it a try and sure enough,there they were. Prior to this I thought that morgellons was something that only a small minority of people suffered from. But now it seems that if this is in fact morgellons, that it is something that resides in all of us to some extend, maybe laying dormant and just replicating. I tryed to post here on just the wine test itself and have others try it and share their experiences, but unfortunately many here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are too skeptical to even spend a few minutes holding some wine in their mouths. I hope your condition improves. Best of luck to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that, i&#39;ve had scabies once, lice once, a bunch of bad rashes, ringworm, and a few other rashes/parasites since I was real little (backwoods country life) and NOTHING has ever even had SIMILAR symptoms, the worse thing besides this I know about developing on my skin was the bulls eye rash from Lyme Disease.  I&#39;d be the first to hope/try and diagnose as ANYTHING else, but what else can it be with these symptoms?  I mean you can explain away 1, 2, 3, 4 even 5 or 6 of the more unique symptoms but there comes a point where you have to look at it and say it&#39;s not a coincidence that 95% of symptoms here i&#39;ve been experiencing since I started having that crawling feeling.  I would definitely love for it to be ANY THING at all else, but the only way I can believe that anymore is it&#39;s some natural occurence we haven&#39;t found out about yet and the cause is something simple yet natural, until they can even tell me why it occurs let alone develop treatments or a cure, I can&#39;t believe that my symptoms are 1 or 2 symptoms of a BUNCH of other afflictions, and I have yet to find a disease with fibers and that sensation of crawling.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I read about it, alot more than just that page and I don&#39;t deem EVERY particle or EVERY hair I have on me as infectious, I know the ones that are not natural and if it&#39;s a spec of dirt then I dust it off.  Wouldn&#39;t that refute the symptom right there, that every/any particle can be and is usually seen as infectious?  I know what is part of my symptoms and what is natural particles or natural skin lines.  The skin lines we speak of are STRAIGHT lines sometimes going the length of the midsection, hip all the way sometimes to the top of the neck, just one straight line.  People have used syringes to stick in the lines and draw back and fibers draw up in the syringe and the lines disappear.</p>

<p>And another thing, I know there&#39;s no bugs or anything alive in my skin (that I know/hope of) that&#39;s also a key symptom, that I believe bugs to be tunneling into my veins, correct?  I didn&#39;t even go through every symptom until I had the skin lines/fibers that bunched together so how could I have had symptom delusion before I knew about the other symptoms?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I don&#39;t mean to be critical, but it seems like confirmation bias abounds with morgellon&#39;s sufferrers. I have met many of them and their symptoms are always in a lull, but then they spike later that week or they just got over an episode. Very few sufferers produce useful media, it&#39;s pretty much the same pictures from site to site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking that too. The only reason I don&#39;t immediately jump to the conclusion that she&#39;s crazy, is because of what I know about and who I know with multiple chemical sensitivity. This is another kind of disease that pretty much everyone in the medical field says &quot;nope, you&#39;re just nuts&quot;. This seems like it should be easier to verify though if you actually get lesions and weird spider webs under your skin... Some of those pictures of sores and rashes look bad. I think if you went to a dermatologist looking like that and didn&#39;t say &quot;I think I have this&quot; they would have to give you some answer other than &quot;go see a shrink&quot;, right? Have you gone to a regular doctor while this was acting up (without giving your input as to what you think it is) and heard what they have to say?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what?  And show them the fibers on my skin?  What do you think they can do for me?  Figure out &#39;why&#39; the fibers are infecting MY body in particular, maybe because it&#39;s parent(s) didn&#39;t grow with them?  I mean really.  Tell me what in my post suggests this.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried &amp; succeeded 2 or 3 times in convincing myself I was just imagining the shit or it was something else, but the symptoms always return, always the same and always look 70-90% like the other pictures documented, but it&#39;s just a good PS job.  </p>

<p>Can you guys explain why you can believe that bin Laden isn&#39;t dead, that the Rockefeller&#39;s and Rothchild&#39;s are trying to dominate humanity, and the Bilderberg&#39;s make every major or semi-major event occur and how this disease, with pictures, videos, microscope pictures ,testimony, and more is SO hard for all of you to believe?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to criticize anyone, before I had ANY symptoms I liked reading about it, but I found it a little hard to believe, even with ALL the evidence.</p>

<p>Just sayin, believe what you want to believe, just try the Red Wine and Peroxide test and spit it in a petri dish or a dish or something and keep it covered and then check it out,  It&#39;ll be a lot worse looking if you have a microscope.  <a href="http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/bio2011-3.htm">http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/bio2011-3.htm</a>  Check that out, that&#39;s a picture of someone who tried the test after the 1st time he heard of Morgellon&#39;s and the Peroxide test and this is what he found in the petri dish, also, it&#39;s <em>verified</em></p>
