    <div class="md"><p>He is not in it for the money, jessh. All this socialist talk crap makes me sick. You got to earn your living somehow, but I mean he&#39;s only been successful the last 2-3 years, so out of 17 years with nothing, to say he is doing it for money is stupid, false and disingenuous.</p>

<p>If he was doing it for money he would have worked at Fox like that AJ copy guy that got fired. I mean that is controlled opposition, forgot his name, but you guys know who I&#39;m talking about, that is a guy working for money. Have less viewers, have less info, not cover topics like FEMA or pretend it doesn&#39;t exist and get tens of millions of dollars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I lived in Austin some years back, I&#39;d watch his show on Austin Access. That was sort of my introduction to the world of conspiracy, and it would scare the crap out of me. Since then, I&#39;ve fallen in with some other theorists, particularly Freeman (who also began on Austin Access Television), who present a more positive, albeit stranger, picture of what&#39;s going on. I know some people respond better to Alex&#39;s energy, and while I respect that, it&#39;s not my cuppa tea. Still, gotta love Alex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting not to take this /r/ seriously because of all the knee-jerk reactionary bias towards Alex (including burying this comment so now it&#39;s a reply)</p>

<p>Snake Oil?</p>

<p>Youngevity was invented by Dr. Joel Wallach, the guy literally wrote the book on modern nutritional medicine, for animals &amp; humans. Every homeopath/naturopath that use organic supplementations of vitamins &amp; minerals is standing on his shoulders. I&#39;ve done months of personal research and haven&#39;t been able to find a better broad spectrum vitamin/mineral/efa supplementation package than the youngevity &quot;90 for life&quot; program and it&#39;s had a dramatic impact on my over all health.</p>

<p>Efoods is another amazing product. I&#39;ve tried several other storable food companies and there is no comparison.</p>

<p>Lifestraw is another must have piece of equipment, especially if you are an outdoorsman. Having a reusable straw shaped filter is worth it&#39;s weight in gold in a sticky situation.</p>

<p>Does that mean that every product Alex pushes is just as amazing?</p>

<p>No, for example from my research Berkey&#39;s are the better filters. Propur&#39;s flow rate in a real emergency situation is nowhere near enough. It requires a full tank to have a real flow, while the berkey does 1 gallon an hour no matter how much water is in the tank. Propur also touts itself as &quot;NSF-42&quot; which only filters heavy metals and other pollutants, it&#39;s not rated for things like protozoa from pond or river water &quot;NSF-53&quot; which berkey is. While I&#39;m sure that propur&#39;s &quot;silver impregnated&quot; filters would most likely kill and filter those buggers as collodial silver is highly effective at that it&#39;s a leap to just trust that. I&#39;m sure propur works great for day to day city water, but in a real emergency you want a berkey.</p>

<p>Is Alex misleading people on the filters? I would say unintentionally but that&#39;s why you should always do your own research!! Something he constantly hammers with people!</p>

<p>Fear mongering?</p>

<p>You know when someone makes this accusation the only instance you can usually corner them on with Alex is Y2k.</p>

<p>If you say Iran and all the times he&#39;s been &quot;wrong&quot; that they were going to attack Iran, look at the news at the time. If you have 2 dozen mainstream publications doing the actual fear mongering. Is Alex a fear monger for reading the writing on their wall and the seriousness of their intention and conveying that to you?</p>

<p>Cancer virus&#39; / sterilants in the vaccines? If you haven&#39;t done your own research and read the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundation docs you have no one to blame but yourself.</p>

<p>The police state? Sure you may be could be excused as ignorant for calling Alex a fear monger on this subject 10 years ago. But now? You have to be living under a rock to not see the writing on that wall. More than any subject too, Alex has had pinpoint ridiculous level precision on. I wish he wasn&#39;t as right as he has been on this subject.</p>

<p>I could keep going but I think you get my point. In fact the AJ bias in the one reddit Alex should have some support is SO BAD; Infowars/prisonplanet could break a huge story that gets buried or barely makes the front page here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. While the EXACT SAME STORY reposted by another site goes right to the top. It&#39;s disgusting and pathetic and petty and really starting to turn me off to this board.</p>

<p>Sure, I agree he could talk about the Jesuits and Zionists more but is that a reason to censor legitimate &amp; important news stories from his sites, or because you don&#39;t like him as a person and how he conveys himself 100% of the time?</p>

<p>Like yahoo_bot has said you don&#39;t need to agree with someone 100% to know through your own verification of their research that most of what someone says is 100% correct.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested in seeing further info on this .  I mean I could do the googling myself, but you seem to be pretty sure on it and so am wondering if you might point me in the direction of the smoking gun info.</p>

<p>Yeah.. because, being prepared for a total meltdown of society when the bankers openly talk about a &quot;post industrial world&quot; of neo-feudalism is a totally self-centered exercise in hoarding money and fooling people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most common complaint I hear about AJ is that his aggressive style is offputting and perhaps a but wearing, and I see their point. But he does perform a valuable role in waking people up. It&#39;s unfair to call him alarmist while so many alarming developments happen on a daily basis. </p>

<p>Infowars and Prisonplanet are excellent news sources, backed up with links to source material. </p>

<p>AJ is human and screws up from time to time, but he has a much better track record than the vast majority of the MSM. </p>

<p>But as he says himself, never take anything at face value and check your sources. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man this is getting ridiculous, 4 posts about AJ in 2-3 weeks. </p>

<p>Look people he&#39;s just a man, doing what he believes in and it just so happens a big percentage of what he says and covers is 100% real. </p>

<p>But you don&#39;t need to agree with him 100%, I don&#39;t agree with anyone 100%, but look at what he says and research it yourself. </p>

<p>He is nothing special, but he isn&#39;t a &quot;controlled opposition&quot; or anything like that. </p>

<p>Is he maybe playing things down with the Jews, yes, we know his wife is Jewish, so obviously there is something there, but he&#39;s talked about bad things they&#39;ve done, he&#39;s talked about Zionism, etc...</p>

<p>I mean its actually pretty ridiculous when for everything that happens people blame Jews, its getting really old. Most of the Jews are actually pretty uninformed and very religious so they have no idea of what is going on. But side issue. </p>

<p>But I know people that are like scared of what he talks, and I mean there is nothing to be scared of, if its true the only things you should be scared of is not stopping or reversing it and if its not true than you have nothing to fear.</p>

<p>But I mean get a back bone and stop living in fear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not take him seriously. I do not consider Infowars and Prison Planet to be legitimate. The reason why I do not them seriously is because it is a bunch of fearmongering and disinfo. You can gather this by looking at everything he says, not taking it seriously, and then laughing when nothing happens. Some shit that he predicts does come true, but anyone who has been paying attention to the news and knows a little about economics and politics could tell you these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has done some very good interviews such as the ones with Aaron Russo and Katherine Austin Fitts. He lets them speak and does not control the interview. Many times I find him to be rather histrionic, narcissistic, and to be a shock jock type of broadcaster. </p>

<p>I now prefer Mike Rivero at Republic Broadcasting Network (RBN). <a href="http://republicbroadcasting.org/">http://republicbroadcasting.org/</a> </p>

<p>Rivero&#39;s website is <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/">http://whatreallyhappened.com/</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like Mike Rivero, but I have issues with three of his positions. 1: Everything&#39;s Israel&#39;s fault. 2: It&#39;s individual greed (&quot;the money junkies&quot;) not a larger globalist plan. 3: He refuses to acknowledge geoengineering/ Chemtrails. </p>

<p>Other than that, I like what he does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s found a formula that works for him.  He shouts, hucks his snake oil products and moves on to the next thing.  That&#39;s all.  I don&#39;t believe 98% of what comes out of his mouth.  Like others, I have tried to listen, but I grew tired EARLY ON of the hollering and smear tactics and his near total lack of patience for anyone who even slightly disagrees with him.  Someone ought to tell him that being loud doesn&#39;t make you right.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if traffic to his site is falling and revenue is falling along with it.  I think that might be part of why there has been an influx of AJ cheerleaders here recently.</p>

<p>If any of them are sincere, they have to realize WE GAVE ALEX JONES A CHANCE.  At first glance, he looked like a truth teller, but closer inspection led to serious disappointment.  Most of us don&#39;t actively badmouth him, but if we&#39;re asked, we&#39;ll explain our reservations about him.</p>

<p>Alex Jones is a half truther, and
Half truths will not set us free...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like he just throws too many ideas that fall flat at you, every video of his is a barrage of information that most people won&#39;t question because of how he presents it, the way his show moves so fast, but if you stop and question it you can&#39;t really walk away from any of it with anything substantial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I view him as the worst kind of conspiracy theorist. He appears to just be cashing in on others that are ill informed but have a general interest in conspiracies. The bulk of what he says is bullshit but he uses a foundation of truth based around corruption and conspiracies and branches all sorts of crazy bullshit off of that.</p>

<p>He makes people with our beliefs look like Dale Gribble from KOTH. </p>
