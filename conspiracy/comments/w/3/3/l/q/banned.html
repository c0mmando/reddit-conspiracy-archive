This is the link I posted.  <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/contributed/2012-07-05/biggest-financial-scam-world-history">http://www.zerohedge.com/contributed/2012-07-05/biggest-financial-scam-world-history</a></p>

<p>The story clearly states that the banks involved are global.  The link does not say anything about US politics.</p>

<p>The message I received is this: you&#39;ve been banned</p>

<p>subreddit message via  <a href="/r/worldnews/">/r/worldnews/</a>  sent 5 minutes ago</p>

<p>you have been banned from posting to <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>: World News [ no US / US Politics news please ].</p>

<p>I request the administration take administration action against the person who banned me, and reinstate my ability to post to worldnews.  I broke no rule, they did.  The banks broke the rules, globally, the effect of that is world wide.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right now the top post in r/pics is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/w3hns/bush_in_zambia/">George Bush hugging a little black kid</a>, with the most amazing case of mass amnesia presenting itself among the comments. Just below that is a pic of a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/w3ftc/on_my_1st_deployment_he_came_in_a_care_package/">soldier in uniform</a> holding a stuffed whale. The top post in r/aww is the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/w360r/military_photographer_caught_this_moment_this_is/">ongoing saga</a> of a middle-aged woman and her deploying husband, complete with professional pic taken (admittedly) by a military photographer. I point this out because it&#39;s a pretty good description of what is going on with reddit. It&#39;s sad really, sadder that most people can&#39;t see how information and opinions are manipulated. Take the banning as a compliment and make a new account. </p>

<p>moderation has ruined reddit - just as it&#39;s owners intended when they bought in order to shut down this uncontrolled bastion of collective free speech and information they didn&#39;t control.</p>

<p>(and no it never made enough money for them to care about revenues more than they cared about Reddit&#39;s collective ability to destroy their other abusive sources of revenue as those things became known from reddit.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a subreddit lets a &#39;newbie&#39; become a moderator, yes. Is that some ruinous scheme for the sake of censorship to you? Because to me, it looks like not giving senior users the ability to break the rules as they please. </p>

<p>You reposted a page-long diatribe about Rick Scott a dozen times on Wednesday alone. That&#39;s pretty spammy. If you want to whine about a politician, tighten it up and don&#39;t just copy-paste the same crap everyone ignored the first time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you don&#39;t know what spam is. Spam is the posting of commercial links.</p>

<p>reposting the same material to multiple places or subreddits where it applies is NOT spam and is SPECIFICALLY allowed in Rediquette.</p>

<p>Posting a detailed FAQ from authoritative sources that are referenced is actually called journalism and being informative.</p>

<p>If I reworded it then it wouldn&#39;t be from those sources would it?</p>

<p>It gets posted when the subject comes up.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like it getting posted so often perhaps your solution is to limit Rick Scott posts by anyone to once a month?</p>

<p>No, that doesn&#39;t sound very logical either does it? Just as limiting an authoritative FAQ about Rick Scott to a random time frequency isn&#39;t logical either.</p>

<p>How old are you BTW?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so you just want to ignore the clear guidelines of redditquette and make up your own interpretation based on nic picking the tone and assuming what is clearly said about posting isn&#39;t what is meant as a general guideline.</p>

<p>Fine.
Why are we talking then?
you think anyone can run reddit whatever way they want now and maybe that&#39;s true.</p>

<p>Reddit is VERY different from what made it so popular. It is not Reddit anymore in any way really. People are in denial about it but it is clear.</p>

<p>It is now a politically correct censored posting forum where the few decide what is and isn&#39;t appropriate for others to talk about.</p>

<p>It is ruined. Now just a fiefdom of people who decide what is and isn&#39;t allowed or proper.</p>

<p>They far overrule the actual voting of redditors now.</p>

<p>So why are you even talking?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand what reddit was and don&#39;t seem to care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying reddiquite is a guideline for how <em>users</em> act, not a bill of rights against the power of moderators. It boils down to &quot;don&#39;t be a shit.&quot; You were a shit. You got banned. Cry me a river. </p>

<p>Also: your interpretation is no less made-up. I read &quot;cross-posted&quot; and I think submissions. You think it includes comments. We disagree. Whoop dee doo. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Anyone can run their subreddits as they please. That&#39;s kind of the point of subreddits. <a href="/r/Science">/r/Science</a> could delete dumb jokes even if reddiquite specifically mentioned dumb jokes. </p>

<p>Wow, you mean a website that started as a few thousand college guys posting news and comments to a communal channel is different from a website where ten million people (admittedly still mostly guys) can post all sorts of crazy shit to a variety of user-created categories? Quelle suprise!</p>

<p>The people and attitudes present in <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> would not survive if reddit was anything like the way it began. Most of them were brilliantly shut down by 911-WAS-AN-INSIDE-JOB and laughed out of popular discussions. Be grateful you have a venue to scream in and don&#39;t get your knickers in a twist if other communities don&#39;t want to hear it. </p>

<p>I signed up a week after you did. Literally seven days later. I have 150,000 comment karma. I&#39;ve been on the front page page both before and after the introduction of <a href="/r/All">/r/All</a>. Moderation is pretty much the only thing I haven&#39;t done here. But do go on - tell me how I don&#39;t understand this site and its history. </p>
