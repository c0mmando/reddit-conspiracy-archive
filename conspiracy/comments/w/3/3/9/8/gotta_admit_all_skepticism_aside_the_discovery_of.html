<p><strong>Okay, it&#39;s not <em>officially</em> the Higgs, my topic is still valid, I believe</strong> :)</p>

<p><strong>Question Two, then: For those whole believe in predictions: Considering that recent discoveries have the potential to significantly alter our current understandings of reality as we know it, and propel our scientific and technological advancement in directions before thought impossible; could the Higgs be the catalyst that starts our path to our new Age those crazy Mayans foretold?</strong></p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t do that, they just hear &quot;omg, <strong><em>they</em></strong> say the world is going to end in 2012 because the Mayans said so, and the Mayans predicted the occurrences of regularly occurring astronomical phenomenon, therefore they&#39;re right.&quot;</p>

<p>The reason all this $$$$$ is pouring into this project is to prove the universe is a real place, that kind of fact is and should be kind of important for intelligent beings to figure out.</p>

<p>Too bad they DID NOT find it, meaning the universe doesn&#39;t exist until someone can in fact find the higgs boson.  But all these cover stories and toungue in cheek bs posts are providing cover for the money spent on finding out that we are all fake along with the fake universe around us.
