        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Tell me where I am wrong. Not because I think I can&#39;t be disproven, but because I want to learn.</p>

<p>Before this week, to hear any major news about a bank being at fault for the state that this world is in, and to hear it on the MSM was a real oddity. But now, it&#39;s all coming out like a fire hose and just today there&#39;ve been several news posts and videos showing the corruption. Heck, even my father who is nearly a FOX News zombie new about &quot;LIBOR.&quot;</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that banks are suddenly being seen for what they are? I don&#39;t think so. I think it&#39;s all apart of their plan. And as I&#39;ve posted before, just another way to play on peoples emotions. It&#39;s your typical Cause, Response, Effect move. Just as it happened right before the Fed was instituted.</p>

<p>Now you have articles <a href="http://rt.com/business/news/banks-crisis-failure-plans-381/">Like this</a>. Oh boy, wouldn&#39;t it be nice to get rid of those top 9 banks. All they&#39;re doing is putting out their dirty laundry so the only thing the masses can do is to jump on the bandwagon and want them destroyed.</p>

<p>And who is honestly going to destroy them? You? Me? &quot;The masses.&quot; Oh, maybe Operation Green light will. Get real. The only people that are going to destroy heavily engrained institutions set up by TPTB <strong>are</strong> TPTB. The media get their orders from them, so why are we hearing about it? Because it&#39;s wanted.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t think for a moment that the system will go back in time; back to the people. Oh no. Just like in 1914, the people wanted to get rid of the top bankers - the money trust - and they put in its place a more powerful regulator to bring salvation back to the people. And who was it then that broke the grip of the money trust? Was it the people? They thought so. Through legislation and the congress; surely representatives of the people.</p>

<p>So it will be now. When the banks are destroyed, it won&#39;t go back to the people, TPTB will offer a solution... yes! a higher bank that resides over all institutions - a world bank. A bank controlled by &quot;all nations.&quot; It&#39;ll be 1914 all over again. The fox will build the hen house, and install the security system.</p>

<p>The only way a bank failure is good is if the derivitves market crashes and we start fresh.  If that doesn&#39;t happen, you are right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, its a ploy to reduce the 16 major banks down to as few as possible, or as you suggested, ONE. Then it will truly be &quot;too big to fail&quot;. If its the only one, the world can&#39;t be run without it (at least that&#39;s what they&#39;ll say when that one fucks the world even harder and gets &quot;caught&quot; for it)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The deepnet is hard to see and somewhat unbrowsable. Bitcoin is all open-source and transactions are transparent... so if a large $800 trillion mega scandal was occurring, you could follow the transaction on <a href="https://blockchain.info/">https://blockchain.info/</a> and see where the money went. 
There are known flaws to bitcoin but it does solve many problem we have with tradition paper/electronic currencies.</p>

This should help.
The flaws that directly affected me were:</p>

<p>1.) The blockchain data adds up, making synchronizing with the bitcoin network a chore.</p>

<p>2.) Your bitcoin wallet is never 100% secure, but it can be made 99.999% secure.(you are always vulnerable to scammers, hackers, trojans, &amp; viruses. Even misplacing your harddrive and/or flashdrive where you wallet is kept) In otherwords ALWAYS KEEP A BACKUP.</p>

<p>3.) Assume everyone online is a scammer after your Bitcoins. I lost 100$+ to online investment scams. They seem truthful and legitimate when hundreds of other join in, only to find out they closed for business and ran away with tens of thousand of dollars: <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MyBitcoin">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MyBitcoin</a> and countless other scams.</p>

<p>4.) You should know standard computer practices like cmd or encyrpting files... if you don&#39;t know what you are doing, you could lose your wallet. oh and never forget your encryption password. <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_Security_Dos_and_Don&#x27;ts_(Windows)">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_Security_Dos_and_Don&#39;ts_(Windows)</a></p>

<p>There are many people who don&#39;t consider my incidents a flaw considering that normal paper currency deals with the same issues, some claim there are flaws with the software, other claims it is with markets, and a few claim it is with not enough transactions. I do not know the technicals, all of that is over my head, but <a href="https://bitcointalk.org">https://bitcointalk.org</a> is where are the cool kids hang and talk of this speculation(beware of download links).</p>

<p>tl&#39;dr: Be skeptical of everything you read relating to Bitcoins (even this) and be caution with who you send your bitcoins to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a curiosity written by Michel de Nostradame ( Nostradamus) circa 1555 AD</p>

<p>VIII 28
Les simulachres d&#39;or et d&#39;argent enflez,
Qu&#39;apres le rapt lac au feu furent iettez
Au descouuert estaincts tous &amp; troublez.
Au marbre escripts, perscripts interiettez.</p>

<p>The copies of gold and silver inflated,
which after the theft were thrown into the lake,
at the discovery that all is exhausted and dissipated by the debt.
All scrips and bonds will be wiped out.</p>

<p>edit, </p>

<p>This is one of the quatrains that existed before the Internet.</p>

<p>I first read it in the early 1970&#39;s.</p>

<p>It seems quite plausible now.</p>

<p>Since the Interwebz there have been many that are wantonly  made up and that don&#39;t fit with the real writings..</p>
