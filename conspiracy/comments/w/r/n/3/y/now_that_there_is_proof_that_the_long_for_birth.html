       I watched the news conference and read the AP article. AP just dances around the issues and really does a good job at spin doctoring the whole conference. The largest point I took from it is that a Hawaiian birth certificate is not proof of being born in the states in the first place, let alone the obvious photoshop butchering. How can so many people not care / overlook this huge issue? What are your thoughts and what do you think should be done about this?

       I hate how an attempt to discuss this is always derailed into a racism thing.  No one gives a fuck what race he is.  He can't be President if he wasn't born here.  Period.

       Maybe you care about the 8th Amendment, but Joe Arpaio doesn't, you probably can't name what it is, and Arpaio didn't give two fucks about Bush/Cheney violating it for 7 years.

       Show me all the other demands for birth certificates from any other presidential candidate.

       McCain was born in Panama.  Supposedly on a military base.  But where was the scrutiny of his birth certificate?

       Did it ever occur to you that some lobbyists DID raise concern over such possibilities, but the paper trail checked out and did not show tremendously obvious signs of editing, and were subsequently quietly dropped due to lack of evidence proving non-citizenship?

       Did it ever occur to you that every candidate put forth by the left/right was actually ineligible by design in order to give us something entirely unimportant to bitch and moan about while a rapid loss of liberty occurs?

       Quote me.  I'm calling you out.  Show me where I said anything like the above statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm calling it racist to question one single candidate's birth certificate, when there is no evidence that any other candidate's birth certificate was ever questioned in our lifetime, and when the party in question making the accusation has an historical track record of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Strategy">
        "The Southern Strategy"
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting words in my mouth like you did is childish, projecting your own stereotype of your perception of an anti-racist onto someone who said no such thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, read all of my comment history and see if you can find
       <em>
        one single positive comment about Obama
       </em>
       .  He might as well work for the Bush Family.  The "Birth Certificate" bullshit is more likely a CIA smokescreen to discredit  legitimate inquiry into Obama's background.  And racist assholes are the CIA's biggest asset in perpetuating their cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just as with Clinton, attacking a president for a blow job instead of indicting him for signing NAFTA &amp; GATT &amp; eliminating Glass-Steagall is a full-of-shit method of impeachment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe
       <em>
        you're the one
       </em>
       who is unable to differentiate &amp; makes sweeping generalizations against others.

       Honestly, I had higher hopes of intellectuals on here. I'm no genius but most of you people are so tunnel visioned and still caught up in the red/blue paradigm that you wouldn't know you were in an internment camp until they turned the gas on. If you think in the terms of race, religion, left wing vs right, know that you need to let go of EVERY preconceived notion you have. Understand why you have them, release your mind from it's own ego. If that makes you laugh or think I'm a nut job, I can only strongly encourage you to further exam yourself. We are all on this sub/r to find the truth, nothing more. So please, for fucks sake, try to entertain a new idea in your brain. If what was said in the press-conference was true the only thing it proves is that the conspiracy can of worms is officially open (far beyond the president).
      </p>
      <p>
       For all of you that think I'm a raciest, I defended one of my best friends (who's black) and took criticism from whites and risked my military career and other friendships to support him. I would do anything for that guy and it has nothing to do with him being black, I give no fucks what color your skin is. Shit, if he had good policies, I think Samuel L. Jackson would make one bad as POTUS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I think Romney is an awful person. I'm going to hate having either fuckers in office. I wish I could pack my bags and move to Iceland. They seem to be the only ones in the whole world who are moving in the right direction.

       Are you even fucking kidding me? How do you know that I'm not black? What the fuck does this have to do with race? Absolutely nothing. You must be a fucking idiot because I'm no genius. I almost agree with the NWO in the fact the the world is full of fucking idiot sheepeople that diverse to be put down so that the human race can advance further than reality TV, McDonald's, and fucktards like yourself.

       Hang on there, cowboy. I've seen the merit in your comments so far, and tend to agree, even if it's with a HUGE grain of salt. But to buy into the birther nonsense and then turn around and tell someone to educate themselves is quite silly. The only reason the president's birth records are in question is because of the public's penchant for media hype and fluff, evidenced by the fact that it refuses to die. I'd suggest you educate yourself in the ways of American sensibilities and priorities.

       You admit that you fail to formulate your own opinion. You calling me a "birther" or simply a "raciest" brings the debate down to a 10 year old level. Honestly, do you not see that? I feel like I'm speaking to a child who rebuttals "my daddy told me so, you're a meanie pop-pop head." Grow the fuck up man. Obviously we can't have a conversation about something that you don't know about....

       You should educate yourself on computer software, and understand how they came to the conclusion that it was a forgery. They scanned in the document with a text recognition software, that rather than creating an image of the text, it scans the document, creates a new layer for the text on the image, and inserts the text. This creates an effect of apparent layering, which most image editing tools do. Arpaio is a sherrif in Maricopa county, Arizona. He has spent exhorbetent amounts of taxpayer money on this extravaganza, mainly to turn the spotlight off of his prison camps, and the terrible job of policing they are doing in Maricopa County. The guy runs prisons as slave camps. I've seen the prison yards so crowded on 100+ degree days, that if you wanted to turn around, you would be face to face with another inmate. 
Inmates are loaned out then to corporations and other "employment opportunities".

       He is an American Citizen, by birth. Born abroad, born in the states, it doesn't matter too terribly much. People say that it isn't about his citizenship, that it is about honesty. To which I have to reply, it's politics, wtf does honesty have to do with it? They'll lie to you like it was second nature, like breathing. Because there are only two real things politicians care about, and that is Money, and Votes. Thanks to citizens united, corporations are speaking loud and clear what kind of country they want America to be.

       You got it.  Arpaio is violating the 8th Amendment on a regular basis.  (For you right-wing fucktards:  The 8th Amendment is
       <em>
        "No Cruel Or Unusual Punishment"
       </em>
       ).

       How better to distract from his Constitutional violations, then by accusing someone else of Constitutional violations?

       No, its about his legitimacy about being the president. That is all. Other issues may be important but should not be in this conversation.

       Spoken like a true right-wing authoritarian fascist, dictating what should and should not be spoken about.

       Typically, you fail to address why you are concerned about violating one portion of the Constitution, but completely disregard all other violations, exactly as you fail to address concerns for
       <em>
        anyone else's birth certificate
       </em>
       .
       <em>
        Res ipsa loquitur
       </em>
       .  That speaks for itself.

       What you didnt seem to get was i was trying to say this issue is unrelated. Im not right wing, i have never voted for a republican. I was trying to steer the conversation to "point a" you are trying to have a conversation about point b or point a and b and how they relate, which personally i don't think they do. Im trying to talk about the god damn video. You all are so quick to judge me. This is r/conspiracy right?
