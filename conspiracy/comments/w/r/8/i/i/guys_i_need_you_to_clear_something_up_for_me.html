    <div class="md"><p>what makes you think the NWO is going to unite the world? surely it is far more profitable to keep different countries, laws and banking systems. after all, how could they profit off war if there were no borders? why would they remove the ability to profit off currency manipulation? and where would their safe havens be without different laws? not to mention how boring the olympics would be without nationalism.</p>

<p>personally, i would prefer a nationless planet operating under an enlightened set of principles with no need for currency at all, with humanity attempting to explore both outer and inner space.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not the idea of the one world government that&#39;s bad, I for one think it is necessary and an inevitability, it&#39;s how its governed that&#39;s the issue.  A one world government a la star trek for example would be a good thing, the supposed &quot;New World Order&quot; is according to many at best a corporatist dictatorship or a 1984-esque totalitarian perpetual war state, at worst Satan ruling this world through proxies, depending on your personal beliefs. </p>

<p>The problem a lot of people have is our perpetual need to divide ourselves into tribes.  I.e. a one world government is bad because we&#39;re &quot;Americans&quot;, rather than recognizing we&#39;re all human beings.</p>

<p>Edit: Ok I have no idea why that first paragraph showed up like that. If someone can tell me how to fix it I&#39;d really appreciate it lol</p>

<p>Edit 2: Thanks proggR lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be so sure. I remember asking the same question myself years ago. The idea of a one government world in itself isn&#39;t bad. But I think people need to be reminded that those who are currently in power are the ones who will be in power in a NWO, and that would be bad for everyone but those who are in power.</p>

<p>Perhaps I&#39;m something of an idealist, but part of me think that in a &#39;worst nightmare&#39; NWO type situation, it would give the people of the world, now united, the power to rise up against those who are pulling the strings. I&#39;ll keep my fingers crossed anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly you are way too black and white for me, Not every government official is evil. And a government that is corrupt and is fucking people over on a global scale would be much easier to over throw than a conglomerate of governments all locked in a web of corruption and politics. You have the incorrect assumption that even if the NWO came and it was completely tyrannical, people wouldn&#39;t rise and fight against it. </p>

<p>Plus its much easier to divide people and stay in power, That&#39;s the whole reason our county representative lines are so fucked up 80% of the time, its in order to divide certain people to retain the power. But if people can focus in on one specific group/government that is oppressing them it is much easier to over throw them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have to ask, who benefits most if this planet is controlled by a single government?
In a perfect world,populated with perfect citizens all 7 billion+ humans on Earth would benefit from the existence of corruption-free world government.
The problem is, those who are currently executing the plans for the NWO are selfish, greedy, psychopaths. The ruling class always has and always will take care of the ruling class.</p>

<p>The consolidation of 200+ nations into one will benefi Joe  Average how? One needs only to look at recent history to understand our leaders are ONLY intreested doing whattever it takes to accumulate  as much wealth and power as they can, while the commoners dutifully play their part by eeking out an existance as wage slaves. (If  he  isn&#39;t already  dead from fighting in one of  dozens of bullshit wars based on lies.) The elites who have led us through the bloodiest century in history of man&#39;s existence are now going to consolidate world government for the benefit of you and I.  Sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They would profit and keep us easier controlled with keeping things the way they are. If what you say is true, then borders and dozens of governments and armies would all be not only beneficial to the ruling class I would go as far as to say its necessary.</p>

<p>Uniting people under a one world ANYTHING would not be beneficial to anyone who wishes to be corrupt, selfish, and remain in power. Please and I am not being sarcastic, prove me wrong.</p>

<p>Edit: To answer your original answer, we all would benefit. Could it be that maybe humanity wasn&#39;t ready to meet on common ground? All these terrible TERRIBLE things that have happened to us, war, famine, population control. Instead of viewing this as the elite simply playing God with a magnifying glass with ants try to think maybe this is the unfortunate evil we have to go through in order to reach a level of sustainability, a point where we all could prosper.</p>

<p>Look Rockefeller himself said that he is working against the best interests of the united states, which honestly makes sense. This country is a warmongering shit hole, maybe the strings his family pulls in the united states are simply being pulled to bring this young, arrogant, violent empire to an end and to help bring its citizens into the same level as everyone else. No one is better, no flags to be proud of except that of Humanity, no borders to defend, except possibly from outside intruders, a world where the two major super powers (with the most nukes) don&#39;t go around flexing their war-dicks.</p>

<p>Coincidentally we are slowly entering that kind of world, Russia and the US will enter in war and both empires will fall, people will unite under the NWO and we will look back at all of the battles we waged on ourselves and laugh at our arrogance of being a young evolved primate species who have JUST THEN began to discover their role in this vast universe.</p>

<p>TL;DR - The people playing the very decisive game of chess with humanity, are maybe playing for our best interests.</p>

<p>And spare me the downvotes, If you have something of substance to truly prove what I&#39;m saying to be completely incorrect then please do so. You wouldn&#39;t want to parade around acting like an idiot, neither would I. 
So I say this with no sarcasm what so ever, don&#39;t just click a button to disagree with me, actually think for yourself and respond with your counter argument. =) Thanks!</p>
