A department of corrections source has him cited for UNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF SCHEDULED DRUG (D)- 3 counts. His earliest release date is 7/31/12, but he could be in there for approximately one year. A district court source from March has him incarcerated for &quot;operating while license suspended or revoked&quot; and &quot;violating condition of release,&quot; so he does have a prior arrest record. However, before writing him off as a criminal, I&#39;d like to remind you that he was arrested FOUR days after breaking the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/uqlq9/reddit_i_think_there_is_a_giant_nuclear_coverup/">nuclear cover-up story.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t post much, I prefer to lurk, but I felt a need to reply here. I don&#39;t know why but over the past few days I have been thinking the same thing... When you put this all in perspective, it was pretty damn remarkable what this kid accomplished. Whatever happened in Michigan wasn&#39;t suppose to be in the news and it damn sure wasn&#39;t suppose to get the amount of attention it got..</p>

<p>He hit a nerve, it stirred something up. People began asking questions, people who normally only give a shit about cat pictures and shitting on religion, if only for a moment were unified in finding out wtf was going on in the world. The world you don&#39;t see in commercial media...</p>

<p>All of a sudden, news articles are popping up, others who had similar thoughts and ideas spoke up and weren&#39;t labeled as a crazy conspiracy theorist.. Despite the shills or AstroTurfers best attempts people wanted a real answer... </p>

<p>OCDTrigger, regardless if he intended to or not gave a glimpse to how powerful an outlet like reddit can be, for getting some fucking answers every now and then.</p>

<p>and then hes gone...... OCDTrigger is easy to label, easy to write off, easy to call crazy. But he stumbled on something, stuck with and got the internet to take a real look.... This guy needs to be found, he deserves to be checked up on after what he accomplished... I really wish a thread like this got to the front page instead of the same stupid shit that&#39;s always there... Even if it did tho and people started asking questions, I have a gut feeling his account would post, but it wouldn&#39;t be him and all this will just fade away... </p>

<p>TL:DR OCDTrigger Deserves to be found..</p>

<p>Anyway, OCDTrigger is just stuck on a really long layover at the Denver airport. I invite everyone here to come see him. When you arrive to the airport go to the American Airlines counter for International Flights. When there, ask for Frank, then tell him you need a &quot;Gate D&quot; pass. When he ask who you&#39;re seeing, just tell him you are friend of OCDTrigger. From there take the train to Gate C, walk up to stall 31 and show them your Gate D pass and they&#39;ll take you down to the D Gate train. When stepping off the D-Gate train, I&#39;ll be waiting with a small escort team (for your safety) to take you Area 14, the executive lounge where OCDTrigger is. All here are welcome to join us for a drink or two. </p>

The guy made everyone look at a strange event that was I do in fact believe covered up. Still not sure what and I doubt anyone will. It is shame...it shows us the patriot act in action. Speak up...get people to AWARE and bam. See yah. It is very weird world we live in. I have to many i care for...so i stay quiet and watch. Do quiet research so I at least no what is going on.  </p>

<p>As far as testing them, you likely already have something radioactive in your home, for example a smoke detector, or we have these old coleman lantern bags from a couple decades ago that work well (the new ones are no longer radioactive)</p>

<p>If you&#39;re super serious about it you can order materials to test with online.  You can also use these samples to calibrate devices, if you know what you&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for something simple that you don&#39;t have to put a lot of thought into, and something that is super portable, I would go with one of these:</p>

<p>Edit:  Also it&#39;s not hard to get a name and phone number but I won&#39;t bother to call.  After looking at this shit for half an hour I&#39;m convinced he&#39;s just a dude and for whatever reason stopped posting to reddit.  We ought to let him be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not to sure how it works but has anyone been able to find out about what charges he had? I&#39;m thinking if he was visited by some member of an agency to scare him they might be forcing him to not use a computer as part of an agreement...there was a UFO investigator / hacker named Gary McKinnon (spelling) who is now banned from computer usage.  Seeing as ocdtrigger appeared to be American, it would be much easier for an agency to squelch any further info leaked.  Seems a lot easier for Americans to be silenced   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The AMA states it was &quot;one month&quot; ago. After one month it goes to &#39;two months&#39; making it hard to pinpoint.</p>

<p>My original post was 27 days ago and the nuclear coverup was 13 days b4 that, so the nuclear post happened 40 days ago, and he was  arrested somewhere b/w 1 to maybe 8 days after that post. So that puts his AMA in the back of a cop car post somewhere b/w 32-40 days ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotta say...I love the collective of reddit and the internet. Together things get pieced together. Kinda like the 911 stuff. That is why I enjoyed the OCtrigger thread to begin with. To see him and other redditors trying to figure out what was going on instead of being told by CNN that nothing was wrong etc. I don&#39;t trust news anymore. How can we? So it is cool seeing you guys pulling facts to find him. Good luck</p>

<p>He was always online and seemed to be always awake.  He was a bit paranoid but used it constructively.  He latched onto the one issue and obsessed over it... Maybe he was a tweaker and got arrested buying more speed.</p>

<p>Or maybe the NSA has him... who knows... just what first came to my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Should we actually be bothered and do something about this? I mean at my time of writing this is on 122 points, when it deserves to be seen by everyone ever if this shit has actually gone down. Which it&#39;s looking lke it has. And that bothers me. Are there any rules apart from social boundaries preventing us from creating multiple accounts to use on this post to bring it into fruition? As otherwise it&#39;ll be buried and forgotten about, and OCDTrigger will have lost his only source of help in a time where his life or livelihood is possibly being threatened? I know this would bring in complaints about false karma which will develop a culture of false popularity and shit posts etc etc and how you can&#39;t be arsed to in all truth. But if he/she has just disappeared after revealing some genuine information we should actually be raising an eyebrow at, should we not at least try?</p>
