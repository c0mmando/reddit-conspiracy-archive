      <p>
       With all this shit being passed, can we have an intelligent discussion on the following points:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why would he pass these now? Why have no other presidents signed these before him?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What should be the plan of action for when he starts to act upon these orders?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How can executive orders be removed?
        </p>

       I agree. Why all of this massive preparation that seems aimed either at major war, major depression, or a police state. There is NO good reason to have this huge assumption of authority, at this time. But if you couple this with the massive upsurge of drones over the US, and the endless overseas wars which the population cannot stop, you can guess which of the three aims is likely,
      </p>
      <p>
       I refute the right of this president to impose all of this, and if EO 11002 comes to require a forced implantation of a chip, I reject that. 11002 seems to be revival of the National ID scheme that's been fought already.

       Something really drastic will occur soon. It will be global.

       I pretty much agree. The agendas being pushed in the highest places have nothing to do with the rights of the people or their welfare, and everything to do with consolidating power in a few hands globally. If we cannot stop this, and if we cannot demand accountability from our corrupt government, then the future is bleak.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very likely that global finance is being allowed to fail in order to bring down entire economies and thereby open the means for removing democracy, and instituting a global police state. In the process, many will end up dying, but that meets the needs of the elite. Some say, why would they kill off their customers? One answer is, they already have enough wealth that they don't need us, and we are just useless resource consumers they want out of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fear that things are very much getting close to a major transition, an evil one. Many of you have a gut feeling something bad is coming. I believe that is correct. I wish I knew how we could combat this, but the dark forces are well infiltrated. We must find a way to buy time to fight this.  In the bad times to come, don't give up. but don't be foolish either.  Finally, knowledge is one weapon; spread what you find is truth, fight lies, and resist crime and corruption.

       What they don't realize yet is that they will fail. Not to say it will be bloodless or easy, Because it won't. It will be brutish and nasty.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they live in a flawed model that is at odds with decency and how the universe actually is supposed to work. Darwinism is a handy tool to understand war and competition for resources.  There is another model however, one of cooperation, coexistence, love and compassion.
      </p>
      <p>
       When one looks at what strategy is likely to succeed over time while bringing the most benefit and growth, it is not competition or war.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the opposite. Love.

       I would like to say that is the way, but in the end I think the family that is behind all of this and which always has been, needs to be dealt with. And that will not involve love. They are in their principles among the most evil people on the globe. They have protected themselves and it will take more than flowers to bring them down.

       It is not flowers that will bring them down.

       While I have perhaps intellectually moved past that, there are times I can not. During those periods of frustration and anger I can resort to foul language. And foul disposition. I have been on the road to "truth" a very long time, not something most wish to try to partake in.

       That there are conspiracies, but not
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       is a conspiracy. It's a side people hate, and not many agree with, but it's how I feel about it. I think there are
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       things that can be best described by Hanlon's Razor.

      <p>
       I've lived a life of being ridiculed for my belief in government cover-ups and conspiracies, and when I see people who (to me) make everyone who believes in real conspiracies look like nutjobs, it really irks me.

       I can understand that completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I would mention is that while it is certainly true that the pen is mightier than the sword... As it should be...
      </p>
      <p>
       The sword does have it's place and is never pretty.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it is normal for the user of the pen to be revolted by the wielder of the sword. Reality dictates we need both at some points.

      <p>
       Try to focus on the goals of my mission. I'll do the same for you. I gather they are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us both recognize the need for both. Much like political government and military force each play a part.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, as you likely know and apparently pointed out, each have a place and are needed.

       Can each do better toward a common goal?

       Much of this stuff is new to me. Some is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the new stuff, I honestly believe something will happen soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it is not as simple as a Mayan calendar, biblical prophesies or the disintegration of modern militaristic society.
      </p>

       I sense something more profound. I easily could be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I wasn't wrong on 9/11, the wars and a devolution to the police state.  From day one.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I tend to listen to my inner intuitions. Even when they are painful, lonely and the cause of furious anger.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I feel that someone must be on guard. Ready to be rude and shout "halt!" I wish that guy was not me.

       I get the rude part completely. I have even explained my poor rationale for it. Moving on to something happening soon...
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had asked me 2 months ago, I would have responded just like you. For many years I felt the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       I considered it absolutely ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let me offer my personal experience on this here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has happened to me before. I read, saw, researched and understood many things quickly after 9/11. What I understood was insane to the common man/women I knew in all my circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same was true for Iraq, and to a lesser extent, Afghanistan. The economic collapse. Birth of the police state. Yet my compass was always true. It picked these things up and gave direction. The chatter, info and sources that led me to see a different world than most, at the time, that was accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the first time since then, I sense a very similar thing going on.  Can I post it here and illuminate it clearly for all and make awakening occur? Likely no, just as with 9/11 and middle eastern wars. I did try at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there is a lot of bullshit around 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       But. My spidey sense is screaming. Once again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe what you will.  I am concerned greatly. It is from hours upon hours of reading and digesting.  Just like before.

       Well that's the only thing I'm saying - is just the message being so vague is what's mocked. I apologize if it seemed I was judging
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       at all, I really was only concerned with the way you approach your comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just have seen too much ridicule come my way because of other people being so brash, when it's so easy to just state your point without being that way.

       As I said, we all have our parts to play.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brash or not. As long as it is being thrown about, it is productive and useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       It drives discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politeness is no longer my primary concern. That would be very naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I respect gentle approaches, I also see where they fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I augment them.  Provide heavy handed security. A dose of blowback.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, like Ghandi, Jesus, Budda, Confucius and Mohammed... There are enlightened academic paths to righteousness. They lead the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also the reality of the struggle to get there. To actually win battle instead of just stating why there is conflict. Unlike them, some must be foot soldiers with bayonets. Thrusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even good has it's yin and yang. How could it be different?
      </p>
      <p>
       Idealism can not just be ideas. Or it is useless in practicality.

       I got that long ago. Did you get any of what I said about that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it is just as important. If not more so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake this is a war of ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       While we absolutely need analysts with calm voices and minds, we also need other types of strength and abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       War is never fair nor lovely.  And this is a war. Of ideas, values and truths.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good versus evil. Wrong versus right. Decency versus indecency.
      </p>
      <p>
       You expect it to be bloodless and bleached white?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope. It will play out ugly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you surprised to see a damaged warrior fighting for truth and good leaving no holds barred? Imperfect as he may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I am misunderstanding your depth of understanding here. If so, I am sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       But realize, my gloves came off long ago. I no longer feel the need to respond to indecency decently.  Get it?

       Alas, I am, but I'm also not spelling out doom with my comments. Being vague isn't the issue, it's being vague when blindly stating
       <em>

       that starts to be ridiculed, is all I'm saying.

       But if it already exists, then why was there any need to reissue it, with changes?  They didn't have chip implants in 1962. And therefore it's not all the same.

       It is interesting that not one single source of criticism on the web of EO11002, out of the many I've seen, links to any EO text besides the Kennedy one, and it appears there is no information anywhere directly pointing to Obama signing of EO11002. I will have to dig deeper on this, as none of the large number of articles on EO11002 actually cite a verifiable federal signing by Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, all EOs signed by Obama are in the 13000 series of numbering and none are 11xxxx.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also see claims Obama has signed over 900 EOs, and that number is bogus. So something's not right in all this.

       Executive orders are numbered sequentially and don't repeat. The only EO 11002 there is is the one Kennedy signed. If a new President wants to 'own' an Order his predecessor gave, he reissues it as a new order with whatever tweaks he wants and signs it. The 'No assassinations' order gets treated like this, new President signs a new one even though the old one is in place. I
       <strong>
        <em>
         think

       the 11002 claim is bullshit, but if there's an out that can make the story, it's probably something along those lines.

       These are all Kennedy Executive Orders from the early 60's. For example, the Emergency Registration one (11002) can be read at:
       <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=58941">
        http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=58941

       and deals mostly with the postmaster general and change of address cards in a disaster (these are specifically mentioned). Nothing about microchips
      </p>
      <p>
       None of these are from Obama.

       I've spent the last bit reading these executive orders.  The synopses accompanying each order in the original post are taking significant liberties when interpreting the words of the order.  My favorite is the summary of Executive Order 10998.  The OP went overboard: no mention of individual stockpiling of food is mentioned, let alone the size or duration of a "hoard," or any action that may be taken against citizens storing food.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's trippy stuff in these orders, but the OP is far from credible.  Makes it difficult to have constructive conversation.

       Couldn't this all be in response to the massive criticism of bush after Katrina? Not to say it couldn't be misused, but it seems in line with that kind of post-issue reactionism  that the U.S. government is famous for.

       You were actually right. Even though Kennedy signed the original orders, Obama signed order 13603 implementing them.

       13603 does not implement any of these. It's a freestanding order. You can read it at

       That's the section you're talking about. Most of the previous text deals with them prioritizing contracts already entered in to, and getting emergency funds to buy needed things. Here's the thing. It's just setting rules for it. This power already exists and has since the founding of our country. Hell, you're even probably familiar with it on a small scale. How many cop shows/movies have you seen where an officer in pursuit of a suspect has to commandeer a car?
      </p>
      <p>
       In WW2 the US government took over factories and turned them into military production. It also controlled distribution:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Tires were the first item to be rationed by the OPA, which ordered the temporary end of sales on 11 December 1941 while it created 7,500 unpaid, volunteer three-person tire ration boards around the country. By 5 January 1942 the boards were ready. Each received a monthly allotment of tires based on the number of local vehicle registrations, and allocated them to applicants based on OPA rules.[4]:133 The War Production Board (WPB) ordered the temporary end of all civilian automobile sales on 1 January 1942, leaving dealers with one half million unsold cars.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Civilians first received ration books—War Ration Book Number One, or the "Sugar Book"—on 4 May 1942,[7] through more than 100,000 schoolteachers, PTA groups, and other volunteers.[4]:137 A national speed limit of 35 miles per hour was imposed to save fuel and rubber for tires.[5] Later that month volunteers again helped distribute gasoline cards in 17 Atlantic and Pacific Northwest states.[4]:138 To get a classification and rationing stamps, one had to appear before a local War Price and Rationing Board which reported to the OPA (which was jokingly said to stand for "Only a Puny A-card"). Each person in a household received a ration book, including babies and small children who qualified for canned milk not available to others. To receive a gasoline ration card, a person had to certify a need for gasoline and ownership of no more than five tires. All tires in excess of five per driver were confiscated by the government, because of rubber shortages. An A sticker on a car was the lowest priority of gasoline rationing and entitled the car owner to 3 to 4 gallons of gasoline per week. B stickers were issued to workers in the military industry, entitling their holder up to 8 gallons of gasoline per week. C stickers were granted to persons deemed very essential to the war effort, such as doctors.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       as well as:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As of 1 March 1942 dog food could no longer be sold in tin cans, and manufacturers switched to dehydrated versions. As of 1 April 1942 anyone wishing to purchase a new toothpaste tube had to turn in an empty one.[4]:129-130 Sugar was the first consumer commodity rationed, with all sales ended on 27 April 1942 and resumed on 5 May with a ration of one half pound per person per week, half of normal consumption. Bakeries, ice cream makers, and other commercial users received rations of about 70% of normal usage.[7] Coffee was rationed nationally on 29 November 1942 to one pound every five weeks, about half of normal consumption, in part because of German U-boat attacks on shipping from Brazil.[10] By the end of 1942 ration coupons were used for nine other items.[4]:138 Typewriters, gasoline, bicycles, footwear, Silk, Nylon, fuel oil, stoves, meat, lard, shortening and oils, cheese, butter, margarine, processed foods (canned, bottled, and frozen), dried fruits, canned milk, firewood and coal, jams, jellies, and fruit butter were rationed by November 1943.[11] Many retailers welcomed rationing because they were already experiencing shortages of many items due to rumors and panics, such as flashlights and batteries after Pearl Harbor.[4]:133

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There are perfectly legitimate reasons for the government to step in and control distribution. If it's less then a fucking world war, I'll be right there with you throwing a level 20 shitstorm. But I'm not going to pretend like its outrageous to have a procedure in place if it needs to happen.

       In the end and in practice, doesn't 11360 do basically the same things as the original JFK orders though? And having designated the authority to implement them, won't it now be much faster to actually do it?

       Not really. 11360 Sets up a few things: Funding for agencies during Emergency and Defense incidents, production and service priorities (this includes the seizing that gets conservatives on twitter in a tizzy), hiring rules and practices, and liaison with congress/OMB (because of the spending).
      </p>
      <p>
       It deals with agency function. most of the Kennedy orders deal with agency policies, such as the Postmaster General one with change of address cards so no one falls through the cracks and gets abandoned.

       I saw that, but I'm a little confused by that too. The only other executive orders referenced that that one are in this section:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sec. 803. Authority. (a) Executive Order 12919 of June 3, 1994, and sections 401(3)-(4) of Executive Order 12656 of November 18, 1988, are revoked. All other previously issued orders, regulations, rulings, certificates, directives, and other actions relating to any function affected by this order shall remain in effect except as they are inconsistent with this order or are subsequently amended or revoked under proper authority. Nothing in this order shall affect the validity or force of anything done under previous delegations or other assignment of authority under the Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        (b) Nothing in this order shall affect the authorities assigned under Executive Order 11858 of May 7, 1975, as amended, except as provided in section 802 of this order.
       </p>
       <p>
        (c) Nothing in this order shall affect the authorities assigned under Executive Order 12472 of April 3, 1984, as amended.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sec. 804. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
       </p>
       <p>
        (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Most of that order sets up Presidential Advisory boards and tells agencies what they can buy and who they can hire during a disaster or conflict.

       One would have to go back through those named EOs and check what they say too. And those will have references to other EOs, and on and on. That's one of the tricks of enacting laws. It's intentionally made almost impossible to see what laws effect what.

       I wont dispute that, but you made the assertion that 13603 was what implemented these. I'm saying from a reading it doesn't seem like that. Can you point me to how you arrived at the conclusion? I'm not telling you you're wrong, law is arcane after all. Im just trying to see where you got the thought because it's not one I've had reading through it.

       It is a clusterfuck of control. Now, even though the EO itself doesn't state I will take your farm equipment, it allows other agencies to have the power to take your equipment in a time of emergency. Which our country has been in since 2001. So the question is, when will he give the OK to start these procedures?

       This means that you
       <strong>
        are
       </strong>
       a part of that site. "Apart" means separate. So, that sentence says you are not separate. You want "

      <p>
       Really, you should use "from" with "apart", as in "I am not apart from...".

       I get the rude part completely. I have even explained my poor rationale for it. Moving on to something happening soon...
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had asked me 2 months ago, I would have responded just like you. For many years I felt the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       I considered it absolutely ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let me offer my personal experience on this here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has happened to me before. I read, saw, researched and understood many things quickly after 9/11. What I understood was insane to the common man/women I knew in all my circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same was true for Iraq, and to a lesser extent, Afghanistan. The economic collapse. Birth of the police state. Yet my compass was always true. It picked these things up and gave direction. The chatter, info and sources that led me to see a different world than most, at the time, that was accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the first time since then, I sense a very similar thing going on.  Can I post it here and illuminate it clearly for all and make awakening occur? Likely no, just as with 9/11 and middle eastern wars. I did try at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there is a lot of bullshit around 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       But. My spidey sense is screaming. Once again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe what you will.  I am concerned greatly. It is from hours upon hours of reading and digesting.  Just like before.

       I got that long ago. Did you get any of what I said about that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it is just as important. If not more so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake this is a war of ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       While we absolutely need analysts with calm voices and minds, we also need other types of strength and abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       War is never fair nor lovely.  And this is a war. Of ideas, values and truths.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good versus evil. Wrong versus right. Decency versus indecency.
      </p>
      <p>
       You expect it to be bloodless and bleached white?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope. It will play out ugly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you surprised to see a damaged warrior fighting for truth and good leaving no holds barred? Imperfect as he may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I am misunderstanding your depth of understanding here. If so, I am sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       But realize, my gloves came off long ago. I no longer feel the need to respond to indecency decently.  Get it?
