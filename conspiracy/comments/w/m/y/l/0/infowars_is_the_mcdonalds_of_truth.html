Almost daily you guys make me think.... That said I need to ask what&#39;s up with all the shameless Alex Jones promoting/blind trust? Every statement he makes is truth  and every fabricated article is posted. If someone dares call out AJ they&#39;re down voted  and mocked . </p>

<p>Not saying that people can&#39;t like who they want but the Infowars crap almost discredits the tireless effort some of you put into your research and unique theories.</p>

<p>What&#39;s my problem? Why am I raining on your parades? You see the sooner you realize AJ is a capitalist,egomaniac, disinformation agent and the sooner you understand that the sooner you can FIGHT the powers that be, instead of argue about 911 and Y2K. (yeah Alex had a lot of people scared for nothing)</p>

<p>How do I know AJ is bullshit?
 One- he&#39;s alive. 
Two- show me a clip where he questions/connects the United States of Israel.......</p>

<p>I gotta stop you right there.  This is faulty logic.  It&#39;s basically saying, &quot;I know this information is false, because if it were true, I wouldn&#39;t know about it.&quot;   </p>

<p>It&#39;s very risky business, even for the government to just kill anyone who reveals secret information.  Especially when the individual revealing the information has gained some notoriety.   Killing him would only add credibility to his claims.  It would be better to co-opt him, infiltrate his inner circle and then corrupt the message than it would be to kill him.  Which is what they typically do with people like Alex Jones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He WAS co-opted. I wish I wasn&#39;t on a restricted connection, but in his doc about Bohemian Grove, a senator(?) he was trying to interview basically outs him as having made an agreement to get that footage himself, and that he&#39;s in violation of that agreement by talking about the Grove with another member publicly. </p>

<p>This is on Jones&#39; own doc... smoking gun pointing at his compromised position if you ask me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They killed Kennedy and got away with it.   They got away with 9/11.  And the public is so convinced of the official stories of both of those events that, it&#39;s not going to change anything and hasn&#39;t changed anything if Alex Jones sells some DVDs.   </p>

<p>Why take the risk and expend any resources on a cover up, when you don&#39;t have to.  Besides, keeping him alive apparently convinces you that the information he provides is false.  If they killed him, would you then be inclined to believe everything he&#39;s said?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>...and that&#39;s my point.</p>

<p>The people in charge of keeping government secrets away from the public know this too.  They are aware that if people who argued that 9/11 was an inside job started mysteriously dying, that a lot more people would start taking their claims seriously.  They know this, and that&#39;s why they won&#39;t kill someone like Alex Jones.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t agree with you.  Look, AJ says a lot of true things, but he also supports a lot of whacked out nonsense too.  He discredits himself by not focusing on the things he can prove, but instead going for every conspiracy theory possible, all to sell more DVDs.   </p>

<p>Look, what I&#39;m saying is, why should the &#39;powers that be&#39; feel intimidated by him at all?  They control the corporate media, anything he says that&#39;s of any value won&#39;t make it to the mainstream public in the first place.  Honestly I don&#39;t believe they have any fear of Alex Jones.  </p>

<p>When it comes to JFK, 9/11 and all that, let&#39;s just face it.  They got away with it.  And Alex Jones&#39; DVDs aren&#39;t going to change that.  Why kill a man and expend the resources on a coverup when you don&#39;t have too.   </p>

<p>Most might be doing this by accident, but some could be said to do it as a preventative feature. That way, it makes them easy to discredit and makes them less of a threat to the power structure to the point where an accident is necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If AJ is too much plant rant for you, try The Mark David Show on Monday 11pm Eastern on wromradio.net.  It&#39;s similar subject matter as AJ only delivered in a much more entertaining, digestable manner, and not long winded like Joe Rogan.  Plus there are great interviews with comedians, cops, ect.  AJ does have good news sometimes, but he&#39;s so biased and the ranting....who can handle it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he is part of the recent organization towards giving people truth to ensure that the proper dissent takes place. If the New World Order plans are real, then these protests have been planned for a while. The problem is that the truth he let&#39;s out is a specific version of the truth, so all of his followers have their hearts in the right place, they just seem like they&#39;re missing a bigger, crazier picture. It sounds pretentious, and I am not claiming to &quot;know more&quot; than an infowars reader, or any other of my fellow humans for that matter, but it seems like that is the deal.</p>

<p>Alex Jones is the McDonalds of Truths!
- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjLgCu-K42U">Supports Israel</a>
- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAgTFWglHrc"><em>Caused</em> Chaos during Y2K</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_William_Cooper">William Cooper</a> broadcasted <a href="http://www.hourofthetime.com/wordpresstest/?page_id=7576">over 1900hrs of TRUTH over Short-Wave Radio from 1992 - 2001</a>.
- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r8rFNDh9WQ&amp;amp;feature=related">Exposed Alex Jones as a Fear Monger</a>
- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrTjPGy2k_U">He predicted 9/11</a>
- [Did the most <em>fair and balanced</em> 9/11 broadcast in which he did an EPIC 8hr broadcast (he usually just did an hour at night)](<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eE5mzQrVXo">www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eE5mzQrVXo</a>)
- <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/s4gq4/the_religion_of_the_illuminati_freemasons_this_is/">Revealed more about the mystery schools and the religion of the illuminati and freemasons than anyone else (except maybe <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmOit3B1vKs">Ralph Epperson</a>)</a></p>

<p>Before he was <a href="http://www.cassiopaea.org/cass/cooper.htm">murdered in entrapment by police</a> he was involved as the leader of the largest civillian intelligence gathering service, recieving mass amounts of information everyday.  He was a militia man.  He was the cofounder of the constitution party.  Believed in <strong>RESTORATION</strong> not <em>revolution</em>.  </p>

<p>William Cooper, in my opinion, is perfect model of how to measure a man in this life.  If you are looking for truth, and a new perspective on this life and everything that happens in it, <a href="http://www.hourofthetime.com/wordpresstest/?page_id=7576">give it a listen and gimme a message</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whats wrong with capitalism? are you a Commie like Obama? another thing Alex may have a big additude but he who dares wins and fortune favors the bold so go big or dont go at all. infowars does good research in eugenics and government false flags and they get good guests. i like the show when alex isn&#39;t jibbering and screaming but he does come from the heart during the screaming jibbers. I know his history with Y2K but he&#39;s really grown up from that kid in a public channel room with a mic and theory. all in all i think hes doing his best with what he&#39;s got and Maybe it is Mc D&#39;s of truth atleast it ain&#39;t reptilian space alien bullshit. Pro christian Pro Family Pro Humanity Nationalistic patriotism minus the government worship Im all for it i wish more talk show radio host held that platform shit thats why i loved Ron Paul before the endorsement fiasco.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They killed Kennedy and got away with it.   They got away with 9/11.  And the public is so convinced of the official stories of both of those events that, it&#39;s not going to change anything and hasn&#39;t changed anything if Alex Jones sells some DVDs.   </p>

<p>Why take the risk and expend any resources on a cover up, when you don&#39;t have to.  Besides, keeping him alive apparently convinces you that the information he provides is false.  If they killed him, would you then be inclined to believe everything he&#39;s said?   </p>
