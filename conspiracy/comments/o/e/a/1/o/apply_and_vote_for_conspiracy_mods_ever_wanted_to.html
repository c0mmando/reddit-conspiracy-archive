I&#39;ve seen nothing but complaints about the latest changes, and the community will always have a voice in any of my subreddits.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m taking applications: if you want to be a mod, please post your qualifications, why you want to be a mod, and how you would moderate <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I will take into consideration upvotes (but not absolutely). I will also be trying to strike a balance -- there is always controversy in a subreddit like this, and I want to make sure all sides are represented.</p>

<p>Everyone from ambiversive down has been removed as a mod. They are NOT banned from being a mod, but they will have to apply here like everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Furthermore, the foods you have stated that you enjoy only exist because of exchanges and mixing of various cuisines over the course of thousands of years of history. Nor is your enjoyment of these foods in line with your idea of homogeneity as you are allowing yourself to mix your tastes with other groups. To be truly homogeneous would mean that you would need to forgo all modern innovation and live in isolation. Finally, the most homogenous groups are those reviled most by white supremacists, like the jews, gypies and other tribal groups throughout the world who have not assimilated or &quot;mixed in&quot; with the larger sovereign powers. Thus, the homogenous groups you are referring to consist essentially of groups of people who were at some point subverted by those more powerful and assimilated. In other words, the only way to achieve true homogeneity is by continued mixture--to a point where differences become invisible.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how someone can have this view point yet be so virulently anti-Zionist. The main and most basic tenet of Zionism is to have a state for which Jews to live in the way they want to live. With their own food, culture, music, literature, ect. Just like Italy for Italians, Sweden for Swedes, Ireland for the Irish. You essentially have a Zionist ideology expect instead of having Jews in mind you&#39;re thinking about Irish, French, German, ect. </p>

<p>Granted, you can still be a Zionist and be against Israels treatment of the Palestinians, or for a Palestinian state. To say though you are anti-Zionist means you would not want a state for Jewish people under any circumstances. You can&#39;t really hold this opinion while at the same time advocating that Italians should have their own state for Italians, Swedes should have their own state for Swedish people.</p>

<p>I know it is. The Jewish Paradox kind of blows my mind anymore though.   </p>

<p>What is the point of a Jewish state when most of the wealthiest, most influential and powerful Jews in the USA/world don&#39;t live there and probably never will? Why is Israel the only nation allowed to practice National Socialism?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So? I could say the same thing about Ireland.</p>

<p>You should understand that given Israels position it doesn&#39;t have much choice. </p>

<p>Israel is an extremely tiny country, with a small population, no natural resources, and no nearby allies. </p>

<p>Due to Israels geopolitical situation, it is has no trade with any of its neighbors. This is not from a lack of desire, but an unwillingness from its neighbors to cooperate with it. From its inception is has been completely isolated in the region on the basis of its own existence. Given this situation, Israelis MUST broaden their horizons if they wish to engage in trade. Germany, Italy, France, all of these countries have many neighbors they can do trade with so they don&#39;t need to seek international opportunities. Israel has none. </p>

<p>That being said, I don&#39;t see why this should be considered the necessary criteria for a state. Like you said, the state be a place for people to express their music, literature, history, culture, ect. Not a hub for rich people. </p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your definition of Zionist may need a tune up. Zionism has come to encompass other values and goals that extend far beyond merely having a place of their own to live as they please. I fully support Israel&#39;s right to exist as long as they do so peacefully and don&#39;t engage in business practices that seek to sway public opinion here in America and Europe. They know their big bad ally America would love to reshape the middle east and they can help give us that extra little push needed (I.e. money for lawmakers. Lots of it.), and everyone is happy. Everyone except most of the people of the world that is. But it&#39;s all worth it so the zionists can have their little makeshift country built on sand dunes, lies, and murder. America is Israel&#39;s doormat and it&#39;s about time America took care of its own people instead of Israel. To clarify, I love all people of the world. I love and respect all races, religions and cultures and encourage them to prosper. I am anti Zionist because the state of Israel is bleeding the US dry and involving our military in conflicts that are against our interests as a nation, against the will of the great majority of America, and an injustice to the people we have harmed in doing so. I have no hate for Jews or Israel, just their corrupt government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of the groups you&#39;ve mentioned are truly homogenous. They only appear the way they do today because they have achieved some level of segregation and national sovereignty at some point in history that has slowed the amount of mixture between neighboring and conquering races. The Italians are a mixed race, the Japanese are a mixed race and so is everyone else on the planet. The closest you will get to a non-mixed race is the chimpanzees. Mixture creates robust and resilient populations. Every person I have ever met who is of mixed race is stronger, better looking, smarter and more adaptable than either of the more homogenous groups they descend from. Mixing is why the human race has been so successful and will be the only way for the human race to continue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be down to be a mod here if you needed another set of eyes on the spam filter.  I&#39;m a mod over at r/worldpolitics, and I feel like we do a good job letting the pro and anti-Zionists duke it out in an open environment.  I personally don&#39;t believe in removing links unless there&#39;s a consensus amongst the mods, and if anything, I&#39;d love to learn about how things work here behind the scenes.</p>

<ul>
<li>I question absolutely everything that I read and always try to challenge my beliefs on economics, politics, foreign policy, etc.</li>
<li>I&#39;m convinced that one of the biggest problems with our world is that much of the information exchange is corporately-owned and thus filtered - this is why subs like r/conspiracy, r/911truth, and r/worldpolitics are so important to me</li>
<li>I think I have the top-voted self-post in this subreddit, and I check it on a daily basis (since I&#39;m essentially on Reddit all day long at work)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for this post btw, it&#39;s always refreshing to see unadultered democracy play out in the favor of the people (mostly because it seems to never play out that way...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have become too biased over the last two years to moderate r/conspiracy. Personally I don&#39;t need all the CSS changes, but I can understand someones desire to experiment.

<p>I believe r/conspiracy should be based on the freedom to post what ever you please without heavy moderation or censorship. I mean this is <strong>R/CONSPIRACY</strong>. Use it like <a href="http://cryptome.org/">http://cryptome.org/</a>, but with commentary and voting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very interested!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on reddit about 4 years and appreciate old-school reddiquette, something I notice to be fading away as newer redditors come aboard.  I&#39;m on here many times a day at all hours, due to the nature of my personal and work life, and know I can contribute to helping to operate and moderate r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>My particular interests (conspiracy related) center around the hidden secrets of ancient ruins. I enjoy and follow many other conspiracies of course, but that&#39;s my favorite subject.</p>

<p>Given a chance, I&#39;d hope to encourage more discussion here since it seems that while we have a large membership, the amount of discussion in posts is disproportionate compared to other subreddits. </p>

<p>One thing I wouldn&#39;t do is fuck with the CSS.. Ain&#39;t broke, won&#39;t fix.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also a moderator over at r/conspiracyfacts, a low traffic conspiracy subreddit, and have experience moderating forums going back to the BBSes I ran back in the early 90s. </p>

<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>

<p>Edit:  I&#39;m surprised by so many downvotes with no replies, any feedback or criticisms? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ran several different products, but ended up running TAG because it best allowed for multiple lines, Fidonet, and a useable computer (running Win 3.1) on OS/2 Warp.  I tried all sorts of other BBS software using things like DRDos, desqview, and a few other &quot;multitasking&quot; dos kernels, but OS/2 Warp was the shit back then.</p>

<p>Honestly, it was a blast.. OS/2 Warp with a Win3.1 &quot;vm&quot; for the parents so they could use MS Office etc..  good times.  I only ran single-line during the day, but at night, my parents didn&#39;t mind my using the home phone for a second line.  Keep in mind this is back when you couldn&#39;t do two things on a home PC at once.  Commercials for OS/2 demonstrated a user formatting a floppy while printing.  It was amazing.. back then.</p>

<p>After a while, I had a job and could afford another modem and phone line and went multi-line 24x7.  Mostly, I hosted discussions, network access like Fidonet (and many others..), games (DOOM! Quake 1! Fuck yea), and eventually considered providing internet services but it was cost prohibitive for me.</p>

<p>Anyhow I&#39;m rambling.  Good times.  BBSes were nice because of the tighter community.  The anonymity and vastness of the internet is great and all, but some days it&#39;s nice to have conversations with the same people, rather than each discussion being a new collection of strangers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just curious why you, illuminatedwax, want to be a moderator of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. On the infrequent occasions that you comment in this subreddit, you come across as dismissive of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and theories. And aren&#39;t you busy enough with the numerous other subreddits you moderate? </p>

<p>Also I find it curious that the only moderator you did not remove in this housecleaning was <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/donbueno">donbueno</a>. He has almost no track record of participation in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Not only that, he has only one submission and one comment on any subreddit in the last six months. </p>

<p>Maybe both of you should step down. </p>

<p>I&#39;m currently a moderator at r/campFEMA. EDIT: Here&#39;s my first submission there. If you want to discuss &quot;innocuous&quot; CSS changes, I added the r/gaming spoiler code over there - a complete user discretion change, which I used in this post <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/campFEMA/comments/ndtfp/i_dont_always_submit_things_to_reddit_but_when_i/">here</a>. And the entirety of the CSS for r/campFEMA can be viewed <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/campfema/stylesheet.css">here</a>. (Basically a small handful of flair options and the one spoiler code. All implemented by me with no other formatting changes.)</p>

<p>... is not what you asked in your original post.</p>

<p>See the policy line I referenced in my previous comment. If your &quot;earnest account&quot; has longevity and a post history displaying a relevant awareness of the issues of importance to r/campFEMA, then... yes, a PM might be worth your effort (then, again, I have no idea what &quot;worth your effort&quot; means).</p>

<p>What I can tell you is that the subreddit isn&#39;t all that active, so it may not interest you even if your PM resulted in granting you access to the subreddit.</p>

If I were a mod, I would delete &quot;Win a FREE iPhone ...&quot; submissions and the like, but most anything that had to do with even religion and politics I&#39;d let through.  The thing is, I&#39;m not on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> all the time and I often don&#39;t look at the new submissions either.  So I wouldn&#39;t be a very effective moderator unless there were many more moderators, and who knows if they would be fair with what they delete.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been called things like antisemitic myself, and many of the things I&#39;ve said could be considered &quot;abhorrent&quot;.. I do not care that he may be a member of a white nationalist subredit. what I do care for is that I&#39;m almost positive he&#39;s not a mole. The only other person I&#39;m fairly sure isn&#39;t a mole is 9000sins. I&#39;m certainly not saying everyone else is an undercover agent, I&#39;m just saying I&#39;m more familiar with their comment history, than any one else&#39;s applying...</p>

<p>Though they could be agents themselves: it wouldn&#39;t be the first time intelligence services wasted money and resources infiltrating a community, group, organization, etc...</p>

<p>For me, it&#39;s kind of like voting, i.e. the lesser of so many evils. What&#39;s important for r/conspiracy is that the mods are just regular, unbiased people, and that transparency and freedom of speech are the forefront of the subredit. In that sense, I feel more comfortable with my choices...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to keep the subreddit clean and content heavy - relevant content. There exists many topics that deserve exploring on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, i think the subreddit has a real chance of becoming even more popular. What we need to do here is cut down on the tripe submissions and concentrate on the quality. With consistent input by the moderators and a willingness to engage thoughtful,well spoken individuals <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> could really take off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who gets to decide what &quot;tripe&quot; means? This is where the waters get murky. A mod shouldn&#39;t censor content based on the quality of the submission, only the type. Things that are unrelated to the sub are usually the first to go, but even then the mod should exercise restraint against blocking any submissions here. Even seemingly innocuous stories here can sometimes be seen as possibly conspiratorial so almost any subject matter really can be shoehorned into this sub. So in order to keep this place as open as it currently is then we don&#39;t need mods deleting content based on personal definitions of what a tripe submission is. We want to free all content and let the users decide with upvotes what is good and what is not. The only example of material I can think of that would merit a removal would be referral to hate groups or just plain false/mislabeled submissions. Other than that it&#39;s up to the users what they want to see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright. I have been a redditor for about 4 years now, mostly lurking at first, but after a while I got more comfortable posting my own material. I soon discovered how powerful the hivemind is, and I decided to stay away from the major subreddits and just stick with the subjects that matter to me. When I found r/conspiracy I knew I was at home immediately. I come here several times a day every day and I try to post as much original material as possible. </p>

<p>As a moderator here I feel the main things that need to happen is we need an active gatekeeper to keep out bots and hate propaganda. There are a few users here who actively seek to undermine this subreddit and scare people away from the truth. There are also users that are abusive to others, I.e. crackiswhackexcept. There hasn&#39;t been many problems with this since he was rebanned, but the potential always exists for another character like him to emerge. I am not afraid to stand up to these guys. I do it all the time. I won&#39;t go crazy with the banhammer though, I would reserve that for the most extreme cases, and even then not without a warning. Of course all actions taken as a moderator are subject to debate among all moderators and the users. Even people like frostek, RogerStrong and mattman59 deserve to speak here, even though they walk the line between debate and abuse sometimes.  We all got a taste of ambiversive&#39;s mod style where he pretty much did what he wanted and ignored all input from the community. That was kind of a disaster, and I promise I will not be that kind of mod. People like the style here, so why change it up? Thank you for returning it by the way. Looks much better now! Anyway, I want to say thanks for the opportunity to reapply. I enjoyed being a mod for the short time I had before, so I hope that I can try again. </p>

<p>Edit: was at 12, went down to 2 in 24 hours. It&#39;s a conspiracy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m flattered, really. I don&#39;t want to take this place over, I just want to make sure our community is properly represented and that every voice is heard so long as they respect everyone here. I don&#39;t want illuminatedwax to resign. To the contrary I have a lot of respect for how he has done things here. He has always taken a very hands off approach to this sub, but when the community needed him, he intervened and did what a real mod is supposed to do. I think this arrangement is a beautiful accident, and it has worked out great so far. For anyone talking down to illuminatedwax, don&#39;t be so hard on the guy. He may not be very active here, but he came to help when we needed him. donbueno on the other hand, not so much, but from the looks of things he has pretty much given up on reddit. The mods have a tough job sometimes. Do too much and people think you are overzealous. Do too little and they get upset for lack of control. there is a delicate balance that not many can achieve. All in all I think he is doing great. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to be a mod.  I&#39;ve been on reddit since college (4 years ago now, wow).  I love research, am open to at least hearing every point of view, and really would only moderate (Not censor) when the spirit of the subreddit is violated.  The spirit being: one of exchanging ideas, sharing sources, and discussing the veracity of various claims.  I would never exclude a topic, thread, or subject so long as it was posted to facilitate the above virtues.  I would abide by the rules for reddiquette in moderating users/comments.</p>

<p>I spend my working day in front of a computer so being available for moderation is not an issue - I also write my own blog which is conspiracy related.  <a href="http://thegldnrule.wordpress.com">http://thegldnrule.wordpress.com</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll apply.</p>

<p>If you want balance, you can consider me as an &quot;extreme-ist&quot; which also eliminates me as a shill. If you visit my post history everything I post about revolves around the truth and conspiracies and the like all the way to two years ago, where I got 700 upvotes for explaining why I think 911 was an inside job. To an outside observer it would be labelled an obsession, but as we know, this information and things we&#39;re all individually working on are incredibly meaningful to ourselves and also meaningful in the larger scheme of things. I consider the ideas and information I&#39;m gathering right now my life purpose and will continue to research and learn until I am old.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also a moderator of OWS watch. I also contribute meaningful content to this subreddit, usually larger posts with compiled evidence and information as to why I believe some things to be true, offering alternative information or ideas. I&#39;ve also defended people constantly and believe that ridiculing/dismissing/labeling posts and ideas is detrimental to the entire reason that we&#39;re all here- to find the truth. I am avid fighter against disinformation, jumping to conclusions, and anything but the scientific method in discerning the truth. Cirrow for mod 2012!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries here bro. I for one, do believe there is Jewish conspiracy to dominate America through subversion, manipulation, and deceit. It&#39;s written all over the wall, in plain view. I also believe there is a world wide oligarchy conspiring to bring about a one world, fascist, corporate dictatorship, and the Zionist flavor of Judaism just happens to be front and center. The whole anti-semitic thing has gone way to far, it&#39;s used way to easily.</p>

<p>It essentially squashes free speech. The Jews are perhaps the most conspiratorial of all religions on earth. Germany has laws in place that will lock a person up for years just for questioning the number of deaths attributed to the Holocaust. Jews have obviously conspired to have these laws put in place, <em>and</em> to use them internationally. Perhaps you aren&#39;t familiar with places like Kiryas Joel, NY.</p>

<p>On paper, Kiryas Joel has the lowest per median income in America. It is a Jewish town, with a little over 5,000 &quot;residents&quot;: roughly 90% of which are Hasidic Jews. More than two-thirds of residents live below the federal poverty line, and 40% receive food stamps. BUT. If you take a look around you&#39;d instantly think middle-class, and even upper middle-class.</p>

<p>Many of the residents own local business&#39;s, or work for local businesses, under the table. The police force are Hasidic Jews, and totally biased as such. A large portion of the community does nothing but study religious text, hides their incomes, while living off of American welfare, and has no ambitions to do otherwise...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I am sure of, is that their is Zionists waiting in the wings for r/conspiracy to slip up. All they really have to do is months of credibility building, and bam, moderator. Not that it&#39;s that easy.</p>

<p>But from a professional, intelligence sort of perspective: it will probably happen at some point. That&#39;s just the nature of the beast. I always find it amusing when people can so easily dismiss the power of an individual. In all reality nothing is more dangerous to a ruling power than citizen dissent. Especially when the population is very unhappy with current conditions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy then to get others on board and start a grassroots sort of movement. That&#39;s what happened in all of the countries that went through the US influenced &quot;Arab Spring&quot;. A lot of banter started about how the elites were living so lavishly: videos were created, Google Earth pictures of enormous swimming pool&#39;s and huge mansions, etc, were used to enrage the populace. And the people ultimately fought tooth and nail to remove them from power.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the power of a united people, and the danger of a influential, anti-government, anti-elitist individual with a medium to broadcast his/her thoughts. Thoughts that are contagious, and a threat to the status quo. The 9/11 Truth Movement started with so few, and has grown over the years to include millions of people all over the world. It wasn&#39;t by accident or coincidence: it was because of some very dedicated people. People sharing information, data, ideas, opinions, and now it&#39;s a grassroots movement.</p>

<p>reddit is a powerful platform, and r/conspiracy certainly has the attention of thousands of people, I&#39;m sure the government is watching too, and that people like Cass Sunstein would love to take on r/conspiracy...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no qualifications.  I just read Reddit like everyone else (Among many other sites).  </p>

<p>I am a skeptic, in all forms of the term.  I actually don&#39;t believe in ANY conspiracies just for the recurring instance that the people in power aren&#39;t really hiding it anymore, or if they are, someone will find out and let it be known in this internet age.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I am essentially neutral when it comes to everything, (its even hard for me to pick dinner when wifey asks what I want) Do I spend break-neck amounts of time on Reddit (internet in general)?  No.  I need to work sometimes, as well as play games on the PS3 and PC; also listen to brutal death metal and cavort about my house and freak out my dog.</p>

<p>So vote for me and we will have an &quot;anarcho-socialist&quot; orgy of sex, drugs, alcohol and general debauchery that only Bacchus will envy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love reading up on Conspiracies, but I have no opinion on them. The only reason I think I&#39;d be a great mod is that I rarely make my mind up on a conspiracy. A conspiracy is only a conspiracy if it hasn&#39;t been utterly proven and accepted by the general public, which is why evidence to the contrary should <em>always</em> be encouraged. If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;d always like to see, it&#39;s evidence being put through the scientific method.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it&#39;s your call, but I think I&#39;d make a fantastic mod.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would mod if I knew how, and then let this sub run wild like 4chan , but even then ... there will always be mysterious downvotes with no replies. Even this post for mod was hardly noticeable and I keep wondering how many good posts I&#39;ve missed since there is no time to scroll down and read every post all the time. Maybe a revamped system is required more than a mod. Even tho a mod dedicated to informing the public would help somewhat. There is no way to overcome attempted censorship of information unless everybody was equally tolerant to both good information and bad information.
Nobody wants spammers and abusers , but the very act of censoring them is in its nature the same censorship that is applied to silence dissent. &quot;But it&#39;s not the same&quot;, you say, &quot;we censor for the greater good!&quot; Then how do we define the line that differentiate between good posts and bad posts ? Other than automated spam detection, the only way to tell is by upvotes and downvotes, which can be defeated with &#39;schilling&#39; (pun intended) 
Since (up/down)voting requires no &quot;CAPTCHA&quot; , it can be automated due to the fact that one simply has to purchase more IP address to avoid detection.
So why don&#39;t we put CAPTCHA on everything ? Cause it would be a pain in the ass, and reduce karma whoring , hopefully. This , however, seems to be out of the reach of a moderator, and until then , &quot;shill-ing&quot; will still be cheap and effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t mind moderating. I like engaging in discussions here and offering a different opinion. I&#39;ve been reading this subreddit for a long time. I like when people disagree with me or have an alternative viewpoint, it broadens my own thoughts and perspective. Even if I may not agree with them. I think I&#39;d be a very libertarian mod. </p>

<p>My main issue with this subreddit is the editorializing of titles in order to indoctrinate a view point. I can point you to dozens of examples when people have changed the titles of articles to include content which is not actually in the article. To me this is propaganda. People are already told what to think before they open up the article. I think most people here except it because they agree with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to be a moderator because I believe any discussion of conspiracies needs a skeptical viewpoint, and I believe I can help provide that viewpoint. I&#39;ve observed that in many discussions on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, Reddiquette is not followed well, and I lament that. My qualifications include a long history on Reddit, some experience moderating game servers (years ago, however), and a familiarity with the Reddit moderation interface.   </p>

<p>If I was a moderator on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I&#39;d take a mostly hands-off approach to moderating; I&#39;d enforce rules that other moderators set and clear the spam filter. I believe personal bias shouldn&#39;t be involved in moderation, and would not let my moderation be affected by my biases. If I felt there was a conflict of interest in a moderation situation, I&#39;d recuse myself and allow the matter to be handled by another moderator. Were I a moderator, I&#39;d look to implement a policy against contentless posts such as <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/oel9b/conspiracy_keanu/">this</a>, but would otherwise remain hands-off. </p>

<p>does <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> really want to de-legitimize itself like that? it&#39;ll basically become an extension of the white-man jew-haters club.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright. I have been a redditor for about 4 years now, mostly lurking at first, but after a while I got more comfortable posting my own material. I soon discovered how powerful the hivemind is, and I decided to stay away from the major subreddits and just stick with the subjects that matter to me. When I found r/conspiracy I knew I was at home immediately. I come here several times a day every day and I try to post as much original material as possible. </p>

<p>As a moderator here I feel the main things that need to happen is we need an active gatekeeper to keep out bots and hate propaganda. There are a few users here who actively seek to undermine this subreddit and scare people away from the truth. There are also users that are abusive to others, I.e. crackiswhackexcept. There hasn&#39;t been many problems with this since he was rebanned, but the potential always exists for another character like him to emerge. I am not afraid to stand up to these guys. I do it all the time. I won&#39;t go crazy with the banhammer though, I would reserve that for the most extreme cases, and even then not without a warning. Of course all actions taken as a moderator are subject to debate among all moderators and the users. Even people like frostek, RogerStrong and mattman59 deserve to speak here, even though they walk the line between debate and abuse sometimes.  We all got a taste of ambiversive&#39;s mod style where he pretty much did what he wanted and ignored all input from the community. That was kind of a disaster, and I promise I will not be that kind of mod. People like the style here, so why change it up? Thank you for returning it by the way. Looks much better now! Anyway, I want to say thanks for the opportunity to reapply. I enjoyed being a mod for the short time I had before, so I hope that I can try again. </p>

<p>Edit: was at 12, went down to 2 in 24 hours. It&#39;s a conspiracy!</p>
