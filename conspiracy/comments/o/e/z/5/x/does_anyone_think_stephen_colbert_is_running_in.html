    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s doing it to siphon votes away from one person....that seems a bit silly. But I really wish he would&#39;ve chosen another election year for this prank. This is an important one, and he&#39;s going to make a mockery out of it. I am upset because I think Ron Paul will lose more votes than anybody from this stunt. Kind of a dick move on Colbert&#39;s part.</p>

<p>He&#39;s doing this a. because he can and b. because he is showing how fucked the system is with things like his super pac. Yes it will undoubtedly siphon votes from EVERYONE, but he&#39;s not going out to fuck over Paul. That&#39;s the most absurd thing I&#39;ve ever heard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the non-zero amount of time people are going to spend talking about Stephen Colbert&#39;s presidential run is absolutely going to cut into time people could be talking about Ron Paul&#39;s <em>actual</em> candidacy. Even more so, this cuts into time that Stephen Colbert himself could be talking about Ron Paul, and not just mocking the other Republicans. Paul is not doing this just &quot;because he can&quot; and to &quot;show how fucked the system is&quot;. The fact that Colbert could potentially run is actually a point about how openly democratic our society is supposed to be, and the only people who are going to be impressed by that are those who weren&#39;t paying attention last election. The ones who were know this country is running out of time and the sooner we get Paul in office, the sooner we can get back on track. But all the talk about the two-party system and how corrupt politicians are can only be productive insofar as it helps get not just somebody like but the individual himself, Ron Paul, get the nomination, so we can proceed to getting as close to an actual, real debate with Obama about the direction this country has been going.</p>

<p>That Colbert lampoons this process is not the same as actively, actually challenging it, and suggesting that any media coverage of the Republican nomination that doesn&#39;t flatly support Ron Paul is not necessarily detrimental to his campaign is being hopelessly optimistic or simply nihilistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether it&#39;s his intent or not should not matter all that much; how much say does he have over anything else he does on his show? It&#39;s impossible to tell. I can see that you don&#39;t see much correlation between a real election and a comedy show, but I&#39;m pretty sure there are DC politicos and analysts that do, and considering how artificial and superficial American culture is, the public follows suit. People not just like but who specifically are Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert have an implicit moral responsibility to the people who watch them to make it obvious when they&#39;re telling the truth and when it&#39;s all an act. The election is in far too meta a territory for the difference to remain distinct, and either way, whether they spend time seriously or not, it&#39;s still very much real time.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>See, this is why I responded as simply as I did. I don&#39;t feel like debating this, but please don&#39;t assume things about my knowledge on such issues. The thing about all of this that I&#39;m sure you understand or not that if Colbert indeed moves forward with this that it could very likely mean more than just being a joke. Who&#39;s to say he, while being a jokester, isn&#39;t deadpan serious off camera about becoming President? By all means, he&#39;d be just as good for the country in my opinion and probably the world. There&#39;s always a certain degree to which it&#39;s advertising his show, but I also think this has a lot to do with not doing such, too. After all, this is a <em>presidential race</em>, for goodness sake. He&#39;s not going to go in just to say &quot;watch my show&quot; and be done with it. I think of this as a really, really great wrench thrown into the cogs of boring reality and bad partisan politics.</p>

<p>I also didn&#39;t want to say it before because I don&#39;t like to admit it myself, but how much of a chance does Paul have anyway, especially in a heavily pro-war state such as SC? He doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s going to be Romney. Paul may take 2nd, but having family from SC I can tell you right now their mindset will be to side with someone like Santorum or Perry. Colbert getting in this will indeed affect Paul, but it will also help cut the bullshit out of the race, such as Perry and Gingrich. South Carolina is only State #3 out of 50, so even if Paul loses there it DOESN&#39;T mean the end like the media will tell you it does. </p>

<p>Wait until they start prepping for primary #4. South Carolina isn&#39;t going to sway to Paul. You can downvote me for saying this, as I don&#39;t want to believe it either, but sometimes we have to face the facts and realize the truth of the matter, which is the general population of Conservatives there don&#39;t lean to his side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a Colbert fan since he first started, so let me say I may be a bit biased. Having said that, I really have to disagree with you here. For one, the fact that Colbert could potentially run was also an issue in 2008, and it came down to the Democratic party in South Carolina not allowing him to. The fact that he could potentially run again in 2012, at the end of the day, is owed all to MONEY. He has public recognition, but to ever truly get the ball rolling as a candidate you need crazy amounts of cash. </p>

<p>To me, there is nothing openly democratic about that- or our system in general. Go ahead and try to run for president in your home state. Go ahead. I&#39;ll wait.</p>

<p>It is not Colbert&#39;s job to throw his weight behind an actual candidate. He is a comedian, a satirist, and with things like this bid for the 2012 election- a very important performance artist. At the end of the day candidates come and go, and even a president can&#39;t hang around for over a decade. What Colbert is seeking to do is, yes, show how fucked the system is because it is the system itself that needs attention. Not any particular candidate. In fact, if the system improved, I guess I&#39;d be &quot;hopelessly optimisitc&quot; enough to think that we&#39;d have better candidates, too.</p>
