       Television, the mind bending power of Television is working. Look at it, see it for what it is. A hate machine full of hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The so called current affairs and news shows push hate to the max. Making you hate fat people, drug takers, Christians, Atheists, Chinese, Australians, the other political party, petrol prices, food costs, Turbans, milk,  etc etc. There is very little good news displayed. People don't want that... we the people, are told.  If it's not making you hate something, it's trying to make you buy something and all the while laying it thick with lies and deceit. Monkey see, monkey do. TV makes it happen.

       You're right, there is a reason they call it that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         program (n.)
        </strong>
        1630s, "public notice," from L.L. programma "proclamation, edict," from Gk. programma (gen. programmatos) "a written public notice," from stem of prographein "to write publicly," from pro- "forth" (see pro-) + graphein "to write" (see -graphy). General sense of "a definite plan or scheme" is recorded from 1837. Meaning "list of pieces at a concert, playbill" first recorded 1805 and retains the original sense. That of "objects or events suggested by music" is from 1854.
        <strong>
         Sense of "broadcasting presentation" is from 1923.
        </strong>
        Computer sense (n.,v.) is from 1945. Spelling programme, sometimes preferred in Britain, is from French and began to be used early 19c.
        <strong>
         The verb in the figurative sense of "to train to behave in a predetermined way" is from 1963.
        </strong>
        Related: Programmed; programming.

       couldnt have said it better myself! I live in a small town so you wouldnt thinks its as bad, but every day  I read the paper looking for something good and its hard to find. there are articles about war, death, the shitty economy and so on. I wish we could have more peace, everything would run much more smoothly

       agreed.  you are born, and you die, and in between it's television programming.  people cannot even begin to comprehend the power of the corporate media brainwashing they experience on a DAILY BASIS when they have experienced it their whole life.  kind of like how an abused child rationalizes his/her situation and often goes on to repeat it.
      </p>
      <p>
       they key to tackling the problem, much like alcoholism, begins with recognition of the problem. in the case of the American, it is that the enemy is in charge of the distribution of information through corporate media networks and they do not play fair.  so we recognize the problem?  okay, now how do we proceed in combating it?  proper awareness will never be promoted in the public school.  and promotion of these "unorthodox ideas", unfortunately, is not tolerated by the "good parents"/customers of the private educational institutions who only want their children to grow up into successful slaves of the machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       so what, may i ask, is the most effective method by which the children can glean the necessary information to actually fight the monsters that force us into funding their evil endeavors across the globe?  family.  nothing else is as naturally effective.  not enough people possess the requisite level of curiosity that many of the internet readers of "conspiracy" websites such as this exist to effectuate change... and internet freedom is on its way out.  family.  don't forget it.  never let the information be forgotten by the children.

       Man I haven't had cable for months. Last night I was watching a little NFL at my buddies, and it was fucked how blatant and obvious the conditioning and messages were.

       I would have to say they are getting much more aggressive with the programming since last I saw in October.

       nope.  unfortunately, for every one of us that recognizes the game that is being run, there are at least 10 of them that think everything is alright and that we are paranoid or crazy for even suggesting that it is most certainly NOT alright.

       Why do you guys believe in the illuminati. Have you even researched the historical illuminati? It was an enlightenment group that had to be kept secret in fear of persecution from the church so the church deemed it heretical or satanic. something like that. Theres alot of good reliable information on r/conspiracy but then you get crazy conspiracies like this and it really hurts the credibility of the reddit.

       Negative. You need to love yourself and be content with what was given.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a difference between self love/appreciation and the ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       Society reinforces the ego. If you are rich and beautiful your mind is conditioned to believe it is better then others.

       Oh, I get what Cat-Hax is saying, they love others more than themselves as a part of the selfless path. I assumed he/she was too depressed/selfishly negative and bitter, "I hate everyone, I hate myself." Most of the people I know my age are like that. Am I correct?

       I would say that yes. It's probably the first step towards unhappiness. If you don't like yourself, how are you gunna like anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only makes sense really.

       So when the TV and media puts forth an unrealistic picture of perfection, and you want to be what you see on TV, you will never reach that perfection, creating a deep void in yourself.

       People are too stupid to see that, they will divide themselves from others based on lines which when tallied up only make us different by a tiny fraction, lines of ethnicity, geography, financial status, etc.  People fail to realize that we are all made of the same stuff, are part of the same family.  Somehow our species finds its more reasonable to say we are different based on something that makes up less than 1% of who we are than to say we are the same based on the 99% of things that make us alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Unintentionally used the 99% and 1% monikers from OWS.

       Be the change you want to see.  People aren't too stupid, they are ignorant, as in uneducated, to why we should love each other.  Think of how much people are told to hate one another, and how much of "the other guy" is always the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       So lighten up, spread the message with love, rather than berating people.  It's so easy to become jaded, we must work hard against that.

       Biased or not I agree, they were  more a disappointment for fans who had been hoping/waiting for years for them to be made than actually bad movies.  Adding the midiclorian count BS took away from the mysticism/fantasy of 'the force' and poor casting for the part of Anakin made his decent to the dark side anticlimactic... things like that made them feel like they took away from the galaxy far far away rather than adding to it.

       LOL, that's the worst heaven/reincarnation prize for good karma I've ever heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, will there still be film... depends, am I allowed to be reincarnated in the past?  :P I'd imagine there will still be things like film, as physical recordings form a fail-safe redundancy for information(it's good to have a copy of information that can be read without a sophisticated device, film can be viewed with no more equipment than a light source so is a good backup), tho how widespread their use will be is another question.

       There's a more sensible way to take this concept, and that's to remember that everyone is just like you: they eat, sleep, shit, fuck, dream, hurt and so on.  Therefore there is no justification for either oligarchy (i.e. do not bow to Liz 2) or for shitting on the poor (you could be them rather easily), because you are them and they are you (regardless of what you or they believe; all blood is red).  Sure, folks do fucking retarded shit- to themselves and to others.  Deal with the shit, and then fix the fucked perceptions that lead to that stupid shit; if they turn out to be predators, deal with that.  Once everything's sorted,
       <em>
        move the fuck on
       </em>
       and let it go.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how you do it in practical terms, folks.

       I wouldn't say Illuminati. Maybe the bastardized version that they've become but the Illuminati's main goal is(was) worldwide awakening and illumination.

       Wishaupt [sic] believes that to promote this perfection of the human character was the object of Jesus Christ. That his intention was simply to reinstate natural religion, &amp; by diffusing the light of his morality, to teach us to govern ourselves. His precepts are the love of god &amp; love of our neighbor. And by teaching innocence of conduct, he expected to place men in their natural state of liberty &amp; equality. He says, no one ever laid a surer foundation for liberty than our grand master, Jesus of Nazareth. -Thomas Jefferson

       Illuminati symbolism / Luciferianism. Many of the self-appointed rulers use the symbolism in the megacorp logos. So it seems to follow that they believe in the power of their symbolism.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this sense I think that the people who use this symbolism seem to believe in the symbols they're using. And since those symbols [light / fire / mind] are what we would call 'Illuminati' symbolism I'm willing to accept that the users of such symbolism believe in light [illumination] as a symbol. Does that mean there is such a thing as The Illuminati? Well, they seem to think so. So, maybe there is.
      </p>
      <p>
       In either case I'm going to operate as though the symbolism they use is real to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sense?

       "Arch" &gt; Greek. Lord, master, arbiter, powerful typically in reference to social organizations [monarchy / arch bishop]

       "onemis" &gt; nonsense. It literally doesn't mean anything at all. It's not taken from any language that I know of so if it happens to mean something I'm not aware of it. It was a series of syllables that, when put together with 'arc', sounded like the kind of name one would give a transformer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The meaning of my name: I used to type in 'MASTER' when I'd get high score in Tetris when I was a little kid. 'Archonemis' is a sort of tip-of-the-hat to nostalgia. Hurrah.

       1.) Scientists and mathematicians? Some illuminati logos include Fidelity investment, Comcast, Chase and Morning Star. For some reason they do not push the ‘scientist’ or ‘mathematician’ button(s) in my head. 2.) No subliminal messages? You clearly haven’t spent much time on symbolism / semiotics. 3.) Popular concepts. In strictly academic terms, popularity in thought is meaningless. 4.) Newton was not an originator of these concepts. He was reading source material. 5.) The early 1900’s is not where the action is. You’re thinking in linear time. 6.) Game theory? That’s some pretty reptilian shit right there.

       I think it's sad that if someone talks about anger and hate then people just shrug their shoulders. But, if someone talks about loving each other then they are laughed at and put down.

       It's not an illusion if everything they surround themselves with is real. And what qualifies as a distraction is a matter of opinion since we are free to attach significance to whatever we choose. But yes, "there is more to living than the material realm" still holds true across the board.

       enough research. No amount of research can make the dumbshit myth of the Illuminati to be real. You really need to do the right homework to understand world corruption. It's really as bad as people think it may be under a whatever Illuminati syndicate, but it's nothing like that, just that organized crime is all over the world, whether it's gov't colluding with outside groups or whatever. Think about the legalized structure of corruption that runs through the revolving doors of Washington. If the US has this type indirect corruption and an unimaginable scale, think think about the other nations (also developing ones, which are the worst).

       Completely with you - as is everyone else - on what you say and rightfully complain about corruption. However (given that corruption exists)

       I had assumed that we, both myself and yourself - and general thinking - were already way past this. Something, presumably other than conceptual convenience, has convinced you that the "Illuminati doesn't exist". What convinced you or pretty-much convinced you?

       Actually, I been studying the CIA old boy network and big banks.  Sure, Illuminati myth correlates with the Big Banks, but that's a system legality that is one of the most widely hit by corruption (central banks). As far as our American gov't corrupted, it's completely rigged to the core with corruption (local/state and federal level). This is just my great develop country.
      </p>
      <p>
       the less developed countries are a whole lot more corrupt than our country.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ever decide to read something that relates to this actual corruption I suggest you pick up a book about "Inslaw Octopus: the findings of Danny Casolaro" and "the Creature from Jekkyl Island" to explain to you the evils of central banks. The big banks books is not entirely correct, but almost so.

       I would suggest "The anglo-american establishment" especially or, not really at all related "Tragedy and Hope"'s section about the functioning of the parliamentary system. Yes, the systems described are corrupt to the core, or rather, corrupt
       <em>
        as
       </em>
       the core - that is how they function. I have only read one history of the J.P. Morgan line and banking system and the Jekkyl Island stuff doesn't mean anything to me - if you are going to borrow, [
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       you are going to borrow] as a state or semi-state like company, you will borrow from A or B or... the Fed ... or X or Y or Z and they will all have their own special ideas about fucking you up the arse in their own special way:  The Fed or Mr Z, screwed either way, they thought the Fed was a better idea, and went about making it happen as they are wont to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it is the (non-existing) absence of corruption that would be the death of secret societies, almost by definition, I still cannot see your reasoning.   That doesn't mean that you are wrong.

       Love is definitely the answer to singular, individual spiritual growth and ultimate emancipation - where borders and cultural irrelevancies are of no importance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Systems of control will always manifest themselves in the physical realm, but if one is able to maintain a sound appreciation of life through love, all corporeal borders are of no relevance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it is tempting to thirst for a progressive, utopian society, I am beginning to realize that it is from within where I will witness the greatest revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no religious beliefs, save my strong appreciation for myth, the art of story-telling and metaphor - all three expressed in the physical form, but also become something built by us from within.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indigenous people across the world have still got it right philosophically - despite their systematic brutalization and ethnic cleansing by war and now policy - that we are of the earth and therefore responsible for maintaining a mutual balance of reverence and respect with this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I strongly agree, with all the hoky bullshit aside, that since there is no way of representing "love" in a monetary system, there is no room for love through direct democratic representation under our current social organization.  I am of the opinion, however, that under the present-day neoliberal global financial system we can best represent ourselves through the dollar bill by directing our movements with our spending.  Peoples' movements have proven increasingly easy to form and gain momentum via the internet, and instead of protesting on the streets with picket signs, we should organize huge amounts of people to redirect their spending and even make runs on major banks that engage in fraudulent behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       If our representatives will not REPRESENT us, then we must represent ourselves in the most effective fashion under the present circumstances - REDIRECT OUR HARD-EARNED $$.

       Not to rain on your parade, but even if we all stopped buying from "evil megacorporations" and doing business with culprit banks, the Fed will simply create+transfer money to keep them afloat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I strongly encourage you to do business with moral companies, as it helps them.  But that will not stop the well-connected immoral companies.  This is a much deeper problem than simple consumer choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fed has the power to make money FROM NOTHING.  And give it to whoever they want.  They literally type in 1's and 0's into a machine and can make their pals trillionaires.  Until this is stopped, your HARD EARNED $$ are a joke to them.  "That guy actually had to EARN his paltry allowance! haha! sucker!"

       All I stated was that since we are not being represented, voting for this/that party doesn't really matter and we all live under a neoliberal economic arrangement, the only real real effective vote in America and the rest of the Western world is with our wallets.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, alas, this solution always meets with hostility because too many people simply are unwilling to sacrifice the only "freedom of choice" they really have left - spending moolah.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really get where you are coming from, but if you think that the government will all of a sudden start listening to the people and oust the banking and corporate lobbies, it ain't happening.

       The problem with your solution is that even with a huge majority of people voting correctly with their wallets, we are still being vastly overruled by a small minority of people who print the money.  They too are voting with gigantic endless wallets.

       I'm not saying give up and don't try.  You
       <em>
        should

       spend wisely.  Just don't get sucked so deep into their game.  Valuing THEIR money as if it were super-important is what props up the class system and keeps them on top.

       Runs on banks have been proven very effective actually, and with the advent of the internet it is more within reach than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, we (and businesses) have the most control over the small amount of hard capital that is deposited and represents the "fraction" of fractional reserve banking.  Banks engage in investment risks that far exceed their fractional reserve amounts, but this risk they engage in is possible only if they follow regulations closely, which specifies across the board that some "hard" currency and collateral must be kept in banks' control.  The truth is, mathematically, banks are on the precipice of bankruptcy during every single minute of their operation.  It is only because this type of banking is accepted worldwide that they can hold on to the banking collective, and save themselves from falling down this precipice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key to what you are missing, and maybe I was not clear about, is that we hold the spending power, which plays out an important relationship with GDP, and in turn the ability of banks to lend out money, and essentially make money out of thin air.  If we were to take one out of the mix, lets say consumer spending, and America is the engine that runs it all, then you take a guess at the outcome if we were to discontinue purchasing products that outsource jobs, or build military hardware.  You see, the banks are so intertwined by owning debt, or loaning money, to corporations and people that if consumer spending were directed in the right way, a major bank could be targeted by the industries it invests in.  It is a complex solution, but a HELL of a lot less bloody than an all-out revolution and dark ages!

       Its like someone approached a web designer and said, "Alright look man, I want a website that is vaguely reminiscent of a late-90's geocities site.  Now, the key here is to make it as convoluted and difficult to read as possible; this will make sure only the truly dedicated will read the whole thing. I'm thinking a single massive wall of text, interrupted with some videos.  Also, do you accept bits of string as payment?"

       Thanks for posting this. I think you are correct. However we cant really love if we are doing it to spite another entity. We all have love inside of us. We need to learn that it is ok to let it out. I have struggled with this myself, I am getting better.

       Well... say you're wrong, or even deceiving us, but we take your advice anyway?

       We'd live happier lives for it.

       Besides, with what gets into the actual news, it's easy to feel like you're always under attack. Fear is excellent for manipulating public sentiment and making people ask what they should do next too. Take a break from it, love someone, and you see that even if the news is true, life isn't like TV. That's the world's despair, distilled into a block of information. It's far thinner in almost anyone's life, and mixed in with plenty of good things as well.

       If the Illumaniti does exist, then I blame them for hyping love to such a holy status that people would go out and do down right stupid ass shit for it.  It's great if you love someone, but hey it's a fucking chemical, and sometimes you should make decisions that benefit you.
