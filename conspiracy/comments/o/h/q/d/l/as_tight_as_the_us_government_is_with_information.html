       Don't forget, America operates by the brave new world method, it doesn't matter if the info gets out as long as you flood the market with disinfo and denounce "conspiracy theorists".  Who cares if it gets out, most people wont believe it even if it IS a government document.

       This is very true. I hear all the time that if these things were true that it would be the biggest news ever and it would be on the front page of every newspaper, magazine, and children's books for the next 100 years. While I did use a bit of hyperbole there this is basicly the major argument used against conspiracies. I also hear this a lot: "there would have to be hundreds of people in on that one. There is no way they could keep a secret that big."  The major problem with this logic is that, believe it or not, whistleblowers come out ALL THE TIME! They are just ignored, denounced as crazy or racist, falsely imprisoned or just killed of they are a real threat. I have personally seen testimonials by at least 10 ex CIA officials detailing exactly what is happening, and their stories are consistent with almost every other whistleblower about the NWO ever.

       I'm not sure if anyone who wasn't involved really knows why, but here are some possible scenarios:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Tip of the iceberg
         </strong>
         .The government has so many worse examples of plans and behavior that this one seemed tame and uncontroversial in their circles.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          False honesty
         </strong>
         . The government thought admitting some dubious behavior would suggest they were being forthright with all their dubious behavior. A similar situation often occurs when murder suspects admit they robbed the victim but say someone else committed the murder.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Internal turmoil
         </strong>
         . The government has many different factions, this may have been one side firing a warning shot at the other side (namely the CIA and the people involved). It basically said, "We know your secrets and we will expose them, so give us what we want or it will get a lot worse."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          They fucked-up.
         </strong>
         They may have thought it was just old and irrelevant information. A cheeky story about a cold war plan that never came to fruition. And/or it may not have been classified high enough to not get pulled by the investigating committee. Once the committee had it, they figured it wasn't worth the effort to try and contain such a mild threat.
        </p>

       these are all good ideas. i personally think false honesty is the more likely choice. the only thing about it though is it's not really tame at all, and i don't know what to even consider trumping this to make it seem so. i mean some of the most important people in government begged kennedy to go through with it, then called him a baby when he said no.
      </p>

       or you could say they shot him, but that's a different story.

       it's funny how the "reaction" portion is just about how kennedy was pissed and nothing about any sort of public reaction. i mean it's a blatant letter of intent to kill americans and it's just written off like no big deal.

       You are arguing a similar but different point. I know there have been leaks, whistleblowers, and releases of classified information. Obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying that doesn't mean the public knows all of the government's dirty secrets. Your logic is like a girl saying, "My boyfriend can't be sleeping around because I once caught him kissing another girl. If he can't kiss a girl without getting caught, then there's no way he could have sex with one."
      </p>
      <p>
       This logic is simply not true. It also is going in the wrong direction with the info that is known. If someone admits they are lying or committing indecent acts, they should have more suspicion, scrutiny, and investigations not less.

       JAMES BAMFORD was the original writer who "released" the Northwoods documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bamford is an author who has written many books about the NSA, including "The Puzzle Palace".
      </p>
      <p>
       Bamford used/uses the Northwoods documents to give himself credibility in attacking 9/11 conspiracy talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bamford says that his release of the Northwoods documents is proof that he isn't "anti-conspiracy" so people should listen to him that 9/11 has no loose ends.

       The government isn't a unified entity marching to the beat of the same drum (even though in theory it's supposed to be); there are competing interests with different goals within it, and one of the ways employees of the government try to shape it to their POV is by leaking stuff that hinders the competing POV.
      </p>
      <p>
       It works when the competing POV is up to something that isn't popular with the public, and the best time to stop something is
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       it starts. The leakers who try to stop something
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       it starts (like Bradley Manning) tend to not be as successful and pay a higher price, mostly for misunderstanding how the game is played. By contrast, the leakers of the intent and early steps to go to war with Iran in the 2nd Bush term (around 2006) were more successful because they got in front of it before the Bush crowd could get the set-up to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, any leaking that isn't done by demonstrated incompetence, likely has the above motivation behind it.

       You don't have to worry about old CIA cases being dredged up, I suppose. Have you ever seen the mainstream media talk about Operation Northwoods? :/

       I heard that the "Family Jewels" document dump was a coordinated effort to ensure every major CIA operative had record of what was going down. Operation Northwoods was a part of the Family Jewels document set, I believe. I am unsure how it went from an internal document to a public admission of wholesale American corruption.

       They want you to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever hear the adventures of Huckleberry Finn story where a boy is painting the fence, and, in order to get the other boy to do the work for him, he then pretends that painting the fence is really great? Almost a little like he programmed the guy, just by changing his perception of the situation, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll spell this out in as simply as I can: The forces that truly run the show want the current system torn down, so a new one can be put up in it's place - not unlike how men who have just bought a parcel of land must first tear down existing structures before installing new ones. The goal is not something as simple as money or even conventional ideas of power, because the powers at the top, are in fact, not human. They have money. They have power. What this is really about, is perception. Ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the big picture was about either money or "power", you would not be able to read about Operation Northwoods; you would not know the WMD's in Iraq did not exist, you wouldn't have paperthin explanations put over 9/11 that even a gullible person could come to question.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what is it about? Convincing you to distrust the system, that it
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be knocked down, so, when the time comes, you will willing pick up the paint brush, and paint the fence for them.
       <em>
        and you will be convinced you made the right decision to do so.
       </em>

       Because the CIA is staffed by regular people, not James Bond.  Just like in the rest of the world plans fall through, mistakes are made.  The fact that so much proof is out there for things like northwoods should make you seriously question conspiracy tales like the 9/11 inside job.  If so much info about a simple plot for a false flag attack is out there then how could an operation a thousand times more complicated get exicuted without leaving a single shred of evidence that would hold up in a court room.
