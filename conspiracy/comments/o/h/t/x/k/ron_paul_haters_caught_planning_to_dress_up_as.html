       is a screencap of the FB thread where the conspiracy began. Seems hard to fathom that they thought they would get away with it and keep it covert while organizing on a public forum, especially FB. Almost too much so...

       There's a difference between honorable honest debate, and dishonorable fraudulent attacks. Online we see liberal, sometimes naive but mostly honest debaters, and too many times we see lying, dishonest, distorting rightwingers. In fact, the conservative side seems to harbor a lot of 'anything goes as long as you win' crooks. Lies are never acceptable.

       Exactly. The other candidates have to hire professionals to clean up their pasts and try to bury inconveinient facts. Now I'm not saying Ron Paul doesn't have one or more of these guys, but I imagine they spend most of their time rebutting the criticisms and outright lies that are being spread about him on television and in the newspapers. Or just playing video games and surfing reddit.

       =) I hope to help change any preconceived notions of conspiracy theorists people may have. Believe it or not I am one of the most skeptical people I know. But my beliefs are extremely flexible at the same time, and I try to keep my mind wide open and I even research things that seem like total bullshit even to me. I never believed in any of this stuff until I was about 23 and I began noticing the many inconsistancies of the mainstream media and their absolute lack of empathy for human life and dignity. I was about to join the military and have a bright career as a computer engineer, but I was hesitant in my decision and I'm glad I was. I've always held the opinion that war is wrong on so many levels and that our American concept of righteous militarism is based on the post ww2 mindset that America's military saved the world from the axis forces. While I do believe intervention was neccisary in that war, the underlying causes of most major wars are almost completely fabricated in history textbooks worldwide. It took many years of trying to forget all of the hardcore indoctrination to be able to see our country for what it has really become. I like you as well, you are friendly and reasonable and willing to cross intellectual boundaries that most people are not willing to even approach. I think you are coming along nicely and who knows, you may even see a story or 2 here that might change your mind. It starts with a crack in the seams, and grows from there. I'm actually planning on compiling a list of the most documented and widely known and accepted conspiracies as a submission today. I'll give you a link after its posted.

       No problem, I doubt it will change my mind, but I'm always open to alternative viewpoints as it can do nothing but further your own understanding by being presented with different arguments. I always look for 'cracks' be it in a pro or anti-government explanation for something.

      <p>
       I hate crap info being pushed as irrefutable fact in general, be it the sun newspaper or endthelie. No-one is infallible and to think otherwise is a disservice to critical thinking.

       Oh absolutely. I never take any individuals word for it so to speak. You should always back up any stories that sound fantastic with hard evidence. That is the real problem with many conspiracy theories is the lack of hard evidence, which is the hallmark of the best conspiracies. Most evidence gleaned is circumstantial, but the same type of circumstances have been occurring over and over again, implying that there is some very corrupt behavior occurring in the highest places of power. People go to jail because of circumstantial evidence all the time, but to suggest that a politician or royalty is possibly engaging in corrupt behavior is unacceptable to most people. I was talking with a guy yesterday who seemed convinced that we were all just following an alternative narrative handed down to us by others. While this may be true to some extent, we are mostly independent thinkers who try to avoid such thought patterns as blindly following any source of information wether its CNN or prisonplanet.

       I think we have wildy different political views but similar in the way of verifiability and integrity of sources and arguments.

       I disagree about the jail part, in general (In the UK at least) I find clearly obviously guilty people walk due not being able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

       So, how was Fox News today? Also, what does Rush Limbaugh's asshole taste like? You seem to know.

       Prove what? You yourself show the proof.  The fact that you can't admit your racist comment about blacks has any similarity to KKK racism about blacks shows your sad irrationality and fraudulence. Too bad about that.

       I began looking into the murder/assassination of Bill Cooper a few years ago and then I happened to watch a video about Ruby Ridge and read up on that. The SPLC and the ADL gather intelligence/information and feed this often highly inflammatory and prejudicial information to law enforcement agencies. Then there seem to be these kind of mysterious incidents/agitators that trigger a heavily armed police action. What you end up with is
       <strong>
        murder by proxy by law enforcement.
       </strong>
       I mean who will investigate the cops? I am quite sure they wanted Bill Cooper silenced for good.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Zionist controlled media really knows how to spin these events.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also did some looking into the history of the militia movement. It largely arose from the S&amp;L and Farm Crisis in the 80's. Many of these groups blamed Wall Street and the Fed. Did you know the ADL was founded the same year as the Fed? That is quite a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe what the SPLC and the ADL have been doing for years gradually morphed into Homeland Security and the Patriot Act.

       Not unlawful. "evil" and "treacherous" are subjective but I'm confident most people would disagree this is not "evil". Not secret considering it's a Facebook thread. Perhaps the word you're looking for is "satire".

       I think you mean "agree", but many may in fact consider a plot like this "evil". It is certainly immoral, which is why I consider this absolutely conspiratorial. As a matter of fact, if it
       <em>
        were

       This is not a logical way of thinking on this. It isn't illegal, it isn't secretive, and few people would consider it evil. It's pretty meaningless to say, "Well, if it
       <strong>
        was
       </strong>
       illegal then they would
       <strong>
        certainly

       be breaking the law!" There's a good reason this type of thing isn't illegal. That would be an outrageous abuse of free speech which, last I checked, was a value held dear by this community.

       Well, definition 1 is absolutely wrong in this case since we've already established it's not secret and not illegal. Definition 2 is a much more casual use of "conspiracy" and can include virtually any activity you don't agree with...extremely subjective and essentially meaningless. Using definition 2, I can say you and anyone else who doesn't like my responses are
       <em>
        conspiring

       I was being sarcastic, in that we had actual racist engaged in voter intimidation and yet nothing was done. If you truly never heard of this, try a google search of "Black Panther voter intimidation.

       No I heard of it, just not it being a farce. I was trying to give the benefit of the doubt to an obama supporter or letting them show me information I wasn't aware of.

       I'm skeptical that this was a grass roots/FB organized event. I'm sure CIA/NSA/whoever can easily ferret out a bunch of useful redneck idiots who would think this is a great idea.
