       It took me a long time to build up the courage to make this thread. I've had TOR installed for quite awhile, but it took these 12 empty beers on my desk to really bless me with the bravery to tell this tale. A tale we will consider hypothetical, and for entertainment purposes only.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say, hypothetically of course, that I have a brother-in-law who, before deciding to switch professions, served a lengthy internship with MI5 a couple of years back. MI5 is akin to the CIA of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our media and populous alike have been swept up in post-9/11 fear and have been rendered susceptible to numerous avenues of fear mongering, ultimately resulting in a slow descent into a paranoid population of terrified lemmings under the protection of an increasingly totalitarian regime bent on the dissolution of personal liberties. Perhaps not as noticeably as the United States, but noticeable nevertheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll cut to the chase. My brother-in-law, who I wont bother to grant a pseudonym and will henceforth refer to as BIL, has a tendency of bestowing a great deal of trust in me after he's had a few too many at family gatherings. He's told me some shit that the educated minority wouldn't find too shocking, but one of his drunken tirades has never sat well with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Blizzard EU leaks World of Warcraft customer information to MI5
       </strong>
       in a bizarre manner in order to potentially thwart school shootings, involving a cocktail of enhanced CCTV techniques, racial/income/neighborhood profiling and sadistic in-game behavior. In-game behavior including, but not limited to, high-level players returning to low-level areas such as Elwynn Forest, and spending an unusual amount of time one-hit killing enemies, an action which isn't rewarded with XP, or serves any other purpose than to, from a psychological standpoint, and in the manner of a lunatic with a God-complex, execute bullies who have previously victimized and frustrated the player.
      </p>
      <p>
       These players are automatically IP geographically located, cross-referenced with information in their Battle.net accounts, red flagged and monitored meticulously by MI5 supercomputers, and eventually actual agents, granted the use of specific buzzwords and/or unusual behavior is discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm sure you're asking yourself why Blizzard would  involve themselves in such unfathomably invasive bullshit. I asked myself, and BIL informed me it was the result of subtle threats and comprehensive blackmail at high levels of the Blizzard corporate chain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever wonder why politicians are so crooked in the United States? and around the world for that matter? Sure, they might be subject to corporate bribes, among bribes not so publicized, but they're much more subject to succumbing to fear. After all, the shadow governments, i.e. intelligence agencies, holding the strings strive on their greatest weapon. Fear. And anyone with a large enough voice in any government or industry is subject to its merciless grip. Intelligence agencies across the globe are the masters of blackmail and assassination. If they weren't, the 1st world wouldn't have such a choke hold on the planet. And as we all know, the greatest wars are won without fighting a single battle.
      </p>

        I'll answer almost any questions

       This is ridiculous. Sounds like absolute bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, their battlenet account doesn't necessarily indicate who is playing. Since many players are underage, its usually the name of the parent or some relative who shows up on the account. You also don't know who's actually carrying out the actions in game since anyone could be sitting at the computer playing your character; a friend, sibling, ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, Blizzard doesn't have this technology. In the game people its easy to abuse the mechanics or do things against the rules and not get caught. If Blizzard had the power to catch people killing lower level players, than they would be able to stop a lot of real in game violations; but they don't.

       I never mentioned anything about killing low level players, and I think you're missing the big picture, but thank you for your criticism. Suspicion is very important to an educated mind, and I expect you all to be very cautious of things I, your friends, your family, and anyone else tell you. It's paramount that we question everything.

       Sure this is definitely plausible, the problem is that in-video-game behavior has never been linked to sociopathy. Otherwise, all intelligence agencies would be having a blast monitoring GTA players.

       Umm.. It has actually in Japan. some games been banned in Japan because kids who played certain games showed very violent behavior such as cutting off brother's hand and etc. I'm not saying video games alone can cause someone to become a psychopath but It seems like they can trigger some kids with certain background to commit violent crimes. for example, in one case, a boy with single mother who played an RPG game for hours everyday while his mother was working 3 jobs to pay bills and etc ended up killing his friend in school and he jut didn't think It was a wrong thing to do since he did that all of the time in virtual games so I don't think you can say there's
       <strong>
        absolutely
       </strong>
       no connection between video games and violent behaviors in kids. 
Not that I support this claim that MI5 is monitoring video game players using super computers but I just wanted to point this out.

       Except for the part where correlation does not imply causation. For instance:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       This is textbook sociopathy and I don't think has anything to do with video games. He would've done after watching a movie. I bet he would torture animals just for kicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that I'm trying to deny a connection, but I just haven't seen enough academic material on the subject. It may or may not you know, but with the amount of people playing video games daily, the crazy vs normal ratio is way too positive for any conclusion other than "hey, video games may not be bad after all".

       Now, data mining a group of players, especially of WoW, might turn interesting results.

       I'm gonna call bullshit.  Not because the theory is implausible, but because the sheer cost of monitoring these guys just because they ganked a lowbie would have a very little return-on-investment.  Lots of people gank because they
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       in an online world.  This does not mean they're gonna go and start shooting up schools.

       Online games might be one of a number of ways to recruit potential sociopaths. Of course a primary way is to note them in the miitary; once their traits and talents are established and they are demob'd. But I could see system being useful that screens the population this way.

      <p>
       Controllable sociopaths are a desirable commodity for manipulators.

       On a side note is is a well known fact that terrorist/drug dealers, etc, etc,  use the social aspect of online games in order to communicate (second life, wow, steam, etc, etc) and companies like blizzard (and your ISP, Google, etc) have to comply to a lawful order (usually the FBI) to hand over chat logs and user info.

       It's called information mining; every information that can be collected is collected, and they may never use it, but if they ever want to arrest you they can say "in 2002 you registered for this website and that shows you are this type of person so we get to arrest you".
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't mean Blizzard is involved with the secret police or that their board members know about it. If you are ever brought to court and they use WoW evidence against you, and the court takes it seriously, then WoW is not your biggest threat.

       First hand knowledge here: we have groups of American intelligence who actively use WoW for "collection", including making contact through CO's. So I am verifying this but from the US perspective.

       BTW, Tor is good, but more vulnerable than most people think. I prefer trading a few bitcoins for a rooted box as a source point. (or root your own)

       First off, I condone Blizzard for leaking private info. However, the methods you have described to identify suspects are not unreasonable. Establishing a pattern of behavior helps to identify psychopaths, before the age of WoW, it used to be symptoms like mutilating small animals. Since most people have a protective mechanism built-in in the brain to prevent us from doing such atrocious acts, anyone who abuses small animals for fun may lack this mechanism.
That being said, you cannot legally arrest a player for lunacy in WoW, but it is only a matter of time and probability before that kind of behavior turns up outside the digital world.
