Although it&#39;d be nice to see Ron Paul succeed, I&#39;m downvoting the submission because I think it&#39;s currently overrated and because I don&#39;t like being told that I should upvote this submission just because... besides I&#39;m pretty sure everyone else in this subreddit knows about RP and doesn&#39;t plan to vote for anyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody told you to do anything. This was merely my way of getting Ron Paul&#39;s name on the front page. I&#39;m sorry if anyone finds this offensive, or thinks that it&#39;s just my way of trying to steal a bunch of pointless upvotes. I don&#39;t really get into the whole karma game, it really is pointless and just serves to boost the ego and activate your brain&#39;s reward pathway. Ron Paul should be on all media all the time, but since he&#39;s not I try to give him as much attention as possible online. Once again I&#39;m sorry if this was offensive to you or anyone else, but it is only offensive when taken out of context which is my fault. I should have been clearer in the original post. Sorry. </p>

<p>That is the benefit of being objective, I have no horse in this race so I can sit back and point out what is wrong with ALL the candidates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are implying that anyone who supports Paul worships him as a god, but that is untrue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I am implying that people like you take your love for him to a religious level.  You feel it is &quot;too important&quot; not to share the love of Paul with total strangers and you don&#39;t feel bad about making obvious spam posts in non-Paul subs.  Again, people like you are the reason enoughpaulspam was created, to point out just how much like a religion you treat your obsession.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe there is a possibility that he could screw up bad just like everyone else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could point directly to many of his policies that would &quot;screw up&quot; most Americans lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You obviously have a hard time understanding why people like what he stands for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Statements like this are just more proof of your religious fervor.  Insulting the questioner is a pretty common tactic for Paulites.  Don&#39;t forget, you started the spam posting.</p>

<p>Lol. Okay. I can&#39;t dignify this conversation with any more responses. I personally don&#39;t think Paul will win, and even if he does there is only a slim chance he could fix any of our major problems. I don&#39;t really have a horse in the race either. I would like to see him win, but only because I desire to see real change in this country. Good change. It has nothing to do with him personally, just the real change he represents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I have some difficult questions for you. I already know the answers to these questions, so this is just me and you verifying what we know together and trying to reach a concensus. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is the federal reserve a public entity or a privately owned bank?</p></li>
<li><p>Since it is a private company, what is the goal of the institution?</p></li>
<li><p>How do they make money doing what they do? the service provided by them could easily be done by a government body with public oversight. </p></li>
<li><p>How was the federal reserve established? Who was the big money behind the group?</p></li>
<li><p>Were there any wealthy or powerful Americans who were against the establishment of the federal reserve? What were their reasons? What became of those people?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These questions are the epicenter of the debate. If you can answer these questions in a reasonable way that somehow avoids the conclusion that they are an international banking cartel that has is hooks in American politics and uses America&#39;s prosperity to stuff their pockets I will be really impressed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is actually kind of nice to have a day&#39;s break from Ron Paul.  </p>

<p>The discourse limitations in America are pathetic, and his inclusion in the Republican debates doesn&#39;t make sense to me, nor has it helped him to be lambasted and edited to high noon, appearing as a closet racist hillbilly to the vast majority of the public.  In my opinion, he should be running as an independent, as his political leanings are far beyond the narrow spectrum of polity that the GOP envelops.  He would be wise to hold on to his campaign funds and wait to run as an independent this summer and into the fall.  Perhaps a war may have even broken out by then, which would in my op further strengthen the base of support for Paul&#39;s anti-imperialistic, anti-war stance.</p>

<p>We really ought to be rallying around an independent.  As the internet has provided, rallying support around an individual is vastly more cheap and rapid a process than ever before.</p>

<p>Ron Paul holds some pretty amazing liberty-induced orgasmic views that resonate with me and a lot of young (&amp; old!) people, but we shouldn&#39;t repeat history and overlook where he stands regarding serious issues in America like healthcare and affordable housing, which are the foremost concern of the average American family in my op.</p>

<p>Any better options for president? Nope. Do I think he is perfect? Nope. Do I think he has my country&#39;s best interests in mind? Yes I do. I think this because in all of his years of service he has never once violated his oath to support and protect the constitution. </p>

<p>That is the benefit of being objective, I have no horse in this race so I can sit back and point out what is wrong with ALL the candidates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are implying that anyone who supports Paul worships him as a god, but that is untrue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I am implying that people like you take your love for him to a religious level.  You feel it is &quot;too important&quot; not to share the love of Paul with total strangers and you don&#39;t feel bad about making obvious spam posts in non-Paul subs.  Again, people like you are the reason enoughpaulspam was created, to point out just how much like a religion you treat your obsession.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe there is a possibility that he could screw up bad just like everyone else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could point directly to many of his policies that would &quot;screw up&quot; most Americans lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You obviously have a hard time understanding why people like what he stands for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Statements like this are just more proof of your religious fervor.  Insulting the questioner is a pretty common tactic for Paulites.  Don&#39;t forget, you started the spam posting.</p>
