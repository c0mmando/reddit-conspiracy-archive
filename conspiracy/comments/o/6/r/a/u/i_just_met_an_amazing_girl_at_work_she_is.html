    <div class="md"><p>Most girls just write me off as insane even though I am intelligent and reasonably attractive, so it&#39;s refreshing to meet a girl I can actually talk to and not feel like I&#39;m being judged. I have been single for over 3 years now because I decided I&#39;m done playing games and would only date an intelligent woman who lives up to my standards. It has been a really lonely 3 years. Not even a date to speak of. But like I said, I&#39;m better off being single than pretending to be somebody I&#39;m not or disagreeing with my significant other about the very nature of life. </p>

Same state though, and there is always the possibility that she moved from one city to the next. That would be amazing though if that was her. That would mean we have kind of known each other for some time now. crazy. If its her I&#39;ll buy you a beer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;As he drifted back into conscienceness a cold sensation rushed through his whole body like the arctic wind blowing right through him. He soon realized his hands were dripping wet and this frightened him enough to jolt his mind back to reality. He felt panicked after he realized that this wasn&#39;t his hotel room he was waking up in. He was outdoors in what appeared to be a desert, laying in a pig feeding trough filled with ice. He felt a pinching sensation in his chest. He reached up to figure out what was pinching, and his hand came back with a note. It read: &quot;atención: su riñón ha sido eliminado. Por favor, busque atención médica lo más pronto posible.&quot; Suddenly he wished he had paid more attention in spanish class.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you kidding? Men LOVE women. And as a woman you have the ultimate say so when it comes to this. YOU have all the power in relationship situations. Even unattractive women have a chance to engage men and can almost certainly have sex with almost any man she wants. This is simple sociology. Men want sex. Women want sex too, but are way more particular about with whom they have sex with. Even if the subject of sex were obscured, we still love women for other reasons. Who else will do nice things for us like taking care of us when we are sick, making our breakfasts, lunches and dinners, and doing our laundry and other tedious things they do just because they care? This may sound sexist, but it&#39;s actually a thank you. Thanks to all those women out there for loving us, even though we are ungrateful, domineering, condescending and we also smell pretty bad too. We don&#39;t deserve you. From the men of the world, thank you. </p>

Unfortunately the qualities I seek are exceedingly rare, especially in today&#39;s chemically lobotomized sociopathic society. I like girls who are genuinely sweet. I have met 3 in my lifetime, and I&#39;m always on the lookout for the next. When I find her I&#39;m not going to give up very easily. </p>
