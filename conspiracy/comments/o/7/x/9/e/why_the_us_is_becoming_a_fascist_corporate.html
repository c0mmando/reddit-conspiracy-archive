       It's easy to see how the US is becoming a fascist state.  What with bills like the NDAA that eliminate Habeas Corpus, bills like SOPA that serve to censor the internet, and the militarization of the police force.  It's also easy to see how the ones in power are not the three branches of government, but the powerful corporate entities that fund them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       .  The United States was founded on libertarian ideals, and it seems odd that we should become a fascist state.
      </p>
      <p>
       But before I answer that question, we have to look at the long string of military failures we've been engaged in since Vietnam (the first gulf war excepted).  These have all been wars fought against insurgent groups in foreign territory.  The US's primary military doctrine is overwhelming air superiority.  This is an effective doctrine against armies that can be found and identified, since any exposed target is neutralized by air power.  It is completely ineffective against camouflaged targets however, as you cannot bomb what you cannot see (the exception being carpet bombing the entire region, but that has political consequences).  Insurgent warfare is by its very nature camouflaged and invisible to standard reconnaissance.  This means that the US has been completely ill equipped for every war since Vietnam (with the exception of the first gulf war--the only war against a standing army).
      </p>
      <p>
       Foreign insurgencies are hard to stamp out even with more applicable military doctrine.  In fact, because of the way insurgencies operate, the only way to root them out is with brutal police occupations.  To date, the only nation that has successfully eliminated foreign insurgencies, has been the USSR/Russia.  That's because it's impossible to institute the measures necessary to stamp out an insurgency with a free society at home, that can decry the atrocities carried out in their name.
      </p>
      <p>
       For whatever reason, the US has started to move away from the tried-and-true CIA incubated banana republics of the cold war and started using direct military force to enforce its economic policies abroad.  And in any case, with the size and power of the US army, no intelligent military command will engage in conventional warfare with the US.  That means that all US wars for the foreseeable future will be anti-insurgencies, which, as I've explained, can only be won by a fascist state willing to do what it takes to eliminate the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       QED the US is becoming a fascist state to better wage war on the enemies it is likely to face.

       I hate to break it to you but the US was NOT founded on libertarian ideals, it was founded on nothing more than greed and war, and still is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its just that Americans are starting to see this, but they forget their own history and believe what they have been told, but not what is actually true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The so-called ideals looked great on paper but has the US ever really followed them? Like killing off the Native Americans, slavery, war after war after war... This is not exactly libertarian... it more like Empire building in my book.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wars of insurgency are not meant to be won, they are meant to be fought forever and ever. That way the war machine gets lots and lots of cash, and along the way you as a citizen get less and less free. If peace broke out - can you imagine the unemployment? It would be the end of the US for sure...
      </p>
      <p>
       The US had a brief affair with the middle class concept starting roughly around the turn of the century, but that is also going in the garbage and back to the old ways. The rich get filthy rich and everyone else can suck it - just like it used to be...
      </p>
      <p>
       Just for reference the US has used direct military force much more than the CIA ops, and they are returning also to that concept. To be honest the CIA coups and operations were not that successful. So... back to the old ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       The military went straight in to Panama, The Spanish War, the Indian Wars, The Philippines etc... etc... Just read up how many wars the US has been in since 1800 and you will be surprised... don't believe me just read up on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sine the industrial revolution the US has been nothing more than a corpratocracy, it started with the plantation owners and into the industrialists then the corporations have taken over that role recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Were you, in the US, ever really free at one time in the last 150 years? Not really, if you read history there were so many slaves, indentured servants and poor; that the rich could do anything, and that ideal is what is returning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself this. With the US having thousands and thousands of nuclear missiles, why do you have a big army? Nobody is going to actually go to war with you at all - you have nuclear weapons!
      </p>
      <p>
       No, you have a big army because the country pays lip service to the ideals of freedom and democracy, and liberty. They just make that crap up so that you will follow what they say... and they have an endless war to feed the machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope I did not come off as rude, I am just thinking about your history and how I think the truth is obscured.

       The U.S. Constitution was one of the greatest and most radical (for its time) human rights document in history, and did more to consequently advance the human rights of all people the world over than probably any other single document.
      </p>
      <p>
       Totalitarian leftists, Anglo-fascists neo-Imperialists, Zionists, Globalists and their bought-off useful idiots have sought to undermine it ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       The libertarian-Christian Founders and early generations of Americans got the ball rolling; it's unfortunate that succeessive defective, money-worshipping, Judeo-"Christian" and and Jewish-Zionist generations of Americans, along with atheist-materialist, power-mad leftist gangsters, have sabatoged their work.

       You are correct in saying that at no time in the past did the United States live up to its ideals. But at least for a while there it had ideals. We seem to have lost them.

       So....British Imperialism meets French "Democracy"?
      </p>
      <p>
       All the CIA instigated wars you talk of is pretty much how France historically handled itself as the 4th largest exporter of military arms. They support "disenfranchised" groups who wish a 'democracy' and put pressure on governments that don't favor them in policy or trade agreements.(American Revolution/Vietnam) It's not as direct as the British entitlement to colonize, take over trade, educate and sanction if they fail to fall in step. (Irish potato famine/India massacres)
      </p>
      <p>
       The US government is far from perfect, but I don't remember starting any World Wars or committing genocide in the last 100 years. If you think it's fair to go back as far as the Native Americans, you should check out your own country's history. I would bet there is a better than 50% chance "your" country
       <em>
        stole
       </em>
       land from some group. It's also not like the US population was built from one group of people. Some of our ancestors were related to your ancestors after all. You don't think they immigrated to the US because things were all fine and dandy in your country, do you? (More Irish people here than Ireland)
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a fine line between taking responsibility to make the world a better place and taking over control of it for selfish gains. The US is only one country in a succession of countries to choose this path over isolation. The US isn't fortunate enough to hide in the shadow of a more powerful country. It's this great expectation that will always put us under scrutiny for what we do or don't do. Instead of trying to steer the US, maybe you should spend your efforts on making your own country a model of strength and responsibility.

       The op was right about stamping out insurgency. We need to surrender all rights to the state in order to effectively deal with an insurgent army. Not that we would do that, or even acknowledge it as an option.

       I agree with OP's opinion but I think there's more to it than his/her analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are entering an era of chronic resource scarcity and economic instability around the world and those in power in America anticipate significant social unrest and violence at home as well as abroad. They are circling the wagons and doing what they can to maintain order, stability and their own wealth, influence and safety. This also means the rights and political voice of the public will be severely curtailed as the public's priorities will likely not match their own. As they (the elites) see it, these changes will likely be permanent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our rights are disappearing in the name of protecting the state from terrorism; they are really disappearing to protect the elites from us. What we're heading towards is a high-tech surveillance state where the middle class has been gutted and social mobility has dropped to a crawl, a kind of neo-feudalism.

       This is the truth. Social control systems like religion, patriotism, politics, economics, always with the huge help of propaganda are only fooling a majority of poor and ignorant, that actually works its whole life for the powerful and ruler elite. Neo-feudalism is, in fact, a very adequate term.

       Petroleum, natural gas, and arable land are not becoming more plentiful especially considering that world population and demand keep growing. We seem to be hitting the limits of growth, at least those that exist within our current economic system.

       Ok , interesting analysis, but who do the US army represent? Who do they work for?  I guess from your title it is the oligarchs whoever they be.  How would you describe who the people which benefit are?

       Waging war is not an end in itself, but only a means to an end for the fascist elite class that now runs the United States. They need total control over the populations they oppress, because they are doing things that are hateful to those populations. Hence, fascism in America, and military occupying forces in other nations that are perceived by this ruthless elite to have things of value the elite wants. They have no moral high ground of any kind, and therefore have thrown away even the illusion of moral high ground in favor of a rigid control over the communications, movements and activities of the populations they oppress.

       Why has it become this way? Easy. Corporations have a lot of money. They give money to people in Congress. Congress does whatever the fuck the highest paying corporation wants. This is why no one should be able to run for Congress more than once. Then you have no second, third, etc campaign to need to gain money for. Serve once, you do it for your country. Serve more than once, you slowly start looking at it as a career that you need to keep more than something for the good of the country. They should limit Congress members to one term, and no corporate donations.
