       I know this topic has probably been beaten to death here, but I've never seen a thread about it. Does anyone have any decent evidence? I only bring this up because I've noticed recently that if you post something about RP, even in a weird subreddit, in a not "preachy" kind of way, it seems like people come out of the woodwork to bash him. Now I only made the leap to conspiracy mode because I notice it's often the same couple people who do this, and usually immediately after they make a reply/downvote, 5 or 6 more people show up to back them up and provide follow up downvotes....almost as if it's one person with 5 or 6 accounts, or, it could just be a group  of people working together.....or it could just be coincidence. I'm not drawing any serious conclusions, but it is pretty weird, especially the context it just happened to me in.

       About 3/4 down the page. This guy BetYouCanNotTellMe. Notice how quickly he responds. I was downvoted several times within about 5 minutes. It's not the first time I've seen him...TheGhostOfNoLibs is another I see popping up to bash RP.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't know, I'm likely being paranoid, but I'd like to hear your supporting stories, because it seems to me like something creepy is going on. Often times these people use a lot of copy pasta, followed by massive downvotes on whoever opposes, very quickly. It just seems coordinated..
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: So with a bit of an update from mattman59, it appears that there is indeed a coordinated effort, though it is not on the part of the anti-paul people, at least not that I know of. Apparently a website called friendfeed.com provides the technology to basically stalk every comment a user makes, and is being used by Ron Paul supporters to keep track of a list of people! Definitely clears things up for me. Thanks for the good info.

       Maybe Ron Paul isn't as popular as you think he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe people who don't like his platform are fed up with him getting raised as the second coming of the great prophet Zarniwoop and the solution to every problem from athletes foot to zebras.

       You've got to be kidding me. I've been further even more decided to use even go need to do look more as anyone can. Can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that? My guess is that when one really been far even as decided once to use even go want, it is then that he has really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like. It's just common sense.

       It's a meme dude. It's from an old post on 4chan. I thought more people would understand the reference. Guess not. Google "Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?" for the story.

       ThePieOfSauron is another one. Everywhere there is a thread about RP, he's in with the bashing. Now that you posted the nicknames of the other two, the way the names are made... they kind of look the same :-) Are those all 3 the fake persons we read so much about?

       Aside from those that genuinely don't like him for whatever reason.
Combine the software the air force requested a while back seen from the HBGary email leak to create fake persona management.
Couple this with social proof:

       Remember there are people who really do have differing opinions though and might not necessarily be actively/knowingly involved in any conspiracy.

       Interesting. Yeah I'm totally aware that many do simply have differing opinions. My suggestion isn't that anything other than constant circle jerk is obviously conspiracy. I just find it odd when I see a lot of accounts that are only a week or two old and all they've done for 12 hours a day is spam anti-paul....it just doesn't seem right, and there's kind of a lot of those accounts. It was just weird to me that I was posting in a thread completely unrelated to the topic, and I offered my input that was neither pro or against Paul, and several minutes later someone I recognize from other threads as being one of the anti-paul spammers, replied, immediately receiving several upvotes.....could've just been coincidence, but I found it kind of out of the ordinary.

       So clearly they have the capability of stalking pro paul posters, and ARE doing it. I'm literally watching your posts in real time show up on this website....is this against some rule on Reddit? This is fucking creepy.

       If you will notice that list is of anti-paul folks.  I have no real love for Ron Paul's policies but I don't run to every post I see about him and shit on him.

       Well that is the whole point, Ron Paul worshipers claim conspiracy when in reality they are the only ones organizing to fight and imaginary force.  Go over to
       <a href="/r/enoughpaulspam">

       , it isn't plots on how to ruin Paul, it is examples how insane he and his followers are.

       I can tell you without a doubt that there is a conspiracy against people who don't love Ron Paul.  I volunteered for the man's campaign when I was in high school but now I am somehow labeled a super secret covert operative paid to come here and let you guys know Ron Paul is not really Jesus.

       No, it's not that we don't like him. It's that for some reason, nobody that supports him is willing to admit that he will not be a king, he's not the fucking messiah, and the powers that be WILL stop him from achieving what he promises. Why is that so hard to see? they shot kennedy, clinton got a blowjob, obama promised 1,000 things and now stays under the radar because he isn't

       You're not alone.  I've noticed this as well.  There seems to be a very strong effort to downplay/downvote Dr. Paul in all mainstream media outlets.  I think what makes it so weak is the fact that more people are waking up and becoming aware that Ron Paul is the only sane person running for president.
