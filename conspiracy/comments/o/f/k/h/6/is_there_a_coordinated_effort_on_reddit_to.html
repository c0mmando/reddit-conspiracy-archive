        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know this topic has probably been beaten to death here, but I&#39;ve never seen a thread about it. Does anyone have any decent evidence? I only bring this up because I&#39;ve noticed recently that if you post something about RP, even in a weird subreddit, in a not &quot;preachy&quot; kind of way, it seems like people come out of the woodwork to bash him. Now I only made the leap to conspiracy mode because I notice it&#39;s often the same couple people who do this, and usually immediately after they make a reply/downvote, 5 or 6 more people show up to back them up and provide follow up downvotes....almost as if it&#39;s one person with 5 or 6 accounts, or, it could just be a group  of people working together.....or it could just be coincidence. I&#39;m not drawing any serious conclusions, but it is pretty weird, especially the context it just happened to me in. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ofbmi/younger_people_on_reddit_what_are_the_biggest/">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ofbmi/younger_people_on_reddit_what_are_the_biggest/</a></p>

<p>About 3/4 down the page. This guy BetYouCanNotTellMe. Notice how quickly he responds. I was downvoted several times within about 5 minutes. It&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve seen him...TheGhostOfNoLibs is another I see popping up to bash RP. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m likely being paranoid, but I&#39;d like to hear your supporting stories, because it seems to me like something creepy is going on. Often times these people use a lot of copy pasta, followed by massive downvotes on whoever opposes, very quickly. It just seems coordinated..</p>

<p>EDIT: So with a bit of an update from mattman59, it appears that there is indeed a coordinated effort, though it is not on the part of the anti-paul people, at least not that I know of. Apparently a website called friendfeed.com provides the technology to basically stalk every comment a user makes, and is being used by Ron Paul supporters to keep track of a list of people! Definitely clears things up for me. Thanks for the good info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Yeah I&#39;m totally aware that many do simply have differing opinions. My suggestion isn&#39;t that anything other than constant circle jerk is obviously conspiracy. I just find it odd when I see a lot of accounts that are only a week or two old and all they&#39;ve done for 12 hours a day is spam anti-paul....it just doesn&#39;t seem right, and there&#39;s kind of a lot of those accounts. It was just weird to me that I was posting in a thread completely unrelated to the topic, and I offered my input that was neither pro or against Paul, and several minutes later someone I recognize from other threads as being one of the anti-paul spammers, replied, immediately receiving several upvotes.....could&#39;ve just been coincidence, but I found it kind of out of the ordinary. </p>

<p>I can tell you without a doubt that there is a conspiracy against people who don&#39;t love Ron Paul.  I volunteered for the man&#39;s campaign when I was in high school but now I am somehow labeled a super secret covert operative paid to come here and let you guys know Ron Paul is not really Jesus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s not that we don&#39;t like him. It&#39;s that for some reason, nobody that supports him is willing to admit that he will not be a king, he&#39;s not the fucking messiah, and the powers that be WILL stop him from achieving what he promises. Why is that so hard to see? they shot kennedy, clinton got a blowjob, obama promised 1,000 things and now stays under the radar because he isn&#39;t <em>allowed</em> to do anything, but OH! Mr. Paul has superpowers and is immune to government control!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not alone.  I&#39;ve noticed this as well.  There seems to be a very strong effort to downplay/downvote Dr. Paul in all mainstream media outlets.  I think what makes it so weak is the fact that more people are waking up and becoming aware that Ron Paul is the only sane person running for president. </p>

<p>EDIT: Downvote all you want, but it&#39;s true</p>
