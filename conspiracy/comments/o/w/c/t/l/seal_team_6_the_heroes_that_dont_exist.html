       I find it really funny how washington and the media are always talking about seal team 6... the good guy version of al qaeda..
      </p>
      <p>
       seal team 6 was officially disbanded in 87.. and renamed to DEVGRU
which is the common name. yet the media keeps talking about "seal team 6"
      </p>
      <p>
       the team that "killed" osama bin laden... then took only his body and dumped it at sea...
      </p>
      <p>
       the team that magically boarded and flew on a old helicopter operated by the national guard (can anyone tell me since when do seals fly with the national guard)
      </p>
      <p>
       and then that team dies in the crash.. the supposed heroes who killed osama.. die in a crash..
      </p>
      <p>
       and now the same team that died in a crash, killed osama.. and was disbanded in 87 rescues 2 from pirates in somalia.. our HEROS..
      </p>
      <p>
       WAG THE DOG folks... this is a script.. and people are eating it up..

       One of the helicopters on the raid was

       This is the helicopter that SEALs disembarked from to raid the compound.  It was rigged to go down so that no eye witnesses would make it out.  Necessary since Osama was never there, hence the inability to produce proof of his death.

       That is why the surviving SEAL members that

       Just going to throw it out there.  Prior service Navy.  I was stationed at Damneck Annex in Virginia Beach.  Yes, the Seals there are called "DEVGRU" but it is in fact still Seal Team 6.  As for the chopper that went down.  There were members of Team 6 on it but not the whole team.  There were Seals, Rangers, Para-Rescue on the chopper that went down.  As for the national guard being in that particular chopper,  that happens all the time.  Just like there are Marines on USN ships.  All the military branches work together.  That shouldn't be something to difficult to understand.

       I work with a Marine in my office (he served '94-'98) and just asked him. According to him you're wrong. Spec Ops catches rides with various branches of the military all the time. It is common and specific to each mission.

       I know I'm just providing "anecdotal" evidence- but where is your proof that they never travel/interact etc??

       they aren't going to send an elite team on a national guard helicopter in a hostile area. just not going to happen. I will ask my cousin who is a Lt. Commander in the Navy and flys the Ch46.. and I will get back.
      </p>
      <p>
       but from what I have been told by 1 seal.. they find it very suspicious that a seal team would be traveling on board this particular aircraft with no other support

       What "old helicopter" are you referring to, though? Can you provide a link? The one that went in to Afghanistan after OBL was "old" according to my co-worker, even though it had some stealth technology, but again was pretty SOP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that there is more to the story, but to say all of this is completely fabricated is a stretch. Especially, when you provide no proof otherwise.

       they were flying in an older chinook.. a slow moving transporter over enemy territory, and the helicopter was "shot down" by a "LUCKY" shot according to the military..
      </p>
      <p>
       not to mention this was a "rescue" mission
      </p>
      <p>
       if and when special forces do hop rides with the NATIONAL GUARD.. its not for missions...

       its to maybe move from one base to another..

       This story proclaims that they flew in on fixed-wing aircraft, not helicopters:

       of course when they jump.. its from a fixed wing aircraft.. and they jump from very high altitudes in whats called a HALO jump...

      <p>
       flying on a slow moving chinook on a rescue mission with several other non seals is BS.

       Any and all. Don't hold back. You are right about Jessica Lynch- I don't need links on that or Pat Tillman. Propaganda most certainly exists, I just don't believe that EVERY story is propaganda and I like to evaluate based on evidence.

       You know this from all the times you've been called out on QRF while you were in a warzone? Chinooks are often choice for QRF operations because of how many people you can get on the ground in fewer aircraft.

       If they were in some marine aviation unit's AO they would fly on a marine bird. They were not. They were in an AO currently tasked out to a national guard aviation unit, so they flew on a NG bird. Thats how it works. When your unit is deployed you get a certain AO or sector of the country you are responsible for doing your particular thing in. So for units that operate all over the country like SEALS and SF and what not, they often hitch rides on the controlling aviation unit's bird. A more adequate question would be why they weren't flying with the 160th as that is the elite special ops aviation wing? The answer to that though is that the 160th hasn't been deployed in the GWOT in a few years. They've been tasked with supporting special operations elsewhere in the globe.

       You are flat wrong, since 9/11 special operations teams from all stripes work together.  In Afghanistan you might have a SEAL going out with a Force Recon Marine and an Air Force Tactical Air controller.  Stop watching TV and get your nose in a book.

       You're wrong... I've seen it done in Iraq. Hell when I was on a recon team in the 82nd we flew on a national guard Chinook to go and support a SEAL team on a QRF mission.

       You're an idiot. Chinooks are used because of the amount of people you can hold on board. I've gone on several joint operations in Iraq in Chinooks with SEALs, SF, etc on the bird sitting right next to me.

       That is a huge conspiracy site, do you have anything legit?  Again people are telling you, based on their own personal experience that you are wrong.  I can point to specific instances in books where this takes place, first hand accounts by special operations forces themselves.

       "as far as i know its some 17 year old kid who's in rotc and thinks he knows.. "

       is probably wrong in favor of the non-conspiracy posts almost exclusively originating out of DSH/DoD offices.

       There are very few people who don't take conspiracy fact seriously.

       Your point was to try and imply that some sinister figure loaded a bunch of DEVGRU SEALs (each representing tens if not hundreds of millions in training) into an aircraft and then intentionally brought it down.  You made this claim with circumstantial evidence and almost no understanding of the subject matter and that showed in your replies.

      <p>
       "i've since talked to a national media figure and then talked to the individuals they put me in contact with at very high level in the current CIA and they just said 'we want to tell you you're right about bin laden' very bizarre uh three weeks ago to have this person reach out to me just to tell me 'i just want to tell you you're right about bin laden' "

       So much is wrong with this post. Where to start...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the good guy version of al qaeda..
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Al Quaeda is a large terrorist organization that is about big shock and awe operations that don't require much training. Seal Team 6(DEVGRU) is a very small, HIGHLY trained military organization that conducts a lot of clandestine operations and doesn't want/seek publicity.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        seal team 6 was officially disbanded in 87.. and renamed to DEVGRU which is the common name. yet the media keeps talking about "seal team 6"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It wasn't disbanded, just renamed. Like how "Delta Force" became CAG(Combat Applications Group). Seal Team Six is the common name, I work with two guys who were on Seal Team 6(I work for a private military contracting company) and they refer to it as Seal Team 6 mostly, not DEVGRU.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the team that "killed" osama bin laden... then took only his body and dumped it at sea...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here I agree with you, I'm not convinced it went down like the media said it went down.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the team that magically boarded and flew on a old helicopter operated by the national guard (can anyone tell me since when do seals fly with the national guard)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Since the GWOT started, if a National Guard unit currently is tasked with providing air operations for that particular AO then thats the unit who flys you on operations in that AO
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        and then that team dies in the crash.. the supposed heroes who killed osama.. die in a crash..
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Are you referring to the Chinook crash or the Helo crash on the Osama mission? Cause the Chinook crash wasnt only SEALs and those dudes on the Osama mission didn't die
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        and now the same team that died in a crash
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You couldn't fit all of Seal Team 6 on one helo. So the team its self did not die in a crash. Also, still very confused as to what crash you're talking about. The Chinook in 2005, 2011, or the Blackhawk on the Osama raid?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm thinking OP has zero frame of reference on how the military or Special Operations works.

       It would also make sense that a team that was supposed to be simi secret would 'die in a crash' after becoming world famous again.

       It would also make sense that the media would keep calling them what they were calling them before even with their new horrible DEVGRU name.  DEVGRU doesn't sell newspapers.

       So what is the alternate story?  I admit that the published story seems far fetched, but is there a link to a more evidenced explanation? I do assume that Osama is dead because I would have predicted a "nuh uh, Osama is alive" video from Al Qaeda.

       You're going about this all wrong. People with a clue have known that OBL is long dead and he has no connection to 9/11. Knowing this, it is obvious that the government is simply telling us fairy tales, stringing us along with their imaginary villians and heroes, distracting us.

       Yes, the videos were faked, probably all of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bin Laden denied participating in the 9/11 attacks right before his death. Forgive me to linking to Fox News, but it was a handy source.

       The videos released afterward were clearly fakes. None of them really look like Bin Laden. In one of the videos, "OBL" is seen writing with his right hand, despite the FBI saying he is left handed, and he is wearing a gold ring, forbidden by Islam. Check out these
       <a href="http://imgur.com/BCFl1">
        screen shots
       </a>
       of his face progressing, they are not the same person, and clearly not a man dying of Marfan Syndrome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where are these video coming from then? We don't know for sure. What we do know is that a Zionist named Rita Katz has a way of getting this intel a little...  early.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Katz">
         In October 2007, it was revealed that Katz had discovered and issued to the Bush administration a copy of an Osama bin Laden video which had yet to be released by al-Qaeda. Katz issued the video via a private link to a SITE web page to White House counsel Fred F. Fielding and Joel Bagnal, deputy assistant to the President for Homeland Security. Within 20 minutes, computers registered to various parts of the Executive Branch began downloading the video, and within hours a transcript referencing SITE had appeared on Fox News. Katz had requested that the web page remain confidential, and has reported that dissemination of this information tipped off her Al-Qaeda supporters who had since eliminated the ability of SITE to gather such information.

       Well thanks for the thought out answer.  I'd say that the novelty of conspiracy theories is that they are as believable and disprovable as the stated story.  I don't know what I believe in this instance.  I think the man in those four pictures looks like the same guy to me, but I'm not an expert in body doubles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the strangest thing is that if this was a conspiracy, why would they make the story that they went into Pakistan? Why create an international dispute that wasn't necessary for a fake story anyways?  Also, why does Al Jazeera seem to support the US' claims?  They have no reason to and seem to corroborate what the US is reporting.

        why would they make the story that they went into Pakistan?

       The ISI has been mostly complicit in U.S. activities. The 'invisible' power structure in the U.S. thought they had the ISI under control. In this case, a rogue general who is done giving a shit is giving his honest opinion. A lot of people share these beliefs, it's just a matter of finding those who do not care about the ramifications of speaking truth.

        Why create an international dispute that wasn't necessary for a fake story anyways?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       At the point in time when the alleged Osama assassination took place, the powers that be decided to cut Pakistan loose. They could see that the country was slowly turning against them, and further cooperation would simply provide harmful evidence in the future. This is when they decided to "kill" Osama. Fuck what Pakistan has to say, no one in the controlled Western media would dare report on this story.

        Also, why does Al Jazeera seem to support the US' claims? They have no reason to and seem to corroborate what the US is reporting.

      <p>
       I can't give you a definite answer. As far as I know, Al Jazeera has been fully honest and unbiased in reporting Middle Eastern events. They are not bound under the same centralized control that the American media is subject to. To help you understand, I will give you

       You are dead right about Ajazeera, all they care about is the truth. I met couple of their journos in the field and they are head and shoulders above the American press and quite a few of the British as well. On point with Pakistan as well, that country has been hemorrhaging credibility for years, closer to falling apart than it has ever been it its short history. Personally I feel that if you getting your news from anything on the telly then you are misinformed right from the start. Someone else said it before, the news here in America doesn't have to, legally, tell the truth. WTF.

       I was watching a doc, I think it was called the corporation, on linktv and I believe one part mentioned a story from where I am located near tampa - some bullshit happened regarding a story on monsanto and the local fox affiliate...long story short the fox affiliate won a counter lawsuit against the reporters under the decision that the news station didn't legally have to report the news factually. I may have botched up the summary a little bit but that's the gist of it. food for thought there.

       Don't listen to CNN. Dr. Steve Pieczenik has blown the whistle on this one already, and says that Bin Laden died of Marfan Syndrome in 01-02. He would know.
