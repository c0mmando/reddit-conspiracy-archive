    <div class="md"><p>I took the user ID I<strong>a</strong>mJulianAssange when I discovered Reddit about 10 months ago. At that time people in our criminal government and the sycophant syndicate media were calling for Julian Assange to be assassinated. I wanted to express the idea that &quot;we are legion&quot; and if you take one of us down a hundred will rise in his place. I got the idea from Anonymous and the movie <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8h_v_our_Q">I am Spartacus.</a></em></p>

<p>I soon learned that Reddit is crawling with shills. Through the use of multiple user accounts they can bury posts and gang up on posters in a comment thread. I decided to beat them at their own game by posting as many provocative links as I could find and engaging them in endless desultory banter. It worked. In order to get their comments noticed they had to up-vote my posts. I quickly accrued over 32,000 karma points but more importantly I drew attention to r/conspiracy and in a couple of months readers went from around 26,000 to over 38,000. They could not keep up with everyone while they were stalking me. </p>

<p>In exasperation &quot;they&quot; deleted my account. I had not broken any rules; I was not warned; and I was not given any notice (even to this day). I did not know that my account was deleted until someone put up a self post asking what had happened to me (like the one you just posted). My account appeared normal to me on my computer. However, no one else could see my posts or my comments (I can still access the account). Who could do that I wondered. I created this account, ImJulianAssange to find out. I got no help from the mods who could not detect anything wrong with my account. I finally got a very succint message from one of the mods that admins had deleted my account. They have never responded to my many messages and have made no attempt to find out &quot;who hacked their site&quot; so I guess the admins are &quot;they&quot;.</p>

<p>After a two week hiatus to think about what I might have done wrong I returned with my new (almost identical) user name. </p>

<p>My original intent was to</p>

<p><em>&quot;cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
The very faculties of eyes and ears.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Now I am trying to focus on exposing people to ideas that challenge what religion, free public education and nationalism would have us believe.</p>

<p>I use to provide 80% of r/conspiracy content. With all the new posters that is no longer necessary. The same ideas from multiple sources is more powerful than from one. </p>

<p>This is called a shadow ban, ninja ban, ghost ban, or what have you. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/kgwd8/how_do_i_get_a_shadow_ban_lifted_from_an_account/">Happens all the time</a>.</p>

<p>Only Admins can lift it, not Mods. It&#39;s usually reserved for spammers. If you were linking to the same blog repeatedly and with high frequency then an algorithm probably banned you automatically. The Admins may not even know who you are.</p>

<p>If <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is worried about it then everyone who&#39;s concerned should message the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#WhichstaffmembershouldIwritetoifIhaveaproblemorquestion">site&#39;s staff</a> and (politely) tell them that IamJulianAssange is a legitimate user and not a spammer.</p>

<p>I enjoyed your extreme Hyperbole, Julian, but it was very similar to how spam bots work on social aggregates like reddit, Digg, and the like. I was pretty sure you were a bot myself during the height of your posting, though your comments convinced me you just really liked to post;)</p>

<p>I doubt there is a conspiracy, you just probably haven&#39;t petitioned the right people. Or you did petition and your banning was for more than link bombing r/conspiracy and you just aren&#39;t revealing that (a conspiracy? AHH!!!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, <strong>you guys are stupid</strong></p>

<p>OP is julian or a friend. Julian was mute banned 7 months ago, not the last two weeks. He purposely wrote his reply to make it seem like he was recently banned by hidden powers to help muster support towards his agenda which new conspiracy members aren&#39;t a part of\</p>

<p>Check his history, redditor for 6 months and successfully posted posts the last 3 weeks. OP only a few days.</p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t banned recently! He is milking support for his cause through deception like a typical politician.</p>

<p>He originally got banned because he was probably linking to the same blog over and over so the bots mute banned him and afterwards, he figured out how to post to reddit properly but he wants us to think there is an elite power after us on reddit.</p>

<p>the only conspiracy on conspiracy are the white rights supremacists who work together to subtlety target their agenda against jews very indirectly although some members are too undisciplined and are very obvious but everyone is blind just as they are blind to this post</p>

<p>IamJulianAssange was a major contributor, and should have probably been given a warning or two before being given an unannounced shadow ban. The actions speak for themselves.

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya. We&#39;ve all been squelched at some point tho. You cannot act like it does not happen around here. Additionally, you have glossed over a major point; a 20,000+ karma poster was shadow-banned with no warning or indication. I could understand a new account, but after so much positive response, you kill that guys account without giving them a chance to learn from it? That&#39;s not reasonable at all. That&#39;s harsh and unreasonable, by definition. That account showed a load of goodwill towards this community, and as someone who represents this subreddit, you should be defending him rather than piling on. There is a difference between Spam and posting a lot.</p>

<li>He, by his own admission, submitted 80% of articles to the subreddit; I consider that flooding the new queue.</li>
<li>He will be busted for using sockpuppets to post things if he abuses them. That may, in fact, have been the reason for his original ban.</li>

<p>He was banned for &quot;cheating&quot; apparently. That ranges from using sockpuppets to upvote your own submissions to possibly monopolizing the new queue. (The admin team is intentionally vague.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Salvation Army is a church. Instead of priests and bishops they have captains and generals. I think religion is a form of control based on delusion. I worked within their system to develop a non religious method of self-directed addiction recovery. They now have the most successful recovery program in the world (30% compared to Betty Ford 5%). I also live and work in the United States I work within the system to improve it. It does not mean that I endorse the system or its beliefs. </p>

<p>I think the homosexuality test of political correctness is identical to the communist or terrorist test. I think it is blown way out of proportion and essentially boils down to: are you with us or against us?</p>

<p>I soon learned that Reddit is crawling with shills. Through the use of multiple user accounts they can bury posts and gang up on posters in a comment thread. I decided to beat them at their own game by posting as many provocative links as I could find and engaging them in endless desultory banter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sort of behavior is probably what got you <del>banned</del> deleted. You decided that reddit is &quot;full of shills&quot; so you decided that the only course of action was to basically flood reddit with links. Just because you think you see the truth doesn&#39;t make you exempt from the rules all reddit users have to follow. Check out the FAQ and reddiquette. You <strong>had</strong> broken rules, and I think I recall telling you that. </p>

<p>The reason people that are banned are not warned is because of spam. Spammers will simply create a new account if they know theirs has been removed. And you were spamming. A spammer is a spammer, and it was impossible to tell if you were some kind of reddit freedom fighter or just a dude trying to rack up karma by constantly posting articles. The end result is that you monopolize the new queue.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t make the decision whether users are removed or not. But I am saying that it&#39;s ridiculous to say you were banned because the SUITS AT CONDE NAST FREAKED OUT or because THE ADMINS WERE TRYING TO CENSOR MY TRUTH. Or whatever conspiracy line you want to trot out that lets you pretend you are the most important person on reddit and all the &quot;shills&quot; and admins are shaking in their boots all because you post links to news articles on reddit.</p>

<p>I appreciate that you are trying to bring new ideas to reddit. reddit has always been about discussion and ideas. No one is stopping you from spreading ideas, and you&#39;ll notice that since you aren&#39;t spamming any longer that your account remains uncensored and intact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Presumably the difference between spam and prolific should be the view. of the community. i.e , if the submissions are upvoted then not really spam.

    <div class="md"><p>I read what constitutes cheating at the link you provided.</p>

<p>I have never used shill or multiple accounts, voting services, or any other software to increase votes for submissions (although now I use a second account to check to see if this account is banned).</p>

<p>I have never been part of a group of people who send links to their submissions around via message, IM, or any other means, with the expectation of &quot;you guys vote for my stuff and I&#39;ll vote for yours.&quot;</p>

<p>I was never accused of cheating.</p>

<p>First it didn&#39;t happen; then I was caught in an automatic ban; now I was banned for something I did not do.</p>

<p>It was not an accident. It was not automatic. It was intentional. It was not for something I did not do. I was intentionally banned for posting not too much or too frequently but for posting topics that were contrary to the personal beliefs of the person who banned me.</p>

<p>I know you have no power or influence to change the situation but please do not try to convince yourself that banning me was either fair or justified. It was neither.</p>

<p>I did not say the powers that be. I said <em>the</em> person who had me banned did not do it for any of the reasons that you have suggested. <em>You</em> do not have access to all the user data. It was the content.</p>

<p>Reddit is not the utopian paradise you wish it were.

No one has investigated until now and the reason that I am given goes against the evidence. If it happened automatically it would have been corrected. Now six months later you are making excuses to try and hide the truth.</p>

<p>I accused you of being dishonest in your approach: first claiming not to be aware, then being dismissive in your conclusions then blaming the victim. You continue to misrepresent my position with your ridiculous cliches so you can dismiss the straw man that you created. I have never said I was &quot;sticking it to the man&quot; or that anyone was out to get me. I was posting links that someone found offensive despite your claim that no one cares what I post (how stupid is that?).</p>

<p>You have not found any offense (of the rules) and you have not found any lies. You are reduced to this ridiculous mewling pretense because you are an effete functionary who has not done his job. You are not helping me with your reminder to yourself of your self importance and how impartial and fair you think you are. Are you totally unaware that one of the major issues of this subreddit is poor moderation?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always maintained that it was never the <em>content</em> of your posts, but rather it was likely the <em>volume</em> of your posts.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with moderation; it was a decision made by the admins, and I&#39;m simply saying that I&#39;m far inclined to believe their word over your imagined oppression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK you manned up. <strong>You don&#39;t know</strong> and <em>you took the side of administration</em> over mine. Totally understandable and honest. But all along you are trying to belittle me by calling me crazy and a liar. Also you cannot help but try and throw in another disparaging remark by saying my situation is imagined oppression. Is that what you think is good customer service?</p>

<p>You also have been pretending that you have some sort of influence and now finally you admit that <em>the deletion has nothing to do with moderation</em>.  </p>

<p>For the sake of improving your product, put your animosity toward me aside for a moment and think about this. You conjecture that my account was deleted because of volume. What are the parameters of that violation? Is it an automated process? Does a human have to intervene? If the process is automated and someone goes over the invisible line doesn&#39;t it make sense to give them a notice instead of a phantom account? Shouldn&#39;t there also be an appeals process either way? Doesn&#39;t six months seem like a long time to wait to explain the decision?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simply because the administration has better things to do than give a crap about the politics you are espousing. You&#39;re trying to pretend that the administration somehow found the content of your submissions odious, and banned you because they didn&#39;t like your political opinion. I find it impossible to believe that, given the huge amount of evidence against it (the general transparency admins have displayed in the past, the vast and varied amounts of political opinions they allow to be posted all over reddit), they somehow singled you out for the political content of your posts. You have said yourself that it was this content that caused them to somehow despise you and want you gone, so since I believe that isn&#39;t the case, it would be foolish and illogical for me to think you weren&#39;t lying.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe by &quot;cheating&quot; they were talking about flooding the new queue? I&#39;m not privy to details.</p>

<p>I have not once said that I had any influence; only that I agree with the general rules of reddit, and if I catch people breaking them, I might remove them from <em>my</em> subreddit. I have been very careful to point out that I don&#39;t make the decisions to delete users nor do I have any influence over them outside of alerting the admins to possible abuses (which didn&#39;t happen in this case).</p>

<p>It is not an automated process; an admin decides whether you are flooding reddit or not. That doesn&#39;t mean that the admin who makes the decision has anything against the <em>content</em> of your submissions or against <em>you personally</em>.</p>

<p>Did you ask the admins? I can&#39;t say anything as to their response time; I asked and got a response back in less than a day. So I don&#39;t know what this &quot;6 month&quot; thing is all about. As far as I know, you never asked for an explanation until the other day.</p>

<p>I guess if you want to appeal you can take this directly to them or to some kind of subreddit devoted to these issues. </p>

<p>No, that was me looking at your user page <em>at your request</em> and seeing that it was gone. Anyone could&#39;ve done that for you, even someone who wasn&#39;t a mod. What I&#39;m not privy to (and what I was referring to in that sentence, if you could read) was the response of the admin team. I have no idea if they got back to you or not, or if you even asked them why you were banned until the other day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are guessing why.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kind of. I know that you were busted for cheating, which narrows down the possibility to a few different things: voting with sockpuppets, maybe even your monopolization of the new queue. What I know it was <em>not</em> was an individual deciding that the content of your posts was somehow odious or dangerous to them and deleting you out of spite.</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t know about their policy for informing people of their account&#39;s deletion. I don&#39;t know if you tried to contact them or even asked me 6 months ago when I pointed out your account was gone. My memory is fuzzy; I might have even told you why</p>

<p>I <em>suspect</em> that you know <em>exactly</em> why your account was deleted and you&#39;re just throwing a public fit because you&#39;re sore about it and/or you think it&#39;s part of some conspiracy.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no way I could&#39;ve known what had happened, because I&#39;m not an admin. I&#39;m accusing you because I trust the administration of reddit <em>and</em> because your version of events sound implausible. And here is <em>your</em> reasoning, and while you don&#39;t say the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; it sure as shit sounds like one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At that time people in our criminal government and the sycophant syndicate media were calling for Julian Assange to be assassinated. I wanted to express the idea that &quot;we are legion&quot; and if you take one of us down a hundred will rise in his place. I got the idea from Anonymous and the movie I am Spartacus.</p>

<p>I soon learned that Reddit is crawling with shills. Through the use of multiple user accounts they can bury posts and gang up on posters in a comment thread. I decided to beat them at their own game by posting as many provocative links as I could find and engaging them in endless desultory banter. It worked. I quickly accrued over 32,000 karma points but more importantly I drew attention to r/conspiracy and in a couple of months readers went from around 26,000 to over 38,000. They could not keep up with everyone while they were stalking me. </p>

<p><strong>In exasperation &quot;they&quot; deleted my account.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically you&#39;re saying that the administration of reddit contains &quot;shills&quot; that were hell bent on assassinating Julian Assange, and because you had somehow beaten them at their own reddit comment game (why reddit comments are somehow important to international policy is anyone&#39;s guess), the shadowy member of the administration deleted your account. </p>

<p>You go on with your special batch of crazy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I finally got a very succint message from one of the mods that admins had deleted my account. They have never responded to my many messages and have made no attempt to find out &quot;who hacked their site&quot; so I guess the admins are &quot;they&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So not only did you get a message from the admins about your account well before the most recent one, you are assuming that either a member of the secret conspiracy group &quot;hacked&quot; reddit OR a member of the admin is part of the <em>conspiracy</em> to have Julian Assange assassinated -- either way, your comments were just <em>too dangerous</em> to allow you to continue posting!!!!! And since reddit never investigated any hacking, they must be in cahoots with the Kill Assange Cabal [tinc]!!</p>

<p>You&#39;re delusional and self-important. I don&#39;t know the details of why you were banned; only an admin can say <em>exactly</em> why, but if I had to guess it would be close to this scenario: someone thinks they see &quot;shills&quot; downvoting their links in droves, they think there is some kind of anti-Assange cabal, and says to themselves, &quot;two can play at this game&quot;, and decide to create a bunch of sockpuppet accounts or create a voting ring to downvote them in turn to defeat the evil reddit downvoters and save Julian Assange through superior reddit upvoting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude you need a girl friend.</p>

<p>Stop sending me messages.</p>

<p>You keep misreading or misunderstanding what I post.</p>

<p>I never said the <em>administration</em> is filled with shills. I said reddit. Do you actually believe there are no shills on reddit?</p>

<p>You quote me correctly that I got a message from one of the <strong>mods</strong>. <strong>It was YOU!</strong> <em>You are the one who told me my account was deleted.</em> You claim your memory is fuzzy, you don&#39;t remember.</p>

<p>I call it the MSM the syndicate media because that is what it is by definition. I don&#39;t include reddit in the syndicate media.  There was a time when the mainstream media was calling for the execution of Julian Assange. I am not Julian Assange.</p>

<p>You keep claiming I have multiple accounts. That is your &quot;theory&quot;. It is not true. I only had one until I got this one. Now I have a second to test if this one has gone phantom. Ask admins to check my IP. I do not have a cabal of accounts or co-conspirators. (Which makes me even more impressive!)</p>

<p>You keep saying <strong>you do not know why my account was deleted</strong>. That has not stopped you from <strong>guessing</strong>. You are so angry and confused you keep making up reasons and calling me names. I don&#39;t know either.  <strong>&quot;Only an admin can say exactly why&quot;</strong>.  It was my understanding that one of the mods was an admin. Neither he nor anyone else has given me a reason.  </p>

<p>I have nothing against you or reddit. I was hoping you were the honest and fair person you claim to be. I am slightly disappointed but I have not given up hope. I feel confident that you will eventually redirect your attention and ask the admins on my behalf for an explanation and an opportunity to appeal the decision. </p>

<p>Best wishes in all your endeavors. </p>

<p>You can still see the archived stuff <a href="http://www.reddit.com/search?q=author%3Aiamjulianassange&amp;amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;amp;sort=new">here</a>. Basically when someone is flagged by the reddit system as spamming, usually by submitting a high number of links in a short period of time that don&#39;t get a lot of votes (either up or down) the account becomes inaccessible to anyone but the account holder. All posts go immediately into the moderator spam box and must be approved on a post by post and comment by comment basis by the subreddit moderator. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As you and many others have pointed out many times. Being a moderator does not make you right.</p>

<p>I completely understood your point. I was simply disagreeing with your assessment of the circumstances based on the known fact that chromakode (yeah, yeah... all admins are users too, I know that) was both an admin (with the power to ban/ninja-ban/delete accounts) <strong>and</strong> a moderator of r/conspiracy <em>at the time</em> that IamJulianAssange&#39;s account was ninja-banned (and yes, it does appear to be that type of ban - due to a recent search I did which revealed IamJulianAssange&#39;s account made a submission 23 days ago which is still falling under that ban - you can thank your newly recruited moderator, ambiversive, for making that information available).</p>

<p>My point is this: If IamJulianAssange was reported to r/RTS and approved (by that mod team) as a spammer (which, by the way, his type of posting does not meet all of their criteria, but is certainly borderline due to the frequency of his postings at the time), then the admins might have escalated those reports to an actual spammer ban. This is entirely possible and I&#39;m pretty sure this is the message you are asserting (i.e., that &quot;the admins&quot; did it because only the admins can - with or without any input from the r/conspiracy mods). BUT, it also appears (and suspiciously so) that the presence of an admin in this particular subreddit may have <em>also</em> been a factor in the decision making process (considering that particular admin quit this subreddit shortly after that ban, under circumstances you have described elsewhere as &quot;drama&quot;).</p>

<p>I.E., Yes, I&#39;m speculating that chromakode was involved in the ban.</p>

<p>That having been said, thank you for returning the layout to something &quot;plainer&quot; (easier on my aging eyesight).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, <strong>you guys are stupid</strong></p>

<p>OP is julian or a friend. Julian was mute banned 7 months ago, not the last two weeks. He purposely wrote his reply to make it seem like he was recently banned by hidden powers to help muster support towards his agenda which new conspiracy members aren&#39;t a part of.</p>

<p>Check his history, redditor for 6 months and successfully posted posts the last 3 weeks.</p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t banned recently! He is milking support for his cause through deception like a typical politician.</p>

<p>He originally got banned because he was probably linking to the same blog over and over so the bots mute banned him and afterwards, he figured out how to post to reddit properly but he wants us to think there is an elite power after us on reddit.</p>

<p>the only conspiracy on conspiracy are the white rights supremacists who work together to subtlety target their agenda against jews very indirectly although some members are too undisciplined and are very obvious but everyone is blind just as they are blind to this post</p>

<p>You&#39;ve talked to both of them at the same time ... where? on reddit? Are you not familiar with RES&#39;s &quot;quick account switching&quot; feature? It&#39;s quite an easy matter for one person to appear to be 25 (or more) different user accounts without ever breaking stride in 5 or 10 different simultaneous message threads. A fast typist can probably emulate even more accounts than that - especially if they don&#39;t rant, rave, or meander (short responses - less than 50 words or so).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hazarded a guess as to why you were banned. I stand by my statement that your abuse of the shared resource (the new queue) could have possibly warranted a ban, if not from reddit, then from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Now I find out you committed a worse offense, and are trying to lie about not having done it and inventing some nonsense story about how people are <em>out to get you</em> because you think posting a bunch of articles about conspiracy stuff is <em>sticking it to the man.</em> </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re nuts, dude. But that&#39;s just my personal opinion. It&#39;s not going to affect how I moderate this subreddit, and if you do find yourself on the wrong end of the spam filter or ban stick, you&#39;ll get an objective reason why, based on the rules of reddit and the subreddit.</p>
