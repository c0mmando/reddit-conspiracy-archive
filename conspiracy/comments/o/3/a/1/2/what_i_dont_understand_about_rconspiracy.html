<p>So why is everyone so shocked and appalled when they bare their fangs a little more? They will kill you without permission, they will detain you without permission, they will fuck with the DNA of our food without your permission... are we all just shocked because &quot;Oh my gosh golly they&#39;re going for it!&quot; or because they&#39;re choosing to announce their intentions (to scare us further, no doubt)?</p>

<p>Is this place just a notice board? &quot;Oh by the way, we&#39;ve fucked your permissions a bit further.&quot;</p>

<p>Because... let&#39;s face it. We don&#39;t have rights. We have permissions that our Masters allow.</p>

<p>What happens to one&#39;s right to life when another decides to kill her? It doesn&#39;t seem very inalienable now does it?

<p>No you dont understand as ChickaloonCharlie suggests;</p>

<p>We are not shocked that they bare their fangs; we are shocked that so few people see <em>&quot;They will kill you without permission, they will detain you without permission, they will fuck with the DNA of our food without your permission&quot;</em></p>

<p>Also, there is much we are not in agreement with. Many people focus on things that are distractions.</p>

<p>Conspiracy has been used for years to not only distract - but to also build a credible deniability to those who are &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; -- but now, now the conspiracies are WAY too plain to see - and the credible deniability is used against those that are truly the ones who have been pointing this shit out, such that there is a much lower % of people that have really been paying attention to what is real as compared to those that have been distracted by bullshit.</p>

<p>Conspiracy is about the people/organizations that hide from the public. The &quot;movers and shakers and moguls&quot; don&#39;t just represent the government, or the government in it&#39;s entirety.</p>

<p>Bringing conspiracy to light for discussion, burns it into peoples minds. Every day, smart people form opinions on what they will do about what they read.  This board, comprised of freaks, geeks, and sneaks, preforms a service that isn&#39;t always apparent to the creators.

<p>I really don&#39;t see that much surprise. There are people here who don&#39;t want to believe each new development, but I don&#39;t see many who are surprised.</p>

<p>Everyone here is in agreement that &quot;They&quot; who are the movers and shakers and moguls of the world don&#39;t give a damn about us and would gladly kill everyone for a little extra breathing room. &quot;They&quot; suck, right?</p>

<p>My own vision of <em>Them</em> is a bit more in a gray area than that. I believe that some of <em>Them</em> are doing what they do because they are convinced that it is the best thing for the world, and therefore <em>They</em> don&#39;t see themselves as &quot;evil&quot;. (Although probably they recognize that they are Machiavelians, as in &quot;the end justify the means&quot;.) Now, for us poor mortals, that brings little solace. Let&#39;s just remember the saying &quot;Hell is littered with good intentions&quot;...</p>
