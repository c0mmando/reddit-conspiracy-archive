       "From a historical point of view, the only reaility is that of conspiracy. Secrecy, wealth and independence add up to power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deception is the key element of warfare, (the tool of the power elites), and when winning is all that matters, the conventional morality held by ordinary people becomes an impediment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secrecy stems from a pervasive and fundamental element of our life in our world, that those who are at the top of the heap will always take whatever steps are necessary to maintain the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very label 'conspiracy' serves as an automatic dismissal, as though no one ever acts in secret. Let us bring some perspective and common sense to the issue. The United States comprises large organizations- corporations, bureaucracies, 'interest groups', and the like- which are conspiratorial by nature. That is, they are hierarchical, their important decisions are made in secret by a few key decision-makers, and they are not above lying about their activities. Such is the nature of organizational behavior. 'conspiracy, in this key sense, is a way of life around the globe."

       Once in a while I try this stuff, but whatever I post doesn't get voted or viewed at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm even careful not to scare them, because I know that running in screaming "OMG it's a big conspiracy you guys!" is a waste of time, and only serves to discredit the conspiracy theorists.
      </p>

       But even when you post things like "Hey did you guys know that the US was behind dozens of military coups around the world?", no one dares to say anything about it.

       I constantly face the same problem with friends and family. It's very frustrating, people just don't seem to see what's really important. They fall victim to superficial politics, and a majority mindset. What we're supposed to believe is ridiculous, the news is ridiculous, TV is ridiculous, sports are ridiculous. AND, the enemy is
       <em>
        not
       </em>

       Don't be so sure that r/anarchism understands.  Remember, communism and anarchism have often been considered similar ideologies, mutually supportive, and communism was one of the most successful conspiracies of this century, consuming more than 1/3 of the human population.  There does need to be some type of governance, the less the better, absolutely, but dangerous technology alone is a valid justification for government.

       My conclusion about communism is that it is good at only one thing ... the suppression of the general population. Communism is a keen-o tool for controlling a country, and forcing its people to do what you want them to do, but in every other respect it falls short.

       Anarchism and communist are quite different, especially the kind of communist that comes forced upon the people, which is pretty much the only form of communism that history has produced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communists also sabotaged a lot of anarchist projects throughout the years, and if you go to
       <a href="/r/anarchism">
        /r/anarchism
       </a>
       and ask what they think about communism, they will most likely say they don't like it. I don't mind communism in theory, but in practice it's usually more authoritarian than anything.

       I've always said something similar to this.  I complain about how somehow the term "conspiracy theory" carries such negative connotations.

      <p>
       Everything that has ever happened in history ever was a conspiracy.
