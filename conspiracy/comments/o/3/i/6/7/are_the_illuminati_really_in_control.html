Problem is, all sources of information are, in fact, very sanitized to prevent this type of enlightenment.</p>

<p>1: control the media
2:control the food supply
3: control the US military
4: control world monetary supply</p>

<p>Beyond this there are a few more specifics, but I wont go into anything deeper to keep this short. Beyond that let me say that hypnotism is very real and about 95% of people are susceptible to this and television and movies are perfect vehicles for putting your mind into an alpha state and download you with messages. Sounds pretty out there unless you actually do the research. Alan watt did a really good video about this called &quot;Enslavement of the mind&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They only have as much power as we agree that they have.</p>

<p>They cannot control everything. So they choose the largest blocks they can find: 1.) money, 2.) government and 3.) information. Those are levels of control that seem overwhelming, but once you see through them the control begins to degrade - almost evaporate. The man behind the curtain loses power when you see him for what he is (The Wizard of Oz [novel] was about central banking by the way).</p>

<p>1.) Their money system is failing, but that was likely planned. Not that it matters. We, by way of 9th and 10th amendment can charter our own banks and coin our own money (no kidding). Money is little more than a medium of exchange. We allow them control of a medium that ought to be public. This is an injustice and I expect people to take it back as they properly should sooner or later (propbably not within my lifetime).</p>

<p>2.) Their government organization is so corrupt that it is falling apart before our very eyes. Look at these presidential &#39;candidates.&#39; They must conceal their corruption and side-step all real questions. What will their slogans be? &quot;I only stripped away three rights relative to my opponent.&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll only rob you if you&#39;re poor.&quot; This is what our &#39;democracy&#39; has devolved into. I can&#39;t imagine it limping along for much longer.</p>

<p>3.) Information. Knowledge truly is power. They know this. Which is why the clamp down on media. This is a centuries old technique and the only bone in their works is the internet. People are catching on like never before. I woke up by accident. Many others are doing the same right now. So long as we think and discuss on ur own terms - not their terms - we are playing by our game. The illuminati have defined the game as such: A.) If we play by their rules they win. B.) If we do not play by their rules they lose. C.) They will do anything necessary to keep us well within their rule set.</p>

<p>So, if we decide to not play their game we win.</p>

<p>They are a few. We are many. I think we have a shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of &#39;their&#39; plans occur at key astrological moments, so in some ways one can map out their activities. So much of what &#39;they&#39; do is rooted in esoteric ritual... You can see it all over in city planning, monuments, etc. It makes sense that an opposing force would meet them on an esoteric level.</p>

<p>I guess the weight of astrology and its effects holds little bearing on reddit, but it has a powerful effect within the collective conscious and subconscious. Pretty much everyone knows their zodiac sign, yet only a handful in comparison know their blood type. Some people believe in it and others don&#39;t, though I&#39;m pretty confident that &#39;they&#39; believe in it and use it where they can. </p>

<p>They cannot control everything. So they choose the largest blocks they can find: 1.) money, 2.) government and 3.) information. Those are levels of control that seem overwhelming, but once you see through them the control begins to degrade - almost evaporate. The man behind the curtain loses power when you see him for what he is (The Wizard of Oz [novel] was about central banking by the way).</p>

<p>1.) Their money system is failing, but that was likely planned. Not that it matters. We, by way of 9th and 10th amendment can charter our own banks and coin our own money (no kidding). Money is little more than a medium of exchange. We allow them control of a medium that ought to be public. This is an injustice and I expect people to take it back as they properly should sooner or later (propbably not within my lifetime).</p>

<p>2.) Their government organization is so corrupt that it is falling apart before our very eyes. Look at these presidential &#39;candidates.&#39; They must conceal their corruption and side-step all real questions. What will their slogans be? &quot;I only stripped away three rights relative to my opponent.&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll only rob you if you&#39;re poor.&quot; This is what our &#39;democracy&#39; has devolved into. I can&#39;t imagine it limping along for much longer.</p>

<p>3.) Information. Knowledge truly is power. They know this. Which is why the clamp down on media. This is a centuries old technique and the only bone in their works is the internet. People are catching on like never before. I woke up by accident. Many others are doing the same right now. So long as we think and discuss on ur own terms - not their terms - we are playing by our game. The illuminati have defined the game as such: A.) If we play by their rules they win. B.) If we do not play by their rules they lose. C.) They will do anything necessary to keep us well within their rule set.</p>

<p>So, if we decide to not play their game we win.</p>

<p>They are a few. We are many. I think we have a shot.</p>
