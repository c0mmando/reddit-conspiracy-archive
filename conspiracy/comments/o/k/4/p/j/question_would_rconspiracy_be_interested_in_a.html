        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Think &quot;peoples history of the united states&quot; but built out by tinfoilers with the major events of concern plugged into a timeline.</p>

<p>We could structure this by century, then decade. Build out a bullet list of major events that occured during/between these time points and back it up with as much evidence as possible.</p>

<p>Basically, any event you happen to know a lot about, or some about, you could add the bullet and your links to the info.</p>

<p>The end result is a world timeline of tinfoil history.</p>

<p>It has multiple timelines on conspiracy events -- but it HAS TO BE SOURCED.  No David Icke &quot;Pepsi uses aborted fetuses&quot; bullshit.  There&#39;s plenty of facts to damn the Neocon perpetrators of 9/11 on existing source material, but you have to be a serious factual amateur historian to participate.</p>

<p>This weeds out the disinfo/COINTELPRO people to a large degree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I was not thinking of unverifiable information, but like information on real people events such as the neocons rise to power from their positions in the CIA and as beginning aides in the 70s through their installation of CIA agents into the office of potus. </p>

<p>And think like dov zhakeim&#39;s role in building the Israeli military through the 80s to his thriving 2 trillion on 9/10. Unocal being installed as president of Afghanistan etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely yes. We all know how history is written extremely selectively. But hearing a conspiracy-minded world history adds more to the total accumulation of history out there.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like how anecdotal experience isn&#39;t valid as evidence. A single study on human health is anecdotal in the grand scheme of things. But when you start looking over dozens of studies on the same topic, and there are meta-analysis and reviews, the big picture begins to emerge.</p>

<p>History, or news, or opinion from one outlet shows a limited, biased view of things, so if we can get all sorts of opinions out there it would be a good thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with treebright, a different web site altogether would be desirable.  Possibly a wiki, or a different site that may or may not include one.  Reddit works on stories, which age and blend into the vast archives.  Such a site could integrate with the subreddit somewhat.  Or merely linked in submissions from time to time.  I can provide free hosting (I have &quot;unlimited&quot; hosting because I already pay $15/mo at hostgator) if someone wants to buy a domain name.  I might even be willing to put in a limited amount of time helping others build such a site (I know how to program but don&#39;t have much free time).  Also, freedns.afraid.com can provide free subdomains (haha kinda like a subreddit).  I have a (simple and limited) online c++ compiler hosted with the address <a href="http://doubles.ftp.sh">http://doubles.ftp.sh</a> for example.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I don&#39;t know if an &quot;official <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> history&quot; is necessarily a good thing.  Mainstream history with it&#39;s millions of books arguably still has its gaps - and not all are deliberate manipulation but rather oversight or subconcious bias of the authors.</p>
