       If one has only the itchy feeling but not the visible fibers emerging, it may be an allergic reaction to something or things.  Such diverse items as cats, the Santa Ana wind (dust and ions) will trigger annoying itching in me of this form, but I don't consider it Morgellon's.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you have the canonical symptom - colored fibers appearing coming out of your skin, now that's true Morgellon's. Until more doctors get the disease themselves and begin to take it more seriously, the med establishment won't do anything. The CDC whitewashed their investigation, which to me says someone applied pressure. In the long run I won't be surprised if Monsanto or military bioweapons get connected in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Added: the new CDC announcement is so bogus. 1) the study was conducted only among Kaiser patients, 2)  the study looked at 115 people. Total.  3) the study only talked to people they found by searching through patient records for similar symptoms  4) they claim ""We found no infectious cause" which is not the same as being able to say there is no environmental cause,  5) where there were fibers, the researchers said all were common cotton or other material.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a controlled whitewash. Other researchers who carefully examined fiber samples from Morgellon's claimants have found by means of mass spectrometry peculiar abnormal elements, plastic materials unlike clothing fibers, and odd biological properties in them. How is it the CDC found nothing like that?

       I would highly recommend seeing a Dr and let them help you look into it.  I have read a decent amount about Morgellons and i honestly do not know what to make of it all... However i do know that if it is actually paranoid parasitosis or some other tricks of the mind then without outside help you may never know.  The mind is powerful.

       Personally, I think a large number of the people who talk about it so vehemently are in fact bonkers. I can't dismiss them all as paranoid delusions, but I think people draw lines where there may not be any. The claims of the fibers being connected to chemtrails, for example. It's still very interesting and I try to read/watch anything that I stumble upon about it. Before you start pulling bits of your skin apart, you may want to try switching to a mild detergent and soap.

       It looks to me like they updated the "current status" section and neglected to update the section you quoted.

       I see. thanks.   We still don't have a peer reviewed journal article about the condition/epidemeology, there is no accepted medical condition as such.   'The symptoms so far as I know haven't been conclusively diagnosed. (e.g. colored fibres)

       Some ideas:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Might be due to GM foods (timing is there), and/or toxic food additives, strange chemicals merging with your tissue
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Might be a buildup of foreign materials in the body, that get stuck near tissue somehow, such as hard plastics, and the body is expelling them as wires
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Maybe hair generating follicles are expelling foreign materials
        </p>

      </ul>

       Definatly a GMO link to examine with the prevalence of Agrobacterium (used in GMO gene transfer) in humans Morgellons suffers. But more acutely, it seems like an onset illness from nano-particulate environmental toxins as part of the ongoing aerosol regime.

       As someone who has battled fleas on more than one occasion, you are going to have to live with the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        You will always be itchy at random, probably more as you grow older
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You have to be at peace with it.  Until you discover hard evidence, don't sweat it.  Your body is naturally itchy throughout the day.  Maybe its not 100% natural but it's there and usually benign enough that you can't do anything about it.

       Could be scabies. Is the itching around hot spots like groin, wrists, armpits? Scabies are more active at night. I had them and it was treated with a lotion easily. Have you been to a dermatologist? To test, they just scrape your skin and look under a microscope. Also, scabies aren't visible to the naked eye.

       Could it be your liver?
Maybe buy 400 thread count of a good polyester mix. The type of material that. Cools.
