    <div class="md"><p>No, but there is an interesting amount of relations between Pharaohs =&gt; Roman nobility =&gt; European royalty =&gt; American political/corporate wealthy; and if you want to bring secret societies into this... well, you&#39;re looking at all kinds of links and tangled webs. Sure, if you choose to look back far enough, we can find common ancestry in Africa, but these are relatively recent bloodlines that make sense to note contextually. </p>

<p>The large amount of symbolism used by societies is known today to be a useful tool for conveying and storing information in the brain; historically that put science behind the reasoning of all these <a href="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx5cfrpRxf1qdr294o1_500.jpg">symbols</a> we see in ancient civilizations like pyramids and obelisks and such. The general populace isn&#39;t aware of the kind of psychological interpretations that are occurring behind all of these symbols being constantly fed into their subconscious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just as DragonHunter said about building a pyramid... Try making a symbol.  You&#39;ll draw a triangle, or a circle, or one of many interesting-looking simple geometrical shapes.  Or likely you will use one you&#39;ve seen before and think is cool (eye of horus).  Common symbology is not necessarily a conspiracy.</p>

<p>EDIT: ugh, 9/11 related stuff. </p>

<p>that being said though, what we must focus on is not whether or not 9/11 was an inside job, but the actions that were taken in the name of 9/11 that we must investigate since 2001. So far what has the U.S done? Invaded Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, itching to go to war with Iran, and expanding military bases and embassies throughout the region, benefiting MNC&#39;s like Haliburton, Bechtel, and ex-CIA/JSOC operatives moving into the security contractor industry that are not subject to U.S or International Law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should all get together for dinner one night. I agree with you fully. I personally like to think that our species has endured unimaginable calamity, both cosmic and earthy and still, we exist. </p>

<p>There have likely been guardians of knowledge throughout the epochs and they use their knowledge to rule everyone else. They use physics, philosophy, geometry, biology, and calculus to dominate all others and mostly keep their vast knowledge a secret, hence the desperate efforts of occultists and adepts of esotera to &#39;learn the unlearnable&#39;. </p>

<p>The pyramids of yesteryear may have been the obelisks of today. Who knows?</p>

<li><p>From Αμμων (Ammon), the Greek form of Egyptian Ymn (reconstructed as Yamanu) which meant &quot;the hidden one&quot;. In early Egyptian mythology he was a god of the air, creativity and fertility, who was particularly revered in Thebes. Later, during the Middle Kingdom, his attributes were combined with those of the god Ra and he was worshipped as the supreme solar deity Amon-Ra.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;d like the books of Enoch. Reportedly, his biblical texts tell the story of his interaction with &quot;the gods&quot;, who travelled here from space and had him construct the pyramids with their assistance. The reason was to store their gifts of knowledge with human, in 300+ texts. Who knows where they are now.</p>

<p>Anyhow, yeah, I totally agree; there&#39;s much more to the story of international pyramids and megalithic construction than we&#39;re being told. I look forward to dec 21 2012, as I predict the return of extraterrestrials (or just the truth about them). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Will most likely get downvoted, but head on over <a href="/r/DMT">/r/DMT</a> and the psychonautic crowd will say that elves are real, just not in this physical world we live. Nutso right? But for those that ingest DMT or Ayahuasca, some of these individuals have an experience similar to a NDE or OBE and do report seeing intelligent entities conversing with them, including elven like entities, serpents, praying mantises, and others. Similarly, people that are susceptible to OBE&#39;s report meeting entities as well. </p>

<p>FYI he states that DMT is secreted from your pineal gland. There is no scientific proof of that as of now. Its just a theory. Currently DMT is found in our brain/blood cells as well as in plants and other mammals.</p>

<p>If you look at most religions, they practice a form of meditation, whether it be through yoga, prayer, incantations, and chants. These are all methods of going into our altered state of consciousness. Ingesting Ayahuasca is I suppose, &#39;the easy way&#39; of traveling to this realm, subconscious mind, hyperspace, whatever you want to call it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>H.P. Blavatsky wrote The Secret Doctrine. The works of Alice Baily known as the blue books are not negative or &quot;evil&quot; in anyway. The term Lucifer used in theosophical literature meant &quot;Light-bringer&quot; and had nothing to do with the devil, which Blavatsky claimed not to believe in.</p>

<p>In 1887, Blavatsky created a theosophy magazine,and she chose to name it Lucifer, which was a dark joke and in part was used to keep her critics at arms length.</p>

<p>I recommend &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot; for understanding some of the connections from ancient Egypt to the Hermetic traditions. Her great works introduced the ancient mysteries to the Occident.</p>
