       I think that having links to conspiracy things is a neat idea, but this has been implemented in a bad way. I'm saying this as a user and webdesigner; please stop what you are doing, it's not only hurting the users of this sub-reddit but also it feels like a crime of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
       Effectively, this subreddit feels like it's trapped under/inside this blue page trying to creep in. The structure of any website is always framed, by the browser, and the fact is not having reddit on the top or left fo this frame makes it feel less important while in reality it's the meat(due to our reading top down/left to right).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, another of my concerns is the fact that when a massive amount of links, and content, is provided in such a manner it's as if this community and the people running this subreddit are endorsing said links, and content.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO, this is the main problem with these links; of course, not all the people on this subreddit would be comfortable endorsing the information provided. Now I'm not saying that David Icke isn't interesting, or Alex Jones doesn't have good information sometimes, or that AboveTopSecret doesn't have a interesting/bleeding edge info; but the truth is not everyone believes the world is run by Lizard people, or that FEMA is going to kill us, or even that not all people can handle all the fear that ATS may impose on somebody.

       What was it with the blue, anyway? Some kind of blue fetish on the part of the designer? Or maybe he thought the blue would make us all more docile. If so, didn't work.

       I feel bad saying this, but as a web designer too I have to agree, it's uncomfortable on the eye.  I feel bad because i'm sure someone put a lot of time and effort into the redesign.

       I no longer see what is being done to this subreddit. The only time I get a glimpse is when I am not signed in and the custom frame peaks behind my custom css. I have gotten rid of all the boxes on the side. My only complaint is that I always have to log in to browse but at least I found a solution. I am now more or less apathetic to the changes that take place around here, my only concern is that it would appear erratic and unstable to new users--something that a sub like this should really strive to avoid and be a bit more professional. If it were my task to improve the look I would not implement a change until I was certain it would be an improvement and then I would stick with it. If I wanted to experiment first I would create a separate sub and experiment and even invite users to comment. The mistake is for an inexperienced designer to keep implementing looks and ideas only to realize they do not work well. Trial and error needs a separate place where it does not interfere or constantly shock users into adjusting to new themes and layouts. One change is an irritant and constant changes are a constant irritant.

       I've noticed a lot of flack directed at the mods lately about changes in how this subreddit looks....What does it matter how it looks? You people are knit picking over the stupidest shit right now and all the mods are trying to do is make it a better experience for you. That's pretty selfish. Are you here for information or are you here for aesthetics? Is this truly a good way for you to be spending your time right now? We have this forum to coordinate and keep each other informed and they are holding it together while you bitch and moan about colors or elements of design that don't agree with you. Get it together or we all fail. There isn't a time for bickering over trivial things. And try and show some appreciation for christ's sakes. This is voluntary work they are doing for YOU.

       I disagree entirely! It is potentially very useful! The question is open as to how best to utilize the new space. I intend to make it a resource for newbies to get acquainted with standard conspiracy lore, as well as displaying potentially subreddit relevant information. There are others who

       So if the list of links was, say, a hundred links long. We could say that "starting from the top" is "what everyone who comes here should know" (ie: most important recent news story) .. and "starting from the bottom" is for newbies .. like, if you haven't seen this already you're not paying attention. So the #1 left side link should change only when something more important comes along..

       Yes and phonetic at that. Back to the topic at hand...This sidebar that you plan on being a manufactured consent indoctrination station was an unnecessary addition in the first place. And yes, the whole wingding thing gives it a creepy feel- like something you'd see on a Scientology pamphlet.

       The interim one was horrible I agree, but this is greatly improved. Most subreddits are just
       <em>
        boring
       </em>
       compared to this one.
