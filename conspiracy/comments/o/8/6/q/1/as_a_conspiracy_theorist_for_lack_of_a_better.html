       A lot of people call me crazy. Are my beliefs not sane?

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         the real events of 9/11 probably involved government/banking/military-industrial elements (e.g., possibly entities within, but not necessarily "officially" sponsored by, Israel, USA, Rothchilds, Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, etc.). The investigation was clearly white-washed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         JFK was clearly taken out with military precision. The investigation was clearly white-washed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Vietnam was an exercise in military-industrial profitability (i.e., keeping unemployment from skyrocketing in the US), as was Iraq, as is Afghanistan, etc: if everyone who started working as a result of WW2 &amp; the military-industrial complex born thereof were to stop working, a lot of people would be out of work.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         9/11 was an experiment (similar to JFK) partially intended to achieve some kind of result (unknown, probably involving money), and partially just to prove that whoever-is-running-things-these-days can do whatever they want and get away with it, in spite of everything (through media monopolies, cointelpro, friends in high places in government, etc.).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the 2000 &amp; 2004 elections were both at least partially rigged (between Diebold, Jeb Bush, the Supreme Court, etc.)

       Most people around here are anything but critical thinkers.  They want to understand the world but are too lazy to study history and politics so they listen to Alex Jones who tells them they can be just as "smart" as all those readers if they just regurgitate what he says.  This is why youtube is so popular here, no one can explain their position but they know a guy who makes videos with creepy music that really gets it spot on maaaaaaannnnnnnnnnn.

       I don't think you're giving this subreddit as much attention as it deserves.  Alex Jones isn't as popular here as you might think.  Many of us (myself included) see right through him and are well aware of his agenda.

       Alex is just an easy face to attack, the regurgitation comes from all kinds of sites, David Icke, Jesse Ventura, there is even a Farrakhan video on the front page this morning.  There are very few people here who are actually looking at the evidence and making their own judgement.  The girl who runs endthelie.com is one of those who does actually research shit, makes the connections and then writes about it (with punctuation even).

       edit: Coalition Provisional Authority Cash Payment Scandal: On June 20, 2005, the staff of the Committee on Government Reform prepared a report for Congressman Henry Waxman.[61] It was revealed that $12 billion in cash had been delivered to Iraq by C-130 planes, on shrinkwrapped pallets of US $100 bills.[62] The United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, concluded that "Many of the funds appear to have been lost to corruption and waste.... Some of the funds could have enriched both criminals and insurgents...." Henry Waxman, commented, "Who in their right mind would send 363 tons of cash into a war zone?" A single flight to Iraq on December 12, 2003 which contained $1.5 billion in cash is said to be the largest single Federal Reserve payout in US history according to Henry Waxman.

       I often share you sad sentiment... try to realize that amid all the evil in the world there is still much good also. Focus on the good once in a while and it will help to lift your spirits when you're down. Do what you can to promote good in the world on a local level and realize many things are out of your control.

       Hi, FYI one of my browser's bookmarks is this:

       It's called "September Clues".  I don't claim to have definitive authoritative knowledge of 9/11/2001, but this was very interesting.  The skeptic in me wonders if it was doctored, but if it was it took a great deal of effort.  The last time I watched it, I thought it was fairly compelling.  I don't want to sound like Noam Chomsky here, but whether a plane hit the building on 9/11 or not isn't that significant in the grand scheme of things.  What is significant is that we don't fully know what happened and we keep getting into wars lately.  A court ruling recently was even against Iran (default judgement), yet most "truthers" and 9/11 victims who have tried to get a just hearing and investigation from the courts were kept out.

       I'm about to watch your video now, so i'm not sure if it's about planes hitting or not hitting. But my issue with them "faking" planes hitting the towers is simple. Sure, news channels could easily fake video of planes hitting, however, there were thousands of people in NY that saw planes hit, and probably hundreds of videos that all matchup by every day citizens. For me, personally, what gives 9/11 away as a conspiracy is WTC 7 and the Pentagon, not so much the actually WTC 1 and 2. (Although there is lots of evidence about 1 and 2 that is very convincing by itself) If your video has nothing to do with the planes.. sorry i wasted your time. lol. Going to watch now.

       Thanks, I'll take "my own medicine" and rewatch at least some of the video too.  It's been a while since I saw it.  It is suggesting that no planes hit and it was a missile (that hit the WTC, I know that a missile hitting the Pentagon is a yawning matter here).

       When 9/11 first kicked off, the first conspiracy theorists I heard talking about it were of the opinion that the towers were brought down by nuclear weapons! Then they revised later to "special" nuclear weapons that didn't leave radioactive traces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say, that has pretty much vanished as a theory now.

       Some sort of bomb did go off in the basement. This was recorded about 6-8 seconds BEFORE the first plane even hit. They said it actually shook the ground (this was recorded/tested) more than the buildings falling did.

       I always read the "reptilian" stuff as a reference to the "reptile brain".  Yes, there are humans walking around that look like humans, but they are really "reptilian" in thought and nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they don't literally take of their human masks at the end of the day...but in some more metaphorical and symbolic ways, they do.

       In most stories dragons, western ones,  live in caves, or in the Earth.  They hoard treasure and gold and kill adventures who want to steal the treasure.  They demand sacrifice or appeasement from time to time as well.

       Well, there certainly appears to be a small portion of the population who naturally exhibit sociopathic tendencies. Given the structure of our social hierarchy these people find it easier to rise to the top, or at least away from the lower levels, being untroubled by guilt.

       It is called thinking for yourself. You are resisting the Mass Media Cultural Programming that works so well on the masses. The same people calling you "crazy" all seem to recognize that something is very wrong in America and the world. Yet these same people will refuse to look to deeply into issues for fear of ostracization and other reasons.

       Here's an exercise for you: look up the Wikipedia entries for the Iran-Iraq war and the contra wars in Nicaragua. Read them carefully, and assume that everything on these pages are proven facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now ask yourself why the masses are not outraged at any of what happened, and if they are, how nothing happened and nothing changed (or has gotten worse).
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to define 'sanity'. There is no real definition, but in the end you will come up with something equivalent to 'sanity = normal'. But 'normal' is definitely crazy, because it doesn't realize or care about the stuff in the first paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, being normal is being insane, but that doesn't mean that not being normal is being sane. For example, you can believe in lots of things that aren't true. Just because they're fringe and unpopular doesn't mean they're sane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sanity is relative. It makes no sense to ask if you're crazy on your own. Are you crazy relative to someone 'normal'? That person might think so, but you also believe that that person is crazy, because it disregards the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're like me, you want the truth, no matter how ugly or uncomfortable. And you are ready to risk your reputation and your sanity to get to the truth. You don't even know if the truth actually exists, but you're after it anyway because you can't bring yourself to stop seeking the truth. In that process you will have to investigate topics and consider theories that may or may not be true. The mere fact that you're considering them at all may be labeled as insane by some, but it isn't, not until you believe these things without proof, or without admitting to yourself that you may be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does CNN cut Ron Paul interviews as censorship, or is it just a technical malfunction? Unfortunately, there's no way to know for sure. Maybe CNN is playing dumb, and is actually supporting Ron Paul for super secret evil reasons, and it's censoring him on purpose to gather public support. Maybe CNN and everything else is all a dream.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to live with these uncertainties. Questioning your own sanity is a sign that you're not insane. Only the most insane people are convinced they are sane, and never questioning their own sanity.

       I have no doubt there has been a massive cover-up around 9/11.  What all is being covered up I'm not sure, but I don't think you can believe the official story once you've heard the evidence against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The investigation into John Kennedy's assassination was definitely a joke, no denying that.  I believe there is obviously a cover up.  I'm not sure exactly what is being covered up (I have my theories) but it's obvious when you walk through the evidence that something is amiss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vietnam, Iraq, you name the war and we probably got into it for financial reasons at least partially.  There is always a profitability factor when it comes to war.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if they were experiments or not.  I have no real opinion on this yet, but that could change tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes.  Both elections were a joke.  But keep in mind it's a lot harder to cheat if everyone shows up, they can get away with it when only a minority vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       In closing I think we all feel nuts sometimes and some of us probably are a little bit at least.  But if you are cognizant enough to ask if you're crazy then you're not really.  Just make sure you're not suffering from Confirmation Bias, that's really easy to do for me and then I get sucked in further.  Sometimes you just have to step back and go, "Okay what do I really believe and why?  Does that hold up?" and move on from there.

       i have not only just realized it. i knew 9/11 stunk from the day it happened. you guys make -so many- assumptions.. it's ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       the reality, though, is that there ARE such things as "conspiratards" and "paranoid" people. if you've ever listend to rush limbaugh or coast 2 coast FM you would know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       what we need is a more fact-based approach, and less HURRR CHECK OUT DIS YOUTUBE VIDEO YO IT PROVES 9/11 WAS DONE BY BUSH HURRRRRRRRR shit. but maybe
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       is only for people who want sensationalist reptilian bullshit, not people who want intelligent discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       arguing that "conspiratards" and "paranoia" are not valid labels implies that no label is truly valid and that we should just flow back into the ephemera and abandon language altogether. sounds like madness to me.

       conspiratards and paranoia are often side effects of the abuse and eventual (although mostly incorrect) gradual deprogramming by either subversive elements such as hate groups, or the conspiracy media disinformation coupled with the extreme anxiety of an unexpected journey outside of the matrix (aka: hivemind, or consensus)of society. this is not their fault. people of a certain age probably never will wake up fully, and my heart weeps for them. these people latch onto the information that is fed to them, but through years of simply accepting claims from the media while in an alpha state, they bring this same process to their online information gathering, often getting most of their info from youtube, which is worse in some ways than the msm. they watch the videos, but fail to back up a lot of what they see with a paper trail and when these people are challenged on these false beliefs they either become indignant or they crumble like ashes in the wind. this also serves a purpose in the NWO, to frame all truth seekers as paranoid, racist, ignorant or just plain stupid and the audience just eats it up. yum yum.

       I grew up with TV.  I've for the most part cut it out of my life as an adult.  But there are plenty of Internet clips of what TV is showing.  I am sometimes around other people who have a TV on at the time.  I can see subliminal messages in TV, magazines, etc.  When TV was in it's infancy, older people supposedly would be against it and say "it rots your brain".  The Internet is better in many ways, but is prone to rigging like how TV was.  Is it a mind control brainwashing box that emits flashes and neurolinguistic programming anchors and colors in a way to shape the viewer?  Every time I find myself around somebody else when a sitcom is playing (this is rare but...), I feel a little angry at even little things like the laugh track telling you that what you are watching is funny and that you should laugh.  Or other techniques like the lighted "Applause" sign that TV audiences have.  Even the constant bombardment of "sex" "sex" "sex" written all over the photos and videos we watch (in a subliminal fashion where it is almost like invisible ink but there).

       As a teen in high school, before coming across anything about conspiracy theories and only having associated "conspiracy theory" with "let's wear tin foil beanies so the government can't read our minds", I remember having a sinking feeling and telling a couple others in one of my classes that "This is awful, I hope we don't end up in a war over this" on 9/11/2001 (TV or radio broadcasts were being tuned-in-to in all of my classes).  This was before Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, etc.  You were heavily downvoted - I upvoted you even though I don't fully agree with your message.

       what if you are both right? we all have "handlers" before we take off the chains. so literally speaking, i think his intentions were good, but one thing about mind control is that unless it is the product of abuse it doesn't really work that well. it also works better when the subjects view their abusers instead as saviors, and the control is unknown. they program the predictable responses and the subject may feel like this is their free will, but is instead a multiple choice scenario from a list of approved outcomes. the best mind control is secret, and the best defense against being controlled is awareness that there are elements out there that want to subvert your mind, and they take all forms. the ones doing the abusing are the handlers, and honestly i think the lessons learned from mkultra have been used on the unsuspecting public for decades. the media, the governments, the transnational corporations, religion and celebrities are the handlers now. most people can find evil in at least one of these things, but turn against most or all of them, and then you get the "crazy" badge from society.

       Mainstream is insane.  Normal is marginalized.  The "silent majority" is a soundbyte, but there is some truth in the phrase.  In many ways we are manipulated and we also manipulate each other.  Freedom is the answer, but without understanding it may as well be a phrase written on a fortune in a fortune cookie.

       Now, I haven't read this whole thread, there's no reason to, but what I have seen written from you, aside from your initial post, is trite drivel. Even the attempt to stroke

       What is interesting is that you mentioned "tinfoil hat" in a quote of him, and I hadn't read it yet when I wrote a response (in this discussion) which included the phrase "tinfoil beanie".  I was referring to my understanding of conspiracy theories as of 9/11/2001.

       The mere fact that this person comes here to ask for verification, justification, and reaffirmation of what he assumes to be true, despite what some know, and then, regardless of replies to him of his intent or even that verification, he is the very person who is saying things such as:

       What does this say to you in their attempt to come to an understanding about this persons beliefs about certain events? To call a spade a spade and then lean to his ego and say these blokes are blind it's clearly a clover when it's painfully obvious his ego is still getting in the way and this guy is a joker.

       Also, I don't understand why it is interesting I put in a quote of him talking about "tinfoil hats". Elaborate?

       The belief that microwaves/radiowaves from power lines, towers (tv/phone), satellites get into your head and can be used for mind control or other nefarious things. Just as tin foil could be used to enhance a signal on old antenna, it was believed would repel the same signals and keep them out of your brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have ever seen the movie
       <em>
        "Signs"

       by M Night Shamamsdlfkjaghylan, there is enough reference in there.
      </p>

       So, because people like us, back in the day, would talk about how these radio waves were influencing us negatively and would at the same time talk about the governments and even the global cabal, to an extent. The unfortunate thing is that people at large do not make distinctions between different subjects and it all gets jumbled up into one big cluster fuck of a nut show. *( in reality it is all essentially one big show)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a matter of seeing the trees through the forest and the forest through the trees. Being able to do both as best as possible. Many, many trees to see. Fewer and fewer distinguishable forests. (Meaning they are or have grown into each other - one big cabal.)

       Well I guess that's the reason cover-ups are easier than we think... but when faced with a fact we were not meant to discover, it remains a fact, regardless of what others think of us for talking about it. As long as you can back up what you say with facts, it will disturb them enough to maybe make them think a little more.

       You are not crazy, you are an independent thinker. That is a crime in America today. Remember Mao shot anyone who wore glasses believing that glasses were a sign of intelligence. He also killed all the professors in the universities first. More recently in China all the colleges were emptied and professors and students forced to work in the field for the next eight months. There is a global war on intelligence.

       While the military and the CIA were both lobbying for a war in Vietnam, they did this hardly for altruistic reasons like the desire to prevent unemployment. Money spend on the MIC creates less jobs than money spent on other industries.

       Lets get out of any conspiracy theories for a second and see things in a different light...
      </p>
      <p>
       The pursuit of the truth is usually an insane project itself - according to everyone around you. You are questioning the very fabric of the society you live in. You might not like the answers, you might create a more "true" reality by your questing for the ultimate truth... and you might really mess up your society. So yes, it is insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       I rest quite assured that anyone who was thinking the Earth is not flat was considered "insane" at one time, same for the person who first thought that maybe Kings and Queens were not sent from heaven or the guy who first thought about radio transmissions...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who goes out to see if there is a deeper truth usually gets labelled that. And of course you would question yourself, but damn it your thinking on your own and maybe realizing there is a deeper truth than what you can see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, think about this one... Somebody probably said just after the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, "ya, know, I think the Government set that up!" and I am sure he was berated and told he was insane. But it was true, and he was not insane.

       If sanity is gauged in terms of your beliefs in relation to the rest of the general population then by all means you would be viewed as crazy.

       they don't care about the unemployed, but they need the American public to have faith in them to keep getting Romneys &amp; Obamas elected (and, as a result, to keep the rich in power). if they "end the wars," unemployment spikes, and people might start asking questions. keep them employed and hating "foreigners," and they'll keep supporting your "war efforts"

       Let me see if I can set your mind at rest on some of these points you raise:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         There's no doubt that the investigation into 9/11 was white-washed. The question is, why? What was being covered up. My own suspicion is that it was done to protect Israeli and Saudi interests connected with the CIA and the Pentagon. We can't necessarily assume that a whitewash occurred because the highest members of the US government caused 9/11. That doesn't necessarily follow, and to me sounds a little on the nutty side. But I have no doubt at all that Israel knew about the attacks before they happened, and did not inform the proper authorities in the US, because Israel wanted a terrorist strike against the US. I doubt the Israelis ever imagined that the strike would be so massive or so successful. But much of the coverup surrounding 9/11 is covering up the role of Israel.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         JFK assassination? It might have been the work of a single crazed gunman. It might have been two gunmen, and we don't know who the second is. It might have involved LBJ ... that wouldn't surprise me since he was a total son of a bitch. I agree, the government swept the events surrounding the assassination under the carpet much too quickly, but I doubt it was a CIA hit.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Vietnam was more a matter of not knowing what they were getting into at the time. They wanted to fight the war, but at the same time were told they could not finish the war because China might not like it. So the war got prolonged, and many elements discovered that there was big money to be made from prolonging a war. We suffer the consequences of this discovery today, in Afghanistan and Iraq, and  maybe soon to be Iran. But Vietnam was mostly a matter of screwing up, and then taking the illegal profits that came from the screwup.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         9/11 was obviously planned by somebody, and whoever planned it had some skills and resources. My pick, Mossad. I doubt they ever thought the impact of the planes would actually bring down the Twin Towers. They just wanted a major terrorist attack in the US to draw the US into war in the Middle East ... and of course the neo-cons in Washington wanted it and aided them in their purposes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As for the rigged 2000 and 2004 elections, there is always fraud of some sort in any major US election. Did it influence the outcome? Maybe, in the case of 2000. But maybe not.

       First 3 IMO are true.
Last 2 I'm not sure.
There is plenty of proof. I think you are suffering from the need to think that everything is OK and normal. I wish it was, but we've moved beyond all that. They call it a "normalcy bias". It's scary when the nightly news never mentions any of what you think is true. It makes you question yourself. Start with what you can verify. Quit hoping your TV will help you; it never will. Don't worship that box. The truth is everything they deny. If you ever wonder why these people do this or that, the answer is ALWAYS money and power. Start from there. But there's a lot of crap and disinformation out there. Verify what you believe to be true. Some of your friends will never be aware of this stuff and perhaps be blissfully ignorant. Maybe that's good. Some of them will get seriously angry if you try to tell them they been betrayed and everything they know is crap. Go slowly. People are waking up that something is very wrong. Zbignew Brezinksi and the CFR are worried about the global awakening here:

       . Funny a google search on the "Council on Foreign Relations" brings up 10.2 million hits but they are never mentioned on your TV news - never, even though they openly tell the government what to do. They recently announced it's time to invade Iran. Is that a conspiracy?

       Ever since we started smiling in pictures, and became "happiness machines", there has been an unspoken war against the "self." See "Century of the Self" (documentary). IMO this is also why codependency has been ignored by mental health professionals.

       Smiling in pictures is more of a symptom (coupled with technological advancements that allowed smiling in pictures) than a cause, but I agree that people have been unwittingly turned into "happiness machines." Or maybe more accurately, "consumption machines," led to believe that if they can just get a bigger house or a better car, everything will be ok.

       I am interesting in how you are linking in co-dependency though. Care to elaborate? Are you saying that people are so weak today that they are desperately clinging together in co-dependent relationships?

       Listen. I was one block away from 9/11. Witnessed it with my own eyes. But... conspiracy? There are only the FACTS. And the facts with 9/11 don't add up. EVERY theory is a conspiracy theory--even the official story--simply by virtue of it being a sequence of events. EVERY "theory" is a theory until it is proven or disproven.
      </p>
      <p>
       What evidence is there that 9/11 was an experiment? 9/11 was an "event"--who benefitted? Israel and the warmongers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no conspiracies. There is only what happened... and theories that are best supported by the facts.

       Oh, of course not. But it's time to stop calling a "conspiracy theory" anything different than a plan. A conspiracy theory doesn't
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to be malicious, really... people can conspire to hid a birthday party, say, for instance... or conspire / by the fire, like in the song Jingle Bells. All I'm saying is: Something happened. Something caused what happened. People and/or certain forces were behind what happened. There are facts. And there is supposition. Steer away from the supposition, and stick to the facts, and say "Fuck you!" to people that dismiss your inquisitiveness and refusal to blindly and sheepishly accept THEIR version of what happened.

       oklahoma bombing is a big wtf in my book for sure, but i'm not sure what happened there, exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       i know there were more bombs than the national media admitted, and if i recall correctly, the nature of the bombs was more complex than just a bunch of fertilizer in a truck, but the sources of information for oklahoma city are so sparse, it's hard to tell the truth from the BS.

       Just relax.  Remember, you don't know exactly what has happened because covert activity is not published... so just relax and speak about these things in a relaxed way.  Cee Lo Green sings a song called “Crazy” that has some poignant lyrics; “Maybe I’m crazy… but it wasn’t because I didn’t know enough, I just knew too much.”  The point here is that there is a HUGE amount of information in the world, and our minds were not designed to handle that much information.  If you think you’re overloaded, slow down, chill out, relax, and be a bit “dumber…” because, sometimes dumber is actually smarter in the eyes of others.  What matters the most?  Having fluid, positive communication with others, so protect your monolithic psychology, and keep it solid and strong in the eyes of others.  You don’t want to communicate in an unclear, scatter brained, irritated, excessively excited, or crazy way, else people might look at you and think, “What in the world is wrong with that person.”  Note: unless you’re intentionally trying to be funny and those listening are enjoying it (but don’t do it too much).

       You have discovered Occam's Razor (the law of parsimony, economy or succinctness), is a principle that generally recommends that, from among competing hypotheses, selecting the one that makes the fewest new assumptions usually provides the correct one, and that the simplest explanation will be the most plausible until evidence is presented to prove it false.

I'll use that argument next time I plan anything with anyone. I'll just say that we happened to be acting at the same time to the same end, but that any direct connection in the mind of the viewer should be seen as batshit crazy.

       I guess you just mean there is probably no global cabal of people trying to push a single platform (i.e., no one "NWO"). I'd say that the fact that we have a world currency and a capitalist-modeled economic system makes everyone part of the same conspiracy. The rich want more money, and they communicate, at the very least, through trade, etc.

       is malice planned in secret by two or more people. You don't really believe there are no conspiracies, do you?

       Most people around here are anything but critical thinkers.  They want to understand the world but are too lazy to study history and politics so they listen to Alex Jones who tells them they can be just as "smart" as all those readers if they just regurgitate what he says.  This is why youtube is so popular here, no one can explain their position but they know a guy who makes videos with creepy music that really gets it spot on maaaaaaannnnnnnnnnn.

       I grew up with TV.  I've for the most part cut it out of my life as an adult.  But there are plenty of Internet clips of what TV is showing.  I am sometimes around other people who have a TV on at the time.  I can see subliminal messages in TV, magazines, etc.  When TV was in it's infancy, older people supposedly would be against it and say "it rots your brain".  The Internet is better in many ways, but is prone to rigging like how TV was.  Is it a mind control brainwashing box that emits flashes and neurolinguistic programming anchors and colors in a way to shape the viewer?  Every time I find myself around somebody else when a sitcom is playing (this is rare but...), I feel a little angry at even little things like the laugh track telling you that what you are watching is funny and that you should laugh.  Or other techniques like the lighted "Applause" sign that TV audiences have.  Even the constant bombardment of "sex" "sex" "sex" written all over the photos and videos we watch (in a subliminal fashion where it is almost like invisible ink but there).

       Isn't it ironic that people who are critical are often labeled crazy, while people who workship an invisible man in the sky are considered mainstream?
