        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Looking at my mod mail, it really seems like there have been a few issues but nothing big. But now I&#39;m seeing people calling for the head of moderators and people getting banned and mods getting demodded. Being a <strong>conspiracy</strong> subreddit means that people tend to get a little more excited about positions of power, and it&#39;s hard to tell everything that&#39;s going on. Here&#39;s what I know so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>ambiversive changed the CSS. I thought it was okay, but it&#39;s clear most people hate it. I&#39;ve changed it to be a little less extreme. People have accused him of being abusive in response to complaints, but from what I&#39;ve seen, the people complaining have been far worse.</li>
<li>ambiversive has added a bunch of mods. Not anything wrong with this <em>per se</em>, but if the new mods are being abusive, I&#39;d like to find out about it here.</li>
<li>A mod that ambiversive added (9000sins) banned a user &quot;crackiswhackexcept&quot; for being abusive and then demodded. The issue is two fold: I agree with a temporary banning of the user. There is nothing wrong with being a dick on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but posting a link in response to EVERY COMMENT another user posts no matter the thread is harassment. However, I&#39;m confused about the demodding: moderators discussed the ban beforehand and ambiversive didn&#39;t take part in that conversation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any other kind of abuse or misuse of mod power has escaped me. I&#39;m just catching up on mod duties after some time away, and I want to make sure I know everything that&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Please air your grievances about the subreddit here; please try to provide direct links to comments/comment threads where applicable instead of just flinging accusations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I commented on that thread. Long and short of is that he -- by his own admission -- was submitting about 80% of content to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. This floods the new queue, is an abuse of reddit and totally against the rules. Mods cannot delete accounts, but admins can and regularly do, generally to counter spam or to remove abusive users.</p>

<p>To think that RedditHQ or CondeNast or anyone gave a crap about a guy flooding  subreddit with news articles is utterly ridiculous -- even for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>That user started a new account, stopped spamming, and is still active today.</p>

<p>I was responding to the idea that -- as ImJulianAssange himself claims -- that the content of his submissions was somehow repugnant to Conde Nast or other such corporate entities.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between &quot;key contributor&quot; and &quot;<em>only</em> contributor.&quot; When someone&#39;s submissions make up 80% of the new queue, of COURSE he&#39;s going to get a lot of karma. That&#39;s because it&#39;s the only thing anyone can vote on! It monopolizes the &quot;new&quot; queue and prevents stories from less active users from being seen.</p>

<p>And as for perma-banning someone, what steps were taken before that? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you or any of the mods talk to him about what was considered acceptable? Did you receive any complaints that he was spamming the queue?</p>

<p>I told him he should stop submitting so much. And yes, we did: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hc80d/iamjulianassange_submitting_90_of_links/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hc80d/iamjulianassange_submitting_90_of_links/</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is difficult because there are a lot of sites that get posted here constantly. If you suspect that a user is submitting their <em>own</em> site, or if a site is stealing content, please report it and send a message to the moderators. However, we really can&#39;t do much otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact is if you spend all day doing nothing but making submissions, you can easily flood the new queue and become 80% of a subreddit&#39;s content in all but the largest subreddits. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s spam or not; from reddiquette:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please don&#39;t:</p>

<p>Flood reddit with a lot of stories in a short span of time. By doing this you monopolize a shared resource — the &quot;new&quot; queue. Be warned, your future submissions may be automatically blocked by the spam filter. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically it drowns out anyone who can&#39;t sit there and submit links all day.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what the precise reason he was banned was. But I suspect it was him flooding the subreddit, and I am defending that decision by the admins.</p>

<p>You have your facts wrong. The admins banned him, not anyone I appointed. ambiversive has nothing to do with IAmJulianAssange. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what? I had a strong impression that the site was actually racist and anti-semitic (I am vehemently anti-zionist, but constantly eying that line between &quot;I don&#39;t like this Israeli government policy&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s the jews keeping us [poor white christians] down.&quot;). I see links to anti-Israel articles posted here <em>constantly</em>, and I also see a lot of anti-zionism bend toward &quot;white pride&quot; here, too. Even the name &quot;mondoweiss&quot; makes me uncomfortable, considering how it might be translated.</p>

<p>But, your comment spurred me to do a search through the archives and look at what&#39;s been posted here. In short, I take it back; I was wrong. All the headlines sound spot-on to me, and <a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2011/12/israel-isnt-good-for-the-jews-anymore.html">this article</a> in particular does a good job of convincing me that I completely misjudged this one.</p>

<p>OP is most likely Julian himself or a white rights friend and they plan to muster support for Julian which musters support for their agenda.</p>

<p>He was never banned in the last three weeks, he writes the thread in a way to gain sympathy for him and make it look like a hidden power is attacking him in the present time frame so check the proof yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend not to get involved in larger subreddits unless the community needs it. There have been a lot of messages about moderators recently, so I&#39;ve decided to take action.

I basically pulled stuff out of the spam filter and let you guys duke it out.</p>

<p>Moderation outside of spam in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a minefield anyway, because no matter what you do, you&#39;re going to be called some kind of shill for whatever side you&#39;re perceived to be on.</p>

<li>I added ambiversive; this is why I&#39;m concerned about his actions. They were added because they were an active user in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with good karma that was interested in moderation, and I needed someone more involved in the community.</li>
<li>It was a long time ago, so I don&#39;t remember exactly why chromakode was removed. I did not demod that user. However, I seem to recall there being drama and good reason for their departure. They&#39;re an admin, so I&#39;m guessing they left of their own accord.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>On the matter of commentrs being far more abusive than ambiversive himself I have to disagree. If you look at the order in which comments were posted you&#39;ll notice that most, including my own were reasonable at first. The anger was an outcome of ambiversive&#39;s resistance to any and all suggestions and requests regarding the new look. His responses at first seemed to indicate that he was willing to compromise, however, he would not commit to any request and when pushed to act on his promises he became abusive and non-responsive. Each time acting as a victim and trying to garner sympathy when anger boiled over. He was incapable of amerliorating tension and smoothing out bad relations. In a matter of 2 weeks since the conflicts first began they escalated to such a degree that r/conspiracy became r/soapopera. I think if you want someone who will actively take care of this subreddit you should select someone who is inclined to care about servicing the members and is capable of extracting themselves from drama and patching issues, rather than creating them and then stirring them until they boil over, and then hiding in a corner and removing negative posts before they surface and gain attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to say I am somewhat disappointed with your response. It is clear that you have nothing to be upset over since your don&#39;t hold any grievances and did not experience any wrongdoing, nor would you in such a case being that you are the head mod, who seldom makes his appearance here. I am going to give it a last attempt before I give up at this because I truly feel that the issue of wrongdoing has not been adequately addressed. If you were to imagine the type of conduct displayed by ambiversive in any real life situation where you have an authority figure and a subordinate person/group that depends on the authority and that figure acts in such a manner it would be perceived as offensive. A person with power over another must hold himself to a higher standard. I am not sure what you referred to as irrevelant here but if you are saying all of the users who have been offended are irrelevant then you just did what ambiverse did. As a top mod in this subreddit I would have liked to see more of an effort to appease and smooth over some of the angst that has built up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s exceptions for other subreddits, such as moderated subreddits, and the number of submissions that is too many depends on the subreddit.

    <div class="md"><p>thank you for addressing this issue. i have been faithful to this sub for a long time, and i wasn&#39;t trying to be abusive in my power as a mod. on the contrary i was removing a user from the sub who was being abusive to our users on a regular basis. i tried to warn him first about spamming and harassment, and he responded by telling me to die in a fire. repeatedly. after about 4 or 5 messages with this back and forth, i temporarily banned him to prevent him from spamming even more until it could be discussed with any and or all of the the mods. i discussed it with one of the other mods and he and i agreed that it was best to just ban the guy. i waited to see what ambiversive would say, but instead of a message i found that my mod privlages were gone and the user was unbanned, and spamming again. i sent him a few messages with no response asking why i had been demodded. i finally got him to respond once and he said he was looking for mods to be a little more &quot;hands-off&quot;, meaning no moderation unless he was doing it. i feel it wasn&#39;t really fair for my privileges to be taken away, but seeing as how he was the one who gave me mod privileges to begin with, i really should have asked you or donbueno for the honor instead of asking him. when it comes to the style of the sub i have to agree it looks bad. most of the users here hate it and want it returned to how it was before. thanks for addressing us about this, we needed a real mod to know what was going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the banning of crackiswhack was justified and 9000 did the right thing.  I observed crack&#39;s constant stalking of a mod of one subreddit, with one specific comment and link repeated over and over. Also, I personally received a number of crazy and abusive messages from whack. The mod who dealt with him was handling a genuine issue, not a personal or made-up one.  But Ambi&#39;s position against 9000 was I felt bordering a bit on personal and not professional.</p>

<p>In all, I would just like there to be a balance between free speech and prevention of abusive stalking.</p>

<p>I would also like the mods to seriously think about what to do about the puppet gangs which have been brought over here by the Digg bury brigade guys. They were banned from Digg years ago then flooded over here and colonized politics here.  Now that they have an effective synchronized mechanism here, probably 95% of the anti-Paul political spam we get has come from this puppet gang, the same names over and over. They even boast of their synchronization and gaming of Reddit, but fortunately Reddit&#39;s engine does not allow the same kind of burying of opponents.</p>

<p>However, there has been abuse of banning. Some weeks ago a small number of us received a flood of ban notices for subReddits we had never even heard of nor visited. They all came from the same guy (under his name and a puppet name given mod status by him for one of his subReddits.) Such activity borders on harassment by a mod and should not be allowed.  What 9000 did was fair, but in other cases mods are abusing users with no justification for their actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The leadership of a community sets the tone for the environment.  When you have mods arguing with each other in threads, trolling other users, being argumentative pricks to users who are validly expressing dislike with style changes and leadership styles and practices, and when you have mods being made and unmade with no communication you are going to be setting the tone in this subreddit as one of disrespect, disloyalty, and disdain.  I used to find this to be an interesting place to come, to read, and to discuss.  I noticed immediately not only the changes in the visual layout of the page, but the tone as well.  </p>

<p>This has very very acutely become a place of displeasure not only for myself but for many thousands of others as evidenced by numerous posts (some deleted by the mods in question) and the immense amount of negative feedback by users in threads.  </p>

<p>Having been a moderator and admin of several large communities myself I expect a mod to be polite, courteous, kind, and respectful of the community.  I expect them to have a passion for the topic of said community, and I expect them to be good with people as that is the main part of the job.  If they want to troll and be dicks that&#39;s fine, but dont do it under the mantle of a mod position, dont do it wearing your tag or even under your mod account.  Use an alt and preserve your dignity as a moderator.  That being said I can tell you that ambiversive and llllllllll_ have done nothing in my eyes that tells me they are mature enough to handle a position of authority.  </p>

<p>I have seen several times where they are snarky and rude to users, argue with each other in threads the way 14 year old WOW players are known to do, and simply troll looking for a reaction.  That alone has not put me off this sub in and of itself, however the tone that it fosters has completely ruined this place for me and I find myself spending less and less time here, and the time I do spend it often interrupted and ruined when I read their comments and think &quot;how the fuck can these people actually be mods?&quot; I very rarely post here or engage here and I can tell you that now it will become an even rarer occasion when I even bother to read the comments.  I shouldn&#39;t have to blacklist a mod in a community I enjoy and love.  This wouldnt be a big deal except for the fact that it is exactly this type of behavior and reaction that kills a community.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disclaimer: I was modded a couple of days ago. I didn&#39;t ask for it, but I&#39;m certainly not pissed about it either. </p>

<p>This whole situation has gotten way out of control. I miss the Nazi Skinhead vs Zionist Shill days, don&#39;t you? Are we <em>really</em> going to let an overzelaous mod make this sub come to a screeching halt? </p>

<p>When a government (mod squad) has become dangerous to the people (halting discussion in this case), the government must be removed. Isn&#39;t that the point of r/conspiracy, to teach and attempt to empower others in the struggle against oppressive rule? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to say ambiversive is an evil dictator, but the current situation is not working. Even if ambiversive only has the best intentions in mind, it just isn&#39;t working. </p>

<p>There are more important things to worry about than the new layout. Just put it back how it was, and unmod ambiversive. Unmod me too if you want, do a clean sweep. </p>

<p>Sorry if my spelling is bad, on the phone.</p>

<p>Tldr: What we had before was working. This is retarded and more than a little sad.</p>

<p>Edit - crackiswhackexcept did need to go, 9000sins was right there. You are allowed to have an opinion, but threatening &amp; stalking is something different.</p>

Can we have a rule that all the chicks must have a profile pic and an instant messenger thingy would be cool to so i can message them.

    <div class="md"><p>I somehow feel that 9000sins could have been viewed as having a &#39;conflict of interest&#39; in that they seem to have some anti-zionist/anti-semetic sentiment and went ahead and banned the user crackiswhackexcept for pointing out mumblingbumbling&#39;s interest in whitepride.  mumblingbumbling is I guess to his views but so is crackiswhackexpcept presumably and so the banning of him could be seen as a serious incident and I feel that considering ambiversives high profile and activity should have been included in the decision.</p>

<p>Therefore he was reasonably justified with the demod.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;d say a mod vote on unbanning crackiswhackexpect and remodding 9000ins would be in order.</p>

<p>As you point out banning is serious business and so ambiversives response could be seen as overreaction but also perhaps understandable even if ill advised.</p>

<p>It seems ambiversive has good intentions and has been trying hard , but of course the road to hell is paved with good intentions.</p>

<p>As you point out you should stay neutral and so banning users for pointing out their pet peeve may not be so neutral.  Just  a thought, not trying to be an arse here but it seems ambiversive is getting a bit of  flack, he may well not be so diplomatic but he is a long time redditor and is trying hard.  I am sure this can all be worked out with the attitude less is more.</p>
