        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not the conspiracy type but I thought this was really interesting. This happened like 10 minutes ago. She was being interviewed on Fox by Greta Vann Susteran about the state of the Union address.The interviewer asked what if anything did Bachmann agree with from the presidents speech and this is roughly what she said:</p>

<p>&#39;blablabla he gave thanks to the troops blablabla.... and also he praised Seal Team Six for their <strong>capture</strong> of Osama Bin Laden&#39;</p>

<p>This immediately caught my attention. Was this a slip of the tongue or did she give away some classified information? White House has consistently changed the story of Osama Bin Ladens targeting. Last I checked though he was killed in the cross fire. Bachmann thanks Seal Team 6 for his capture though.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Bachmann#Committee_assignments">Bachmann</a> is on the House Permanent Select Committee on intelligence and she is the Overseer of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the rest of the U.S. intelligence community.</p>

<p>“Carbon dioxide is natural, it is not harmful, it is a part of Earth&#39;s lifecycle.

<p>The team met heavy resistance. They met no resistance. He was armed. He was unarmed. They watched the attack live. There was a 40 minute delay and they did not watch it live. ....

<p>It happened last year. There are articles with more details, but that was just the first one I found. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t the rest of the team, but it was over twenty seals that served on the same seal team that supposedly killed Bin Laden. So I was wrong to say &quot;..the rest of the seal team...&quot; </p>
