You&#39;re just coming back with some nonsense deflection yet again, most likely because you&#39;re just a child and an idiot.

Stop fucking around with the colors and the appearance and shit will be just fine. It was just fine before. Gray background, red links, normal quote box, none of this gigantic mismatched Arial font bullshit on the sidebar, none of these fucking hover colors, seriously, is this 1996? Did you just discover CSS? None of these round boxes, none of these dumb ass icons, this isn&#39;t a fucking Iphone, this isn&#39;t Gmail 3.0, it&#39;s just a board that worked perfectly fine before which I used to enjoy visiting, but which now feels unfamiliar and unpleasant when I look at it and dissuades me from participating. Stop fucking around! Change it back! That is unless you LOST the old CSS...</p>

<p>and just fyi I&#39;m not necessarily change resistant, I think these design elements could certainly look nice some of the time. You just don&#39;t know what to do with them, because you aren&#39;t a designer. And that isn&#39;t going to change, no matter how you do the colors and the CSS. Stop trying to design the sub.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been pondering how you could improve the design and haven&#39;t come up with anything. I&#39;ve also been trying to like it since I know you are trying to improve the subreddit. One thing that has improved is I am seeing a lot more participation and commenting around here, it looked really dead for a while. All this compaining about how ugly this subreddit looks seems to be bringing some group cohesion. Maybe it will actually lead to some useful suggestions. I&#39;m still sticking with making readibility the priority. I used the new youtube color scheme as an example of readiability. I think it is a good one, although it is on the darker side and it seems like you are trying to go with a lighter color scheme. I think the old grey and maroon test was quite harmonious. I&#39;d like to seea color scheme that aims to be tranquil and easy on the nerves, something that facilitates a calm state of mind  while perusing the alarming material, and has an air of seriousness to it..</p>

<p>edit: sorry for all the spelling errors I am trying out a new skin and while it makes everything somewhat more readble for me, I can&#39;t make out my own posts or comments very well... It&#39;s a trade offI&#39;ve had to make...</p>

<p>edut: sorry for bad spelling and writing I am using a new skin that makes things a bit more readable excepti for anything writting in these boxes, in which case its dark blue on black. Cant see what i&#39;m typing at all... That&#39;s the trade of i&#39;ve had to make these days...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I recall correctly you said you were the one making the changes. I do not understand why you were the one making the post and comments if you are not a moderator. Who are you? What is your authority? </p>

<p>In this sentence you have just perfectly answered your own question. That is the VERY reason why your changes are not well recieved. If it doesn&#39;t matter to you then that is <em>precisely</em> why you should not be changing <em>anything!</em> Very simple! If appearance is not important to you and you cannot see how a bad layout and nauseating color scheme can be an obstacle to enjoying content then, simply, do not change <em>anything</em>. Changing appearance successfully requires one to first care about making something visually pleasing have a well developed aesthetic sense along with experience with design.</p>

<p>I would prefer honesty. This was done for no reason on a day when everyone was enjoying a holiday and they were not going to bother with this, just as I had said. People are commenting now and voicing their dislike, the honorable thing to do would be to change it back. All of ambiverses comments are below threshold. Your comment has been downvoted as wel. It should be obvious that the appropriate thing to do in this case is to accomodate the unhappy subscribers who make this reddit what it is. </p>

<p>If you still do not understand why this is a problem please review all of the comments and continue to review them until you do understand. </p>

<p>I would have stuck with the previous one but it did bother me, which is why I suggested a change. I think it is important but not enough to stop reading.</p>

<p>But while I don&#39;t think the colors in the banner and background match very well, I do think the color of the background is still very nice, and easy on the eyes as well. I prefer it to the grey and am also very glad that there is less red here now.</p>

So it bothered you and now you are happy, but everyone else is <em>unhappy</em>. You are just one person, do you think your opinion supercedes <strong>EVERYONE</strong> elses? And I still don&#39;t quite understand your relationship with ambiversive; are you saying your dislike of the prior design was the sole reason it was changed? Why did he ask you to make the suggestions instead of making them himself. He wasn&#39;t even commenting in the original thread. He obviously used you to make it appear like he had some meaningful backing, but you are obviously friends or something.</p>

<p>And I didn&#39;t say or imply my opinion was more important than everyone else&#39;s, I was just voicing my opinion. The language in my post was trying to be inclusive as possible. And not everyone is unhappy, this thread has about half as many downvotes as upvotes, which is still significantly outnumbered but in my opinions suggested more changes are needed not just reverting back to the old one. I think a constructive conversation on this topic could still be fruitful.</p>

<p>A few people agreed with me and that is why he changed it. It happened faster than I anticipated and I was expecting a longer discussion to take place before changes would be made.</p>
