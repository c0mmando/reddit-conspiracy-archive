       Yes, this sub has become super fugly. The whole highlighting the edges was entertaining for about 2 seconds, and now this garbage blue is barfable. Want to make it really cool? Go back to the highlighting edge thing, but make the edges fade to total back when you don't hover over them.

       I have to agree. The blue+gray background and the over-use of border radius everywhere, not to mention highlighting, overall colors and the textarea box = not good.

       The blue background is the #1 issue for me, makes my head dizzy after a minute or two. #E6E6FA = Just no for content backgorund. Change back to #fff for now please.

       NO. People can't focus on the content because their perception is overloaded with your grotesque manipulation of this subreddits appearance. You are contradicting yourself because you tried to
       <strong>
        improve
       </strong>
       the subreddit in your own words, now no one likesit and you are in denail. Stop protecting your ego and return the design to how it was. This subreddit was praised for its design on multippole occasions in the past. No one is praising it now,!!!!!!!!!!!

       All I'm saying is that you've fucked up the subreddit and pissed its users off, which is inappropriate, and you writing people off for bringing it up and responding with patronizing remarks like our issues are insignificant is inappropriate too. I haven't said anything unreasonable and it's not that complicated. You're just coming back with some nonsense deflection yet again, most likely because you're just a child and an idiot. How about until you make reparations after deciding to single-handedly mess with a subreddit WE ALL USE, until you make reparations after fucking with our COMMUNITY PROPERTY with NOBODY's permission, STOP sticking up for yourself. You have NO leg to stand on.

       I have to agree with what seems to be the general consensus, the new style isnt just ugly, its hard on the eyes and the highlighting gets annoying after your second visit.
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice: Just change it back the way it was

       maybe follow this advice: stop fucking around with everything as though your taste is good, because it isn't good. That IS constructive. Stop fucking around with the colors and the appearance and shit will be just fine. It was just fine before. Gray background, red links, normal quote box, none of this gigantic mismatched Arial font bullshit on the sidebar, none of these fucking hover colors, seriously, is this 1996? Did you just discover CSS? None of these round boxes, none of these dumb ass icons, this isn't a fucking Iphone, this isn't Gmail 3.0, it's just a board that worked perfectly fine before which I used to enjoy visiting, but which now feels unfamiliar and unpleasant when I look at it and dissuades me from participating. Stop fucking around! Change it back! That is unless you LOST the old CSS...
      </p>
      <p>
       and just fyi I'm not necessarily change resistant, I think these design elements could certainly look nice some of the time. You just don't know what to do with them, because you aren't a designer. And that isn't going to change, no matter how you do the colors and the CSS. Stop trying to design the sub. PLEASE! It just makes things look broken.

       There's nothing harmful about a little experimentation. If the style is evolving based on user feedback, I see no reason to go generic. Nobody here is afraid of change, I hope.

       Has anything been productive with you. People have been telling you from day one that it sucks. It's only gotten worse. Have you noticed you haven't been getting anymore popular around here? It's for a reason. Why don't you do the noble thing and admit tdefeat, your changes have been for the worse. I just want to focus on the damn  contect I dont want to waste energy on this bullshit. If you don't resugn or change things back people will leave. This may finally be the impetus that gets people to move elsewhere.

       Nobody asked me to design the subreddit, except you. But since you asked ... go to a conservative grey on grey, that does not hit you in the eyes. Use primarily black text. Be subtle. What is with the huge rounded corners on the boxes. If you must have rounded corners, just round off the tips, not half the freakin' box.

       But I'm only good at criticizing stuff. In this case I agree with both of you.  I would say that something is wrong with the look, but I don't know anything about design.   On a positive it's a great layout for being low key, with no backgrounds.  I hate the backgrounds on other subreddits.  And it's not black.  I can't read black sites, because I'm afraid of getting a headache.

       Black backgrounds are the bane of the Internet. Kiddies think they look kool. But you know that if you read them for ten minutes, then go back to a normal site with a white background, it rips your eyes out of your sockets. In Web design, less is better.

       I've been pondering how you could improve the design and haven't come up with anything. I've also been trying to like it since I know you are trying to improve the subreddit. One thing that has improved is I am seeing a lot more participation and commenting around here, it looked really dead for a while. All this compaining about how ugly this subreddit looks seems to be bringing some group cohesion. Maybe it will actually lead to some useful suggestions. I'm still sticking with making readibility the priority. I used the new youtube color scheme as an example of readiability. I think it is a good one, although it is on the darker side and it seems like you are trying to go with a lighter color scheme. I think the old grey and maroon test was quite harmonious. I'd like to seea color scheme that aims to be tranquil and easy on the nerves, something that facilitates a calm state of mind  while perusing the alarming material, and has an air of seriousness to it..
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: sorry for all the spelling errors I am trying out a new skin and while it makes everything somewhat more readble for me, I can't make out my own posts or comments very well... It's a trade offI've had to make...
      </p>
      <p>
       edut: sorry for bad spelling and writing I am using a new skin that makes things a bit more readable excepti for anything writting in these boxes, in which case its dark blue on black. Cant see what i'm typing at all... That's the trade of i've had to make these days...

       Didn't you play a part in implementing these changes, providing a wall of text as your rationale? You are not an objective subscriber. If you are moderating this place, your highest goal should be to survey and uphold the community's wishes.Instead you made changes on christmas day when nothere was hardly any participation and ignored all dissent. You are doing a great disservice to the subscribers here, this is not your personal myspace page. I am unsubscribing  from this subreddit until it is returned to its previous appearance.

       I just made suggestions and added my opinion. I'm not a moderator.

       But seriously I don't understand how someone could care so much about the appearance when it is the content is important.

      <p>
       As for "wall of text", would you prefer less rational, something along the lines of "DO WHAT I SAY NOW ASSHOLES WAKE UP SHEEPLE"? I wanted a discussion about it but changes were made before that happened and very few people said anything.

       If I recall correctly you said you were the one making the changes. I do not understand why you were the one making the post and comments if you are not a moderator. Who are you? What is your authority?
      </p>
      <p>
       In this sentence you have just perfectly answered your own question. That is the VERY reason why your changes are not well recieved. If it doesn't matter to you then that is
       <em>
        precisely
       </em>
       why you should not be changing
       <em>
        anything!
       </em>
       Very simple! If appearance is not important to you and you cannot see how a bad layout and nauseating color scheme can be an obstacle to enjoying content then, simply, do not change
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       . Changing appearance successfully requires one to first care about making something visually pleasing have a well developed aesthetic sense along with experience with design.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would prefer honesty. This was done for no reason on a day when everyone was enjoying a holiday and they were not going to bother with this, just as I had said. People are commenting now and voicing their dislike, the honorable thing to do would be to change it back. All of ambiverses comments are below threshold. Your comment has been downvoted as wel. It should be obvious that the appropriate thing to do in this case is to accomodate the unhappy subscribers who make this reddit what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you still do not understand why this is a problem please review all of the comments and continue to review them until you do understand.

       You don't recall correctly, I was making suggestions because Ambiversive suggested I make a place for discussion. I did and provided rational for why to do it, I was expecting more discussion to take place before changes were made.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would have stuck with the previous one but it did bother me, which is why I suggested a change. I think it is important but not enough to stop reading.
      </p>
      <p>
       But while I don't think the colors in the banner and background match very well, I do think the color of the background is still very nice, and easy on the eyes as well. I prefer it to the grey and am also very glad that there is less red here now.

       I commented and never received a response from you in the original thread. I said there wouldn't be much response during the holiday and now that people are no longer preoccupied with the holidays they are complaining just as I said they would. So it bothered you and now you are happy, but everyone else is
       <em>
        unhappy
       </em>
       . You are just one person, do you think your opinion supercedes
       <strong>
        EVERYONE
       </strong>
       elses? And I still don't quite understand your relationship with ambiversive; are you saying your dislike of the prior design was the sole reason it was changed? Why did he ask you to make the suggestions instead of making them himself. He wasn't even commenting in the original thread. He obviously used you to make it appear like he had some meaningful backing, but you are obviously friends or something.

       I'm an illuminatus here to sow discord and destroy this subreddit.

       But seriously, he made a post talking about suggestions, I made a non-sequitur suggestion about an alternate color scheme, and he suggested I make a post about it. I did.

       And I didn't say or imply my opinion was more important than everyone else's, I was just voicing my opinion. The language in my post was trying to be inclusive as possible. And not everyone is unhappy, this thread has about half as many downvotes as upvotes, which is still significantly outnumbered but in my opinions suggested more changes are needed not just reverting back to the old one. I think a constructive conversation on this topic could still be fruitful.

       A few people agreed with me and that is why he changed it. It happened faster than I anticipated and I was expecting a longer discussion to take place before changes would be made.

       of Ambiverse's comments are below threshold there is enough indication here for you to grasp without having to have further discussion.
