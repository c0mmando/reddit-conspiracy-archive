<p>Those are two specific examples, but it&#39;s to say I&#39;ve met Jews on both sides of this issue. It&#39;s not all Jews, it&#39;s specifically the fundamentalist (a.k.a zionists).

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason CNN interviewed the guy at all because he looked like the psycopath from Mt Rainier, even down to the tatoos on his neck.  Notice how the interviewer cleverly implied that soldiers &quot;like him&quot; coming back were dangerous? The casual viewer would assume she meant Ron Paul&#39;s policy of bringing back the troops would be dangerous in the &quot;not protecting us from terrorists&quot; sense, but there&#39;s that double-speak present saying that the veterans themselves will be dangerous. Watch out for this, they will be pushing this more and more as the vets start coming home. Protecting us from dangerous, extremist vets (who they will start calling domestic terrorists) will be the way in which they usher in the police state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every thought, word, voice, person you encounter is going to be a force acting on you and trying to push or pull you.  You can go along or resist but either way it&#39;s acting upon you.</p>

<p>Everything is manipulation and you and I are forces of nature, pushing and being pushed.  </p>

<p>My only question was &quot;is this newscaster <em>conscious</em> of her application of verbal force?&quot; or did it just come out that way.  Was there an intent in the video clip?  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that linguistic sorcery happens constantly and that many people actively engage in this.  But I was just wondering if we should label this particular case as such a situation?</p>

<p>But I do like the direction this conversation is heading because it&#39;s getting into the mechanics behind this tactic in speech that so easily can be used to move forces or to hide behind the clause of &quot;oh you heard it wrong&quot;.</p>

<p>Then we get into the whole self-projection vs how something &quot;really&quot; happened.</p>

<p>Off topic I know, but important none the less.</p>
