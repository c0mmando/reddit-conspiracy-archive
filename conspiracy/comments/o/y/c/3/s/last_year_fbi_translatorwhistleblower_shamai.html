    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with any of your statement whatsoever. Quit trying to frame what I said as something different and spread lies about the nature of the conflict. The Palestinians are the ones fighting for their existence as they are the ones enduring a brutal occupation in the West Bank and blockade around Gaza. But yes, not all Jews are Zionists, and not all Zionists are Jews. Zionism is a political ideology not a religion. I&#39;ll keep talking about it until the US government gets on the right side of history and stops sending our tax dollars/weapons to support war crimes and military occupation against Palestinians and Israel&#39;s neighbors. Time to cut the cord or at the very least put conditions on our overly-generous aid to the Jewish State. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume that the wiretaps were on calls out to news media personnel. For everything critically covert they use encrypted phones or they communicate with their teams around the US through means outside the embassy. If they do their tradecraft properly that means pay as you go cellphones so that the numbers are not easily trackable. And the phones are thrown away regularly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not talking about tracing the purchase location. I am saying that cell phones are designed to stay in constant contact with their network. The network has a good idea where each phone is based upon triangulation. iphones location service relies on this. </p>

<p>It is trivial to search location database and compare it to other phones. If you carry two phones, they will be able to see who you are. If you only carry one phone, they will still see associations with other phone&#39;s locations. </p>

<p>I guess you could keep your second phone in some sort of shielded box to foil this. And only take it out after you have changed locations from where you cut contact with your drop phone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I conclude you&#39;re trolling me.  You are clearly and deliberately ignoring what I said and twisting off onto your own path.</p>

<p>If an agent makes a call to another agent on a prepaid and disposable phone, the FBI would not know this is going on at that time nor be able to trace the caller later.</p>

<p>If a random stranger buys a prepaid phone and calls you, Moarbrains, and tells you to fuck off, then throws the phone away. neither you nor the FBI would know who did it nor trace the call back to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet the cell carrier will still have records of where the call was placed from and records of where the phone has been. Take that list and run and compare it to other local phone location lists. If you see correlations, then you have a connection.</p>

<p>If you go buy a phone and you are not carrying another and don&#39;t travel with anyone who does thenyou should be fine. But if the location data show the phone repeatedly spending time in your home, you anomnity is now blown.</p>

<p>This is pretty trivial to program if you have access to the data and the carriers openly admit to keeping records of the data. So the only question seems to be whether the gov has access to this. </p>

<p>The fact that the NSA has fiber optic taps onthe Internet backbones leads me to believe they have any data they feel is useful.</p>

<p>I apologize for the sloppiness of the post. Editing on a phone is a pita.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not angry, but you&#39;re clearly either trolling or very stupid.  NO agent would be so dumb as to carry a powered prepaid phone used for covert operations into his home, it violates tradecraft.  The phone is not kept on and trackable.  it is used for prearranged time contacts.  It&#39;s not like two teenagers on the phone all day every day. As I said, if the FBI does not know an agent needs to be tracked, they will not track them and certainly will not have their phone number. If they belatedly discover  after many months that someone is a spy, they still don&#39;t have data for the phone because they haven&#39;t been tracing a prepaid they didn&#39;t know existed previously. Phones can be traced, but if you don&#39;t know someone is a spy, you won&#39;t have their phone number to trace. Which is what I&#39;ve said over and over, so you are certainly a troll. Piss off.</p>
