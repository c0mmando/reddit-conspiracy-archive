       Only vaguely related but the USS Liberty helped me to realise what a load of revisionist BS historical articles on Wikipedia are.
      </p>
      <p>
       About five years ago there was a long, long running argument (not as long, bizarrely, as the argument on the page about Hot Dogs - I shit thee not) on the revisions page as a Wiki moderator with a certain point of view kept redacting changes made to the page by a contributor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually said contributor revealed - with relevant proofs - that he was a former naval officer and was
       <em>
        on board the USS Liberty at the time the much discussed "incident" occurred
       </em>
       and therefore in a better position to explain what happened than, for example, a teenage basement warrior who had never worn a uniform (high school marching band doesn't count) in his life and had certainly never been on the USS Liberty ever at any point.
      </p>
      <p>
       This persons changes still aren't on the page - they were removed by a 19 year old "history" graduate who apparently knew more about the incident than someone who was on the fucking boat at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       On that basis I decided that most of the info on Wiki was total bullshit.  It's only the truth if the right people say it is.

       This Zionist bias at Wikipedia is a well known fact.  You simply won't get the truth at Wikipedia if it's an issue which has anything to do with Zionism or Israel or Palestine or any issue remotely related to it at all.

       Wiki is controlled by Zionists. They write history to suit the Zionist agenda. If we don't understand that, we understand nothing about how Wiki, or indeed the entire media and publishing industry in America, works.

       Wikipedia is not intended to be a primary source, so if you can't find a source for what you want to write you can't include it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that Wiki doesn't include your truth because your truth is not able to be entirely objective?

       That's really assuming that objective and subjective are entirely opposite, which critical thinking teaches is a misleading position to take because it imposes a viewpoint that may not be accurate.  I lean more towards the John Searle school of thought which is that as you experience everything subjectively (no other way to do it - you can only think with your brain, no one elses) then even objectivity is itself a conscious function of subjectivity.  So no ones truth is entirely objective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you might have read some sort of anti-Zionist agenda in my comment, which I don't really have (subjectivity creeping in on your part perhaps, or on mine in coming to that conclusion).  It wasn't my intention to make any particular statement about the USS Liberty incident, I was just mentioning that it was the negation of witness testimony on that article in particular that made me realise Wikipedia was a worthless source of historical reference as it only uses, to paraphrase, that particular version of history which is written by the victorious.

       Thanks, I am familiar with the concept.  Anyone with sufficient funding is paying people to manipulate the internet in their favour, in fact there will be people paying people to highlight the fact that Israel engages in this sort ofbehaviour (that video and all the research behind it didn't "just happen").
      </p>
      <p>
       In many ways all this focus on Israel and Zionism is like misdirection in a magic trick.  Without Israel to draw everyone's attention and ire all the other people who pull strings globally would be really fucked, they'd have nothing left to hide behind.
