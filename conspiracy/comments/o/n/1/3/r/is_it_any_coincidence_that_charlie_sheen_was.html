       He literally had the #1 show in the nation with 10 million viewers regularly. There was a clear chance for him to change the opinion of a huge group of people. He seems totally clear headed and straight as an arrow in everything before he came out against the government.

       No, it's because he called Chuck Lorre by his Jewish name "Chaim Levine"

       They couldn't care less if you talk about 9/11 unless you talk about Israel. Case in point: Loose Change. That and every other major 9/11 documentary is Kosher, hence the popularity.

       Now find ones that tell the truth about the so called dancing Israelis, the Israeli company working every single security checkpoint that the 'hijackers' went through.

       Call out a single Jew and you're an anti-Semite and will be shunned. Look at why the real rappers got pushed out of the industry:

       Never saw this video before. I don't know how credible he is but he basically 100% calls out the government weeks before 9/11. He's right though, America is infested with zombies that spend more time watching CNN than connecting the dots on their own. Very sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       His ideas on UFOs and aliens kinda puts me off a bit though. What are your opinions of him?

       Cooper was fed all kinds of misinformation; as you said, he knew this. Those perpetrating crimes on humanity to push certain agendas (e.g. the Holocaust) must put out a loooot of bullshit to keep the heat of themselves. A Rockefeller funding the Disclosure Project isn't to assuring either

       William Cooper had the kind of credibility Alex Jones would love to have. Alex and William have even talked back and forth back in the day and developed a bitter rivalry.
       <a href="http://wideeyecinema.com/?p=3153">
        Here
       </a>
       is William's show discussing Alex's fear mongering. Funny thing about Cooper was he was shot and killed by sheriffs at his own home while Alex Jones went on to star in a minor role in a Hollywood picture and landed himself the largest alternative media show in the world.

       Chuck Lorre wrote this in Feb 2011
      </p>
      <p>
       "Which raises the question, why have I spent a lifetime moving away from that group? How did Chaim become Chuck? How did Levine become Lorre? The only answer I come up with is this: When I was a little boy in Hebrew school the rabbis regularly told us that we were the chosen people. That we were God's favorites. Which is all well and good except that I went home, observed my family and, despite my tender age, thought to myself, "bull$#*!."

        The world watched in awe -- the drugs have finally gotten to him! Sheen has lost his mind! The only thing missing from Sheen's rant was some Mel Gibson-style antisemitism. Then he came back with some Mel Gibson-style antisemitism.

      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        In his interviews, Sheen only called Lorre "Chaim Levine." Lorre was born Charles Levine; a Hebrew version would be Chaim. The comment struck executives at both CBS and Warner Brothers as anti-Semitic, according to Media Decoder.

       I  realized what kind of reaction my comments would elicit from those who have been well conditioned by media propaganda. Indeed, the reaction is as predictable as hitting a knee with a little hammer and watching the leg jerk. That doesn't mean the reaction makes any sense, or has any validity, and I don't waste any time worrying about it. I write what I believe to be true, and one of the things I believe to be true is that Jews rule Hollywood with an iron fist. Anyone who criticizes them, or says anything they don't like, is destroyed.

       I doubt if Charlie Sheen meant any real malice by his strung-out comment. He was just lashing out in anger, and groping for whatever barb he could find that would sting a little. He probably never imagined it would end his career.

       He has a history of drug abuse and domestic violence that goes back to the early 90's. He was arrested for domestic violence a few years ago after holding a knife to his wife's throat and threatening to kill her if she went through with a divorce. He eventually got a plea bargain. He also destroyed a hotel room, because he thought the prostitute he was with stole a watch. He wanted to rent a neighbor's house for millions, just so he could fill it with porn stars. He wanted a "Porn Family." He claims to have cured his addictions simply by blinking.

       It doesn't matter if it is a celebrity or my next door neighbor. If they do those things, I am not going to say they are clear headed and/or straight as an arrow.

       oh for sure, he's neither of those things.
       <em>
        but he would be employable by hollywood
       </em>
       , and that's the whole point.  no one said he's a nice guy, just that he did something to cross some line and get fired, and it wasn't just being a horrible drunk/addict etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       they employ the most drunken worthless pieces of shit you can imagine.  drunk? no problem. coke head? who isn't.  hookers? no problem.  horrible parent? that's fine.  pedo? join the club.
      </p>
      <p>
       so if it's none of those obvious issues that would easily get you fired
       <em>
        outside of hollywood
       </em>
       , what was it that got him fired?

       My reply was never about him being fired for any of that(I'll bring that up later though). It was about the OP's claims that he was clear headed and straight as an arrow before speaking out about the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actors have been fired for all the things you've listed. Off the top of my head, Gary Busey, Nick Nolte, Robert Downey Jr, Rob Lowe, and Lindsay Lohan, have all been fired, removed from roles, considered unhirable or uninsurable for doing the same things as Charlie Sheen has done at one time or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really amazing. You act as if he didn't contribute to his firing at all. After the 36 hour coke party, the show went on hiatus so he could enter rehab. Which he promptly left, and said he cured his addictions by blinking. He wanted to resume filming. The producers and everyone else associated with the show said he needed to return to rehab. That pissed him off. For next month or so, he went on nearly any radio and tv show, so he could bury the network and production staff. That is when he was fired. Believe it or not, that's a valid reason for being fired. 
Yet I am supposed to believe the true reason he was fired was because he questioned 9/11, and called his producer by his Hebrew name?
      </p>
      <p>
       If those were truly the reasons, I find it funny that he is getting a new show on FX. The network is owned by News Corp(Rupert Murdoch)

       I believe there is a certain level of protection offered to celebrities who stay within the well defined bounds.  Anyone who steps outside experiences the full wrath, tabloids to start, news and media second, and probably even worse after that.  Look at Mel Gibson or even Dennis Quade for a glimpse of the dark side.

       How old are you guys?  Sheen has had an almost life long affair with pussy, booze and drugs.  Also did you folks catch any of his interviews?  They painted him as mentally unstabled because he talked about "winning" while his life crumbled before his eyes.
