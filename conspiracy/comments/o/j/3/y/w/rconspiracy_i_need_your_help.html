<p>I was wondering if you could all post links to videos or information that could not possibly be conjured by some nutter. I mean Operation Northwoods type concrete evidence that has no  flaws whatsoever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Iran Contra hearings were televised day after day on the big three networks. The things that the previously unknown Oliver North came out and proudly defended were shocking. And it was pretty clear that even worse was being covered up. I just found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35KcYgMPiIM">this video</a>, but it seems pretty informative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coverup is definitely the best Iran Contra documentary ever produced. Bill Moyers Secret Gov does an alright job but falls short on calling out the deeper issues.

    <div class="md"><p>Look at me for instance, I am not an &quot;expert&quot; in the societal view of anything.  I have almost no formal education post high school but I have been reading (or listening) to book (and audiobooks) at the rate of about 2 a week since I was around 16.  One of the fields that interest me is terrorism and specifically Islamic terrorism and I would venture to say I have read everything available to me in the formats I like on the subject.  Books about 9/11, the Chechen conflict, the seizure of the grand mosque, first hand accounts of the Islamic revolution in Iran, just all kinds of shit that have anything remotely to do with terrorism.  I also am fairly good at being able to tell you which book a specific fact came from (within reason) and cite it accordingly.</p>

<p>Now, knowing this would you put more weight behind my opinion on a terrorism issue or the guy who just got done reading the wiki article on the difference between Sunni and Shia?  Again, I am not asking you to blindly trust that what I am saying is true, I can point to where the information came from and won&#39;t even lay spooky music over my text to confuse you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You probably mean scientifically unsound.  Sometimes some of the most interesting revelations are not pertaining to a grand conspiracy but point to a world that does not operate how we might think.  This may be due to disinterest on most peoples part or willfull concealment.   There are plenty of facts out there that in my opinion most or many do not know or do not care about which paint a different picture or tell a different narrative.</p>

<p>An example would be the idea that the u.s helped create al quaeda as opposition to the russians in afghanistan, there is a video of hilaryclinton admitting as much.   Saddam hussein was aided by western powers as he was seen as a useful tyrant to have onside against the ayatollah of iran.</p>

<p>it may be that videos by adam curtis such as the power of nightmares or century of the self can get people thinking differently.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A simple list of evidence with no definite conclusion drawn, but as the implication does not support your dad&#39;s quaint world view you will get a kick out of him saying that evidence is not evidence when it is not convenient: <a href="http://www.titanicuniverse.com/the-titanic-conspiracy">titanic</a> or <a href="http://www.titanicuniverse.com/the-titanic-conspiracy-investigating-the-titanic-conspiracy-theory/124">here</a>. Note that a conclusion isn&#39;t drawn, unlike the mass media fairy tales that your father dutifully accepts (Iran <em>has</em> an <em>active</em> nuclear weapons program)</p>

<p>Your dad will be able to help NASA out with this one. Again, it is the uncomfortable <em>implication</em> that will make your &quot;incredibly smart&quot; dad deny reality until the subject is changed. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8226075.stm">fake moon rocks</a> Again, note that a conclusion isn&#39;t drawn, unlike the mass media fairy tales that your father dutifully accepts (The protesters in <del>London</del> Libya are the legitimate government)</p>

<p>And he will be able to answer questions for Bertrand Russell with this one: <a href="http://karws.gso.uri.edu/JFK/the_critics/russell/Sixteen_questions_Russell.html">JFK</a></p>

<p>If your &quot;incredibly smart&quot; dad can use a stop watch, which, as it is an investigative tool, I doubt, he will be able to time the suspension of everyday physical processes (other than gravity). Again the social pressure forcing him to say that steel has no strength will be too strong for him to overcome. (The surrounding material will be too much for him: just focus on the collapse) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDvNS9iMjzA&amp;amp;feature=related">free fall 1</a> or <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/ppt_web/2hour/slideshow.php?i=64&amp;amp;hires=1">free fall 2</a></p>

<p>The Northwoods that you are so interested in: <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20010430/doc1.pdf">http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20010430/doc1.pdf</a></p>

<p>Your &#39;Dad&#39; needs to give a proper account of himself: what evidence - scientific evidence - has he presented, ever, to support :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>no explosions at the demolition of the WTC towers. Note that even the NIST fags hid from this one in all of their (non peer reviewed) studies. Luck we have your dad, huh? </p></li>
<li><p>actually any of his silly caves - invisible hijackers - superhuman jumbo jet flying - WTC 7 - noble zionists trying to save us all through the MSM - George Dubya ... conspiracy theory  </p></li>
<li><p>that special interests and corrupt politicians have never made agreements other than under full legal and public scrutiny.   [How do you manage to align your positive view of you father with his back peddaling from this question?]</p></li>
<li><p>that a fertilizer bomb in a pick up truck did blow up the Oklahoma FBI building, and the remarkable FBI death toll. Do, please, let us know his &#39;scientific&#39; insights on this one. </p></li>
<li><p>Iran Contra not being a conspiracy. </p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>No matter where you look closely at 9/11 the &#39;facts&#39; look wrong. </p>

<p>People like your dad believe that the buildings just &#39;look like &#39; they were imploded.</p>

<p>It just looked like building 7 had a little asymmetrical damage and then  came down in a completely symmetrical manner. </p>

<p>It just looked like there were 4 munitions experts who were assigned to &quot; VIP&#39;s within the  Executive Branch who entered building 7 that morning and they just happened to have an appointment there.</p>

<p>The Pentagon just  &#39;looked like&#39; there was no airliner crash and the heavy engines made no mark anywhere. </p>

<p>It just looked like Rumsfeld assigned the power to interdict hijackings to himself personally and then sat on his hands as they occurred.</p>

<p>It just looked like there was no airliner at the crash site at  Shanksville PA.</p>

<p>It just looks like there was a military stand down. </p>

<p>It just looked like the attackers were trained by our own military. </p>

<p>It just looked like the people who issued their visa&#39;s and let them into the country were given bonuses.</p>

<p>It just appears that the hijackers weren&#39;t devout Muslims at all. </p>

<p>It just looked like the evidence that proved the hijackers identity was planted.</p>

<p>It just looked like bush was hiding among human shields until the action was finished in case the mission failed.</p>

<p>It just looked like there was destruction and hiding  of the forensic evidence.</p>

<p>It just looked like there was a cover up.</p>

<p>It just looked like there were gag orders to silence witnesses.</p>

<p>It just looked like the 9/11 commissions  investigation was corrupted by the White House.</p>

<p>it just looked like there were scores of official international warnings of the coming attack   that were &#39;ignored&#39;. </p>

<p>It just looked like the buildings turned to dust facilitating them to fall through themselves with all joinery, bolts and welds, suddenly un joined.</p>

<p>It just looked like  the south tower  defied physics by not conserving momentum as it tilted over and then stopped tilting without cause unless there was a demolition.</p>

<p>It just looked like there were no Arabs on the flight lists of the unscheduled flights of that day.</p>

<p>It just looks like the cell phone calls from the flights were faked because they were impossible at the time.</p>

<p>It just looked like the FBI  confiscated the video from the Pentagon.</p>

<p>It just looked like the 5 frames of video they finally  did release were heavily Photoshopped, with heavy black lines around the shadows for instance.</p>

<p>It  looks like I&#39;m tired of enumerating these but there are plenty more.</p>

<p>To you&#39;re dad I&#39;m sure these things were all just anomalous appearances like you might find in any event.</p>

<p>That level and number of false appearance never happens.</p>

<p>If he uses  numerous  and far fetched official theories,  proposed by &#39;experts&#39; who are almost unanimously  employed by the very government that did the crime  as to why each single item looks wrong, piecemeal, rather than drawing the obvious conclusion that it&#39;s all false, done for political power, as so many other false flag events in history have been,   then he isn&#39;t that smart.</p>
