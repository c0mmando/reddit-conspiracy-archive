    <div class="md"><p>Watch his most recent &quot;rally&quot; in South Carolina and you will hear otherwise.  Colbert admits that he says Herman Cain as a joke and says to vote for &quot;whoever Herman Cain told you to vote for&quot; (Herman Cain tells the audience to vote for whoever they believe in).  Combine this with Colbert&#39;s recent MSNBC interview and you will hear that he likes Ron Paul out of all the Republican candidates...So the answer is actually, most likely, no.</p>

<p>They completely took over the rally for truth or sanity whatever it was called and subverted the cause.</p>

<p>Their job is to grab a movement by the hand and lead it away from the centre. They pull left. If it was a right leaning start to the rally, then FOX would have taken it over.</p>

<p>These guys are gatekeepers designed to keep the left from the right and uniting against their bosses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole thing (the superPAC and his campaign) is a stunt.</p>

<p>While the game may have been rigged prior to 2000 via control of the media. It was during the 2000 and 2004 elections that I was convinced that the USA is no longer a government <em>of the people</em>.</p>

<p>So, on the one hand, I find Colbert&#39;s activity offensive to the seriousness of the election (like Vermin Supreme). But, on the other hand, no more offensive than George W. Bush (the retarded son of a nefarious powermonger) actually <em>being</em> president <strong>for eight years</strong>.</p>

<p>Out of the <em>Republicans running</em>, he supports Paul. This doesn&#39;t include Obama or any independents who may be running. Also, he said he supported Paul over the others simply because he is consistent, and not necessarily because of any of his policies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Current thread is titled: &quot;Is Steven Colbert&#39;s presidential run designed to leech the youth vote from Ron Paul?&quot;</p>

<p>My response: &quot;I doubt it seeing as Colbert has said he supports Ron Paul.&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert: &quot;I like Ron Paul...he is intellectually consistent, absolutely..&quot;</p>

<p>If that doesn&#39;t imply that he even slightly supports Ron Paul, I don&#39;t know what does.  I&#39;m not trying to tell you who Colbert is voting for (I have no idea and don&#39;t care)...but it&#39;s pretty obvious he isn&#39;t trying to take votes away from Ron Paul if he says he likes him most out of all the Republican candidates...so what exactly is your problem?</p>

<p>EDIT: You&#39;ll also hear that he wants the youth to vote for whomever they want to vote for if you watch his recent speech in South Carolina.</p>
