<p>Look through the video footage the day of 9/11 on the BBC. Zionists Ehud Barak, Richard Perle and Frank Gaffney basically laid out the whole plan for who they planned to attack and the whole War On Terror. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are some questions I&#39;d like answered:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the purpose was to coerce the public into war with Iraq, why were most of the hijackers Saudi Arabian and not Iraqi? In retrospect this detail might seem inconsequential since we went to war anyways, however, anyone orchestrating such an event and for the purpose you allege would have surely chosen to make the hijackers identity Iraqi rather than Saudi Arabian. </p></li>
<li><p>If the government had the capacity to pull off 9/11, why didn&#39;t it just plant WMDs in Iraq to justify the war and save itself the embarrassment at home and abroad of not finding any weapons? Why would the government instead opt to incur heavy damage to its credibility?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>1: Most americans can&#39;t tell the difference between people from the mid-east, seeing as many of them don&#39;t have a clue where saudi arabia even is, it&#39;s not difficult to fool the masses.</p>

<p>2: Couldn&#39;t risk the Iraqis accidentally finding the planted WMD&#39;s before &quot;inspectors&quot; arrived. If they found them, they could either point the finger at the US (it&#39;d be relatively easy to point to the source of uranium), keep/use it themselves, sell it to a neighbor, etc. Nor could the US plant one and set it off claiming a misfire or accident on the Iraqis part; science would once again prove where the materials came from. Easier to lay the blame on a prez that is on his last term anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hard physical evidence of 9/11 has a mysterious way of disappearing. The dancing Israelis took photographs of the attack on the Twin Towers -- we know this because they photographed each other standing in front of the burning buildings, with big grins on their faces, as souvenirs to take home and put on their walls. As to what happened with any other evidence they collected, who knows? The FBI probably let them take it back to Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>re: 3, this point goes both ways. For multiple arabic passports to be found in good condition at the scene, it isn&#39;t entirely impossible but it&#39;s extremely improbable - and then there&#39;s the issue that a handful of these &#39;hijackers&#39; are actually still alive, despite at least one of their passports being &quot;found at WTC&quot;. You cant really explain that one away... did he leave his passport on the plane and get off (airlines won&#39;t let you) to take a day-long shit? Logic dictates that the passport was planted at the scene after the fact. &quot;Mistaken identities due to common names&quot; is just more bullshit; one would think that if the FBI was sure about someone&#39;s identity, then there would be no mistake. And if there is a mistake, why are they still withholding information and the guy himself (is he still in gauntanamo?), and why should anyone trust anything the FBI has to say about anything?</p>

<p>As far as plane debris (this is the other side of your issue), there was almost nothing found at the Pentagon (or in Pennsylvania) that indicates a large plane had crashed. There were small pieces of shrapnel, but the engines were never found, the tail section was never shown, there were no airline seats found... way too many inconsistencies.  </p>

<p>@op, you forgot about molten steel under the WTC complex for weeks after, and the fact that no airliner in the world can carry enough fuel to possibly burn openly for anywhere near that long. There&#39;s also all kinds of documentaries already done that show evidence like the US knew about the attack and ignored intel, FEMA prepared for such a situation in something like 1994, the day before (9/10) Rumsfeld quietly announced that $2 trillion USD was missing, etc.</p>

The hotel had several video feeds, or do you think the employees replayed the crappy one the FBI released?  &quot;Hotel employees sat watching the film in shock and horror several times before the FBI confiscated the video as part of its investigation.&quot;  So you think the released video - which shows jack-squat - would captivate them enough to replay it over and over again?

    <div class="md"><p>It is completely relevant because it is used as proof of a conspiracy. I said that there weren&#39;t another other drills involving NORAD. The NRO building is not NORAD. The NRO drill is completely irrelevant to 9/11 and you used it as an example of conspiracy, when it was nothing but a gloried fire drill that didn&#39;t even happen in an unrelated building.

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t care if I&#39;m right or wrong.  (I don&#39;t own the facts.)  Getting to the bottom of what happened that day is &#39;bigger&#39; than that.  It&#39;s not important that one tiny &#39;thread&#39; of this gigantic, lush fabric is a little frayed 10 years later.  You&#39;re completely missing the larger point and using HS debate tactics on someone who knows better.  (That you can&#39;t concede a point and keep &#39;moving the goalposts&#39; is pretty obvious.) </p>

<p>To correct you, yet again: I didn&#39;t use it as an example of &#39;conspiracy proof,&#39; but to counter your assertion that there were &#39;no drills&#39; going on that day.  The NRO indeed notified the DoD and CIA what they were training for, and only stopped and went home AFTER the Pentagon incident, that is hard fact.  The actual point, which you avoid, is that in the NMCC that day, if there are 3 or 4 major, scheduled  aircraft/defense/emergency exercises already going on, and the actual things that are occurring are almost an mirror of that... well, correlation only goes so far before it&#39;s outright collusion or causation.  That &#39;glorified fire drill&#39; involved a building located just a few miles from the Pentagon. They are truly related - by physical location, method of drill (aircraft crash into Gov&#39;t building) and actual timeline.  It was scheduled and ran on 9/11.  These facts are related, then, by definition.  Nothing occurs in a vacuum. </p>

<p>The bulk of the evidence, vetted as it is in several forums now, is enough to ask that &#39;someone, anyone&#39; have the balls to look at the myriad unanswered questions.  Engineers, pilots, architects, physics &amp; chemistry professors, hi-rise builders - these are all highly trained individuals.  I know in discussing this with you that you have no background in any of these fields, even a little bit.  So, either you&#39;re parroting the &#39;counter-arguments&#39; that have been scripted by blow-hards like Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, who are genuinely not concerned with the truth of that day, or you are a fine example of the Dunning-Kruger Effect on Reddit.  Have you researched anything about security systems yet?  When you do, you will realize that your assertions are so far off the mark that they appear to be &#39;ignorant&#39; of basic rules and concepts of that trade.  The lack of good video of the Pentagon crash is almost theoretically impossible given the &#39;intersecting fields&#39; of video coverage that is the very basis of video security.  No good video IS proof of some sort of cover-up, therefore &#39;shenanigans&#39; needs to be called.  Don&#39;t take my word for it, ask any security manager of a large installation/building.
If you believe the hotel only had one camera, that is YOUR belief, and has nothing whatsoever to do with known facts.  (Hmm... &quot;That is exactly the problem. You can&#39;t believe what is right in front of you because of your ideology. You have make the facts fit the story you want to believe.&quot;)  </p>

<p>You haven&#39;t put any facts &#39;right in front of me&#39; that counter my assertions.  Picking at the corner crumbs of the details is very junior-varsity argumentation.<br/>
Dozens of &#39;impossible&#39; things happened that day, which isn&#39;t a dogmatic belief system, but a known set of facts.  You can nip at tiny, irrelevant  bits, but the facts aren&#39;t ever going to change - just the spin you create to distract from the larger points, and by extension, the implications.   </p>

<p>I would argue that you, _Dimension, are the one clinging to a fixed belief system.  All these pertinent facts, and you CAN&#39;T see a conspiracy, or a cover-up?  I would suggest some mind-expansion.  </p>

2) Not a big surprise.  They were using fake IDs, and who can make awesome fake IDs?  (Hint:  any countries&#39; intelligence services)
3) Planted, obviously.  Along with the Logan Airport &#39;treasure trove&#39; in the parked car.  They had it all figured out in three days.  Right.
4) All good points.  There must be video of what really happened.  It is beyond implausibility that The Pentagon DIDN&#39;T have video capture something more useful.  The engine debris that is shown is not from the aircraft indicated popularly.  The FDR info says the flight ended 480+ feet in the air, and departed 700 feet away from the given gate, and that the cockpit door didn&#39;t open at all during the flight.  Not once.
5) There was also a hole in that field before it happened.  USGS pics put that scar there in 1994.<br/>
6)  Precisely.  Never happened before, won&#39;t ever happen again.  These anomalies in official procedures are the fingerprints of the cover-up.  No cameras in the Pit was a good way to control information.
7) He was an asset.  His family is deeply entrenched in the Bush family.  Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn&#39;t really lie about any of this.
8) There is a video of him talking to a FDNY guy (on the street below) from the wreckage after the initial explosions in the basement there.
9) Dead, or discredited, or demonized - all three tactics have been used.  </p>

Enron was also tightly involved in the bribing of Taliban officials in order to secure the rights to build an oil pipeline. It all goes back to what people were saying after we invaded Iraq. It was all about the oil. Sometimes the most simplistic explanations are 100% correct. Also look into Condoleezza Rice&#39;s background a bit. You will find out she was a former member of Chevron&#39;s board of directors, and also headed Chevron&#39;s committee on public policy until she resigned on January 15, 2001, to become National Security Advisor to President George W.

<p>7/7 occurred more than two years later and when it happened very few people saw it as a justification for the Iraq war which was still attracting a lot of opposition. If anything 7/7 provoked a further reaction against the war because many felt it had probably happened as a result of the UK&#39;s intervention in Iraq.</p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t answered the question implicit in my first comment: since 7/7 happened in 2005 how could it have persuaded the USA to go to war in 2003?</p>

<p>We join america but we as a country didn&#39;t understand why we had to go to war because there wasn&#39;t a threat/nothing had been done to us and not America.</p>

<p>This memo (PDF) written on November 27, 2001 should send cold chills up and down your spine. It is a list of talking points from Rumsfeld to Franks about how to handle a run-up to a full-scale Iraq invasion. November 27th, 51 days after Afghanistan was invaded. </p>
