        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Lately, I’ve been sniffing around and trying to figure everything out for once and for all. I have been into conspiracy theories for over a decade, but especially recently I have been discovering more reliable sources of information. Weather it is a mere coincidence that all these sources are appearing until recently (closer to the year 2012), remains unknown. It could be possible that someone is deliberately releasing all this information or then people are generally more interested in conspiracy theories towards 2012 and therefore more information is being dug out.</p>

<p>Since you are here, the chances are that most likely you already know all the major conspiracy theories. Some of you are perhaps in denial that this is too unbelievable to be true, while others of you have a clear image that something is going on. I am, of course, talking about the mass mind control, hidden symbols and world based on lies. One may always ask:  how do we know for sure that these things are actually happening and that we aren’t simply being delusional? Well, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBKDZhu-EZw">go see any major Hollywood mass production movie and notice the ‘all seeing eye’</a> .Then look at the back of the dollar bill and see it there as well. Follow the money flow and it will lead you to the elite that rules the world. These people own the banks that print the money and they hold the power to control everything. The signs are everywhere.  Perhaps the greatest tragedy is that people know it, but they don’t believe it since the masses aren’t revolting and heads are not rolling. How can this be? What is really going on?</p>

<p>Now that we know that something fishy is going on, let’s consider the facts. What is ‘the all seeing eye’? As many of you already know, the all seeing eye is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Horus">Eye of Horus</a>(sometimes known as the eye or Ra) on top of a pyramid. Both, the eye and the pyramid are originated in Ancient Egypt. Now, which secret society can be tracked down to ancient Egypt? – ALMOST ALL OF THEM. Look into available history of any major secret society, all of them have similar hierarchical systems (different degrees), occult activity and they all claim of ‘possessing a great secret’, which they claim to have passed down from Egypt.  Now, I do not know whether they actually possess an actual secret; the chances are that they are simply deceiving their members to believe that there is some sort of ‘magic word’ that could grant them eternal life or superpowers. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-NAgjw6Zdk">Let’s look at Hollywood’s symbolism once again.</a> Many of the movies symbolise ancient Egyptian tales. Alongside these tales we can find few subliminal themes. Most common is “good guys versus bad guys” type of set up. Now, this is nothing new in itself, but if we look closer, we see that surprisingly often a villain or evil is symbolised by a snake. Why, out of all the creatures, a serpent is portrayed as the source of all evil? The answer can be found in the bible. Every major religion (of Abrahamic origin) has the tale of creation, Genesis, and the story of Adam, Eve and the snake. The oldest variation of this tale exists in Torah, which is estimated to be 3000 years old. We also have a tale of Moses freeing the slaves in Egypt, which means that the bible is not much older that the pyramids. However, recently there has been a discovery of ancient pyramid ruins which are estimated to be 4,300 years old. This means that Egyptian civilization is older than the bible. What this means, is that it’s quite plausible that these people wrote the bible. If so, why did they go through all that trouble to portrait snakes as the root of all evil? What or who is this serpent figure? To find an answer, we will have to go back in time 3000 years. Besides the pyramids, the Stonehenge is estimated to be over 3000 years old. We know that the Egyptian civilization and the civilization that built the Stonehenge existed at the same times. According to modern historians, the Stonehenge was built by the druids. By now it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the main symbol of the druids is a serpent.</p>

<p>It is not a mere coincidence that our hidden rulers originated from ancient Egypt. The Ancient Egyptians were slave masters and they have had thousands of years to perfect their techniques to rule, not only bodies of men, but their minds as well. Even 3000 years ago they were skilled enough to make their people believe they were gods. And when they couldn’t be gods no more, they portrayed themselves as messengers of God, though they were only messengers of themselves. And look what men worship these days: money. Who owns the money? – they do. We have been slaves even from before the history was written. However, not all have been blind to their tricks: the ‘serpents’ were perhaps the first ones to oppose their tyranny. Druids offered knowledge, which is in bible symbolised as a ‘tree of forbidden knowledge’. Just by looking around us we can see that unfortunately they weren’t able to free us. They began to call themselves “the brotherhood of the serpents” and for many times they tried to free us. </p>

<p>Anywhere where the brotherhood of snakes appeared, the church struck and burned their “heathen” writings. Anyone who opposed their religion was a branded a heathen, a Satanist, a sorcerer, or a witch. One of the best known symbols of the serpents can be found in use of medicine. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caduceus">The symbol known as Caduceus</a> depicts two snakes intervened around a pole. This is not a mere coincidence. Medicine, alchemy and astronomy were few things among many that were practiced by the Brotherhood of serpents. It is said that Socrates himself belonged to a secret group. Knowing that Socrates was very fond of Alchemical principles, he most likely was a member of Brotherhood of snakes. Socrates’ teachings led to a revolution in sciences. Ever wondered why the Library of Alexandria was burned down and why the Christian dark ages followed after the fall of the Roman Empire? It seems that our shadow government has always trampled on those who didn’t bow to it. These people write our history books, but they haven’t been able to eradicate all facts. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick#St._Patrick_banishes_all_snakes_from_Ireland">it is said that Saint Patrick banished all snakes from the Ireland</a>. However, it is well known that Ireland never had any snakes, but in fact, it did have Brotherhood of Snakes. It’s ironic how we have always opposed those who have been trying to save us.</p>

<p>Throughout the ages they have been trying to control the flow of information. They own our money and our governments, they write our history books and they own our religions. They stand behind every world war and every evil government. They are the source of all greed and evil. They have many names, but you probably know them as the Bilderberg group, trilateral commission, Freemasons, the Elite, Skull &amp; Bones, Rosicrucians, Golden Dawn, Knights Templars, Priory of Sion and by many other names.</p>

<p>Despite that I’ve come to realize all this, I think that the rabbit hole goes even deeper than this. I believe the new age movement may have something to do with it, but I am not entirely sure. Where does the Bohemian Grove, occult rituals, Lucifer, Hermetica and numerology fit into this? Why every major crisis is nearing towards 2012?  Can anyone please explain what the hell is going on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The globalists are a group of like minded individuals, groups, international financiers and hereditary land-owning families of Britain and Europe which over the years have formed alliances to create  self-regenerating power structures based on self-interest. They share an oligarchic, monopolistic, neofeudal mindset and a common goal of  world domination through global government to control everything and everyone.</p>

<p>The mechanisms of control have lost their effectiveness and people are being forced to acknowledge that the system they have been inculcated to worship is a false God:</p>

<p>&quot;Take a map and draw a circle, then say, everyone outside the circle is to have their labor and resources exploited for the benefit of those inside the circle. If you live outside the circle you say, “this system is completely fucked up.” If you live inside the circle you say, “this is capitalism and it’s the best system on earth you should try it it’s awesome. Sure, people outside are suffering, but who gives a fuck about them?” Now as the circle shrinks, as it is designed to do, concentrating accumulated wealth, people begin finding themselves suddenly outside of the circle. They jump up and down and cry foul, but the ones still in the circle say, “tough shit, you were too slow, should run faster to stay inside the circle“. But then, they soon realize that they too are too slow to keep up with the rapidly shrinking circle, and quickly they find themselves left out, so they cry foul. “The system is broken!!!” they decry! But is it? Isn’t this the way the system has always functioned? Why is it now broken just because they, we, no longer reside within the bounds of its benefits? We stand outside the ever shrinking circle, yelling fixes, throwing band-aids, making demands that the ever shrinking circle expand! at least big enough to include us so that we can go back to not giving a fuck about the people outside, but alas, it will not. The circle does not expand, it does not know how. It only knows how to contract, concentrate, condense, like a dark star collapsing in on itself. There is [nothing] that will drag the borders of the circle back around us. And even if you could, would you? Would you go back to fucking the rest of the world to have your cable TV and your steel belted radials? I hope not. I hope the world is ready to say no more. No more. Therefore, since it is my sincere belief that the circle is/was and always will be fucked up, I say, surround them and demand that they collapse in on themselves and disappear into their own black hole.&quot;</p>

<p>The standard fix is war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Twenty thousand years ago humans lived in small tribal collectives. Life was short and miserable for everyone, but quite often people were happy and free. </p>

<p>Then the glaciers receded, the ice ages ended and the old hunting grounds turned to deserts. New lands became available, specifically large very fertile river delta&#39;s. Humans settled the new lands and found they could stay in one place more often as opposed to wander around. So the first humans started <strong>claiming</strong> these bits of land and didn&#39;t want other people around.</p>

<p>When people first claimed land they could start breeding animals and hold cattle. And they tilled land and grew crops. This started happening first in the middle east, probably in or near what is now Turkey. More than ten thousand years ago. And then because of the territoriality of this process this created a runaway effect. Now populations were possible that ran in the hundreds of humans.</p>

<p>But to organize populations of hundreds of people you started getting people who did special things - warrior castes. Priests, Bureaucrats. The old tribal structures slowly changes in to new hierarchies, where bullies got their war. The bullies could start waging <strong>war</strong> on neighboring tribes. Or their started telling weaker members of the tribes to do as they wanted. Or even better - they started hoarding women.</p>

<p>As a result of <em>property</em> those in charge now invented inheritance. And this proceeded generally through the male line - wealth accumulation through silverback.  This was of course also self-reinforcing as the biggest bullies and most effective autocrats were able to instill fear in the &quot;lower classes&quot; as well as spread their &quot;upper class&quot;  dominance genes. </p>

<p>In fact for ten thousand years humanity has experienced an evolutionary bottleneck. Anyone who didn&#39;t listen to the tyrants had a distinctly higher chance to get killed - hence anyone who had an uppity streak either became rich and had a chance to breed the uppity genes into a dominant (and distinctly less moral - i.e. &quot;psychopathic) lineage, whereas the majority of people (the 99%) started attaining more the characteristics of domesticated docile cattle. </p>

<p>The women fared worst. They grew smaller, died earlier (in childbirth mostly, since most women were forced to live in small houses, often close to animal manure and human excrement) and the new tribal  mechanisms favored most a high birth rate and high turnover - the bullies consistently targeted neighboring tribes for slaves, stolen property, cattle or land.</p>

<p>This is where we are now. A small percentage of humanity has the mindset of vampires, whereas the vast majority is inclined to apathy, an almost masochistic tendency to submit. In fact, this mechanism would be my number one explanation why sadomachochism exists in the first place. </p>

<p>In fact - ten thousand years of autocrats - what does that do to the collective subconscious of humans? Wouldn&#39;t humans start expecting the shadow of some kind of eternal, celestial bully to be constantly watching over their shoulder?</p>

<p><strong>Submit</strong>, as Islam says. Submit or face Hell.</p>

<p>Yes my friends, there is a global, highly secretive and deceptive group of people out there. They are few and they control many. You can see signs everywhere. They have their sources at the very beginning of civilization, and they have made slaves and fools of us all. They hide in plain sight, they know each other. They are <strong>The Assholes.</strong></p>

<p>The Assholes are a secret organization ruling the world. The Assholes have secret Assholes parties on Assholes yachts and Assholes retreats, doing Assholes rituals. The news is controlled by Assholes, politics and the leaders of most countries are Assholes. Even the UN is full of Assholes! They have Assholes friends doing Assholes things and each Asshole secretly knows what&#39;s best for The Assholes. Men are frustrated and profited by them and women are hypnotized by them. Assholes suck up our wealth and life energy. Assholes cannot be detected by scanners or metal detector, they live in an alternate Assholish dimension, barely perceptible to most humans.</p>

<p>Wake up sheeple! There are Assholes everywhere!</p>

<p>Seriously though, we are the product of a highly predatory environment. The Universe has no natural laws saying things have to be fair for you, me, or anyone else. People cheat and lie and they don&#39;t get caught. They are like snake oil salesmen. They are slimy and disgusting. Shit happens. There are systemic flaws in society, and lots of people take advantage of it. Wars happen because they are profitable. Drug addicts steal TVs and power addicts steal elections. You don&#39;t need any grand scheme to explain what&#39;s going on. There are enough myths out there to make up any possible story for the development of society and the human race. People have been predicting the end of the world since the beginning of the world, and so far it hasn&#39;t happened. In 2013 people will come up with a new date that will be the end of it all, and things will continue as they have been for thousands of years. Deal with it.</p>

Make peace with yourself, then your mind, and after that the universe.  Why?  Because the <em>truth is different at ever level</em> (like an onion), and more importantly, reality is shaped by perception, and <em>your perception is unique</em>.</p>

<p>That is why you can spend decades looking for truth, and arrive back at the start.  It is designed this way, all part of the game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stumbled upon the same conclusion a number of years ago. The <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_brotherhoodsnake.htm">Brotherhood of the snake or serpent</a> has been around for thousands of years. I personally believe the big secret that they are hiding is advanced technology and the fact that the illuminati killed off most of humanity at least once before. They have also demonized the serpent as the devil, the bringer of temptation, the temptation of forbidden knowledge. The implications are staggering.The story of Noah&#39;s ark might be an analogy of a spaceship. Also the serpent in the bible is the bringer of knowledge, or the enlightened one. The analogy here is clear. The brotherhood is likely a group of extraterrestrial humans who helped along the evolution of homosapiens and possibly Neanderthals about ten to thirty thousand years ago. . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t go as far as proclaiming existence of aliens, but I do agree that it could be something completely forgotten by time. Many skeptics would try to disprove my assumption regarding the Eye of Horus, claiming that perhaps the symbol itself does come from ancient Egypt, but that it has nothing to do with the civilization that existed back then. However, the closer study of the Bible prooves otherwise. Judaism, Christianity and Islam have remerkable correlations with one another and the ancient sun worship (which once again leads us to Ra and Horus).</p>

<p>Someone from that era, 3000 years ago, had to write the old testament, for it didn&#39;t write itself. This means that that someone could have known and passed down other knowledge which is now generally thought to be lost in time. Perhaps something remarkable happened and due to no existing public records we have no clue. From the point of evolution, the human brain hasn&#39;t really changed in the last 100 000 years, so it is quite possible that a remarkably advanced and now completely forgotten human civilzation existed. Although let&#39;s not jump into assumptions based on possibilities of old.</p>

<p>However, if there really is a secret, then the most likely people to know are the ones who were known as &#39;brotherhood of serpents&#39;: people who brought gnosticism, philosophy, astronomy, mathematics and alchemy (which eventually evolved into modern science) to the public knowledge. Many men of great wisdom (including Socraetes, Plato and Leonardo Da Vinci) had clearly connections to this group. Wether the original Brotherhood of Snakes exists or not, I do not know, but I have come to conclusion that one derived groups exists in modern age by the name of Illuminati. After all, Illuminati has always stood against the church and has been known to advocate alchemy and astronomy. I have also heard of another group, known as Luminari, but I haven&#39;t been able to find any information on the group and I suspect that Luminari is a hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>think about this: the best place to hide something is right out in the open. if you knew there would be a segment of the population that would never stop digging, wouldn&#39;t you throw up a decent number of red herrings along the way? from what i know of these groups, they&#39;ve all had conflicting versions of the truth anyway, shady half-almosts maybe, a nudge in the right direction but doing all the wrong things with it. there was a Masonry AMA recently where the popular consensus was that they really don&#39;t do anything anymore, and that&#39;s true for a lot of the various secret societies that have maybe had some global meddling going on in their time.</p>

<p>where is the best place to hide something? <em>right out in the open.</em> so where would you hide the ultimate secret? and just why the hell did ancient man worship the sun so much? it&#39;s just a big ball of fire in the sky...</p>

<p>My thoughts on this world and the human activities going on in it are holographic and fractal.  Not in the sense it&#39;s not &quot;real&quot; but in the sense that the larger part of civilization goes through exactly the same mental processes and states of operation as the individual mind.  Humanity at large is playing the entire cast of inner space on the world stage.  Macrocosm to Microcosm yeah?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Despite a lot of negative signals, we really have no way of knowing whether this is going to result in a comparatively better or a comparatively worse world for the bulk of humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to ancient Hindu teachings, it would seem that we are headed toward a <em>worse</em> world - not a better one.  We are presently in what is called The Kali Yuga, which is the last of four stages in a cycle that repeats itself about every four and a half <em>million</em> years.  This last stage which we are in - fortunately - is the shortest.  However, it also happens to be the worst, and is said to be marked by aggression, ignorance, and darkness.</p>

<p>We are not getting better and more advanced, therefore, we are getting worse and more barbaric - <em>de</em>volition as opposed to evolution.</p>

<p>Yeah, if the Vedas are correct us fragmentary constitutents of the godhead must continue this dance for a long time before things start to get much better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  It would certainly seem so.  Fortunately, there are undulations - ebbs and flows - regarding what particular aspect of &quot;the fragmentary constituent of the godhead&quot; we manifest in.  I certainly hope a future manifestation of this identity (i.e. me) manifests in a more favorable area of the godhead than is presently the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>*I&#39;ve long &quot;believed in&quot; devolution, the influence of cosmic forces, and the latent potentialities of humanity... a relic from the time in my life when I could just let myself believe in the ideas I like ;)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to imply a feeling on your part that an aspect (or the entirety) of the concept (of devolution) is ill-conceived or ultimately incorrect.  Perhaps I am simply reading or interpreting what you meant incorrectly, but while I admit that the concept of devolution <em>is</em> indeed quite a novel one from the perspective of western thought - one which is by no means taught in our institutions; one which is distinctly different from the constant indoctrination we in the west receive, leading us to believe that we as a civilization are, in fact, getting <em>better</em> and smarter, not, in fact, more barbaric and less evolved - it <em>would</em> indeed seem that an examination of our history and civilization bears out a significant level of support for the theory of devolution, would it not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems that what&#39;s going on is that a race of beings - either from this planet or not from this planet - have simply overtaken the human race.  They are outnumbered by us about a million to one, however, so they can&#39;t just come here and TAKE OVER.  We&#39;d whip their asses.  Therefore, they have to take over slowly and covertly.</p>

<p>There it is.  That&#39;s it really.</p>

<p>The majority of the human race is, for the most part, either massively in denial about the fact that all this is even going on in the first place, or - if they HAVE acknowledged that this is indeed going on - are generally frozen with the overwhelming feeling of powerlessness.  They feel that nothing can really be done about it anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t believe ALL of the stuff that&#39;s on that website.  It does indeed have <em>some</em> relevant information on it - so it&#39;s useful in that sense.  However, even though what I said above is very valid (unfortunately), it should also be mentioned and noted that there is sizeable consortium of extraterrestrial civilizations watching and monitoring what&#39;s going on here on Earth that are actually good and benevolent.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like Dr. Karla Turner.  She had some very, very valid information on abduction.  However, her information was almost 100% negative in terms of what the agenda was.  This is an unfortunate and mistaken viewpoint.  It&#39;s just as bad as saying all E.T. contact is a good and wonderful thing.  Both views are mistaken - although I will say that evidence suggests E.T. contact is overwhelmingly productive and constructive for the development of the contactee.  Contact is often an extremely frightening and traumatizing thing initially, but has often shown itself to ultimately be for the better of the contactee in terms of their understanding of themselves and the world/universe around them.  Also, some have noted <em>physical</em> benefits from an advancement in telepathic awareness, to cures of certain problematic (if not life-threatening) ailments they&#39;ve had.</p>

<p>Regarding E.T. contact, it just is what it is.  We have to learn from it and use it to develop our own abilities and spiritual/emotional paths as much as possible.</p>

<p>What&#39;s going on in this planet regarding what I mentioned above is NOT good at all.  However, that&#39;s not because E.T. civilizations are necessarily bad or evil or against humanity in and of themselves.  Far, far from it.</p>

That is where the scheme is really taking place. For example, an interesting area to look into would be the history of retail supermarkets and their evolution.

Mr. iamnotallthatbad has raised some very key point in todays society, and I for one feel smarter for having listened to him. I award him one upvote, and God will have mercy on his soul.
As for you, I remain neutral on the vote-front. I rarely downvote anything (unless its on r/f7u12 or r/atheism) Downvotes are negative, and negativity is bad.</p>
