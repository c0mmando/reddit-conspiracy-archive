       I personally think if Obama gets a second term he will do some of the most important things a president has ever done for this country. I think the Republicans realize this and have mastered a plan to try to get Ron Paul elected. All of the other candidates are there to make Ron Paul look better. They are all weak choices. I personally think Ron Paul is completely bullshitting with his radical views and will actually be the next George W if he is elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fox News is in on this. They ignore Ron Paul and laugh at him because they are aware a lot of people hate their station and know they are biased. They want these people to think the Republican party doesn't want Ron Paul to be elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Republicans are trying their hardest to make Obama look terrible. They want his former voters to turn on him and register Republican to vote for their man Ron Paul.

       You're tripping so hard if you think Obama will do anything important for you. Important things Obama has done in his first term:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Declared the assassination of US citizens legal.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Executive Order 13567 providing for indefinite detention at GitMo (as of last March). Sure, he experienced resistance when he tried to close it. GUESS HE BETTER MAKE INDEFINITE DETENTION FEASIBLE THEN! that's totally the next logical step.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Extended the USA PATRIOT Act and the Global War on Terror. (a lot of Republicans loved this, by the way)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Anyway, if you have been paying any attention at all, regardless of "conspiracies", you would be foolish to endorse Obama again (or, not going that far, at least foolish to compare someone who upholds personal liberties [Dr. No] to a proponent of the police state and rampant militant action in the interests greed).

       Bush paved the way for Obama to have the power that he has now.  Obama is only guilty of not rescinding said power.  But who would?  And the NDAA isn't anything to worry about, unless you're going to tell me you have read the actual bill, otherwise....ssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....

      </p>
      <p>
       I wish he would have reversed all those things too.  Guantanamo wasn't really his fault, Congress will not approve funding to let him close the base, but there is language in the NDAA that talks about that as well.  As far as the wars....he's slowly doing that, but even I knew that wasn't going to happen immediately, too much bureaucracy and politics.

        actual bill.
       </a>
       Page 265 &amp; 266 are the detainee provisions.  If you scroll down enough you will see this...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "(b) Applicability to United States Citizens and Lawful Resident Aliens-
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        (1) UNITED STATES CITIZENS- The requirement to detain a person in military custody under this section does not extend to citizens of the United States.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        (2) LAWFUL RESIDENT ALIENS- The requirement to detain a person in military custody under this section does not extend to a lawful resident alien of the United States on the basis of conduct taking place within the United States, except to the extent permitted by the Constitution of the United States."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The bill says nothing of indefinite detention, only that you can be held until hostilities come to an end.  Even then, you still have to fall under their
       <em>
        covered persons
       </em>
       section to even be considered for such treatment.  Otherwise, no, there are no provisions in the bill to hold Americans indefinitely.  It is a lie.

       Well, I didn't believe he would end the wars like he said, when he said either.  However, he campaigned on it -so he lied.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the NDAA, I'm aware of that section.  Are you aware of these contradicting sections:
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 1021 of the NDAA allows the U.S. military to indefinitely detain, without due process, any person engaged in "hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners ... without trial until the end of hostilities."
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 1022 expressly states that the military will imprison anyone who is a member of al-Qaeda or "
       <strong>
        an associated force
       </strong>
       " that acts like al-Qaeda; and anyone who planned or carried out an attack, or attempted attack, against the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 1022 continues that detaining American citizens is not required. "UNITED STATES CITIZENS — The requirement to detain a person in military custody under this section does not extend to citizens of the United States."

      </p>
      <p>
       No where in the bill is "indefinitely" used, at all.  Those captured and held under these laws still have options, as found under that paragraph....military trial, transfer to an alternative court, or a request to transfer to the detainees country of origin.  I never said I like these bills, but let's get the information correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Section 1022 expressly states that the military will imprison anyone who is a member of al-Qaeda or "an associated force" that acts like al-Qaeda; and anyone who planned or carried out an attack, or attempted attack, against the U.S."
      </p>
      <p>
       And nothing there states the indefinite detention of American citizens.  The authority to detain people comes from different bills, the Authority for Use of Military Force and the Patriot Act.  This bill does not grant that authority.

       There is the language for that.  Like I said, the authority to hold people aren't granted in this bill, it comes from bills that have been on the books for 10+ years.

       What he did was right, but he fucked up.  He was an enlisted man and broke so may laws, he'll be lucky to not get the death penalty.  If it was a civilian who could have released that information, they would not have received that same treatment since they were not enlisted in the armed forces.

       Of course, that is how it is meant to be.  I didn't write the laws, but whoever did made sure that it would go on and on.  This mess started with the Bush Administration, after 9/11 when the Patriot Act was passed (with much haste and too much emotion.)  Obama is guilty of not rescinding those laws, but it would be political suicide.  He would never get that support from anybody, his own party or especially the opposition.  They would label him a traitor and accuse him of trying to conspire with our enemies.  It was a lose-lose situation when Obama signed the NDAA.

       Wo, wo, wo...  So you're saying of course the war could go on forever and that's how it's meant to be...  So then people CAN be held indefinitely, no?  Do you not see the circle here?

       You said there's no mention of the word indefinite, but that people can be held for as long as the war on terror goes...  which is indefinite.  Did I just get caught in a circle jerk, cuz I'm pulling taffy.

       More like they want Obama to get elected again since he is the greatest 'Republican' president since Eisenhower (seriously - compare their policies, Obama is the black Eisenhower) so they can get everything moderate Republicans want all while clamouring for extreme right crap that will never happen WHILE discrediting Democrats. It's a win / win / win situation with Obama.
