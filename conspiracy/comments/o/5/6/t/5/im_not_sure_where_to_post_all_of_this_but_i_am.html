    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t care. That&#39;s what it boils down to. They just don&#39;t fucking care.</p>

<p>This is the average American&#39;s thought process, &quot;The govt can do whatever it wants as long as it doesn&#39;t interfere with me directly.&quot; People don&#39;t want to be bothered with shit like us starting a war with Iran. As long as they&#39;re given a few pieces of information that allow them to justify it, it&#39;s fine. Just don&#39;t get in the way of my 9-5 job and my 2 story house with 2 1/2 kids.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the mentality you&#39;re dealing with and there is NO way to fight it. You can&#39;t make these people care about the middle east. Personally, I am and always have been of the opinion that we have zero right to be in that area at all. We need to let them sort out their own mess.</p>

<p>If oil prices go up, so be it. Govt should&#39;ve taken all the money it spent on war and invested in a national upgrade to our energy future (more solar, more wind, etc). Would&#39;ve created jobs (research, building, maintaining, etc), reduced reliance on oil, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We mustn&#39;t fall short again by practicing American exceptionalism (or any other means of racism/elitism). Every human life is valuable. Iranian, American, Russian, Chinese.. This is what nationalism attempts to defeat.</p>

<p>At this point in time, it is very clear to me who values life and who seeks to destroy it for the gain of the few. We have to stand together, and the means for that are rapidly eroding (attempted destruction and subversion of the Internet, racial profiling, religion/media/education as social controls, etc.). I can only hope that the people of this planet can see their true value and rise above this when all is said and done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought communists were evil, pure evil, that was the impression I was given as a child.</p>

<p>The school system led me to believe that WWII was a war against communism.</p>

<p>What a joke.</p>

<p>I believe that Marx was right, in order for it to work, or rather, to work well, everyone needs to play along, we need <em>world revolution</em>; you can&#39;t play the noncompetitive in a capitalistic/nationalist world economy and still expect to stay afloat. </p>

<p>I think a lot of the issues the USSR had were related to their own form of twisted nationalism, as well as isolation of industry...</p>

<p>Although dictators can be to blame in most of the historical situations, I, In fact, I don&#39;t think there <em>is</em> such a thing as a communist &quot;nation&quot;... we won&#39;t be communists until it&#39;s a majority game...  anything else is just a form of socialism, and just as vulnerable to problems as any other system.</p>

<p>People cry out about too much government regulation and too much power being a product of communism... but their lovely capitalism obviously hasn&#39;t prevented that has it?</p>

<p>In addition, I find the meaning of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;ved=0CD4QFjAB&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThird_World&amp;amp;ei=trQGT4qiG4vZiQKwnKCbCQ&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFReV4Dl49yg8M4JSx_Ejfhv0msiw&amp;amp;sig2=BRPDyglsw7Brm-YQC960Iw">&quot;third world&quot;</a> to be quite interesting...</p>

<p>By that definition I&#39;d say we&#39;ve been involved in the Third World War for fourty years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then you went to a better school.   Others of us saw teachers use any subject to make jabs at the communists.

    <div class="md"><p>They really didn&#39;t differentiate at all, there was no distinction, morally/ethically, between nazis and communists; both were portrayed as forms of fascist socialist dictatorships, when at most, real &quot;communism&quot; is a set of socioeconomic policies, not even a form of government.</p>

<p>Communism is no more synonymous with dictatorships than democracy is with capitalism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all simply implied, perhaps even expected or presupposed.</p>

<p>It was also stressed that communists had a &quot;low median quality of life&quot;, and no private ownership or monetary inheritance.</p>

<p>Interesting set of maps here:</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t realize until my grandfather bought me a book on WWII that communists were among the first to be targeted by the nazis.</p>

<p>Capitalism wrote our textbooks, and runs our school systems.</p>

<p>Look at the facts; we don&#39;t teach kids how to <em>survive</em>, we simply teach them how to live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Institutional statism of the American Empire variety or of the Soviet variety both render their territory and their citizens into exploited and ugly entities.   The capitalist flavor is better at rampant consumerism.   Both embraced the idea of unbridled growth and the conquest of nature.   Neither is a good model for the future.    As both have imploded or are imploding,  a new way of social organization will emerge,  one with fewer idealistic features.   Nature does not stay in ecological balance through idealism.   Nature pays constant attention to what works, and thrives only when the whole is in balance.   It is not a machine of assembled parts,  but an organic whole in which all the elements have evolved together.   Advanced communication systems will help society to re-balance once the rotten head(s) collapse.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, check out this response letter from two days ago from our Alaskan state senator, Mark Begich, concerning NDAA.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Dear Mr. *******</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting me about <strong><em>counter-terrorism</em></strong> provisions in H.R. 1540, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which passed the Senate 86-13 on December 15, 2011. Let me begin by saying there has been a lot of <strong><em>misinformation in the media</em></strong> on this subject, so I appreciate your questions and the opportunity to present the facts. </p>

<p>As an advocate of <strong><em>constitutional rights</em></strong> and <strong><em>civil liberties</em></strong>, I strongly oppose the military arresting U.S. citizens on <strong><em>American soil</em></strong>. I also do not support military detention of U.S. citizens–unless they are members or supporters of <strong><em>al-Qaeda</em></strong> or the <strong><em>Taliban</em></strong>, were involved in the <strong><em>terrorist attacks</em></strong> on <strong><em>September 11, 2001</em></strong>, or have engaged in <strong><em>hostile action</em></strong> against our <strong><em>troops overseas</em></strong>. I voted in support of the bill because it will codify law which <strong><em>provides protection</em></strong> for <strong><em>civil liberties</em></strong>, does not allow for the military to arrest U.S. citizens on American soil and prohibits military custody of individuals who are not members of <strong><em>al-Qaeda</em></strong> or the <strong><em>Taliban</em></strong>. </p>

<p>The just-passed bill does not mandate indefinite military detention of U.S. citizens who have participated in an act of war. In fact, the provisions provide no new or expanded detention authority to the President. To ensure that was clear and to continue to defend citizens&#39; rights under the Constitution, I supported one of Senator Feinstein&#39;s amendments to the bill. The amendment clearly states the provisions shall not be construed to affect existing laws or authorizations relating to the detention of our citizens arrested in the United States by the civil authorities–even if they are members or supporters of <strong><em>al-Qaeda</em></strong> or the <strong><em>Taliban</em></strong>, involved in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, or who engage in hostile action against our <strong><em>troops overseas</em></strong>. </p>

<p>The bill does, however, affirm the President&#39;s existing detention authority under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40) passed by Congress in 2001. This law and subsequent U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Hamadi v. Rumsfeld authorize the President to detain any person who is deemed to be a member or supporter of al-Qaeda or the Taliban, involved in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, or has engaged in hostile action against our troops overseas. This includes the authority to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens like <strong><em>John Walker Lindh</em></strong>, who fought alongside the <strong><em>Taliban against</em></strong> U.S. troops in <strong><em>Afghanistan</em></strong>, as an <strong><em>enemy combatant</em></strong> subject to the <strong><em>law of war</em></strong>. </p>

<p>To protect citizens and non-citizens from being wrongfully held, the bill also includes a number of provisions to uphold the rights of those accused of joining the <strong><em>Taliban</em></strong> or <strong><em>al-Qaeda</em></strong>. The bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide them with an attorney and mandates <strong><em>DOD</em></strong> provide evidence of proof to a <strong><em>federal judge</em></strong> the person is a <strong><em>member</em></strong> or <strong><em>supporter</em></strong> of <strong><em>al-Qaeda</em></strong> or the <strong><em>Taliban</em></strong>, was involved in the <strong><em>terrorist attacks</em></strong> on <strong><em>September 11, 2001</em></strong>, or has engaged in <strong><em>hostile action</em></strong> against our troops. There will also be an annual review of the person&#39;s status as an <strong><em>enemy</em></strong> held under the <strong><em>law of war</em></strong>. Further, nothing in the bill undercuts <strong><em>habeas corpus rights</em></strong> of those in detention. Citizens and non-citizens will still be able to seek a federal court review of the legality of their detention. </p>

<p>I believe affirming the President&#39;s already existing authority to detain persons who would <strong><em>harm America</em></strong> through an <strong><em>act of war</em></strong> is important to <strong><em>national security.</em></strong> Thank you for your letter. I appreciate hearing your thoughts on the matter. </p>

<p>Sincerely, 
Mark Begich 
U.S. Senator</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Futher, A letter recieved on the same day from Senator Lisa Murkowski:</p>

<p>Dear Mr. and Mrs. ********; </p>

<p>Thank you for contacting me about detention provisions contained in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (H.R. 1540). I appreciate hearing from you and having the opportunity to respond. </p>

<p>America is a nation of checks and balances, and it remains so under this bill. Nothing in the bill allows any branch of the military to detain a law-abiding American citizen if you go to the local gun store or grocery store. The bill does not overturn the Posse Comitatus Act; the military will not be patrolling the streets. This bill does not take away your rights as a citizen or lawful permanent resident; the authority under this act does not take away one&#39;s habeas rights. Furthermore, the bill does not take away an individual&#39;s rights to equal protection under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and does not take away one&#39;s due process rights afforded under the 5th or 14th Amendments. If the bill did such a thing, I would, without question, oppose it. </p>

<p>On December 15, the Senate approved the National Defense Authorization Act conference report on a bipartisan vote of 86-13. The conference report includes two provisions regarding the U.S. government&#39;s detention authority that have raised many questions. 
Section 1021 of H.R. 1540 affirms that the President has permissive authority to detain &quot;covered persons,&quot; and specifies that &quot;covered persons&quot; are limited to persons &quot;who <strong><em>planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks</em></strong> that occurred on <strong><em>September 11, 2001</em></strong>, or harbored those responsible for those attacks&quot; or persons who were &quot;a part of or substantially supported <strong><em>al-Qaeda</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Taliban</em></strong>, or <strong><em>associated forces</em></strong> that are engaged in <strong><em>hostilities</em></strong> against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a <strong><em>belligerent act</em></strong> or has <strong><em>directly supported</em></strong> such <strong><em>hostilities</em></strong> in aid of such <strong><em>enemy forces</em></strong>.&quot; In addition to limiting the persons covered by this provision to those involved in the <strong><em>September 11, 2001 attacks</em></strong> and those associated with <strong><em>al-Qaeda</em></strong> or the <strong><em>Taliban</em></strong>, Section 1021 explicitly provides that nothing in this section &quot;is <strong><em>intended</em></strong> to limit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force&quot; or &quot;shall be <strong><em>construed</em></strong> to affect existing law or authorities relating to the <strong><em>detention</em></strong> of United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States.&quot; </p>

<p>Section 1022 of H.R. 1540 requires our Armed Forces to hold a person in <strong><em>military custody</em></strong> if the person is captured in the course of <strong><em>hostilities</em></strong> and is &quot;determined to be a <strong><em>member of</em></strong>, or <strong><em>part of</em></strong>, <strong><em>al-Qaeda</em></strong> or an <strong><em>associated force</em></strong> that acts in coordination with or pursuant to the direction of <strong><em>al-Qaeda</em></strong> and to have participated in the course of planning or carrying out an <strong><em>attack</em></strong> or <strong><em>attempted attack</em></strong> against the United States or its coalition partners.&quot; However, Section 1022 provides an important exception to this requirement to detain members of <strong><em>al-Qaeda</em></strong>. The President may waive the requirement by submitting a certification that the waiver is in the <strong><em>national security interest</em></strong> of the United States. In addition, the requirement to detain a member of <strong><em>al-Qaeda</em></strong> in <strong><em>military custody</em></strong> under section 1022 &quot;does not extend to citizens of the United States,&quot; or &quot;a lawful resident alien of the United States on the basis of conduct taking place within the United States, except to the extent permitted by the Constitution.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t pass fair judgement on Ron Paul, he seems like he may be a decent guy; What I can say, is that if he comes into a position of power, I don&#39;t think much will be affected, regardless of intentions.</p>

<p>Our president is a glorified military figurehead, with power to veto bills.</p>

<p>Nothing more.</p>

<p>Paid senate, bought congress, and life term supreme court justices...</p>

<p>That&#39;s where the power lies.</p>

<p>Regardless of who becomes president, overall, he will be inheriting a flawed framework; the only checks and balances going on in our government are taken care of by accountants, I&#39;m sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s why Ron Paul&#39;s track record is important in all of this he hasn&#39;t changed his message since he first started. He has fought congress tooth and nail to stop the war in Iraq, indefinite detention bill, and he also has come out and has openly talked about the CIA using drug money to fund itself. He is the only candidate that wants to restore our country to how it use to be smaller government and eliminate debt. He has called out the federal reserve for printing money and has demanded a audit. I understand people skeptic thinking especially after Obama&#39;s &quot;change&quot;, but the mainstream medias bias and unwillingly not including Ron Paul in news reports goes to show that there is big fear in him to positively change the way things are going. </p>

<p>Assuming the people find out about it, <em>that</em> might be what causes the real riots.  However, I&#39;m betting that the public won&#39;t find out about it, or the people will be painted as dangerous terrorists who need detained.  The media is good at that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realise that by posting (or supporting) this that you can now be held indefinitely in one of our prisons, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Either wake up, get up, or go back to sleep</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what the vast majority will do. There is no use in getting upset about it. There is nothing you can do about it. As long as Americans are placated / distracted, then the US government can do <em>whatever the fuck it wants</em>. They want to butcher Iranians? All they have to do is keep Americans fed and plugged into our TVs. And they (both sides) know this.</p>

<p>Its a weird type of &#39;herd immunity&#39;, where perhaps YOU get upset about it, but all they gotta do is vaccinate 80% of the herd to defeat a disease. They know this too.</p>

<p>There is an end to this, it can only end in 1 of 2 ways. If the madness runs its course unchallenged, it WILL end up wiping humanity in its current form, rather soon too. Im not talking extinct here, I am talking the top .1% <em>owning</em> us (as in slavery, real, honest to goodness slavery where you are just a piece of meat in a machine). Otherwise, if it IS challenged, it very likely will end up wiping us out, but could drag on (dragon as an analogy for complexity... sorry had to point that out) in stalemates for a loooooong time, similar to the constant bickering surrounding Israel. That will either wipe us out completely, knock us down to the iron age, or (best case?) back to slavery per option 1.</p>

<p>The answer to all of this? Attack the food supply, incurring true suffering on Americans, and (successfully) tie it to government corruption / military industrial complex corruption. Show a strong correlation between corruption / foreign relations / private wars / billion dollar jets and your kids starving and things would change <em>quick</em>. This is a known attack vector, and steps have already been taken to prevent just this. Barring that, the only other thing I can think of would be all the other countries ganging up on the US, but thats unlikely, as its easy to divide and conquer them (wikileaks showd us that), and they cant even decide on simple bullshit.</p>

<hr/>

<p>We hold these <strong><em>truths to be self-evident</em></strong>, that all men are <strong><em>created equal</em></strong>, that they are <strong><em>endowed</em></strong> by their <strong><em>Creator</em></strong> with certain <strong><em>unalienable Rights</em></strong>, that among these are <strong><em>Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness</em></strong>- That to <strong><em>secure these rights</em></strong>, Governments are <strong><em>instituted</em></strong> among Men, <strong><em>deriving</em></strong> their <strong><em>just powers</em></strong> from the <strong><em>consent</em></strong> of the governed- That <strong><em>whenever</em></strong> any Form of Government becomes <strong><em>destructive</em></strong> of those <strong><em>ends</em></strong>, it is <strong><em>Right of the People</em></strong> to <strong><em>alter</em></strong> or to <strong><em>abolish</em></strong> it, and to institute new Government, laying its <strong><em>foundation</em></strong> on such <strong><em>principles</em></strong> and <strong><em>organizing</em></strong> its <strong><em>powers</em></strong> in such form, as to <strong><em>them</em></strong> shall seem <strong><em>most likely</em></strong> to effect their <strong><em>Safety and Happiness</em></strong>. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established <strong><em>should not</em></strong> be changed for <strong><em>light and transient</em></strong> causes; and accordingly all <strong><em>experience</em></strong> hath shewn, that mankind are more <strong><em>disposed to suffer</em></strong>, while <strong><em>evils</em></strong> are <strong><em>sufferable</em></strong>, than to <strong><em>right</em></strong> themselves by <strong><em>abolishing</em></strong> the <strong><em>forms</em></strong> to which they are <strong><em>accustomed</em></strong>. But when a <strong><em>long train</em></strong> of <strong><em>abuses and usurpations</em></strong>, <strong><em>pursuing</em></strong> invariably the same <strong><em>object</em></strong> evinces a design to <strong><em>reduce them</em></strong> under <strong><em>absolute Despotism</em></strong>, it is their <strong><em>right</em></strong>, it is their <strong><em>duty</em></strong>, to <strong><em>throw off</em></strong> such <strong><em>Government</em></strong>, and to provide <strong><em>new Guards</em></strong> for their <strong><em>future security</em></strong>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Tell me again what it is you believe in, <em>American</em>? </p>

<p>Industry? </p>

<p>If you support capitalism as your master go ahead, strike; because along with your employer, that is who is hurt.</p>

<p>If you are aware of reality you will realize that a government trillions of dollars in imaginary debt doesn&#39;t truthfully concern itself with your <strong><em>industry</em></strong>, simply your <strong><em>subservience.</em></strong></p>

<p>They know we <em>have</em> to work to feed our <em>children</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you advocate rioting I hope you know that this is exactly what some authorities want, in order to <strong><em>declare</em></strong> martial law.</p>

<p>Let them <strong><em>declare</em></strong> whatever they would fucking like, perhaps it will be the first serious step; our <em>declaration</em> came first, and they are bound by it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is only true if the people don&#39;t submit.</p>

<p>The spirit of independence and self-reliance, or rugged individualism, is almost totally dead.  If the federal government declared martial law, brought in the Un troops, and shot dead everybody outside after dark, my guess is that only a very marginal number of people would object.</p>

<p>The American people have been dumbed down deliberately over the last 100 years, nursed at the teat of ignorance and propaganda, bread and circuses.

<p>Unemployment for my age group, ages 18-25, is higher than that of the great depression, at 9%.</p>

<p>Most of us have college debt... and live with our parents.</p>

<p>In all honesty, every single close friend I have lives with their parents, and nearly all of them are unemployed with college debt, which makes me question the validity of the percentages.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand <em>life</em>.</p>

<p>Old people <em>die</em>.</p>

<p>Eventually, my age group will be the old people, and we will run this.</p>

<p>As for that higher authority bit, I&#39;ll chalk that up to religion or illuminati nonsense, and let you believe whatever you may, as your inalienable human rights decree you are free to do.</p>

<p>Me saying Illuminati nonsense does not mean Illuminati is nonsense, it means you aren&#39;t speaking intelligibly, and are likely also referring to the Illuminati. </p>

<p>Just like anytime I refer to Monstanto conspiracies, I call it &quot;monsanto nonsense&quot;.</p>

<p>Not because the conspiracy lacks sense, but either the subject matter itself, such as destroying bee colonies and spreading bees of their own, or the delivery... makes no sense.</p>

<p>If you would like to make some sense of what you said, then you will need to clarify.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your attitude, but it&#39;s not that simple.  Here is some advice: know your enemy.  Read the art of war, and really ponder that.  For in knowing this information the path becomes clear.  </p>

<p>The problem with your plan is this: There are still young people in your age group getting jobs, getting knocked up, getting by.  They will be running the country, as the system makes sure it has jobs for the people it presses out in molds.  We need to awaken something deeper to win this fight, and our wepons will be unconventional as they will come from the heart and soul.  For when fighting a system that is setup to get stronger the more you fight it head on, look at a lateral attack to take it down.</p>

<p>Too bad they won&#39;t refuse rounding up and torturing/murdering brown people, people in todays military are absolute scum and hold just as much responsibility as the politicians whose orders they so obediently follow. Also just because the people you know claim they wont do it, doesnt mean that they can&#39;t find thousands who desperately would love to, just look at all the joy police get from beating OWS protestors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sukiari makes a valid distinction between <strong>JUSTIFIED USE OF FORCE</strong> and <em>rioting</em>.  Rioting is a waste of time, energy, and life.  However, being capable and willing to use force to defend oneself is a <strong>RESPONSIBILITY</strong> should be taken seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the main issue with your statement, and that ideal in general: &quot;oneself&quot;.</p>

<pre><code>First they came for the communists,
and I didn&#39;t speak out because I wasn&#39;t a communist.

Then they came for the trade unionists,
and I didn&#39;t speak out because I wasn&#39;t a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Jews,
and I didn&#39;t speak out because I wasn&#39;t a Jew.

Then they came for me
and there was no one left to speak out for me.
</code></pre>

<p>The only time Sukiari makes a real mention of force at all is in defense of his private property...</p>

<p>Like any average, blind, selfish American would do.</p>

<p>Our responsibility lies in the prospective defense of the values of our country, and prosperity of humanity as a whole. </p>

<p>Not to one or a few.</p>

<p>Besides, humans need not riot to lose lives, if history has anything to say, all we need to do is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9_zB8k_lk">gather</a>.</p>

<p>Still, I&#39;m not talking about our lives, and I&#39;m not talking about Gandhi... though rioting need not mean violence; I&#39;m talking the imminent murder of countless people overseas, the innumerable lives already lost in that vicinity, and the social uprising that should take place here to prevent it from happening again.</p>

<p>Honestly, the lives lost here during riots that we can hold them accountable for will be nothing in comparison to the number of lives that will be lost that they will exonerate themselves of in Iran.</p>

<p>Are you so desensitized to the suffering of others, to distinguish some sort of difference in value?</p>

<p>The only difference I see is the difference of who is affected, and we have had enough of an effect on them.</p>

<p>Brave men die for their own countries, noteworthy men make no distinction between borders.</p>

<p>Go back to sleep.</p>
