<p>After witnessing a massive UFO with my own eyes, I can tell you for fact they are real. Who built it is another matter entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am an amateur astronomer mate, I spend a lot of time looking at the sky. This object was 4 times larger than the moon (Edit, for clarification: if you held a ruler at arms length, the moon would measure 25mm say, and this object measured 100mm.). Also I was not the only witness to the event. Yeah I don&#39;t live in the USA, and am a long way from any large military base.
So that counts out all of your ideas (excluding the government aviation program - UFO != aliens) , on what you think I saw was, bottom line is until you witness something like I and others have, you will always be a skeptic. But please, don&#39;t try and suggest to me that what I (and others) saw was anything other than a UFO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Where did I assert that the object you saw was anything other than &#39;unidentified&#39;?</strong> The human brain is amazing at playing tricks with your senses of perception; there are often &#39;errors&#39; when the parallel processing is confused (see: McGurk effect). </p>

<p>Your location doesn&#39;t count out ANY of my explanations because satellites orbit our planet in outer space and can be visible from multiple hemispheres, and appear larger than the moon since they are closer (especially to the untrained eye looking through a telescope). Considering aircraft have no problem traversing most of this planet, excepting risky flying conditions, I don&#39;t see any reason for that to be ruled out either. We know prototype aircraft to often be unusual looking- like Cold War era &quot;saucer&quot; prototypes. They are also attempting to be groundbreaking aeronautic performers, which could explain any strange manouvres you may have noticed.</p>

<p>That said, the only one suggesting what you saw was not &quot;UNIDENTIFIED&quot; is yourself. And yes, I will always be a skeptic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Where did I say that it wasn&#39;t a government aviation program?</strong> </p>

<p>In any case: </p>

<p>You think satellites are larger than the moon? give me a break.
You think both me and my friend had the same hallucination? That&#39;s in the realm of paranormal.
I live on the other side of the planet to where NASA launches rockets, and on top of that, this object was traveling in an arc <em>parallel</em>  to the ground.</p>

<p>So yeah, i think that pretty much counts out all your ideas on what I witnessed, except for the one about is being made by humans, <strong>which was never implied by my original post.</strong> In fact quite the opposite.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where did I assert that the object you saw was anything other than &#39;unidentified&#39;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I politely <strong>asked</strong> you not to <em>suggest</em> it was anything other than a UFO, which is exactly what you did:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;I&#39;ve seen things I can&#39;t explain either, you just won&#39;t find me stating that my interpretation is fact.&quot; UFOs do exist, the only thing that remains unexplained, is where they come from, and who makes them.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;for all you know, it was a government aviation program&quot; What, a government aviation program can&#39;t be called a UFO?</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;for all you know, it was a...... NASA launch&quot; This statement <em>of yours</em> is not suggesting it was something other than a UFO?</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;for all you know, it was a......construct of your mind&quot; or this?</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;for all you know, it was a......a satellite...&quot; or this? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>For all <em>you know,</em> I am a fucking alien from another planet, your statements are pretentious and rude. It never ceases to amaze me that so many people out there think they know better than the one who experienced the event, better than that person. Such arrogance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That said, the only one suggesting what you saw was not &quot;UNIDENTIFIED&quot; is yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m afraid I never suggest it wasn&#39;t &quot;UNIDENTIFIED&quot;, but as shown above you did 3 times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and appear larger than the moon since they are closer (especially to the untrained eye looking through a telescope)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where does it say I was looking through the telescope, I feel like you are deliberately twisting my words, as obviously i didn&#39;t mean the object was &quot;physically&quot; 4 times the size of the fucking moon, that would make it <strong>the size of earth!!</strong>. I meant, that if you held a ruler at arms length, the moon would measure 25mm say, and this object measured 100mm. You calling me an untrained eye? Someone who has spent thousands of hours looking at the stars, someone who you have no idea, whether I&#39;m untrained or not? Tell me, what is it you would consider &quot;trained&quot; in your opinion? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve identified 20 satellites in one night in a period of 4 hrs viewing the the night sky with the naked eye sir. For you to try and <strong>suggest</strong> to me, that the UFO I saw, was a satellite is not only offensive, its conceited. </p>

<p>Ive been viewing the night sky for 20 years, Spent more time looking up to the stars than most people have spent watching TV. I am far from an untrained eye.  I also live far from populated areas, I see the night sky much more clearly than city dwellers, town dwellers or even village dwellers. The main reason for this is because my main hobby is <em>amateur astronomy.</em> I am hardly - as you put it - &quot;an untrained eye.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me that opportunists from all over the world took advantage of the destabilization; even Woodrow Wilson saw himself being manipulated after the first World War. These opportunists continually tried to make themselves an inherent part of the international system; they have a very firm hold on their power right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wilson got manipulated HARD by the Zionist political movement. They got control of the Federal Reserve and brought the USA into WW I via the Balfour Declaration of 1917. </p>

<p>Zionists powerbrokers such as Bernard Baruch, Louis Brandeis, Paul Warburg (father of the US Federal Reserve), Jacob Schiff, and others immediately went to work to put the screws to President Woodrow Wilson. Overnight the Zionist influenced press transformed the German Kaiser and his people into bloodthirsty “Huns”, determined to destroy western civilization. In 1916, the US, with the help of the previous year’s Lusitania “incident”, entered the war on Britain&#39;s side under the ridiculous pretext of “making the world safe for democracy”.</p>

<p>“Beat Back the Hun!” declared Fred Strothman’s famous propaganda poster, - a slogan which became a rallying cry of “patriotic” Americans. Woodrow Wilson was caught up in a sinister force beyond his control - a force which he himself described years earlier in his 1913 book “The New Freedom”, in which Wilson wrote these intriguing words:</p>

<p>&quot;Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men&#39;s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the U. S., in the field of commerce and manufacturing, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great Wilson quote, and he has a few interesting ones concerning the powers that influenced his role as a President. Do you know if he details any outsider influence on his attempt to create the League of Nations? I know the isolationist temperament blocked the attempt to create the progenitor of the EU; but considering the way the EU/NATO is manipulated these days, the LoN could probably have been subverted just as easily. </p>

<p>I notice the same unfounded nationalism is very present in this age as well.</p>

<p>After witnessing a massive UFO with my own eyes, I can tell you for fact they are real. Who built it is another matter entirely.</p>

<p>One thing I know though, is when disclosure finally comes about, and the powers that be say we are being visited by an alien race, and that race just happens to look just like us, <em>that&#39;s</em> when we will know we are being duped. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Where did I assert that the object you saw was anything other than &#39;unidentified&#39;?</strong> The human brain is amazing at playing tricks with your senses of perception; there are often &#39;errors&#39; when the parallel processing is confused (see: McGurk effect). </p>

<p>Your location doesn&#39;t count out ANY of my explanations because satellites orbit our planet in outer space and can be visible from multiple hemispheres, and appear larger than the moon since they are closer (especially to the untrained eye looking through a telescope). Considering aircraft have no problem traversing most of this planet, excepting risky flying conditions, I don&#39;t see any reason for that to be ruled out either. We know prototype aircraft to often be unusual looking- like Cold War era &quot;saucer&quot; prototypes. They are also attempting to be groundbreaking aeronautic performers, which could explain any strange manouvres you may have noticed.</p>

<p>That said, the only one suggesting what you saw was not &quot;UNIDENTIFIED&quot; is yourself. And yes, I will always be a skeptic.</p>
