       I like to get all sources of information so I'm not one-sided, but one thing that bothers me is all of this talk of ZOMG ZIONISTS! and JEWS RUN THE WORLD!!
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time I've seen talk like this outside of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has been on white supremacy sites. I'm not accusing
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       of this, but it's a little unsettling to say the least. I'm not a huge fan of pointing to a people group and blaming them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I have some Israeli heritage (please don't ban me), so it just feels a little awkward.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to know more about what you guys are talking about and why it's such a huge deal.

       It would be silly to try to deny that Israel has an enormous influence on US policy, and therefore world events and we shouldn't be embarrassed about saying things which we perceive to be true. I've no doubt some of these posts are motivated by silly racial ideas, but I don't think you have to worry too much about this subreddit. Anything patently silly or hateful gets downvoted quite harshly. But always feel free to report a post to the mods if you think it's hateful or racist in nature, rather than being a source of information.

       This is a question we must ask ourselves. Why do we support Israel? All evidence shows that as a nation, they are not very friendly to us and regard us as their rich, brutish big brother who will beat up anyone who picks on them. World  military policy is pretty much guided by this principle anymore, like it or not. Those who see the truth get smeared as racists while the attackers think they are so superior for their "tolerant" media sanctioned beliefs. Real tolerance is love and empathy, and most people have none anymore. In this case, ignorance really is bliss apparently , because i have been a pretty angry person since i discovered all of this. We wouldn't ban you for this. We are all about free speech, and i for one love and welcome everyone of any nation or race to join us.

       I know what you mean about the anger. It isn't antisemitism, it is outrage that the truth has been so outrageously abused and hidden for so long. Once you realize certain realities -- that wealthy Zionist Jews own the Congress, and control the media, for example -- you can't feel anything other than outrage, that this shit has been going on for so long with almost nobody having the guts to say anything about it.

       I've been studying pretty much everything available on the internet ever since 911.  I went though some of those types of sites that you are talking about, read what they have to say, and realized that something was not quite right with what they were saying.  It was almost like such groups were somehow intentionally encouraged/created by CIA or some such organizations in order to create the specter of evil that justifies governmental laws, etc.  Now, the whole Christian/Jew conflict issue can be seen in the mainstream news - Mel Gibson.  Many actresses and actors have casually mentioned, on occasion, how prominent Jewish heritage is in Hollywood decision making positions.  Many Jewish actors have mentioned this, also - often in a comedy setting.  Now, as for what other people may have been talking about here on this conspiracy forum, I haven't seen any of that.  I'm just starting to browse here starting today given my unique knowledge of some secret technology per my other post here.

       Look, people know the statistics... it's no secret.  It's how people say it that matters.  I'd recommend a short read here:  culturaltuning.org.  It puts the big pieces together pretty well and has some fascinating insight into why the world is as it is today.

       This is simply not true. If we gathered every longtime lurker and commentator of r/conspiracy and had them vote on this comment, I am sure it would be highly negative. The only reason this comment is barely positive is because of the ADL trolls that come into this subreddit and promote simple horseshit like this....

       9/11 made me aware of Zionism, but it took me from 2001 to 2008 to make the connection. Now it is changed my view of everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is huge deal when you see Zionist manipulations of media leading US into endless wars and financial ruin. White supremacy is a term  created by Jews who are hostile to white gentile interests and unity in any form.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        I'm not a huge fan of pointing to a people group and blaming them.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       That seems to be a Jewish Zionist specialty. Germans, Nazis, Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims, Islam, Iranians, and white patriots in the USA. Any group that goes against Jewish Zionist agendas gets demonized in the Jewish dominated media.
      </p>
      <p>
       So tell me why was Zionism even necessary in the first place?

       I don't doubt it is unsettling for you to hear criticism of Zionism, since the mainstream media in America never touches the subject. Ever. Once a blue moon they will say something tepid about Israel, such as, "Gee, it's a shame Israel wouldn't try harder to make peace with those evil Muslim terrorists who surround them on all sides and bombard them with rockets." But that's about as critical as CNN or NBC or FOX ever gets. So when you come here and read genuine criticism, on topics that never get any press at all in the corporate media (such as Israel's deliberate attack on USS Liberty) it must feel "a little unsettling" and "a little awkward" as you put it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have in this subreddit, and it's a very rare thing, is a group of people willing to talk about Jewish issues and Zionism in critical terms. You should be grateful for the chance to hear the other side of so many Jewish issues -- the side that is suppressed and mocked and ridiculed in the big-money media. Be thankful that the Internet is still free enough that you can hear such views.

       I would invite you to research the origin of neoconservatism and the names involved, i.e. Wolfowitz, Perle, Kagan, Himmelfarb, and the Kristols. Add to this research the stated goals of the Project for the New American Century as well as the people involved. Add to this the influence of AIPAC on Congress by reading The Israel Lobby by Mearsheimer and Walt, in addition to reviewing the games that are played in Congress and campaign financing. Review the history of the Rothschild Family as well, just so you can know the historical basis for this political behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all of this, ask yourself if there is an agenda involved in U.S. Foreign Policy, and if that agenda is coordinated by a consortium of influential people who conspicuously find themselves in finance, politics and media. If your answer is "yes" to this question, that is known as a conspiracy.

       Zionism = belief that GOD "made" Jews to rule the world and control the "Holy Land".   Well, America is not supposed to fight in holy wars.   Support of Israel, is picking a side in a holy war.   That’s enough for me. - but throw in the Jewish control of our government, banking system, mass media and education system  and you have a cult controlling our supposedly free nation.  As far as I'm concerned Israel and the Jewish religion is the by far the biggest threat to American national security.

      <p>
       Thirdly they are war mongers with nuclear bombs and anti proliferation treaty.

       Dig a little deeper. The most distinguishing feature of early Bolshevism was its ethnic construction (Read Winson Churchill or Hitler who were poles apart on other european/eastern affairs but in agreement on this point). Lenin and Stalin may have been exceptions as the public faces of the party. However, Kaganovich as the guy responsible for the Ukranian famines/genocide however was certainly representative. You are correct that leading up to the second world war, Stalin managed to check a lot of the orginal character of Bolshevism - but how this transition came about is not very well documented or understood.

       So his last name sounds a bit like "Jew" in English, what does that mean? "Jew" in Georgian sounds more like "zid", so it makes no sense that he would be Jewish based on this alone. And Lenin's grandfather

       The 2 zionist killed in peacetime more people though, and that should be a crime punishable by prison if you deny that fact, I heard the zionists set a great precedent against free speech.

       The Holocaust is a very special case, and there's really nothing else like the Holocaust "denial" laws that exist in parts of Europe. The closest thing I can think of that approaches them is the prohibition against criticizing the King of Nepal or the King of Thailand. The laws against Holocaust "denial" are a kind of religious taboo of the type that used to exist in ancient Greece against any disclosure of the secrets of the Mystery traditions. In reality, there are no "deniers" (the term is meaningless) but only people critical of the Holocaust dogma, who dispute certain specific points of history. It should be an accepted practice of scholars to debate those aspects of the Second World War that have been loosely grouped under the umbrella term "holocaust" but instead, you go to prison for mentioning them.

       Russian textbooks acknoweldge that the political class of the soviet Union was dominated by Jews. Even Yuri Slezkine, an Israeli historian, readily acknowledges that Jews dominated the secret police, the NKVD, KGD, Nomenklatura, and the cheka.It's more or less an open secret that the USSR was dominated by Jews. It may not be widely publicized in our Jewish dominated publishing and media outlets; but, it is well documented.

Once you realize certain realities -- that wealthy Zionist Jews own the Congress, and control the media, for example -- you can't feel anything other than outrage, that this shit has been going on for so long with almost nobody having the guts to say anything about it.

       Look, people know the statistics... it's no secret.  It's how people say it that matters.  I'd recommend a short read here:  culturaltuning.org.  It puts the big pieces together pretty well and has some fascinating insight into why the world is as it is today.
