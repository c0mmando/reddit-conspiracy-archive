       As an occasional r/conspiracy reader I find the majority of the links that show up on my homepage are from IAmJulianAssange. In checking the homepage, a majority of links are submitted by him. Don't know much about him. Is he well known? Just a guy? What are your thoughts on having so much content submitted by a single person, in a
       <em>
        conspiracy
       </em>
       forum?

       I hope that doesn't happen, with all my heart, because I love Sweden. But it has happened before when the government helped CIA smuggle out people to Egypt who most likely got tortured there.

       No one knows what kind of conditions he would face. You assume we WILL hold him. He is not accused of any crime. The media bobble-heads have called for his assassination and most people think he should be punished in some way for something. Due PROCESS (you know the whole legal thing: probable cause, grand jury, warrant, arraignment, bail, trail by jury, sentencing) has been abandoned. Now we just imprison people indefinitely or kill 'em. Why? Because "the government" says they are a threat to "national security". The problem is not a guy with a website with news you can't get on TV. The problem is our legal system has degenerated into show trials. BTW if you every have to go to court you will find it unlike every TV show you have ever seen.

       This is a global issue. We are in a great depression. It is cyclical. Few of us understand what is happening fewer know how to cope. For some it becomes catastrophic very quickly; (loss of job, loss of home); for others an annoyance (higher prices). The changes in our lives and in our understanding of the world and how it works will be dramatic. Already, most people can look back just a few short years and wonder what happened. I think that will be the continuing (worsening) trend until we are forced by exhaustion to give up "the dream" because it has become a nightmare. IMO we will continue to spiral downwards until we end the endless war on everyone. How far down we go and what that place looks like (not Mad Max) depends upon the collective consciousness. Our culture idealizes the individual and this problem requires, cooperation, community and consensus.

       I think Z1 was great. I use it to inform people that their religious beliefs are cultural indoctrination that prevents them from understanding what is happening in around and to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Z2 was very good for its depiction of the technological  future as a good place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't seen a Z3 but I hope it is about how we get from here to there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand the desire to be part of a group of like minded positive people (like reddit) but the Z "movement"
seems a little contrived (like the "tea party").

       I do read it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I submit to this subreddit not only what is consistent with my personal views but ideas that cause me to think about other peoples opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes I post items that are in opposition to my views 180°. For example, I posted about the WBC because they thrive on publicity not on what they believe. Posting what they believe defeats them. I also post the agenda of the EU because I think it serves as a shocking example of how far out of control things have already gotten.

       I think he tried to monetize his operation and make himself a multi-millionaire like the face-book kid. When he was a hacker he was just a kid getting past security without getting caught. With his co-operation, the media invented the outlaw. He is not a radical (see Abby Hoffman). He is a celebrity and an icon of free information. He is not even Alex Jones.

       I'm going to be the outlier and say that, while his posts are generally good, his emergent monopoly on this subreddit's content is worrying.
      </p>
      <p>
       To quote kr3at:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        if his material wasn't good, his karma would be down and his stuff wouldn't be on the home page! Keep up the good work!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's one very crucial "if" missing from this list: "if
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       isn't being gamed by external entities". If it is being gamed, it doesn't matter if his material is good, or how many real people think it's bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       This exclusion, in conjunction with the tone of all the other comments here, makes me wonder if kr3at and IAJA (among others) are agents of COINTELPRO. Here, we see evidence of a potential attempt to artificially improve IAJA's standing in this subreddit which, if successful, will make it far easier to discredit posts that go against things posted by IAJA. As this subreddit is largely not visibly moderated, and the reddit community in general is acidic towards abuse of moderator power, this is likely the closest COINTELPRO could get to
       <a href="http://theinfounderground.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;amp;t=4198">
        gaining full control
       </a>
       of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, not saying that I've concluded anything. I still default to thinking IAJA is a force for good. It's just that we already have one state-approved counterculture mouthpiece in Alex Jones, and one false-flag honeypot is enough.

       This is a very good question. Many, many people put there HOPE and faith and trust in Obama to CHANGE things. It didn't work out. For several reasons I can think of: 1) looking in the window at the banquet is very different from sitting at the table; 2) nobody uses 4 wheel-drive unless they have to; 3) he is just another politician.

       I am not a person who believes in an end time or apocalypse or Mad Max scenario. I'm thinking huge tent cities (or FEMA camps) squalid cities like the ghettos of the 50's and 60's. Many people are already there. It is difficult to live in the corporate world by day and in your car at night. For those people, food clothing and shelter is all they have time to think about. Luckily that is not my situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is prudent to down-scale to a low profile and small foot-print so that we can live well within our means (spend less than you earn) so that we are not in Disneyland McMansion today and "grapes of wrath" destitution tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each of us is known to our friends and family. That is where true leadership abides. We lead by example. We effect change by being honest about our concerns and our understanding of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The greatest fear of the tiny minority in control is mass awakening (Arab Spring, Wisconsin). The leaderless revolution cannot be stopped: ""There is one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that is an idea whose time as come."

       I started posting when Julian Assange was being targeted for assassination. I took the ID IamJulianAssange based on the idea that we all had to stand up to prevent him from being killed. This was my main inspiration:
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8h_v_our_Q">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8h_v_our_Q
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not pretending to be JA. I always tell people I am not THE Julian Assange except to the extent we all are, using a phrase from an old Beatles song (I am the walrus): "I am he as you are me".
      </p>
      <p>
       It just so happens I do not like Julian Assange so I would never pretend to be him. However, he is the icon of free information. What credit does he have? He was arrested as a youth for getting past security. He (and his companions) created a website that is more show than substance. He is not diminished by my using this id and I am not enhanced.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attention I am now getting is in one post about my posting. If you can figure a way to monetize this attention please give it a try.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not use any RSS feeds. I have three bookmarks in my browser bookmark bar. It is no trouble at all to share with people the information I find. Having been a kindergarten teacher I take your comment about being childlike as an inadvertent compliment of the highest order. Thank you for noticing.

       I don't know anything about guy fawkes, neither do you and neither do most people. NOW everyone knows JA and maybe you think that works in my favor somehow. My prolific POSTING is what is getting me attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not have a mission to enlighten people. My only agenda is to "cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Make mad the guilty, and appall the free,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
The very faculties of eyes and ears".
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize now I am doing just that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not promoting a person or group. I picked what I thought was a weak and vulnerable person who was being targeted for assassination. He has since become a celebrity and an icon of free information worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not say or suggest that teaching kindergarten was intelligent. I said very clearly that your attempt to insult me by calling me childlike was a compliment of the highest order based on what I know first hand about children.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not fighting or even arguing. I am not trying to figure out what I believe or stand for. I am posting links. I believe the reason this annoys you is I am not posting links to things you are interested in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know you. I do not recall ever receiving a message from you. I answer all messages. I usually do not comment except to post Excellent. or Excellent!
      </p>
      <p>
       I still don't know what question you have or had.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not know if i am a man.
You do not know who I am or what I think or what I believe. You would never recognize me in public or discover me in conversation.

      <p>
       You have no respect for the imaginary person you have in your head.

       One more thing. If you commute to work every day for many years, at the same time, on the same conveyance (bus or train), with the same people does that make you a community? NO. A community is people who contribute to the welfare of others based on the knowledge, belief or expectation of similar treatment for themselves should they need it. You have to decide if r/conspiracy is a community and whether or not you want to belong to it. I decided it was not a community and began to flood this place with posts to get people THINKING &amp; INTERACTING.

       Nothing you can mention?
And I am sure your real name is Psychoban.

       Y U STUPID? I have told you three times how I picked the name. Why do you insist you know how I picked it when that is of course impossible.

       My posts usually get 1 or 2 upvotes. Some get a lot more. But very few. I never know which ones are going to be popular and I am usually surprised. I have to post a lot to get lucky.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't upvote because of the name. They read something they want others to see and they upvote to keep it from disappearing. As a matter of fact there are people who automatically downvote whatever I post so the name thing works both ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have been trying to jrritate me with your insults and name calling. Which means that YOU ARE A VICTIM OF MY CONSPIRACY: to ":Make mad the guilty, and...Confound the ignorant".

       BTW "everybody knows the war is over, everybody knows the good guys lost". What "good fight" are you talking about?

       I AN NOT PRETENDING TO BE SOMEONE IMPORTANT (i have already accomplished that mission - without pretending). I am posting under an Iconic name like batman or superman because at the time I started posting it was important to raise awareness of the plight of JA. Nobody mistakes me for the real JA. Whenever anyone asks I tell them I am not.

       I do not doubt you are in politics because you want to fight and argue and win but you have no stated goals. You resort to name calling and insult so you can feel superior. BTW let me show you how that is done in America:

       Stfu - what are you 12?
I don't care who posts what here and I make my own decisions regarding my opinions. I do notice the user name on a lot of links here but the story's do present differing agendas so I don't see the problem. 
Now if you are jealous that he gets more upvotes, you are preoccupied 
with something that really doesn't matter. 
It's a good thing your respect for IamJulianAssange doesn't have to be so tight.

       In what way is your user name any better?
Everyone posts under a name that is different from their real 
name - I don't pay much attention to the user name unless someone 
points it out. 
Don't let the user name bother you - my user name describes doodoo.

       I'm shocked by the stupidity in r/conspiracy. It used to have good information about lesser known subjects but now it has descended into the "Ancient aliens" and "Lizard people" standard of conspiracies.I'm unsubscribed from r/conspiracy now because it's gone to crap. Good luck Iamjulianassange with your spamming mission I don't know how you are not shamed as a spammer with the dirt you submit.

       I never have posted about ancient aliens or lizard people. I ONCE posted a portion of a David Ike presentation. Are you trying to suggest that I believe that HARRP CAUSED THE JAPANESE EARTHQUAKE by putting it in all caps? I do not believe that. I know many people do. I have posted about HARRP and what people believe it can do. I believe that the confluence of tectonic plates is what causes earthquakes.

       He's legit from what I've noticed since subscribing. His links never seem to be biased towards one specific source, he's willing to discuss with critics about controversial posts, and overall he seems to be open to answering questions in general. I've sent him a message recently about something I wanted clarified and he explained it politely and quite quickly from when I sent my message.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm sure even he/she can agree when I say
       <strong>
        nobody
       </strong>
       should be exempt from criticism at all times.

       Well he only has 16 of 48 comments on this post, but I suppose one must sleep some time.

       I think It would be good if he posted to other subreddits to , he may get his message out to those who ignore r/conspiracy and it's possible he may make it to the front page more often.

       Ive had a bunch of questions for IMJA that ive been thinking about for a while now, but i respect your wishes to remain anonymous. Thus ive skipped some of the ones ive had in mind but would love it if you could answer some others! How much of every day do you spend collecting/ posting links? Do you just post links to conspiracies you agree with or links to conspiracies in general? Finally what is your preferred method for finding new information (RSS, browsing etc)? I like the vast majority of your links and so from another skeptical mind i would also like to take the opportunity to say thank you!

       I am a caregiver. I am on duty 24/7. Much of that time is waiting for something to happen. Sometimes I sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have three sources I trust (websites that post news). If an article is about another article, I go to the original unless it has already been posted. I rarely "google" unless I am looking for exact quotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every once in a while someone will send me a message with a link to a story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I submit to this subreddit not only what is consistent with my personal views but ideas that cause me to think about other peoples opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes I post items that are in opposition to my views 180°. For example, I posted about the WBC because they thrive on publicity not on what they believe. Posting what they believe defeats them. I also post the agenda of the EU because I think it serves as a shocking example of how far out of control things have already gotten.

       In the spirit of this subreddit, I'm going to suggest that he is in fact doing a great coverup job of the bigger truths by feeding us smaller, less-relevant conspiracies.

       Since you said you a basically doing an AMA: Do you believe everything you post? I think Bandito2010 had a good question..." How do we change things, how do we lead, if we can't be known? Or are you past the point of wanting to change things, and think survival a more realistic goal?"

       I submit to this subreddit not only what is consistent with my personal views but ideas that cause me to think about other peoples opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes I post items that are in opposition to my views 180°. For example, I posted about the WBC because they thrive on publicity not on what they believe. Posting what they believe defeats them. I also post the agenda of the EU because I think it serves as a shocking example of how far out of control things have already gotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each of us is known to our friends and family. That is where true leadership abides. We lead by example. We effect change by being honest about our concerns and our understanding of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The greatest fear of the tiny minority in control is mass awakening (Arab Spring, Wisconsin). The leaderless revolution cannot be stopped: ""There is one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that is an idea whose time as come."

       How am I bitching? Lol. I pointed it out and asked for thoughts on it. I appreciate it lol, I just think it's funny and ironic that in a conspiracy forum, one user provides the majority of content. L2READ or stop the bitchy comments. Take your pick.

       Bit ironic though, can't say it is not. How can we trust what the government says...goes and believes everything one person post.
