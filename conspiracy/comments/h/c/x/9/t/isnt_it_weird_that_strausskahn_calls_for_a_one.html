    <div class="md"><p>Pick your sides people.  Either shadowy banker elites (IMF) control the world, or powerful governments like the US does (no shit).  I was thinking, that the head of the IMF getting arrested would calm down conspiracy theorist, but apparently he&#39;s a poor victim now.  Never win.  Maybe, just maybe, he&#39;s simply always been a douche and because he was the head of the IMF, he figured he can get away with this shit.  Not so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more I think about it, the less I believe that Kahn would be stupid enough to rape the help. The story has too many holes. </p>

<p>Kahn sounds like he was caught in a honey trap, but not for the reason indicated above. </p>

<p>Apparently Kahn had been influenced by Joseph Stiglitz&#39;s criticisms of the IMF and was indicating that he would be steering the organisation along a fairer path for the developing world. This of course would have upset the Western banking system and corporate oligarchy which is very fond of ass raping countries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t equate it to his call for one world currency. This smacks more of his potential to unseat Sarkozy. The French papers had huge headlines that said &quot;Le Perv&quot; across them, before it was confirmed. They have no sense of the word alleged. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the NWO types can find another puppet to call for a one world currency again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stories in France say Sarkozy framed him. If the presidential elections had  to happen last week, DSK would have been elected as French president - or at least that&#39;s what the survey shows. So he was not only the head of the IMF, but also the president to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what actually happened in the hotel room because I was not there. My gut reaction is that it is Sarkozy/the Americans trying to prevent him from taking power. However, one interesting question remains:</p>

<p>Why was he in New York to begin with?</p>
