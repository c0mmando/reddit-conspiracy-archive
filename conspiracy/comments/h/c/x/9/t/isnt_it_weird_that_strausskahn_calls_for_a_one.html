       Glad you edited when Strauss Kahn called for the new currency. I don't see this as being a reason to frame him. One of the supposed goals of the NWO is to implement a one world electronic currency.

       The one world currency is here, it's called bitcoin but they don't control it. The arrest is just symbolic of the house of cards coming crashing down. Expect more to follow...

       Wait, I thought a one-world-currency was supposed to be evil. So even if he was actually arrested the day after he proposed the idea, wouldn't that be a good thing? Wouldn't the supposed "powers that be" NOT want to arrest him for doing that? I don't get it...

       there are more than one faction, country, or power you all try to group into an "" us v.s them"  scenario.  if in fact there were an omnipotent power base we wouldn't be guessing who to bow to. this is a power play, he was set-up.

       Pick your sides people.  Either shadowy banker elites (IMF) control the world, or powerful governments like the US does (no shit).  I was thinking, that the head of the IMF getting arrested would calm down conspiracy theorist, but apparently he's a poor victim now.  Never win.  Maybe, just maybe, he's simply always been a douche and because he was the head of the IMF, he figured he can get away with this shit.  Not so.

       There is no honor among the truly greedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weakness that is inherent in the super greedy is that they trust no-one and can trust no one.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would, each and every one, sell out the other  greedy bastards the moment real trouble reaches them or whenever they see an opportunity to score.

       This is a power play by somebody as greedy as the head of the IMF.

       The more I think about it, the less I believe that Kahn would be stupid enough to rape the help. The story has too many holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kahn sounds like he was caught in a honey trap, but not for the reason indicated above.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently Kahn had been influenced by Joseph Stiglitz's criticisms of the IMF and was indicating that he would be steering the organisation along a fairer path for the developing world. This of course would have upset the Western banking system and corporate oligarchy which is very fond of ass raping countries.

       I wouldn't equate it to his call for one world currency. This smacks more of his potential to unseat Sarkozy. The French papers had huge headlines that said "Le Perv" across them, before it was confirmed. They have no sense of the word alleged.
      </p>

       I'm sure the NWO types can find another puppet to call for a one world currency again.

       The stories in France say Sarkozy framed him. If the presidential elections had  to happen last week, DSK would have been elected as French president - or at least that's what the survey shows. So he was not only the head of the IMF, but also the president to be.

       I don't know what actually happened in the hotel room because I was not there. My gut reaction is that it is Sarkozy/the Americans trying to prevent him from taking power. However, one interesting question remains:

      <p>
       Why was he in New York to begin with?
