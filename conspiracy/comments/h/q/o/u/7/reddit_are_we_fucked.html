       So much shit happening across the world. Massive corruption, corporations controlling governments, suppressing whistleblowers, massive uprisings, thousands of people being killed, our rights being stripped from us, our privacy gone, diseases that are popping up and killing people, world economies collapsing, etc. etc.

       Do you think we're screwed? I sure hope this world doesn't get any worse but it looks like it might.

       I'm sitting here waiting for the May '11 jobs report to be released in t-minus 27 minutes.  If it is low as everyone has predicted, today will be another rough day in the markets. This is all going to lead up to the end of QE2....that is going to be the real litmus test for the US to see if can actually survive without more stimulus (protip: we can't)

       The fall of the dollar will be the catalyst for everything else to collapse and war to ignite around the world.  I think personally if you end the fed, you stop the elite dead in their tracks.

       For one thing, ending the Fed would prevent America's biggest banks from further inflating the dollar so that the industrial-political alliance can pay for more wars (Pakistan anyone?  Syria?  Yemen?).

       update; NFP at +54k for the month of May, below consensus of +165K. Dow is currently -140 and the 10yr is at 2.96% (the bond market is so detached from reality it hurts my brain).  And to the people that say the end of QE2 is priced in, to them I

       yes, we are.  Eventually, you won't be able to get a computer that isn't a touch screen version and a car that isn't being tracked by the Govt.   People are going to begin to hate technology.   There will be a movement against Tech but it will be too late.  You know how it always works.  American people never do anything until it gets bad.  They are reactive instead of proactive.

       Its not absolutely a bad idea but for the majority case it will have a negative influence.  I have a computer science degree and I am always striving to utilize the most powerful, secure and free software and hardware.  Soon enough we will be able to print our own circuits and then there will be a movement for open source hardware to complement the open source software.  Already we are close to having open source firmware for all  computers through the Coreboot project.  Today I can run all open source software using state of the art security and privacy systems and browse anonymously with networks like tor.  Bitcoin is introducing some new currency constructs that will surely evolve over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the way that I look at it if you have a hammer you can choose to be slave or an independent contractor.  Most people will be slaves, probably forever.  You can't stop the tools from evolving.

       well, think about it.  If everything is touch screen, you'll be paying out the ass for everything.  Right now, I can watch movies for free.  I can read newspaper for free and the reason is because people are able to make programs and software.  There is an open-source community.  If you are unable to make software independently without microsoft or apple's approval, you'll have to pay to read the newspaper, watch movies, or do anything online.  Everything will be subscription based.  It'll be like, "hey, have you paid your $5 yahoo subscription?"    Touch screen = closed source operating systems.  Things that are closed like that are unable to have independent-free software created for them.

       That is the most retarded thing I've ever had someone say to me. We're not talking about Apple, dude. We're talking about a
       <strong>
        touchscreen interface
       </strong>
       , like the ones found on android, windows, and apple devices. All fast food restaurants use touchscreen POS (point of sale) computers. You do realize iDevices can be hacked, right?

       Your points aren't relevant at all.  How are you going to hack an ipad without a computer with a compiler and a keyboard?   I just told you that all computers in the future will be touch screen so tell me, genius, where are you going to get the computer to hack this device if there are no computers with compilers?   You won't have access to those things dumbass. That was my point completely.

       Can you buy an intaglio printing press?  No, it cost a million dollars.  In the same way, computers that are capable of doing the things we do now like programming and stuff, we'll not be available to the general public.  They will either be too expensive or they will just be unavailable to most regular people.

       Are you being serious or trolling me? First of all security and information have very little to do with the interface. Second, why are you following me around posting asinine statements? You have a comprehension problem. I'm talking about how little touchscreens have nothing to do with the end of society.

       The British Empire (which I believe is the one in question here) never really fell. After WWII, Britain simply "gave" autonomy to its colonies, as compared to France, who were engaged in a number of costly wars around the globe. The "empire" did not fall, it simply became a commonwealth, with the Queen still the head of state in all of the former colonies.

       The American fervor to break free was (sadly) due to religious concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       There needs to be a paradigm shift in the way Americans think about America and it's role in the world. Unfortunately, Americans are far too used to taking their social cues from the media (being a nation of immigrants with no cohesive tribal identity) and the media isn't going to inspire any serious rebellion against he power structure - it's a conflict of it's interests to have an informed, militant public.

        The American fervor to break free was (sadly) due to religious concerns.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Religious freedoms were but 1 of the reasons albeit a big one. Taxation without representation was
       <em>
        THE
       </em>
       main reason and another lesser known reason was to escape the corrupt banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The refusal of King George to allow the colonies to operate an honest money system, which freed the ordinary man from clutches of the money manipulators was probably the prime cause of the revolution."
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been quoted from Franklin but likely not written by him rather quoted him as saying, perhaps for a biography.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it wasnt the tax that sent them over the edge. It was the refusal of being allowed to print/use their own money and King George imposing british money on the colonies.

        There needs to be a paradigm shift in the way Americans think about America and it's role in the world. Unfortunately, Americans are far too used to taking their social cues from the media (being a nation of immigrants with no cohesive tribal identity) and the media isn't going to inspire any serious rebellion against he power structure - it's a conflict of it's interests to have an informed, militant public.
Hence the phrase:
The revolution will not be televised.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This, unfortunately, is all true. We need a new George Washington or Ben Franklin.

       I demoed a attack banana this year. I never had it wash out because hitting small tables (that time in mid-jan when there was no snow for a few weeks) but that magna traction is the shit. I had a hard time grabbing an edge on any spin where my old deck would have put me in the hospital. It did get noodely at a higher speed and felt more unstable then the HP board I've got and its 5 years old.

       agreed with everything you just said.  i teach in vermont, where our water systems are in the public trust.  i'm worrying about the day when whomever is at the top will sell out for their own personal gain, and give up our water to whichever corporation pays up.  this is just one small example on how the boat is sinking, and anyone will do anything to get their slice of the pie, and jump overboard in their own little lifeboat to get to their island of comfort while we all crash, burn, and then drown amongst the debris.  i have my students all write take home essays on this site:

       The're trying to break us. They want the collective mind in a atate of fear so it won't think rationally. Our old enemy (Vatican and Royals) believe they can take care of us once and for all and are taking their chance. But its also our chance. To be the generation who takes care of them once and for all. This is our chance to change the world forever. When it takes off, enjoy the experience, knowing that the whole universe is watching us wishing they could be us. Praying we make it. Just one more round with these cunts and its over, and our children are free, free'r than we can imagine. To be honest I can't wait. We're about to see a Global Revolution. All uploaded on YouTube, the death of the New World Order will be tweeted, minute by minute, blow by blow. Just promise me RedCons, when we're victorious, we'll legalize it?

       The hippies saw war and environmental destruction bring our end.

      <p>
       The anti-globalization protestors saw the 90's as devestating.

       This is just another phase where 'extreme measures' by the government will be imposed on us, our taxes will go up, our freedoms will be stripped away, and next decade there will be another threat (most likely food, water or oil) that will mean a further impedement on our lives.

       Technology is getting to the stage where a world government would maintain control.  There is nothing you can do about it, this has been in motion too long.  The protests in Greece and Spain won't achieve anything except to worry politicians. Armies and the Police now have the technology and maneuverability to manage such situations.

       It's beginning to feel like, why bother? I know you're gonna say that that's the problem. But life is short, man. Keeping up with all that's going on just brings down my quality of life. Spreading the word feels pointless, people have already made up their minds. I have so many problems of my own and a family to care for. What am I supposed to do with all the intonation I know? The more I learn about the way things work, the more I realize I know so fucking little. What am I supposed to do? I hold two jobs, work 60+ hrs a week, am in massive student loan debt, have to provide for my parents, live with them cause I have no other choice, can't afford health insurance, etc. What the fuck can I really do? Everything seems so twisted and ugly.

       Yes, we're fucked. The people running the show have made a total mess of the economy, and they are now turning Western nations into neo-fascist states, where the big money interests control the legislation the politicians pass into laws. The whole Free Trade philosophy that began under Ronald Reagan was just a way for the corporations to move manufacturing overseas where there was cheaper labor. It benefited the rich, but hurt the greater mass of the population. And it hurt the country. Now we have a situation where the economy is geared to war -- where invading and occupying foreign nations for no particular reason is what keeps the greased wheels of the war machine turning. Lots of jobs in the military. Lots of jobs making weapons to give to Israel, so that the Zionists can kill people in their homes at long distance. Lots of jobs building cruise missiles to blow up houses in Pakistan. And it is all completely and utterly insane. It will collapse in upon itself, and soon.

For I am going to do something in your days 
   that you would not believe, 
   even if you were told. 
6 I am raising up the Babylonians,[a] 
   that ruthless and impetuous people, 
who sweep across the whole earth 
   to seize dwellings not their own. 
7 They are a feared and dreaded people; 
   they are a law to themselves 
   and promote their own honor. 
8 Their horses are swifter than leopards, 
   fiercer than wolves at dusk. 
Their cavalry gallops headlong; 
   their horsemen come from afar. 
They fly like an eagle swooping to devour; 
 9 they all come intent on violence. 
Their hordes[b] advance like a desert wind 
   and gather prisoners like sand. 
10 They mock kings 
   and scoff at rulers. 
They laugh at all fortified cities; 
   by building earthen ramps they capture them. 
11 Then they sweep past like the wind and go on— 
   guilty people, whose own strength is their god.”

       This morning's job number was horrendous.  Given the 280 pt slide the other day in the Dow and now with futures down around 140 pre-open, we think that this is the official start of the double dip that everyone's been waiting for.  Housing prices are still falling, foreclosures are still occuring and show no signs of slowing, and firms and households are still way too overleveraged.  Overleveraged households means that consumer spending will stay weak as consumers pay down their debts instead of increasing consumption to precrisis levels.  Overleveraged firms have a double incentive to not expand production: no demand for increased goods/services, and their balance sheets still being a mess due to the enormous fall in asset prices that the crisis brought upon the corporate sector.  Firms figure that if there's no demand for their products/services, they'll just use their cash to quietly fix their insolvent balance sheets, leaving unemployment stagnant.

       TL;DR - It's going to get a lot worse in America before it gets better.  Japan's real estate bubble popped in 1990, and it essentially took them until 2005 to recover (only to be smacked by the US's real estate bubble, and then an earthquake, and then a tsunami, and then a nuclear crisis)

       I am of the opinion that for the past three decades the US has been moving increasingly to the political right, putting corporate interests before the public interest, and passing increasingly draconian legislation. I predict barring any major financial collapse, massive environmental disaster, energy or resource crisis; (but quite possibly in conjunction with these events) as the gap between the haves and have-nots widens, there will eventually arise a leftist cultural revolution. I am basing much of my opinion on how various revolutions across the world throughout history were sparked and primarily on the start of the Spanish revolution.

      <p>
       A land, wealth, and resource controlling elite can only tighten their grip so firmly to control their serfs and slaves. It is the greed of the elite that will be their own undoing. Unless they are able to use technology and their wealth effectively to keep the left oppressed, divided, and confused. Unity and a common shared vision among liberal types will be key to a successful cultural revolution.

       I definitely agree it could take decades for conditions to become dire enough for citizens to take action. I think its a possibility that by then the means of control and oppression will become more effective and may stave off revolt indefinitely. The elite want the masses to be as placid and servile as cattle. However, advances in technology also have the potential to free us from that servitude. I can see that if the elite feel threatened enough, they may result to fomenting massive wars, releasing bio weapons, or creating some other crisis to ensure their success and survival, while they hide in bunkers underground. The elite have threatened and attempted in the past to plunge society into chaos and panic when backed into a corner.

       So when all is said and done, there will be no way to organize or rebel against the fascist despot slated to take power. Very few will recognize this happening anyway because everything is moving so slowly, its like watching a glacier.

       I agree, but not only that -- from historical example, it looks like this process of gradually morphing into a totalitarian state is self-perpetuating once it gets past a certain point. The secret police just try to take more and more power for themselves, unless a movement arises to stop them.

       Which is unlikely to happen in the states. People are still pampered here. Unless the power goes out or something radical that actually affects everyone in their daily routine, you'll only see apathy and sheepishness. But if there is no beer at the liquor store. PANIC!

       All I can say is that they better do something sooner then later if anything at all because once the police/sheriff departments are privatized it'll be ugly for all the marginal folks who can't afford to grease the hands of the law.

       Yes, I think it is. For as many people out there that have lost their way and hurt others, there are many more good people. I think the saying goes "Power corrupts. Absolutely", and it's unfortunate that good people are so easily controlled by those in power, but not worth throwing the towel in on the entire Human race.

       For an example of what we are going through, look up Easter Island. The reason why we are collapsing is because of the greatest meme ever to be created, the meme of civilization. If you're familiar with Daniel Quinn, he states it as follows "Civilization is the only way in which humanity and proceed, and it has to at all costs."
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why very soon we will see this in practice, when open nuclear warfare will set upon us. Does this HAVE to happen? NO! You have to get out of your house and talk to anyone that will listen. And don't tell them pure doom and gloom shit, just tell them how fragile this is.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are the product of 4.5 billion years of evolution, our DNA has arisen and propagated itself right up to this point. The sun will die and take Earth with it in another 4 billion years, and any humans that are still around then will certainly not be anything like us.4

       The new meme we have to create should go something like this "We are far to fragile to endanger ourselves with the thought of world war 3, we have to move forward and manage our lives and resources equitably. We have to abandon 2 words: Hope and Faith. Those words are temporary and transitory, it's human life that is real"

       Maybe if you'd do your own research instead of bashing those who know what the fuck they're talking about, you would feel the same way.

       Example : I love video games, but their purpose is to waste time. While I'm in front of my computer playing Crysis or Starcraft 2, someone, somewhere, is getting shot at/molested/ illegally searched.

       That's life.  People have been harassing and killing each other since long before we were born and will continue long after we die.  That doesn't mean you cant enjoy your life and should talk down to others because they do.

       I completely agree. However, we must draw the line between "enjoying life" and being apathetic to serious issues that we -could- fix.

       In the 1960's-70's people were rioting in the streets and the government was gunning down the youth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 1950'-60'-70s we were all sure the world was going to end with the USSR bombing us to the stone age.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 50's again it was all about the fear of communism.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 30's - 40's there was a world war that killed untold millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before that is was WWI, then the Civil War, and the Indian wars, and the War of 1812, and the revolutionary war.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the Black Plague, that wiped out 1/3 of the population of Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is really not as bad as you think it is.  Unless there are people dieing in front of you, you are probably just being influenced by the media scare.  Go out side and enjoy the day.

       this is my second day, i may be incorrect, but i believe the only things that go on the front page are what links you want sent to the front page. If you select r/conspiracy to be on your front page then the "hottest" and "new" topics will be sent to your front page...this article being on your front page has nothing to do with mods, but moreso just chance...everyone's front page is different seeing as how people want different boards and things on their front page, which is customizable.
