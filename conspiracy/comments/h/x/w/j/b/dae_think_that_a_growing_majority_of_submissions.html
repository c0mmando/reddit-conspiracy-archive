       I notice so many posts that follow this same pattern:
      </p>
      <p>
       I am about to make this terrible decision in life. The right thing to do is obvious but I'm not going to do it!
      </p>
      <p>
       Or alternately, my friend is about to make this terrible decision in life, how can I stop them!
      </p>
      <p>
       And so ensues a bevy of good hearted people offering predictable advice. I'm starting to think that we've been had and these aren't just trolls but part of Reddit's business model. They make sure enough posts make the front page that pull emotional chords to trigger a response. I'm not buying it anymore. The frequency of these manipulative posts is too steady and predictable to be real. Surely there must be boring reddit news days too, but instead there's always a steady stream of teenage level drama. I'm calling BS on our friends at Reddit and think they're playing with our minds to ensure their continued success.

       yep, i have the seem feeling, but on this subreddit in particular. it's a shame, because i think alot of fellow redditors come check out
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , see some whacky shit and write off 'conspiracies' as a whole, not realizing a good portion of the submissions on here are complete and utter disinfo. there are plenty of great, open minded discussions that take place in this subreddit. that said, it's important to realize that it's not our job to point out the disinfo, it's the reader's job to be able to sift through it.

       Completely disagree, I'll point out whatever I want.  I think it's good for people to realise that they're not the only ones fed-up with the bullshit submissions.  People who post batshit insane theories need to be told to shut the fuck up and I'm often happy to oblige.

       Interesting. I don't subscribe to r/conspiracy, but the r/relationships, r/suicide, and r/depression seem to have a number of posts that can't possibly be true. And it's not like you can call BS on them because what if someone's really hurting. If you're seeing similar things in r/conspiracy then perhaps we've found a trend...

       Fun fact: back in the day when reddit was first struggling to become popular, Alexis and Steve actually
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       make a full-time job of personally scouring the Internet for interesting material and submitting it to reddit themselves under fake accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, it sounds like you're seriously underestimating the traffic reddit actually gets. It's possible that employees are hired to populate reddit with addictive content, but this doesn't necessarily follow from any apparent features of the site.

       I'm sure every site owner does this at some point. An interesting question is how long does it persist, and does it ever stop. Or, can a site be successful without hedging their bets.

       correct... they're two different things. But they both deviate from the ideal of all content being user submitted and democratically rising and falling by majority vote standards.

       The big "emotional" and "outrageous story" posts that gets lots of attention only happen in the big subreddits like Ask Reddit or IAMA or Pics.  Suicide Watch and Depression posts only generate a handful of responses, and most of them are of the quick "
       <em>
        PM me if you want to talk
       </em>
       " variety.  The "
       <em>
        OMG Where can I send money?
       </em>
       " responses that grab lots of attention occur much more frequently in the big subreddits.  If Reddit employees are trolling behind the scenes to generate buzz, then it makes more sense to devote their resources to the most popular subreddits and not Suicide Watch or Depression, which are smaller and less influential in comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also just don't see what's so hard to believe about the majority posts in Suicide Watch and Depression.  I've never thought anything was particularly trollish in either of those subreddits, and I'm usually among the first to call BS on just about anything in IAMA or Ask Reddit.

       Due to the nature of the voting system, coupled with the millions of likeminded/hiveminded voters, wouldn't it make sense for the same types of posts to always rise to prominence?

       it's true though, digg had a much younger, less mature userbase. i think it was probably due to kevin rose being on television.

       i didn't blame the rise in crap on them, i blamed digg for the large influx of users who were mostly young teenagers. whether those people post mostly crap is debatable as is whether there is a similar percentage of douchebags now vs then.
      </p>
      <p>
       i know that digg's userbase was made up of people with somewhat dissimilar interests to the userbase of reddit and i can see the influence of those people on reddit. am i saying that
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       digger was an immature douche? no, obviously that kind of generalization would be false and there's really no need to be so defensive.

       this is all anecdotal from my experiences with these websites. i was a digger for a couple years prior to migrating here so i'm just going on what i observed. i think digg was much more easily accessible to a younger audience than reddit was. digg was more well-known.
      </p>
      <p>
       reddit changed after the whole digg fiasco, whether it was caused by the influx of users straight from digg or the randoms reading about it on the tech blogs. not to mention all the Anons who were undecided about which site to post their recycled 4chan material on suddenly had that decision made for them. is it better or worse? who's to say really? but it is undeniably different imo.

       ninja edit: i guess you think i'm bitching about the state of reddit but i am still here and i still enjoy it, fwiw. also to quote just put &gt; in front (no space!) of what you want to quote on a new line like

       I've never dismiss a post as being fake. If something strike a cord with me I follow it until I find logical fault with it. Why use an online medium like a forum if I'm just going to dismiss everything I read as a hoax or a bot? I might be missing out on a chance to find out something interesting or new. IMHO it's worth the risk of being fooled. It's the Internet. Play at your own risk :)

       Are some posts fake? Yes, but the growing majority, I don't think so... not even close.  you've got to admit it's somewhat pessimistic/cynical to think that of all the people on reddit, that a "majority" of people submitting new posts are fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do these sensationalist bullshit submissions happen, totally, but it certainly doesn't mean that they're all fake.  Beyond that, it's totally unprovable that it's even a "growing" number, and if you really wanna debate it, you'd be better off spending some time over at
       <a href="/r/circlejerk">
        /r/circlejerk
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can say is that most everything that I've noticed in life goes in some sort of cycle of up and down like a sine wave, and if you believe that more of these new submissions are fake, then perhaps we're just in a higher part of the fake submissions wave.

       Exactly. The other trend, which may be falling out of favor is the, "My post with bad grammar will catch your attention" trick. No idea why those gravitate to the top- something to do with human nature.

       Does it really matter? Maybe the post may not be real, but those could be real situations people could be going through but dont want to out themselves out there by post their problems. And maybe they are helped by reading the comments knowing that there is support out there.
      </p>

       If you dont think its real than dont comment it, dont upvote, dont down vote just let it be. But if think you can help a person than you should.

just a thought, but what if that observation is just the result of an interesting statistical phenomena. instead of assuming the people aren't really posting things or there's a conspiracy, what if we thought of it as a "statistical conspiracy" and searched for the cause/source. that sort of understanding might be worth something to us (or at least be interesting).

       Sorry, that's just doing too much. I'm as much of a conspiracy nut as anyone, but no. If anything, this is just an observation of human nature itself. The same shit happens in real life. People ask their friends the same questions... "He won't stop beating me. I know I should leave him but I can't. What should I do?" etc. (no offense, example only). Ever heard of Occam's Razor?

       DAE think that the people at

       As a former lawyer and son of a pathological liar, you could say that my bullshit detector is pretty good.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, I have studied for obvious reasons the mechanics of lying and deception. Sometimes to unmask liars, sometimes to be a better
       <del>
        liar
       </del>
       lawyer myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you know the signs, you realize that 95% of the people who are telling a story, like "look, I did something awesome today" or "guess what I witnessed" are lying.
      </p>

       Isn't it possible that these fake posts are just a by product of want to earn karma or troll this site?  I mean, those need jerk posts seem to be written by someone who does copyright as in write advertisements to grab the audiences attention and further read their post.

       I'm sure if we learn to write post titles like this on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       , we can grab a huger audience in this subreddit...probably...

       and not only that, Reddit promotes certain posts over others.  I think they have a circle of people who they promote and if you aren't inside it, forget about it.  I'm outside the loop and it doesn't matter what I post, it won't get promoted.

       I was here when Reddit was a bit smaller.  The comments would be so retarded like
"Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah  "
and then the next person would be like
"Zip-A-Dee-A"
and then of course the next
"My oh my what a wonderful day"

       There's a certain type of person who is suspicious of everything and you, my friend, are almost certainly of that type. That's why you hang out in a place like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       People of your type can never be dissuaded from this view because anyone attempting to do so is obviously part of a conspiracy.

       The truth is in the real world there are fake stories and there are real stories and I suspect Reddit reflects that by having both kinds.
