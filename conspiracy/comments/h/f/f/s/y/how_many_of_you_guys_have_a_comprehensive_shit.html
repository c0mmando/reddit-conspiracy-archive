<p>There is so much good organization of thought and theory happening on the internet, that&#39;s indisputable. But where&#39;s the organization of concrete practice?  I&#39;m curious to know how many people actually have plans, right now, that do not rely on technology.  I think we take solace in the online community of people who &quot;get it,&quot; but what will happen if (when?) access to that community disappears?  Will we all be lost in the widespread panic, despite our foreknowledge and better sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK man.  I get that.  And thanks.  I could contribute, in a bunch of different ways.  I&#39;ve had this scenario in the back of my mind since I was a child (Bay of Pigs years).  I&#39;m old but I&#39;ve been planning for something like this all my life.  Sadly, I&#39;m living in the Middle East (here to make the $ to put my boys through school in the States)  If the shitstorm starts my hope is that I can get a flight out of Dubai (first I&#39;ll have get myself to Dubai and I reckon it&#39;ll have to be xcountry if the borders are shut down...)headed to the States and my boys and I will meetup at our designated place.  From then one we&#39;ll just have to forage for what we need to get by.  I guess that includes taking stuff we need from wherever we can.  I&#39;ve dreaded this scenario all my life but its always been a just-in-case attitude.  Better to be ready.  If I don&#39;t make it there, I&#39;ve given my sons instructions about sticking together and what to do.  They think I&#39;m just being mum but as long as they hear my words that knowledge will stick.  Prepare for the worst, hope for the best.</p>
