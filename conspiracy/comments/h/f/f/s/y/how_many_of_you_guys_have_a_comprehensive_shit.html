       I'm wondering how many people have means to access to farms/food, old cars that can run without electricity (should the power apocolypse occur), hard copies of addresses, plans for meet-up locations...
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much good organization of thought and theory happening on the internet, that's indisputable. But where's the organization of concrete practice?  I'm curious to know how many people actually have plans, right now, that do not rely on technology.  I think we take solace in the online community of people who "get it," but what will happen if (when?) access to that community disappears?  Will we all be lost in the widespread panic, despite our foreknowledge and better sense?

       I personally do not have a plan, but I should.  That being said, you can probably dig up a lot of good information on r/collapse. Not sure if you've been there before, hope it helps though.

       yup. i have a bugout bag, ammo, a GPS/paper directions to a very private, expensive, self-sufficient 'private estate' in a remote area. i don't own it, but I will roll in with 2 other former marines and our friends and kill the occupants. the rich pricks deserve whatever they get, their land can support 20 people indefinitely. don't drop any morality on me due to this plan, it's survival, plain and simple.

       what if, after you eliminate the rich pricks, another set of survivalist commandos show up and try to kill you, thinking that you are the rich pricks? What if the rich pricks use some of their wealth to prepare against people like you?

       then they'll be fighting an entrenched enemy in a hardened building and have a massive disadvantage. if they're logical, we might join up. if they're better than us, we die, as it has always been. am i not supposed to have considered that option?

       OK.  Very Jack Reacher of you.  No moral judgement here.  Survival is survival.  Just good luck to everyone if things are so bad that some Marines need to go killing the rich folks to get the sanctuary.  Semper fi. I guess that means faithful to me/myself.  Nice one dudes.

       OK man.  I get that.  And thanks.  I could contribute, in a bunch of different ways.  I've had this scenario in the back of my mind since I was a child (Bay of Pigs years).  I'm old but I've been planning for something like this all my life.  Sadly, I'm living in the Middle East (here to make the $ to put my boys through school in the States)  If the shitstorm starts my hope is that I can get a flight out of Dubai (first I'll have get myself to Dubai and I reckon it'll have to be xcountry if the borders are shut down...)headed to the States and my boys and I will meetup at our designated place.  From then one we'll just have to forage for what we need to get by.  I guess that includes taking stuff we need from wherever we can.  I've dreaded this scenario all my life but its always been a just-in-case attitude.  Better to be ready.  If I don't make it there, I've given my sons instructions about sticking together and what to do.  They think I'm just being mum but as long as they hear my words that knowledge will stick.  Prepare for the worst, hope for the best.

       i'm sure they do. how often do they serve in the military to train to do things such as withstand sieges, clear buildings, handle CS-gas bombardment? 
Nope, fightin' like that is for us po' folks, to go get y'all your oil.

       I don't understand the downvotes. This is the reality of food crisis. People WILL kill for food if there is scarcity.

       I hope enough people can grow their own so it never gets this far, but a crunch time will come to pass. The sad fact is those with a plan like this, in a worst case scenario, would likely be more successful than your average Joe.

       to be honest, after the abject pillaging of the economy by the wealthy by the elite, some part of me will enjoy it more than killing illiterate muslims who are only defending their own country.

       i've even done a soils analysis on the area. using the 'three sisters' farming method, we can easily feed 20 people indefinitely, as opposed to the 2 or 3 that live there for one week out of the year. venison and chicken will supplement the diet nicely. maximum benefit for the most people. does anyone think i'm doing this out of hatred?
