       2) Jews can steal from Gentiles.

       3) If a jew kills a gentile then there will be no death penalty.

       4) A jew can have a female gentile as a sex slave if he wishes.

       5) when the jewish messiah comes, each jew will have 2800 gentile slaves.

       Would you like to debate? I'll bring up a few random points of the video and debunk them. That is why I am downvoting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's start:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Libre David 37: A Jew cannot teach a Gentile about religion
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I have no idea what this is. Libre is not a Hebrew word, and the closets approximation of it is ליברה דוד, a Google search of which brings up a bunch of people named David Leiber. Moving on.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Schulchan Aruch Czozchen Hamizshpat 348: A Jew can grab the land of a gentile
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Actually, that is not at all what it says. It states that if a man is living on  a property without a deed, and someone comes with a deed, or witnesses, he may take the property. The "gentile" part is in reference to the Land of Israel under King David where it was assumed that a land belonged to a Jew (99% of the residents) until proven otherwise.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Yebamoth 98a: Gentile children are animals
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The words "Gentile", "children" and "animals" appear no where on the page. The closest thing you can find is a point that gentiles retain their mothers lineage, but not their fathers. One more and we'll call it a day.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sanhedrin 59a: Killing a gentile is like killing a wild animal
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nothing about killing on the entire page. A lot about gentiles, such as this line:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A gentile who follows the law is comparable to the highest Jewish priest.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also, interestingly enough, a search for any of those bizzare misspellings (like "Choszen Hamiszpat" instead of "Choshen Mishpat") all lead to sites like Stormfront.org.

        Whatever. The book doesn't exist.

        Good, I'm glad we are in agreement that there is absolutely nothing wrong morally with this.

        You're the one taking the page out of context. All it is saying is that Egyptians have no patrilineal decent. The line about horses is typical Talmud allegory that is found all over, both in reference to Israel and other nations. For example, (RASHI, Genesis) The Children of Israel are like donkey's, resting with their burden. Besides, the Talmud is often extremely insulting towards Ancient Egyptians, due to the whole 250 years of slavery thing.

        Exactly. This entire video, and 10,000 others like it, is just a mass copy and paste from white supremacist sites. Nobody ever bothers checking to see if any of this stuff is even written.

       LOL. I love the way how the video talks and talks about "Zionists" in an effort to stay non-anti-semitic.
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI hater, Zionists predominately ignore the Talmud. I wonder if Netanyahu can even name half the books quoted in this video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a good 50% of the books mentioned in the video are either horrendeously misspelled, or simply don't exist. WTF is "Gad. Shas."? That's not even Hebrew!

       Exactly.  Jews want you to use the word "zionist" because they don't want to make it a racial issue....WHICH IT IS.  IT'S ENTIRELY RACIAL.   Jews believe that they are superior race and that gentiles are animals so it's definitely a racial thing.  It's a genetic thing.  When they try to get you to use "elites" or "zionist"...you say Jew.

       Then why did the guy who made the video keep using the word Zionist when he was obviously referring to Jews? In my opinion, he is a coward. Too afraid to admit his hatred for Jews, so he hides behind the idea that he is criticizing a nationalist mentality.

       Non-virgins are to be stoned to death:
      </p>
      <p>
       "But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you." (Deuteronomy 22: 20-21)
      </p>
      <p>
       Death penalty for cursing:
      </p>
      <p>
       "For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him." (Leviticus 20:9)

      <p>
       This is just the tip of the iceberg.  The bible is filled with passages about killing people that don't follow your beliefs.

       Jesus said not a jot or tittle shall be changed and all old testament law is therefore supported. Jesus even supported slavery.
      </p>
      <pre><code>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.  (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)

Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed.  If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful.  You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts.  Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them.  (1 Timothy 6:1-2 NLT)

In the following parable, Jesus clearly approves of beating slaves even if they didn't know they were doing anything wrong.

The servant will be severely punished, for though he knew his duty, he refused to do it.  "But people who are not aware that they are doing wrong will be punished only lightly.  Much is required from those to whom much is given, and much more is required from those to whom much more is given."  (Luke 12:47-48 NLT)
</code></pre>
      <p>
       The Quran and Islam also support slavery and keeping women as sex slaves.

       In the U.S, Jews practice ritual murder of gentile children with impunity. Its called Tophet. Look it up.

      <p>
       It is written in the Talmud about the murder of the non-Jew:
      </p>
      <p>
       1). "It is permitted to take the body and the life of a non-jew." (Sepher Ikkarim IIIc, 25)
      </p>
      <p>
       2). "It is the law to kill anyone who denies the Torah (Talmud - Sanhedrin 59b). The Christians belong to the denying ones of the Torah (Talmud)." (Coschen Hamischpat 425, Hagah 425, 5)
      </p>
      <p>
       3). "Every Jew, who spills the blood of the godless (non-Jew), is doing the same as making a sacrifice to God." (Bammidber Raba, c 21 &amp; Jalkut 772)

       No they don't.  Just like all Christians don't believe that owning slaves is OK and women have no rights and you should be killed for working on the sabbath or mixing crops of wearing a shirt with different types of threads.

       Thats not only those kikes believe, but also doing !
      </p>
      <p>
       Bank cartels, FED dollar pressings and loaning them, or buying oil, make tax payers spend 3 bilions every year to Israel, or racketeer gentles directly to pay "hundereds of milions for being guilty of holocoust", etc this equals to SLAVERY
      </p>
      <p>
       3) A jew can have a female gentile as a sex slave if he wishes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of white womans from eastern europe ends their days in forced sex-slavery in Israel. Government knows it, but does nothing

       Would you like to debate? I'll bring up a few random points of the video and debunk them. That is why I am downvoting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's start:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Libre David 37: A Jew cannot teach a Gentile about religion
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I have no idea what this is. Libre is not a Hebrew word, and the closets approximation of it is ליברה דוד, a Google search of which brings up a bunch of people named David Leiber. Moving on.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Schulchan Aruch Czozchen Hamizshpat 348: A Jew can grab the land of a gentile
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Actually, that is not at all what it says. It states that if a man is living on  a property without a deed, and someone comes with a deed, or witnesses, he may take the property. The "gentile" part is in reference to the Land of Israel under King David where it was assumed that a land belonged to a Jew (99% of the residents) until proven otherwise.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Yebamoth 98a: Gentile children are animals
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The words "Gentile", "children" and "animals" appear no where on the page. The closest thing you can find is a point that gentiles retain their mothers lineage, but not their fathers. One more and we'll call it a day.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sanhedrin 59a: Killing a gentile is like killing a wild animal
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nothing about killing on the entire page. A lot about gentiles, such as this line:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A gentile who follows the law is comparable to the highest Jewish priest.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also, interestingly enough, a search for any of those bizzare misspellings (like "Choszen Hamiszpat" instead of "Choshen Mishpat") all lead to sites like Stormfront.org.
