        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t know about the rest of the country, but in my area(NW Florida) teachers teach pretty much only what they know will be on the biannual FCAT test.  It seems to me that this was a deliberate move by the Bush administration through &#39;No Child Left Behind&#39;.  In my opinion, this practice creates the expectation in children that they will be told everything they need to know by their authority figures, and subtly discourages investigation and research to find deeper truth.  We are already a nation that by and large takes our news outlets&#39; word as absolute truth, and I believe this is the next step.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a college professor, I agree completely. I teach creative disciplines (design, art, etc) and students &#39;post-no-child-left-behind&#39; tend to be incredibly subservient and unable to challenge themselves. They just want to be told what to do explicitly. An employer that hires many of my former students said &quot;This generation, you have to hold their hand to go to the bathroom&quot;. Luckily, I&#39;m seeing a change as of the past couple of years. I&#39;m not sure why. Perhaps it&#39;s the internet, social networking finally maturing and not being pure entertainment. That&#39;s just a guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know the movie &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;? I watched it the other night. One of the main &quot;heroes&quot; of the story is a little 10 or 12 year old girl that says stuff like &quot;cunts&quot; and swears throughout the movie, not to mention shooting, stabbing, beheading, and generic hollywood violence type of stuff.</p>

<p>I think that the intention in making this movie (or at the very least having a 12 year old girl as a main &#39;super hero&#39; that slays many people and swears) might possibly be to confuse the subservient viewers into becoming pedophiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s been the plan since the beginning.  Schools are meant to control the production of quality individuals. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/toc1.htm">I really wish they would just teach The Underground History of American Education in class.</a></p>

<p>Gatto, who was teacher of the year in New York, quit his schooling job and wrote an in depth textbook on the complete history of the public education system, it&#39;s true role and how it came to be.  It&#39;s one of the most insightful and infuriating things I&#39;ve ever read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The major premise here is that American schooling has been dumbed down to provide mindless, loyal workers who cannot think for themselves. At least this is the schooling provided to the masses. This was a deliberate act with roots in 19th century industrialism. He shows how the Civil War demonstrated to industrialists and financiers how a standardized population trained to follow orders without significant thought could be made to function as a money tree. Moreover, the proper schooling could be used to strip the common population of its power to cause trouble. You see, our global power and corporate wealth is based on a third-rate educational system that actually works against developing men and women of true character and intellect. The mindless bureaucrat and worker who follows a system without thought or question is the pattern that our &quot;efficient&quot; system depends on. That is what schooling produces. One should never confuse schooling with true education- and definitely not with intelligence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s not perfect, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any malice behind it, or at least, the forces of malice aren&#39;t as strong as the forces of inevitable progress. &#39;No Child Left Behind&#39; and schemes like that are more likely the results of idiotic policy intended to streamline and standardise things rather than genuine evil.</p>

<p>I definitely sound like a shill here, so before I go collect my paycheck, I will say one last thing: look at Dickens and the history of public education. It&#39;s by no means perfect at the moment, but it&#39;s a lot more flexible and directed towards helping students achieve their potential <em>these days</em>. Obviously there&#39;s always room for improvement, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s much of a conspiracy in the sense of hidden subterfuge, but more a collaboration of stupid ideas coalescing into public policy like it often tends to naturally do.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR: The system now is (slightly) better than it&#39;s been in the past, and I don&#39;t think policy makers are motivated by malign intentions as much as they are idiocy and ignorance.</strong></p>

<p>About the author:  Charlotte Iserbyt is the consummate whistleblower! Iserbyt served as Senior Policy Advisor in the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), U.S. Department of Education, during the first Reagan Administration, where she first blew the whistle on a major technology initiative which would control curriculum in America&#39;s classrooms. Iserbyt is a former school board director in Camden, Maine and was co-founder and research analyst of Guardians of Education for Maine (GEM) from 1978 to 2000. She has also served in the American Red Cross on Guam and Japan during the Korean War, and in the United States Foreign Service in Belgium and in the Republic of South Africa. Iserbyt is a speaker and writer, best known for her 1985 booklet Back to Basics Reform or OBE: Skinnerian International Curriculum and her 1989 pamphlet Soviets in the Classroom: America&#39;s Latest Education Fad which  covered the details of the U.S.-Soviet and Carnegie-Soviet Education Agreements which remain in effect to this day. She is a freelance writer and has had articles published in Human Events, The Washington Times, The Bangor Daily News, and included in the record of Congressional hearings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. It is a way to get people to think the same as each other, instead of pushing teachers to learn each students&#39; strengths and weaknesses and teach to that.

    <div class="md"><p>Way off. </p>

<p>As a high school teacher, I can tell you that we are <em>constantly</em> being pushed to ID learning styles, and address them all with differentiated instruction. We are pushed to have students use higher-order thinking skills and to be meta-cognitive with their own learning.</p>

<p>However, when the time comes to rate teachers or schools, scores on standardized tests are still relied on very heavily. To the point where a teacher who is doing those things mentioned above will get shit on by the admins if the results aren&#39;t there at the end of the year, and the worst teacher will be praised if the students do well on the final exam. </p>

<p>Teachers are being sent mixed signals, and we do the best we can with the situation we are dealt. As someone who is neck deep in American public education, I honestly do feel that the entire system is designed to fail, and that the students, teachers, and administrators are doing their best to find success within a fucked up system.

    <div class="md"><p>Could it be that teachers aren&#39;t allowed to think outside the box?  Thanks to the National Education Association (NEA) they dictate the general directions teachers are required to take.  You are required to be apart of the NEA if you are a teacher, and serves as a nation wide teachers union.  </p>

<p>While taking a Public Relations course at the university I attended last year the professor dedicated an entire class to the amazing work of Edward Bernays.  Not until I was doing my own research did I realize the connection between Edward Bernays and Nazi Propaganda, and today&#39;s constant propaganda for that matter.  Standardized testing forces teachers to educate their students on predetermined information approved by state and federal education boards.</p>

<p>My question is what if a teacher is required to cover a subject and they know the information is either half truths or whole lies?  Does the teacher have the freedom to go against what the approved text books say?  Or are they forced to bite the bullet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing wrong with standardized tests, but teaching for the tests defeats their purpose, and where they exist it is almost inevitable that teachers are going to target their material to cover the questions on the test.</p>

<p>What students need more than anything else, is to be taught how to write legibly in cursive script, how to touch-type, basic mental math skills, spelling, and most importantly of all, how to read and how to write an English sentence. Those things are far more valuable than esoteric studies in social interaction or politics or organic chemistry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what your saying, but shouldn&#39;t the school district be required to observe their teachers and fire the bad ones, not a state or national standardized test?  And if the school district itself is the problem, the parents then are the ones which should be making changes in their child&#39;s school.  The overall problem is that the only oversight and direction in our public education system are government education boards.  In my opinion parents need to be more involved in the local school system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While &quot;teaching the test&quot; certainly has a negative effect on critical thinking and creative skills, I find it difficult to believe that the same politicians who talk about competing globally in technological fields would also want to hinder our ability to think for ourselves. Engineers who can think critically and creatively are necessary for the US to have any chance of continuing its global dominance in the technological/information age. Perhaps they intend to have a small middle class of (unfortunately necessary) engineers while the masses are left to be poor and undereducated, but this would be a very difficult balancing act to accomplish considering the growing demand for geeks in the tech race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The teaching for the test is just an unwanted by-product of standardized tests. Standardized tests work based on the principle that if you are taught certain material, you&#39;ll know the stuff on the tests. If everything were to work perfect, this would be great. But you have lazy or greedy teachers who would rather cheat the system or mercilessly beat test questions and answers into kids skulls rather than just teaching them the required coursework. Education IMO is actually heading more toward free thought and critical thinking. If you take a look at or remember your text books, they all had critical thinking questions at the end of sections, and the best example I can think of was my Psyc101 book. It had a whole section devoted to the use of the book and how you should ask questions about the material as you read. In short, I don&#39;t think this is anything more than lazy teachers, because evidence in the way textbooks work and the amount of people fighting these types of laws shows that many people don&#39;t want it working this way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a couple of things for you to take a look at. First, is John Gatto&#39;s book Weapons of Mass Instruction. He was an educator for 30 years and resigned in disgust with a letter to the Wall St. Journal&#39;s Op-ed section. He goes through the history of education in a very interesting way.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Mass-Instruction-Schoolteachers-Compulsory/dp/0865716692/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1305845327&amp;amp;sr=8-1">http://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Mass-Instruction-Schoolteachers-Compulsory/dp/0865716692/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1305845327&amp;amp;sr=8-1</a></p>

<p>And here&#39;s a book (free online) written by Charlotte Izerbyt, formerly high up in the government&#39;s dept. of education who also resigned after she figured out what was going on.
<a href="http://www.deliberatedumbingdown.com/">http://www.deliberatedumbingdown.com/</a>
It&#39;s much more technical than Gatto&#39;s book, but provides better documentation. As an example, she tells us what the definition of &quot;education&quot; was in the past and compares it to the current definition. Apparently, today&#39;s education is more based on neurology......basically &quot;training&quot; students to have certain responses to specific stimuli. </p>

<p>It&#39;s another layer of defense of the Status Quo (on this below), which wants to live forever. It&#39;s natural and understandable. Equally natural and understandable is your refusal to participate in the system of &#39;education&#39; once you have realised what it&#39;s about.</p>

<p>This decay is not targeting our younger generation specifically: this is a cyclical thing.</p>

<p>Long periods of degeneration are accompanied by scholasticism, while independence is encouraged only within short bursts of building a new order on the debris of the previous cycle. Once built, the order starts degenerating, etc.</p>

<p>Status Quo is the degeneration which calls itself &quot;stability&quot; or even &quot;progress&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The assumption in conspiracy-land is that there&#39;s a &quot;deliberate&quot; &lt;enter world-manipulative shadow-entity here&gt; that &quot;wants&quot; to enslave the uneducated, in order to get their world domination orgasm on.  I like big explosions and evil antagonists, don&#39;t get me wrong, but the assumption that the people at the top are somehow planning to &quot;eradicate free thinking in the younger generations&quot; is like turning a greedy asshole into super-evil-nasty-alien-crazy-hate-monger&quot;----a bit too far.  Standardized testing is a testament to human laziness.  They think of education in terms of dollar bills and statistics.  They want black&amp;white results so they put a mechanism into schools that gives them easily digestible numbers.  They turn kids into statistics and expect the schools to train kids into statistic-creationists. Stupid idea. Classic disassociation from the majority/reality, easily ridiculed and corrected.  It isn&#39;t the devil incarnate, and would be a boring movie overall, but all it takes is pushing the idea that education is more important than profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your beliefs are <em>adorable</em>.</p>

<p>Are you basing your claim that you are “smarter” than the previous generation on the fact that you passed your standardized test with flying colors? Because if so, you are a perfect example of being dumbed down while at the same time believing in your superiority. Standardized tests are NOT, I repeat <strong>NOT</strong>, a measurement of intelligence. They measure your ability to robotically commit useless information to memory. So good for you, a dog can learn keywords too.</p>

<p>Public school has long been useless, save for a good way to brainwash kids into sitting down and shutting up. When you make the entire school experience about passing a standardized test, you take away what little actual intellectual value school might have once held.</p>

<p>The best part of it is, you think you are smarter than those who came before you, and were taught critical and free thinking. Beautiful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When he say his standard test scores were better? He just said, In general people in  his locale thought young generations were getting smarter. From my experience in the Midwest, when I compare what I learned at a certain age with the age my kids are learning the same thing, they seem to be 2-3 years ahead. EG my 9th grader is taking physics, something didn&#39;t take until I was in 11th grade. My 6th graders routinely do group research projects that I didn&#39;t do until high school. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to request your basis for your original statement. Are you making it based on facts and studies that you&#39;ve read? If so, what are the names of the authors? Were they peer-reviewed? Do you have any links to the evidence that you used to make this statement?</p>

<p>Or are you operating off an anecdotal opinion, based on nothing more than what you&#39;ve chosen to observe through your own limited frame of reference? </p>

<p>If so, then looknottothesky is 100% correct about you and everyone else like you. </p>

<p>As for me? Well, I talk to kids like you every day. I have to teach them the basics, since school didn&#39;t and their managers don&#39;t have the time to train them. Usually they believe they know everything until they don&#39;t and the world stops. Then they need someone like me (pre-NCLB education) to show them STEP FOR STEP how to do something thats in the documentation RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM. </p>

<p>You&#39;d be shocked to learn how much of your generation, and the population in general is going about their lives <em>functionally illiterate</em>, and just barely at that.</p>
