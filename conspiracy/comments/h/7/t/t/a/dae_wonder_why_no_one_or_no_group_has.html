    <div class="md"><p>Everyday rich and influential people die, get sick, &#39;retire&#39;. Now and then we see some politician or public figure disgraced, humbled, forced to retire or lose face; those are the &#39;coups&#39; and attacks we the general public know about, but the other ones, the ones of the real players, we don&#39;t hear about much. </p>

<p>I&#39;d bet more on internal strife and broken alliances causing deaths and &#39;retirements&#39; than some &#39;Stark&#39;. As they say, the rich are not like us; I seriously doubt anyone raised in a world of infinite affluence, rigorous traditions and boundless power, ingrained with an elitist mindset can become &#39;moral&#39; in the sense the rest of us understand. And maybe when one of them <em>does</em>, is them the ones shunned, estranged and that end up overdosed, in exile, suffer accidents.</p>

<p>All of this refers to &#39;normal&#39; tycoons, leaders of industry, high level bankers; I don&#39;t buy the reptilian, necronomic hidden leaders basing their moves on millenial mandates. It&#39;s all about the money and the power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make it sound as if science is the polar opposite of religion. I agree that many religions have become skewed over many centuries, in part by the very elite you worship. To make it untasteful, boring, and conflicting. A walk with God is not conflicting with science, it is quite the opposite, complimentary. Consumers destroy only because they have lost their ability to work the land and setup long lasting foundations. The goal of humanity should be expansive not destructive, in your case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Destroyed by religious people and rebuilt by men of science? Science only exists because God had made it. Science only shows the true hubris if humanity, humans have become too dependent upon science and have lost their way. A religion should keep humans in check of what is right and wrong, something science does not. You cannot prove right, or disprove wrong; it is something instilled in us as children, and has been slowly lost over time. Science has commuted more atrocities and malfeasance than any religion, because humans still don&#39;t know about the things they are toying with. As the world continues it&#39;s worship of money and science they will lose track of right and wrong, and only pursue to devastate their consciences until they are left hollow. 
I agree that a religion should be built upon truth. As it just so happens Jesus Christ is the way, the TRUTH, and the life. Even though I disagree with almost everything you have said, I still care about you and your soul. You have earned a friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad we can be friends, the conversation is not about either of us personally.</p>

<p>With religion or science or a combination of both there is still a need for a massive population reduction as there are not enough resources.</p>

<p>Over population is the biggest problem and of course the financial elites greed knows no bounds, and unfortunately religious groups like the Vatican are for profit and have joined hands with the international bankers and don&#39;t really give a rats arse about the people, all they offer is tokenism.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe Jesus is the way, the bible is a rip of of the Sumerian tablets and even in history historians have very little reference to Jesus with only two able to report the name and then only several generations after his time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Vatican has become a sick perversion of what a religion should be. And the many divisions of these religions have indeed convoluted a great and wonderful thing. Before there were pills to make someone comfortably numb, there was religion uplifting and spiritually healing people. Before there were psychologists and personal therapists, there were men of God listening and consoling the saddened and troubled. I am aware that resources have been depleting since the population has grown. But instead of heartless and needless &quot;control&quot;, can there not be a way to coexist? Just because someone has more money does not make them special or superior. Just because someone is gifted intellectually does not make them above reproach or have a need to be preserved. There is no need for someone to have more money than they can spend in one lifetime, they do not know what it is like to suffer. If you are so dead set on &quot;thinning the herd&quot; then why not thin out the greedy, or gluttonous, or promiscuous, or even just the elite themselves? There is nothing special in their genes that make them superior. I propose an expansion, space for a prime example. Why cannot humans, as a race, set their goals on exploring new horizons instead of killing each other and manipulating and controlling each other? If every human was given the opportunity to pursue their own goals instead of having to worry about something like paying insurance or what celebrity has gone crazy, then you will see that every human in their very own way is unique and gifted. Population reduction is not the answer as it will hinder the progress of humanity. Redirect all of that ambition and passion towards creation and not destruction. </p>

How about instead of having our planet &quot;steered&quot; by the &quot;intellectual and scientific elite&quot; that we instead bring together the collective intelligence of all people. We should all work toward the common goal of inhabiting new worlds and moving into space. There is no chance if we stay on this planet. However, we can provide for everyone - without killing them. We simply just need to get our heads out of our asses. We&#39;re not READY for a WORLD ORDER. Americans can&#39;t run their own country.

<p>Because they are responsible for the death of millions of people?</p>

<p>People are expendable. You&#39;re giving too much of importance to human life - we&#39;re animals, and just like any other animal, there is nothing &quot;sacred&quot; or &quot;special&quot; about us. There is nothing inherently &quot;bad&quot; about the death of million humans - we (humans) have over the last few thousand year exterminated much of the macrofauna of the world, many advanced species that have had the capacity to evolve into sentient, intelligent life forms in the distant future, and we haven&#39;t had second thoughts about it. Making value judgement over what&#39;s &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; while hypocritically taking for granted anthropocentric, speciesist bias is so...human.</p>

<p>Most living people are unfortunately very dumb, unconsciously governed by impulses and  instincts that have accumulated over millions of years, and which they are incapable of comprehending let alone controlling. Apart from large-scale genetic engineering completely bypassing the traditional natural selection by individuals, a swift and efficient culling of the best and the brightest of mankind is the shortest route to long-term progress. Unfortunately most humans have very little to contribute to the grand human meta-organism at this point of its evolution, apart from their genetic potential in e.g. fighting new diseases.</p>

<p>Definitely - that is the plan of the NWO! But before that - building a prosperous global community, obliterating the brain-dead notions of national borders, &quot;us vs. them&quot; dichotomies, institutionalized religions brainwashing billions into mental serfdom.. We don&#39;t wanna Mars colonies of USA waging wars with Venus colonies of China - only by erasing the artificial differences in identities and establishing a global, supranational body of governance can a peaceful progress be made in such spheres.</p>

<p>Oh, and is it you that is going to pull the trigger? :) They have at their disposal the most advanced military in the world, of many developed nations, and all you have is your shitty firearms. Politicians and banksters are also expandable - it is the overall direction of progress that matters. If there were nobody sympathetic to the NWO on the planet, we&#39;d get there either way, but it would entail even more unnecessary deaths, probably within a WW3.</p>
