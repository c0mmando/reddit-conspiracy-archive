        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>...He&#39;s very plugged into the main-stream media and I&#39;ve had conversations with him about WTC7, but haven&#39;t taken him too far down the rabbit hole. What would be some initial introductions to our world that are strongly supported by evidence.  Though he&#39;s quite open-minded, I&#39;m thinking of his audience. Folks who are possibly first hearing these things for the first time. Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks so much for the replies. Very good points about the negative connotation of conspiracy theories along with the different types of conspiracy theorists. I think if he opens with those points and moves beyond that term it will be much more effective. He&#39;s not a member of the Rotary club, but used to be and his long-time friend asked him to give this talk. I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s an odd request, but if he keeps it to fundamental facts, I want to believe it could open some eyes to at least question our government/bankers. Thanks again! I&#39;ll find out the exact date of the talk and follow up with how it goes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, and because people are accustomed to the stigma. The biggest issue is presenting the facts in a way that they will choose to believe. </p>

<p>One of the reasons BBC doccos do well in my mind, is a slow visual journey, without branching off into unimportant points.</p>

<p>The more you learn, the easier it is to overwhelm someone by assuming implied knowledge. The more likely they&#39;ll default to the standard &quot;conspiracy theory nutjob&quot; idea.</p>

<p>He should create a roadmap with a defined and reasonably specific goal. Lead the audience to that goal without flowing into other areas. Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, is he supposed to discuss any particular aspect of conspiracy theories, or just give a broad overview of all of them, or the personality types of conspiracy theorists, or the history of conspiracy theories?</p>

<p>I would definitely include a short section on how many conspiracy theories have turned out to be true, and include stuff about conspiracies that were foiled like the business plot. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quick list to get him started:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Dreyfus_affair">The Dreyfus Affair</a>: In the late 1800s in France, Jewish artillery officer Alfred Dreyfus was wrongfully convicted of treason based on false government documents, and sentenced to life in prison. The French government did attempt to cover this up, but Dreyfus was eventually pardoned after the affair was made public (an act that is credited to writer Ã‰mile Zola).</li>
<li><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Joe_Valachi">The Mafia</a>: This secret crime society was virtually unknown until the 1960s, when member Joe Valachi first revealed the society&#39;s secrets to law enforcement officials.</li>
<li><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Project_MKULTRA">MK-ULTRA</a>: In the 1950s to the 1970s, the CIA ran a mind-control project aimed at finding a &quot;truth serum&quot; to use on communist spies. Test subjects were given LSD and other drugs, often without consent, and some were tortured. At least one man, civilian biochemist Frank Olson, who was working for the government, died as a result of the experiments. The project was finally exposed after investigations by the Rockefeller Commission.</li>
<li><p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">Operation Mockingbird</a>: Also in the 1950s to &#39;70s, the CIA paid a number of well-known domestic and foreign journalists (from big-name media outlets like Time, The Washington Post, The New York Times, CBS and others) to publish CIA propaganda. The CIA also reportedly funded at least one movie, the animated &quot;Animal Farm,&quot; by George Orwell. The Church Committee finally exposed the activities in 1975.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Watergate_scandal">Watergate</a>: Republican officials spied on the Democratic National Headquarters from the Watergate Hotel in 1972. While conspiracy theories suggested underhanded dealings were taking place, it wasn&#39;t until 1974 that White House tape recordings linked President Nixon to the break-in and forced him to resign.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment">The Tuskegee Syphilis Study</a>: The United States Public Health Service carried out this clinical study on 400 poor, African-American men with syphilis from 1932 to 1972. During the study the men were given false and sometimes dangerous treatments, and adequate treatment was intentionally withheld so the agency could learn more about the disease. While the study was initially supposed to last just six months, it continued for 40 years. Close to 200 of the men died from syphilis or related complications by the end of the study.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">Operation Northwoods</a>: In the early 1960s, American military leaders drafted plans to create public support for a war against Cuba, to oust Fidel Castro from power. The plans included committing acts of terrorism in U.S. cities, killing innocent people and U.S. soldiers, blowing up a U.S. ship, assassinating Cuban Ã©migrÃ©s, sinking boats of Cuban refugees, and hijacking planes. The plans were all approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but were reportedly rejected by the civilian leadership, then kept secret for nearly 40 years.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">The Iran-Contra Affair</a>: In 1985 and &#39;86, the White House authorized government officials to secretly trade weapons with the Israeli government in exchange for the release of U.S. hostages in Iran. The plot was uncovered by Congress in 1987.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Nurse_Nayirah">1990 Testimony of Nayirah</a>: A 15-year-old girl named &quot;Nayirah&quot; testified before the U.S. Congress that she had seen Iraqi soldiers pulling Kuwaiti babies from incubators, causing them to die. The testimony helped gain major public support for the 1991 Gulf War, but -- despite protests that the dispute of this story was itself a conspiracy theory -- it was later discovered that the testimony was false. It was actually the creation of public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton for the purpose of promoting the Gulf War.</p></li>

<p><a href="http://www.sixwise.com/newsletters/07/02/28/the-9-most-shocking-conspiracy-theories-that-turned-out-to-be-true.htm">Source</a></p>

<p>Here is a larger list: <a href="http://conspiraciesthatweretrue.blogspot.com/2007/01/list-of-proven-conspiracies-from.html">http://conspiraciesthatweretrue.blogspot.com/2007/01/list-of-proven-conspiracies-from.html</a></p>

<p>I would highly advise that he mention the different kind of conspiracy theorists. 
1. The crap-peddlers/fearmongers
2. the gullible paranoiacs
3. the critical thinkers</p>

<p>These categories blend, but they give a general idea of the differences. Could mention that fear of ridicule often keeps many more people silent about their questions about alternative viewpoints, so meaningful constructive dialogue on these issues is difficult.</p>

<p>If you want an overview of the major theories and topics, I&#39;d say UFOs/aliens, New World Order, 9/11, and JFK naturally. Make sure that a distinction is made between different kinds of theories. There&#39;s a HUGE difference between people who give a crap about Obama&#39;s birth certificate and people who think that the CIA killed JFK. <a href="http://conspiraciesthatweretrue.blogspot.com/2007/03/conspiracy-theory-rating-scale.html">http://conspiraciesthatweretrue.blogspot.com/2007/03/conspiracy-theory-rating-scale.html</a></p>

<p>When is this presentation due?</p>

<p>I&#39;d say that 9/11 and JFK would be good ones considering the amount of evidence. Then maybe UFOs considering <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gyf6s/i_submitted_this_to_reddit_but_it_may_get_buried/">all of the recent govt. and military witnesses, and the french cometa report</a>.</p>

<p>edit: added ufo witness link</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any examples? I&#39;m having trouble thinking of any. Even the really wacky ones that I can recall haven&#39;t necessarily been proven false, but they have so little supporting evidence that they simply aren&#39;t worth giving much credence. Like David Icke&#39;s reptilian conspiracy, or the end of the world on 2012, or a hollow earh. Oh, okay, hollow earth, flat earth society... yeah I can&#39;t think of any others at the moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you mentioned supporting evidence, that&#39;s a good sign. Can&#39;t think of many off of the top of my head that won&#39;t be shot down by &#39;begging the question&#39; (Or the equivalent of, as it&#39;s generally impossible to prove anything to most conspiracy theorists as they always find a way to negate it).</p>

<p>An imperative question would be to whom the conspiracies are proven false. I&#39;d say a good 99% of people are now happy with Obama&#39;s birth certificate, does that count as proven? what about the moon, i&#39;d say a good 99.9% (pulled out of my arse) believe that we went there, so what&#39;s the cut-off point?</p>

<p>Sorry If i&#39;m rambling, just finished work and I&#39;m rather tired.</p>

<p>Edit: Fucks me off why I&#39;m getting downvoted, I don&#39;t agree with what you posted first but it definately adds to the discussion so I didn&#39;t downvote it, I thought what I asked is a pretty legitimate question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t downvote you. It happens though when you talk about controversial issues. Don&#39;t take it personally.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that you can really go by a democratic evaluation of the validity of a theory in determining whether it is proven to be false or true, especially when the voting body hasn&#39;t examined the evidence on the issues in detail with an objective and skeptical perspective.</p>

<p>The birth certificate issue, while trivial, is still not proven. When the white house chose to release a pdf of the document including multiple different layers of images, they provided fuel to the conspiracy theory that it is a forged document. A single digital document doesn&#39;t disprove the birthers&#39; beliefs, no matter how silly or irrelevant they may be.</p>

<p>As for the moon landing, yes, there may be a good consensus that we went there, that none of the landings were faked - and there are still people who have unanswered questions. Or questions for which the answers do not fulfill a reasonable objective skepticism.</p>

<p>I understand where you&#39;re coming from. Most conspiracy theories are not given credence by 99% of the population, and not all of the 99% have actually invested the time to examine the evidence of the topics.</p>

<p>Imagine, if you will, that a single person out of a million has a new idea about how the world works, and has the intelligence to put it together into a workable hypothesis supported by evidence, and has the balls to declare it publicly when he is likely to be persecuted. Is that man&#39;s theory disproven because he is a minority of 0.0001%? Or if, say, you have maybe a hundred people who agree with him, that&#39;s still only 0.001%. How many revolutionary scientists have had to go against the status quo to be proven right? Yes of course it&#39;s not a perfect analogy because science is different from history or politics, but the principle of being correct independent from the opinion or beliefs of the majority still applies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Conspiracy theory&quot; is the term used by conspirators or those who are willfully blind to conspiracies.  I&#39;d avoid using <em>their</em> term.  </p>

<p>For instance, when talking about 9/11, I&#39;d talk about the presence of thermite, the fact that Marvin Bush&#39;s security firm had the security contract at WTC from 1999 with an end date (set 18 months in advance) of September 11, 2001.  I&#39;d talk about the people who heard explosions; the radio transmissions of firemen in WTC who reported bombs going off.  That Dick Cheney had organized war games and high-jack scenarios for that precise day in order to confuse the Air Force and air traffic controllers.</p>

<p>For myself, I&#39;m not interested in &quot;conspiracies,&quot; I&#39;m interested in the details of an official narrative that don&#39;t add up.  The red flags.</p>

<p>Conspirators and the willfully blind/ignorant want to bundle up all those details -- without looking at any individually, much less as a whole -- and simply dismiss them as &quot;conspiracy theories.&quot;</p>

<p>And there is ample precedence for this.  It works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things like JFK, WTC7, Bin Laden, Gulf of Tonkin, etc while all containing lots of true &#39;conspiracy&#39;, are actually fairly trivial in the large scheme of things. </p>

<p>The only real conspiracy worth study is Central Banking; specifically, the creation of money out of thin-air, loaning it into existence with interest attached. All of those printing presses are owned by someone, and it just happens to be the same set families over and over. </p>

<p>They have used the creation of this debt-money system to enslave the world, for once you control a nations money supply, their laws are meaningless (to paraphrase one of those family members). </p>

<p>This groups plan has 3 distinct phases, two of which are already complete and we are in transition to the third currently: </p>

<p>(a) Phase 1 was removal of the aristocracy and instituting the notion of public-owned resources (ie. democracy and public owned debt). </p>

<p>(b) Phase 2 was to load up these quasi-autonomous regions with increasing debt (via fake wars and general collectivist policies), eventually creating so much debt that a worldwide default takes place. </p>

<p>(c) Phase 3 will be to collapse all countries and do away with any notion of representative government. All of humanity will then be owned directly by their pan-national banking corporation(s). Once they have direct ownership, they will need to massively scale back the population (to prevent revolt), so wave after wave of death will sweep the planet resulting in a population reduced by 90%. Your family will probably be one of them, since educated people with a true understanding of history will, by necessity, need to be removed. </p>

<p>The final result will be a neo-feudalistic construct, with all labor being directly harnessed to explicitly serve this thin layer of ruling elite. Think of the back-breaking labor of slaves building the pyramids, with the all-seeing eye hovering above it....for that&#39;s the analogy they themselves use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a set up! If he finds conspiracy theories to be true then nobody will trust him again and he will never get a position that matters in the hierarchy. The Rotary Club is part of the recruiting system for the NWO. It is far from the round tables (Bilderberg, Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Club of Rom, UN, Royal Institute of International Affairs), but people are supposed to cooperate and digest the ideas of the globalist and unite the people with the same ideas. It is a way to control every person in the world by making them complicit and bring them under different umbrelas, but at last instance they are controlled by the Rothschild dynasty, central bankers and european oligarchs. The ones on the top of the pyramid of the Rotary Club are the ones that are lead by bigger leaders of bigger pyramids above them. Same goes for Free Masons, Satanists, Opus Dei, etc.</p>

<p>Ask him if he has investigated where all the money is going they raise for &quot;charity&quot;. If it leads him to population control of third world countries, the financing of depopulation methods, wars and weapons then he has done his research right. He does not need another conspiracy to realise what is going on there. If he wants to test them then he should stage criticism for royal families, the Rothschilds or the globalist institutions and round tables. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest conspiracy theory is that our news outlets don&#39;t shift the truth or lie for the benefit of the government. Most Americans believe what they&#39;re told on the nightly news or read in the paper is researched truth when in fact, a lot of it is just a cover story to misled or deny the public the truth. Sometimes this is understandable, others times this is reprehensible.</p>

<p>The main thing I would tell his audience is not to just blindly hear the story without also checking alternative news outlets for a completely different version or possibilities of events and then decide for themselves what probably really happened or what the truth really is.  </p>
