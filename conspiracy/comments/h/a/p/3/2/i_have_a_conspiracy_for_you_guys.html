       A couple days ago I was listening to
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9RiRfMYVlQ">
        The
        <strong>
         1962's
        </strong>
        The Ultimate Revolution speech by Aldous Huxley
       </a>
       (to save time 34:00-the end) and was reminded of
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUvGvh2k_Dc">
        this presentation from Jesse Schell, CEO and Creative Director of Schell Games
       </a>
       , (
       <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/videos/44277/dice-2010-design-outside-the-box-presentation/">
        whole version
       </a>
       ).  Jesse’s speech always hit a cord with me, since it could be relatively easy to control people’s behaviors through a point system.  Just look at reddit and the amount of karma whores… I kid, I kid… but seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the past week I have been thinking about how the whole “theoretical” “Big Brother” system could be brought about through the Aldous Huxley’s point of view of “learning to love one’s servitude”.   This is when it got weird, the other day I start surfing around and read this serendipitous
       <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/05/11/technology/google_android_at_home/?section=money_latest">
        article
       </a>
       .  Google’s new platform seems like it would be the foundation for creating something along the lines of what Jesse Schell was talking about.  The amazing things is this announcement was made in light of
       <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2384751,00.asp">

       I had no doubt. I care little for myself, as I wear my opinion on my online sleeve willingly, but I truly fear for society in general when all their information is compiled into a huge database. The stuff we say online now, even if it is completely legal, could get us killed in years to come if our government collapses into fascism.

       The holocaust for the most part was a lie.  Has ever occurred to you why people were sent to camps in Germany?  First of all, there were not 6 millions jews in Germany anyway.  Far less than that.  Only about 500,000.  Anyway, the put jews, dissentors, handicapped, and others in camps for the labor.  Not to kill them.  The people were fed well.  All the germans wanted from the inmates were free labor.  The people who died in those camps died of natural causes.  You've been lied to.  The Germans treated those inmates a hell of a lot better than the US treats those in Guantanamo bay that's for sure but you'll never hear about that.
       <br/>
       If Hitler really wanted to kill the jews, why not just let the USA bomb the crap out of them?   Why not put them on the front lines of battle?   Why not just shoot them?   Nah, they put them in camps to get free labor out of them.

       If they gassed the jews in concentration camps then how did they run a counterfeit money operation out of there?   Well, once you think about it, it makes absolutely no sense to march jews to a camp and let them sit in a camp for months waiting to be killed.  It eats up money and resources.  The only sense it would make is if they used these jews in the camps to finance the war......which they did, dumbfuck.   They used a counterfeit money operation to finance the war.

       who was that "Dumbfuck" directed at? Regardless, considering an alternative narrative to the holocaust has been low on my priority list since its such a sensitive subject among some people. That, and there is still some pretty profound images of starving prisoners and mass graves that came out of those events. But the points made here do make sense. Perhaps I'll give that chapter of history another look some time.

       why the fuck would the Germans waste time, money, and resources housing a bunch of jews in camps?  It makes no sense.  It would make more sense to shoot them on sight.  It only makes sense if you understand why the Germans wanted to house jews and dissenters in the camps.  The reason was that they used these people to finance the war.  They ran a counterfeit money operation out of those camps.

       Jews and non-jews in some concentration camps,  played soccer, had swimming pools, theater, and great medical care.  Do you think those in Guantanamo bay had those things?

       This generation got addicted to the net. We got free porn, free warez, free music, free ways to meet friends and make work connections and learn marketable skills and how to beat that 8-bit game we played as kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next one is being raised with the familiarity and expectation of being connected 24/7, everywhere. Today's kids think nothing of logging their love life, their mistakes, their work history online for all to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next one won't know a world without absolute surveillance.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that wasn't the plan all along, well, kudos on all those finding ways to turn a free means of communication into such a profitable, global surveillance tool.

       Has nobody here read Manufacturing Consent? The modern internet is the
       <strong>
        perfect
       </strong>
       manifestation of Chomsky's theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be accepted that this is the reality we live in, but it should also be recognised that this is not some totalitarian big-brother manipulation of our reality, but rather an inevitable function of a free market society.
      </p>
      <p>
       We
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       told what to think, what to buy, how to vote, but not by some singular shadowy puppetmaster; simply by a societal construct that allows corporate hegemony to influence buying power. The term 'vote with your pocket' has never been more appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Support your underdog, buy items that reflect your personal values, learn to read the news behind the MSM agendas, but don't give in to the tempting-but-paranoid idea that you're being controlled by a totalitarian media machine.

       <p>
        but don't give in to the

       When the MSM tells me that we are in the middle east to liberate the people there.  While Chomsky himself says "
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=TcX23O7RqQQ#at=28">
        Across the [Middle East], the overwhelming majority of the population regards the United States as the main threat to their interests," Chomsky says. "The reason is very simple ... Plainly, the U.S. and allies are not going to want governments, which are responsive to the will of the people. If that happens, not only will the U.S. not control the region, but it will be thrown out.
       </a>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM is the mouth piece of the military industrial complex, and they have been controlling the populations opinions for sometime.  Look at WMD, Jessica Lynch, Pat Tillman, Nayirah (testimony), Incubator babies, The Pentagon Papers.  Doesn't matter if the conspiracy was figured out later, so long as the masses believed them when it mattered.

       Of course, but understand why that is allowed to happen. MSM wants sellable news by the cheapest means necessary. Acting as the press committee for the MIC is in their interests, so it's your responsibility to consume news responsibly.

       Chomsky is a jew.  Fuck him.  Anyway, yes, people blindly put their money into bad things but there is also a conspiracy going on with the media in terms of Facebook and Apple and probably some other companies.  They use persuasive ways of making people dumb and to get them to put their money into things that inevitably will enslave them.

       Yes and no.  Technology lets us interact with the outside world now more than ever before.  Big brother is out there, and it is an unavoidable consequence of greater access.  The access is a two way street.  I do not think it is a grand conspiracy though.  Too many entities with different goals to be a uniform conspiracy.  I think each entity is feeding off the other to reach their goal.  However, the greater technology the greater our ability to uncover and expose the activities.  I think we need to step back a little and look at this in a historical perspective.  Technology has given the average person much more access to information and knowledge, in a way making us more independent thinking.  The "global community" that tech. has created has also made our individual  success more tied to the success of the collective.  Either way we as humans are at this time more in control of our own individual destiny than at any other time in modern history, obviously there are exceptions to this statement but for the Western world this mostly holds true.

       I know for a fact that the IPAD is no coincidence at all and it's no coincidence that the media on TV is plugging that damn thing every 5 minutes, either.  They are going to use the IPAD or similar devices to force you to pay for entertainment again instead of getting it online for free.  IPAD is a closed system computer which means you can't alter it in anyway.  I've never used an IPAD but I assume there is no copy/paste application.  You can't copy files and reproduce them.  Right?   IPAD is not compatible with file sharing apps.   And they keep using a word like "APP" as if it's some new kind of thing that no one has heard of.  It's a fucking program just like on a PC, the only difference is that the normal joe blow can't make his own programs, it has to be Ok'D by fucking Apple before you use it.  That's a big difference between a PC and a closed system device like an IPAD.  BIG FUCKING DIFFERENCE.  That'd be like Bill Gates telling me that I can't use my Full Tilt Poker program to play poker because they don't allow it on my Compaq computer.  It's the same thing.  Do you want that?  I sure don't so I don't buy any apple products.

Anyway, yes, people blindly put their money into bad things but there is also a conspiracy going on with the media in terms of Facebook and Apple and probably some other companies.
