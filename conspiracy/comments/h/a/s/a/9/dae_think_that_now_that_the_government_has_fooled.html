       I'm predicting that the Government will find the "master secret plans for 9/11" on the so called hard drives. Of course they will find other plans to attack, churches, schools and shopping malls so they can get the TSA groping anyone anywhere and at anytime.

       The whole story stinks to high heaven. Right before election would be perfect timing for Obama to come up with that one. But don't ask questions because that means you hate America. What else can they fool Americans into thinking?
      </p>
      <p>
       The war on terror is for Americans not terrorists. In the mean time people are voting up a high schoolers challenge to M. Bachmann and they themselves can't see that their constitution is completely being destroyed because of a fake war on terror. So keep voting left vs right crap morons your country is being taken down from within.

       Yes, and they already said they found in his 'diary' how he was longing to attack small and mid-size towns (psyops: be afraid Akron Ohio!).

       The notion of his 'diary' could only be foisted upon a people who drink as much fluoride as we do.

        "Dear Diary: I've been feeling slighted by Al-Zawahari lately...he never seems he wants to visit. Oh gee diary, how I wish I could attack more small towns in America. After all the planning I did for 911 and luckily were able to knock down 3 buildings with only two planes (what luck! Maybe I should take up bowling, lol!). Anyway, I did get a new TV today...maybe I will video tape myself watching some of the channels. Thats always fun...xxoo"

       That place looked like a Detroit crack house.  Yea, I could definitely see him squatting in front of that crappy little TV plotting how he was going to take down NORAD again on the back of a dirty pizza box.

       If they do 'find' a copy of "My Sekrit Plan by Osama", they'll only let out extremely vague details about it. I mean, to write a fake Sekrit Plan would be actually quite difficult. (Way too many problems in the narrative that the Sekrit Plan would have to skirt.)
