       Should there not be some attempt to organize and even strategize about how to best use this platform to alert people about the serious issues being discussed in this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we focus our efforts on a few well thought out entries we can make a serious impact. Considering how many people now are aware of how much we have been lied too, and how obviously it can be demonstrated to a rationally operating mind, why is it so hard to reach critical mass? What are we doing wrong or aren´t er doing right?
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is on our side, we know that. How can we create the hype necessary on some of the most urgent topics?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what probably most of realize is that these issues are of such significance that we can´t expect everyone to agree on everything. About an 80% frequency of shared understanding on these issues should be enough too unite for a common goal and just settle the last 20% later. In this respect, the "right/left" debate is completely irrelevant. So is division over preset ideologies and details. Let´s get the power back to the people. Than we can start discussing the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a sidenote, if critical mass can be achieved, I think our best option would be to as publicly as possible, demand open negotiation between those that we have recognized as major players in these conspiracies and consensus based representatives of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really needs to end is the age old war of the elites and the commoners. I´m not sure a bloody and gruesome final showdown is the best way to go about it. They may not have a lot of compassion, but they seem to have good logic, and if we could demonstrate that they were being thoroughly exposed by a majority of the population, they would surely be looking for a peaceful way out.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my view it is critical that we give such an opportunity, instead of demanding their deaths, and thus ensuring that they must fight us to the last breath of their existence with any tactics necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any thoughts on how this can be accomplished?

       I thought that's why many of us are here anyway.  How else are we going to learn the ways of the Illuminati, NWO, Freemasons, Lucifarians, or Reptilians?  This subreddit is 66% bots, 22% tinfoil hat/curious, 1% schizophrenics, and 10% Illuminati operatives working to bring about the

       There's only a handful of conspiracy websites.  I'm sure many of us here also frequent one or two of the others.  Reddit is not THE network, but it is an important part of it.  It's an important platform for sharing data, but not for directing action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there is a revolution going on right now, but this revolution must happen without direction.  We can't tell people what to do, or what to think.  You may feel that you have this bright new light of Truth, but if you start shining it in people's faces you will only encourage defensiveness.  Besides; telling people what the truth is, is infringing on their right to freewill.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the world changes, more and more people will be kicked out of their simple worldview and be looking for a worldview that better explains their observed reality.  Our job is to be there when they decide to look for us.  Our job is to trailblaze a path for others to find.  We must encourage the conditions for the revolution, but not impose our expectations on the world.  To act without acting.  To do what is right for you, don't lecture others on what's right for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The music is already playing.  Don't try to beat the drums to your own tune, learn to sync yourself to the rhythm that is already playing.  Resonate with the theme that feels best for you if you want to be a part of the music.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr "Uniting" rhetoric is fascist, that's not the revolution we need.

       Part of the problem is likely the habit of posting to the conspiracy website, as opposed to the original source of the information.  Dialog is hard to initiate if the information is discredited (fairly or unfairly) based upon the source URL.  The message can be lost before it is even transmitted.

       I think that's part of our role.  Who plays the gatekeepers?  An elite hierarchy of corporate stakeholders, or an organic network of concerned citizens?  We're quickly replacing the old structures and we're not very good at it yet.  So we practice.  You can't dance your first time out.  We watch what others do, match what we like, change what we don't.  Etch your perspective on to the groupthink's creation.  Each post is much more then a link, it's also what the hivemind does with it.  Not every source is going to be very credible.  Everyone's got a bias, and everyone's got interests to protect.  We're here to sort through the shit to find our own credible worldview, then resonate with it.  Obviously there's not just one correct worldview.  We make the world rich with a diversity of perspective.  If you start lecturing people on what websites are credible, and which ones are just biased propaganda, you're just trying to impose your worldview.  There is no objective truth of which to measure bias.

       My previous comment was not intended as a lecture regarding credibility of any particular website insomuch as seeing an alternative way of putting forth the same information without triggering the preconceived bias that the intended audience might already have.
      </p>
      <p>
       The role is not to validate/invalidate websites, but it is foolhardy not to take into account the preconceived bias of one's target audience.  For instance, I could link to
       <a href="http://www.infowars.com/at-reactor-damage-worse-than-feared/">
        At Reactor, Damage Worse Than Feared
       </a>
       , from which I must certainly realize that many of the hive will immediately dismiss without so much as a glance, purely on the URL.  If I choose, instead, to link to
       <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703730804576318470827245128.html?mod=WSJ_hp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsThird">
        At Reactor, Damage Worse Than Feared
       </a>
       (original source), it is less likely to suffer from being immediately dismissed due to the preconceived bias of many in the hive mind.  I've got nothing personal against Jones.  I just use his site as an obvious example.

       As concerned citizens, are we not served more by a dialog regarding truth, rather than fighting over the credibility of a website?  Linking
       <em>
        unnecessarily

       to what some consider a questionable website (again, fairly or unfairly) only dilutes and interferes with the dialog.

       I agree with you, I'm just pointing out how it's also important to do our part not to play into preconceived notions of who's credible and who's not.  On r/conspiracy we may post an Alex Jones article (for example), so as a concerned citizen you then find a more palatable version of the information to pass on the r/news, politics, economics, whatever.  However, at r/conspiracy I think we make the assumption that people choose to be here because they've already made the choice to start down the rabbit hole.

       This question suggests I'm not aware of the objective reality that I'm in r/conspiracy. Which is effectively a snide assessment that my opinion (that there is rabid downvoting in r/conspiracy) is wholly inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask you to explain your comment or at the very least expand on the passive aggressive nature of your comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       To which you suggest I don't really know how the r/conspiracy community works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here you are suggesting there is no wild downvoting in r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, someone who has been here for 5 years would have noticed the downvoting, right?

       Explain why you said this:

        At the time he was at 29up/9down

      <p>
       How did I get the order wrong? What were you referring to when you said "at the time"?  Did you mean something other than at the time I commented?

       you keep using that word.  Sure you can say it means nebulous but why not just use that word?  Obtuse has primarily a different connotation.  Do you at least agree with that?

       Wait, so are you here to spread propaganda? Who do you work for? I understand 'disinfo agents' need to exist, so I won't be angry if you say yes. I would be very fascinated and would have a dozen questions, one would be asking for a job lol. Hey, if you can't beat them, join them. Right? But seriously, if you have knowledge spill some please.

       Obviously, I cannot confirm nor deny the assumption you're making.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing a disinfo agent would never admit to being one, as that would run counter to their very goals, whatever they may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, I suspect nobody really think of themselves as a disinfo agent. Was the facebook snowjob on google's privacy practices an act of disinformation? Maybe. Yet none of the items used were false, and the folks working at the company hired to do it don't think of themselves as "disinfo agents".
(Note that these things happen all the time, the difference being that they're usually done much better, and don't get exposed this way.)

       If you like that line of business, you'll want to get a job at a PR firm. You're not doing anything with that soul anyhow.

       r/conspiracy has a bad connotation with it. if ya'll really wanna get some good press you should get sneaky and create another subreddit with a dem/rep-friendly name like r/indienews or r/ireport. that way you won't get the insane number of downvotes (mostly by people who don't read or contribute to the discussion) that happen to come w/ the r/conspiracy tag.

       Yeah but people think they're posting "valuable" information when they link to dumb youtube videos about Reptilians and other nonsensical idiocy. The problem is that these people, who honestly and legitimately believe the hogwash they read about, have just as much saying power as others who may be much more informed. Then, when someone posts something of actual merit, the Reptilian bullshit gets more upvotes than truthful submissions.

       Truth. I just wish that in order to post you must also provide credible sources (ie not shitty quality youtube videos done by some guy in his basement). I know that many would say that since it's a conspiracy there are no credible sources. And in some cases that may be true, and I'm willing to broaden my definition of "credible sources" in these cases, but some of the stuff that's posted here is utter (Dale Gribble level) bullshit. I joined here to learn about how the government is working illegally with corporations and other such cover-ups. Wikileaks type shit. And while I'm ranting, I'll just go ahead and say it: Why do so many here post links to RT (Russia Today)? Can't you see that everything they print/put on TV is the most bias crap around. I'd rather listen to O'Riley than the crap on RT. Some of you need to take a college course where you're required to write a report backed up with credible sources. I bet many here would fail.

       This is exactly how I feel, there are so many of us that dedicate so much time to the spreading of truth that we would be hard to ignore if we all came together and worked toward a goal. The only thing standing in our way is all the disinformation that we need to sift through.

       dear OP,
      </p>
      <p>
       I absolutely agree we should forcefully interject ourselves into the attention spans of broader audiences. I see two main obstacles that must be dealt with before this is possible. First and foremost, it seems that many here, despite believing sincerely in their pet causes, have fallen for the trap of believing they, themselves, are just as illegitimate as the mainstream assumes them to be. This standpoint causes many to conclude supporting these causes is either ethically or rationally inappropriate in some way. The other issue, as I'm sure you would expect, is simply an issue of credibility. It will take a very particular message indeed to inspire the unified support of this board's participants, and that message will likely require a further specificity still if it is to be accepted by the mainstream rather than ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       for this to be accomplished, we need volunteers interacting willfully, not coincidental agreement in public discussions.

       r/conspiracy should choose a time each day (let's say 1pm eastern time for example) where the most important r/conspiracy story of the day is posted to r/politics and upvoted by the everyone.  It's not so much gaming Reddit if we keep it to one story a day, plus, it might even help r/politics learn a thing or two.

       To start off, I would recommend everyone educate themselves on the nature of the conspiracy we all face. The best source of information on it is actually the Illuminati's own website, and they've been updating it with a new article every so often (it seems to be once every 2 weeks). Who knows, if we educate ourselves en masse we may be potential candidates for joining the Illuminati ourselves, as they are always searching for more members.

       I have many questions, I'll ask a few. They clam to be the one true religion, with proof, right? What or who exactly do they worship? They also clam to be protectors of some great secret and if the public ever found out it would cause a violent upheaval or "cataclysm" as he put it. Are you aware of this secret? I'm not religious myself, but I am open to the idea of a supreme creator of some sort. I just need to see the evidence. How could they possibly know something like that? It seems to me that they are simply lying about it to make themselves seem more powerful, a man made secret. Like, only the people at the tip top know it's a lie but the 'Illuminati' members below them truly believe in this secret god and it gives them a feeling of self-worth because they belong to a powerful organization. They use the lie to keep their members obedient and in order... That's my secular take on it because like I said I find it hard to believe in god but I don't rule it out completely. Or maybe the secret is that we have ET creators? And did they create all the other religions for some hidden reason? And lastly for now, why do they hate the human race so much?

       Worship may be a misnomer, but for the sake of answering your question I'll say that they worship the eternal soul that resides in all of us. Only the human spirit is capable of assimilating with God, at least for now.

       The depths of which the human mind can conceptualize is solid proof of God itself. The human mind is so powerful it can experience more thoughts than particles in the universe.The Illuminati go back very far, before the Illuminati
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       the Illuminati (Pythagoras is responsible for turning it into an official organization, before then Illuminists were just nomadic mystics that held on to extremely ancient pieces of mankind's secret history). Many thousands of years ago, people were
       <strong>
        much
       </strong>
       more aware of the nature of reality and the universe itself. These people were responsible for tracking and interpreting the shifting of constellations as a representative concept of the evolutionary pathway our Milky Way is taking us on, which determines our cognitive abilities. These were the first people to be able to chronicle the rate of our evolution, within our specific galaxy. Henceforth, the mysteries of the workings of the universe were revealed for mankind to utilize but most of that information has been destroyed by the lineage of the conspirators we're familiar with.

       You seem to be very close to the greatest epiphany of your lifetime. Let me say this: Anything that requires belief in is
       <strong>
        AUTOMATICALLY FALSE
       </strong>
       . Belief asserts submission to falsifications, which is the natural enemy of all truth. If you seek the truth long enough and with the strongest objectivity, you will become aware of who you really are and why you truly exist.

       No, their (our) enemy did. This requires an extremely lengthy description of how and why, which is actually all laid out on

        the Illuminati's site

       This is the furthest thing from the truth. Without them, I highly doubt the human race would be able to save itself.

Only Jews are capable of such a betrayal against mankind, since it was their lineage that first began this 10,000 year-old plot to permanently enslave the population.

       I think it should be noted that the "Illuminati" you're referring to is actually just another ploy by the same conspirators, since only they have access to the spread of information (media moguls) they can deceive potential truth-seekers into fighting their own allies with the spreading of misinformation and propaganda. That's the reason there are so many videos and blogs about the Illuminati being a Satanic NWO Reptilian cult, because of how much influence those in power have, they masterfully conceive a way to effortlessly but effectively mislead people into such misinterpretations. And anyone reading this with the idea that the Illuminati are our sworn enemy are victims of more disinformation campaigns and mental ploys. Without the Illuminati, we would not have experienced any revolutions. To be frank, we would most likely be in a third-world status. This disinformation/misinformation/propaganda is explained in detail on their site as well.

       I never thought getting high on information was possible, but I feel like I'm staring through a small hole in a gigantic window with the universe on the other side, emitting rays brighter than the sun but they don't hurt my eyes. You seem so smart and wise to all of this, my gut is telling me to trust your words and I trust my gut 100% of the time...
      </p>
      <p>
       So you are aware of the secret? Can you divulge any info about it? If not, can you at least give me a hint or clue, a starting point so I can continue obsessing only with some actual direction?
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes sense that mankind's secret history was held onto (or guarded) by the brightest and most powerful people of the time. I don't understand how this knowledge came to exist. Was it acquired through discovery? Created by the elite through poetry and power for secret reasons? or possibly handed down to humans? You said it was revealed for mankind to utilize, why would anyone want to destroy something so precious? I am most curious about this. Why would they allow our species grow ignorant and stupid? Is this the works of their enemy? Are the Jews the enemy? And does the Illuminati try to stop them at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard the Knights Templar were sort of the original Illuminati. I know they had the wealth, but did they have the knowledge? Then they disappeared underground for centries and slowly emerged very powerful because they infiltrated the free masons, our government and other elitist groups. Sorry, I feel like I'm all over the place, is this making any sense?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it was a misnomer when I said they lied about the secret. What I tried to say was this; Is it possible that the early humans didn't quite understand what they were thinking about, so the conclusions they passed down were actually just very poetic feelings or ideas about the nature of our existence?
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you are right about me being close to an epiphany because I strive for it literally 24/7. You're last paragraph cleared up so many things for me, it's starting to make sense.(I hope) One thing I still don't understand, if the Illuminati really is trying to protect mankind from our enemy, why does it seem like they're loosing? With the massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the super rich at the top, millions loosing their homes, soon millions will be starving to death, 85% of college graduates move back home, jobs are gone. I am about to turn 24 and I'm quickly loosing hope and the will to go on and honestly I put that moderately. I fear the remainder of my life will be fighting to keep my soul afloat.

       The reason you ask this question and why you don't understand it is because you have a soul. To answer briefly, it's because God stands in Satan's way for ultimate control and power. If everyone was spiritually aware, Satan would cease to exist.

       The original Illuminists were just nomadic mystics that traveled around and kept pieces of ancient history safe, some were found by the enemy and horrifically slaughtered while their works and manuscripts were burned. Hypatia was one of these unfortunate cases, she was a Greek philosopher with extensive knowledge of astronomy. The Knights Templar, like Freemasonry, was a creation of the Illuminati to reach out to more people. That's really all it was, as for the direction that the Knights Templar took I'm not sure and no one really is.

       Nope, they completely and perfectly understood everything about the nature of reality and whatever could come of it. The whole "Mayan calendar 2012 z0mg" thing was actually just an extension of this. The Mayans were able to pinpoint the exact rate of evolution according to the constellations, and we are nearing the end of our first stage. Our next stage of evolution is hyperreality, which we're actually seeing early.

Every day I have to go out and figure out how to get money to eat, as many Americans probably do. The best advice I can give is to be optimistic, if you keep a strong will you can help accelerate this process. A good goal to set is helping Ron Paul win the presidency, for starters.

       I can't thank you enough for taking the time to answer my long messages. I shall spend my days on that website reading. I am beginning to realize that pretty much everything I thought I knew about the Illuminati was wrong, thanks to the propaganda and disinfo spread by the enemy. Now I just need to figure out what the Jews motivation is, their motive's and goals. Is it a power thing? Are they striving to rule Earth and human beings? I know they own and control just about all of the mainstream media, Hollywood, the major cable networks; shitty reality tv shows and sports entertainment etc, the education system, the US government, and other giant aspects of the typical daily life of an average American. Am I wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know anything about the aliens? I kind of knew that life is abundant throughout the universe. How could it not be!? Actually, for a while I thought they might be the enemy the Illuminati speaks of. Why haven't they presented themselves to us? Maybe they know we are not ready? Can some really take the form of a human and walk among us to perhaps study us? Are they extra dimensional, existing in a higher density or whatever? Can they read our thoughts? What are their goals? Have they infiltrated the military industrial complex? I know these are big questions, I'm just so f'in curious about them. But, I have seen no evidence or proof so I'm still on the fence. I feel so small lol. Correction, I am so small. Thanks again for your time and patience. Much love.

       Reeks of sensational bullshit. A pro tip to keep in mind when stumbling upon propaganda such as this is replace "Illuminati" with "the elite" and it won't be as confusing. People confuse the two, despite them being polar opposites.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Illuminati have a few free ebooks available for download on their site that they consider extremely important reading. The books were written by a ghost writer hired by one of the members of the Illuminati, I have all of them in my ebook library if you'd like me to upload them for you.

       Yes of course, I would love if you did that. No rush, do it when you have the time. I actually think I heard of them, it's like a series of 3 or 4 books?

       Do you think the masses will ever be able to wake up to this reality without being blinded by Jewish propaganda and other bullshit? I think it will take 50 - 100 years for every single person to 'wake up' spiritually. Does the Illuminati even want that? I think it's easier for my generation and younger, but it's my parents generation and their parents who might never wake up. I try to enlighten my mother to the best of my current abilities, but she is just so extremely brainwashed, it's actually really sad. She doesn't even believe in an elite ruling class and I can't convince her otherwise, at all! I think she will die never knowing why she existed or what her soul really feels like... not that I do, but I like to think I get closer and closer to the universe and myself everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sidenote: Is the Illuminati really trying to reduce the population to under 1 billion? That's another NWO thing people always rant about. It sounds more like the Jews want that, but people only associate population reduction to the Illuminati.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is your take on the afterlife? Does you're soul really move on? Does it depend on how you lived your life, if you were good, eternal bliss, if bad, you burn? It all seems like fear mongering to me. And do other 'nonthinking' animals have souls, if so they should pass on as well, right? I find it hard to believe that any living person knows 100% what happens, but I'd like to hear your opinion.

       Nope, we simply don't have the time to waste sitting around for these ignorant fuckheads to wise up and do something for once in their meaningless lives. The Illuminati only want the heroes, i.e. the people who take it upon themselves to right the wrongs and to stand up for the truth.

       I was there too but I stopped caring and decided the best course of action would be to let it go, it's not up to me to help everyone, especially those that don't want it. Who

       worry about these people anyway? They are a waste of resources, they simply live for the sake of not being dead. That's about it. Your time on Earth is finite and if you waste it trying to cure others, you would take away from the better experiences you could have in place of the time you spent trying to enlighten the ignorant hordes of dumbfucks.

       The word "God" is actually an acronym. It stands for:

       <li>
        Generation
       </li>

       God is what generates you, operates you, and is where you return when you die. Upon death you lose your physical body but your soul remains intact. Honestly the best idea of death that I can give you is through the music of death metal,

       It is the culmination of all truth ever expressed in your lifetime, but yes, absolutely. If your true motives behind your life were to deceptively fuck other people over with the intent to benefit only you at the cost of them,
       <strong>
        THAT
       </strong>
       truth will become visible to you upon death (as if people like George Bush and Obama didn't make it obvious enough...). All the morally correct things you've done throughout your life will glow with an amplification that only death can express (even simple tasks as helping people cross the street, or providing someone with medical aid). The stronger your spirit is, the stronger influence you will have over every particle in the entire universe. At the base of
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       is just a thought, and the willpower expressed by thoughts brands a "species" (even matter is entirely thoughts, however at a specific unique frequency).

       <em>
        Everything

       has a soul. That's what generates such uniqueness throughout the universe. Look at Earth, even the human population. NO one is the same, we are all different in our very own ways. It doesn't matter how small the organism is, there is a soul in everything. But yes, even they do. Animals just aren't as mature as we are, spiritually.

       I've always been a huge metalhead, love it... Yes, that is what I meant by masses, the waste of resources, the empty loads of protoplasm, constantly breeding, polluting, for they know nothing else. I can't help but feel bad for them because the sensation I feel from even slight enlightenment is incredible. But I can't see my pity for them lasting long. If they need to fill the hole in their soul with t.v.,booze, food, children and other garbage and spend zero time filling it with knowledge then so be it. You're right, you can't waste time trying to change them. I can't even describe right now the feeling of obtaining these small puzzle pieces to this grand puzzle. It lifts depression, it actually makes me feel like a little kid again or something. I'm not being cliché, that's how it feels. I have much to learn and it's exciting.

       If pulled off properly, cause and effect will shift some positive change throughout the world.

       If you want a message to be sent across tho. I recommend something within the aspects of sustainability/food/permaculture. Why? 80% of the entire globes environment issues are caused by how we produce our food (un-sustainably) as well as many of the economic issues globally, illness, big pharma, etc etc all are effects to the root cause... destructive food.

       This forum as little to no moderation, and it's all free reign. A more focused conspiracy board, with a more active moderation would benefit. We still need rules. I'm not against people posting whatever they want. However, this subreddit is dead.

       The bin Laden operation did not go as reported.

      <ol>

        Bin Laden died years ago and he was not found and shot.  The operation was a publicity stunt.
       </li>
       <li>
        Bin Laden is currently in a secret prison somewhere being tortured.  That's why there's no evidence of a body.
       </li>
       <li>
        Bin Laden was unarmed when he was shot.  Why?  Because he knew too much.  Either he'd profess his innocence or implicate the government.

       why exactly just try to prove that we can get people to understand things... we should only upvote a single (main) post IF it is important, not upvote stuff that nobody is going to give a shit about, it has to be worth it, maybe stuff that ACTUAL FACTS show how things like 911 are inside jobs..

       I like the idea. I've often thought there must be a way to get more attention for some of these posts. It is very rare that a posting from this subreddit makes it to the front page. I don't understand why, because there is definitely interest. What are we doing wrong? Any idea?

       if discussing in another /r instead of sending direct link to site send a link which routes through r/conspiracy dicussion thread, maybe they look around conspiracy and find something that isn't insane/doesn't confuse their normalcy bias too much.

       Heh. I didn't actually read your post, but based on the title alone, I'll tell you this...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm ONLY subscribed to this subreddit so that I can see what kind of psycho bullshit you "conspiracy theorists" come up with. I love getting a good laugh in now and then, and seeing some crazy theorist ideas that are spewed out usually gets me that laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's similar to how an atheist or evolutionist would laugh at a christian or creationist (and sometimes the other way around)... nothing against the person, just don't agree with their ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would imagine there are quite a few of these 33,340 subscribers that take the same stance as I do... but good luck in your quest to the front page! It's highly unlikely that I'll downvote you unless it's something completely absurd that I would downvote anyway. (I.E. I won't downvote you strictly because I don't wanna see a conspiracy post hit front).

       I think that before you start shoving your conspiracy theories in people's faces, you should figure out what you believe in first, and why you believe it. Work together to come up with the best kind of presentation you can. Be skeptical of your own assertions, and test everything for evidence. r/skeptic won't help you (they'll just laugh and insult you), you have to be the skeptics. You're responsible for crafting the perfect argument, or a set of really great arguments, showing consequences and connections that are more than tenuous, but clear and easily confirmable. You cannot hope to just shout "9/11 was an inside job, just look at WTC7!!!1!" and expect that just by exposure you'll convince a significant majority. Your strongest weapon is reason, civility, and intellectual collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, you moron conspiratards will never have the organization or the balls to undertake such a project and see it to completion. Nobody will invest the time to read it all because they don't care, it's not relevant to their lives, and they enjoy not being stressed by things that challenge their worldview. So go and continue playing and babbling amongst yourselves about julian assange and how he's a shill or the NWO or mad cow disease, or bigfoot. You'll never win. You don't have the will, you're faint of heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yeah, and even if you DID get people to believe you, how are you going to get them to not fall for another lie? 9/11 was an inside job, eh? Who were the insiders? WAs it just bush and cheney? Oh okay, so those two were the bad guys and we'll send them to jail and continue on our way to the nwo. Haha, you loons don't stand a chance.

       I love that classic argument. If there's any opposition to what you're talking about, it's automatically a cover up, or the work of disinformation agents. This is one of the reasons people have a hard time taking you guys seriously, no matter how true the information is.
