       So now we're told that the Bin Laden compound held a
       <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/05/large_porn_stash_found_in_bin.html">
        large stash of electronic pornography
       </a>
       . The implication being, Bin Laden sat beating off in front of his monitor, when he wasn't watching tapes of himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       But could this be a two-part disinformation ploy? The first part, setting into place the (supposed) picture of Bin Laden watching himself on the television, i.e., reviewing videos he had made of himself. The second part, the little bombshell that the hard drives and thumb drives seized held large amounts of pornography.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both taken together create the implication that Bin Laden was a porn addict. Yet we don't know if he even saw the porn on the hard drives, if indeed there actually was any porn on the hard drives (or for that matter, if he hasn't been dead for ten years). It's all implication. Could it have been deliberate implication?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the CIA made a fake tape of Bin Laden and his fellows bragging about having sex with boys -- totally fake, never happened. But if the CIA was devious enough to make such a tape, why wouldn't they be devious enough to set up the implication that Bin Laden was a porn addict, in an attempt to smear his character?

       True. Very few scholars have challenged the vast tidal wave of disinformation that was put out about the Nazis by the Allies during and after WW2. The Nazis lost, "we" won, and that's how it has remained to this day, 66 years later. Those few brave souls who point out that some of what is said about Hitler may have been disinformation are attacked by crazed weasels who live to defend the status quo.

       So, entertaining the idea this porn is real and the owner was who they said: so what if the old goat watched bootleg VHS copies of Sasha Grey's latest opus? Will this have any effect on his reputation in America? No. Actually this seems like sprinkling a bit of gasoline on the wasp hive you just kicked down. Soiling the reputation of the 'admired leader' you just assassinated? Great excuse for a few wacko fundies to smear in the face of impressionable, already USA-hating young guys with nothing to lose and an itch to do some payback on the country that send a drone that made a boo-boo and blew their family during a wedding or kidnapped their cab-driving uncle and sent him to a permanent vacation to the Caribbean.

       They don't want to irk some million Islamic people with the snuff photos, but they talk about this? Nice move. You'd think they want to keep stirring things up.

       You are so bent on finding the conspiracy that you aren't finding the conspiracy.
      </p>

       They found a giant pile of pen drives. We already know they weren't all for Osama's personal file storage. They were employing couriers (read: younger men, reasonably likely not to have wives) to go to internet cafes to upload videos. The chances that ONE of them downloaded some porn are not zero. So prima facie, there is no reason for anyone to turn this into a "Osama's porn" story. That's stupid.  If you had four wives and very little to do in an enclosed compound, you'd have better things to do. (And you might not bother much if you were an old man.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Now consider that porn is a very nice vehicle for steganography, because there are all kinds of reasons to keep it hidden, particularly in Pakistan. And when it is transmitted, no one would really blink an eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the CIA wanted to make up damaging stuff about Bin Laden these days, they could easily do a real job. This is more likely a chummy leak of information which the media can sell. Osama was barely relevant before and now that he's dead he's not much more relevant, and his followers won't believe anything coming from the west anyway.
