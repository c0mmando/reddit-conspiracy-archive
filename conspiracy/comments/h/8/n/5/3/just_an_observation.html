       I was reading comments on an article about how Bin Laden's son is questioning why his father was killed and not taken in alive. What was the general response? Bin Laden's son was dismissed just like all the "conspiracy nuts" that had also brought up valid points just like a blood relative of the man had done.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Conspiracy "nuts" bring up valid points
       </p>
       <p>
        People who are "informed" dismiss points because it questions their "informed" belief.
       </p>

       Funny how people will dismiss every argument on the grounds that no matter how much proof is supplied, conspiracy nuts will never be satisfied and will still say it's bullshit, when they're essentially doing the exact same thing.  No matter who makes the claims if it's in any way shape or form different from the belief they have, it's clearly bullshit.

       I really do love how their argument boils down to me not having proof and that I'm just a nut, when they have no contradicting proof and they're just being an ignorant arrogant sheep that claims they don't feed off mainstream media and yet they go apeshit over anything that contradicts it.

       "Proof" and "evidence" are designated adjectives for things that come from "official channels", because the concepts of them come from the official channels themselves. The rabbit hole goes very deep.

       Well said. It's sad and frustrating to see how people are so conditioned by the mainsteam media; despite the countless proven facts presented to them by the 'nuts'. The good news is more people are beginning to open their eyes each day. It may take a while, but we'll get there.

       Unfortunately, when I posted the article comparing America to 1984 that's on here, it was dismissed just as quickly as it would have been if I said that Bin Laden is hanging out in Atlantis with a t-rex.

       I work for a really large cable company. One of the ideas being floated around is putting cameras on the cable boxes themselves. This is to video chat, etc. But it made me realize that 1984 isn't close, it's already here.

       More they called me various things including retard, nut, loony, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also completely ignored every point that I brought up because them saying I'm basically batshit crazy is enough to counter my points in my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's funny is here's a quote from one of them:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Don't want to hear anti-conspiracy nut "bullshit"? Too fucking bad. I'm sick of this lunacy; the paranoid delusions and irrelevant noise that drown out proper debates. Instead of debating sensibly why the US hasn't released bin Laden's corpse photos yet, what ramifications that decision could have, the legality of such direct violation of a nation's sovereignty and whether or not it was justified with regards to corruption within Pakistan's security framework; all I hear is jumping straight into the deep end with claims that the whole thing is a complete lie and 2011 is 1984.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So they basically ignore my points and then basically complain that they want to debate on a subject that they're comfortable with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they continually ask for examples, so I make up situations that could possibly happen while continually saying that it's just a scenario that I pulled from my head, and then they whine that my "paranoid delusions and irrelevant noise drown out proper debates."
      </p>
      <p>
       Well had they actually responded to my points instead of insulting me, we could be having a proper debate without the scenarios that they keep saying they want me to provide to prove to them that it's worth being worried over this

       I stated in that forum only that no matter what "proof" is supplied there will always be speculation, the other people supplied the negative connotations. I think the big question is not who is right or wrong butwhy aren't we looking into the mistrust a large number of Americans have for their country, I think that is the best way to raise the important questions.

       If you have ever spouted off an opinion on anything verbatim from some media pundit on TV as though it were your own, you'll realize what this means. That's what most people are doing - parrotting the consensus trance that is re-enforced by the media. It all goes back to assumptions - we all act on them, and changing them can be an uncomfortable process. For example, let's say 9/11 was actually carried out by 19 Saudi hijackers with boxcutters. Let's say all that is true. Now let's also allow for the possibility that these guys were simply patsies who were "allowed" to carry out their mission so that a further objective could be realized - the securitization of the USA, more wars, financial coverups, etc. Most people, especially Americans, can only think in either/or terms. Republican or Democrat. Bears or Broncos. Cowboys/Indians. Capitalism/Communism. America is a binary state. Either it was hijackers, or it was an inside job. In fact, both can be true. It is possible that the enemy was aided and abetted by internal forces. But to integrate the two would imply that one's government is not looking out for the general welfare of the population, and most people can't go down that road or integrate those thoughts. So it's easier to dismiss it as conspiracy theory than it is to critically weigh the facts and arrive at your own opinion. It's easier to parrot whatever some talking head thinks instead of doing your own research. Instead of integrating new information into your model of the world, it can be preferable to compartmentalize it. The phrase "conspiracy theory" allows us to compartmentalize any information that contributes to cognitive dissonance. Whenever new information arises that challenges our prior assumptions, we engage in confirmation bias by compartmentalizing this information as conspiracy theory. At some point, though, the number of outliers adds up, which points to a new trend.

       Right around here is where the "yeah buts" pop up, such as why people in the know have not spoken up. If t9/11 was a conspiracy, then surely someone would have spoken out by now. Well, many people have pensions, mortgages and positions of power, and those can be more important to them than the "truth". Also, in a world of extraordinary rendition, people can be "disappeared" into the prison system, suicided or murdered before their voices grow too loud.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my point is that many people watch TV, which is a world full of fantasy. It's an escape. You could make the arguement that people believe in conspiracy theories as a means of escape, because real life is so dull, and the world makes less and less sense by the day. That seems to be the most common opinion - that conspiracy theories are peoples' way of dealing with an increasingly chaotic world. But what if EVERYTHING you see on TV is a Hollywood fantasy? Spending 40 hours a week plugged into the collective hivemind is going to warp your sense of reality until reality itself appears fictional.

       You've touched on a great irony, my friend. You're absolutely right.

       The best way to think about conspiracies and media is to remember high school.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate to say it but adult life in America is an extension of high school, and not of college. You can't get laid if you're not cool, and you can't be cool if you're not mainstream. When the fringe becomes mainstream, then you become mainstream by embracing the fringe.

       I didn't learn until I got older to thank my lucky stars that I was never popular and always did my own thing. There's nothing, NOTHING like being able to think for yourself. I wouldn't trade it for all the money in china.

       We all want to belong to a tribe, and buy the gear to send the social proof. It starts when you're young. Girls vs boys - pink versus blue clothes. Jocks vs goths -Body Armour versus Hot Topic. Then if you ever make it to university, Identity is which frat you belong to, or whether or not you're on varsity. This is more of an American thing. Here in Canada, university Identity is much more centred around which faculty you belong to. Arts students hang with arts students. Polisci with Polisci, and maybe the odd econ. B-students hang with B-students, but later it's the finance people with finance, accounting with accounting - because you all bond around class group projects. So your tribe now is your "discipline" or "vocation". When you get out into the "real world", you have to cut your hair, get some fresh clothes and show you're willing to conform to the new social norms - head down, work hard, don't ask too many questions - conform conform conform. Your identity now is focused around which group you belong to - government or industry, operations or finance, etc. Beyond that, your identity is built by which neighborhood you live in, what kind of car you drive, and which country club or gym you frequent. You work at a job you don't care much about with people you'd rather not know, all to pay the bankers and the tax man their pound of flesh. Every day you're told how living standards are increasing, how you're better off than your grandparents were, yet your standard of living seems to be chipped away every day. Gas prices are up. Food is through the roof. Your savings have been wiped out, and you're underwater on your mortgage. You want to save up some money to go on a trip to Vegas to escape the soul-killing nature of your fabricated reality. You want to experience the freedom of walking around The Strip with a Coors Light in your hand, and don't mind having your balls cupped by the TSA in order to enjoy that freedom. Then you get a text on your cel phone. It's from the President, via the mandatory chip in your cel phone. It says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Remember, they hate us for our freedoms".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Think back to high school - is this how you envisioned it? Deep down in your soul, you know something is amiss. You just haven't realized it. Reality itself is an excercise in cognitive dissonance. If thinking about it too much makes you uncomfortable, crack a beer, watch the game or see what's on TMZ.

       Take it from someone who's done it.  Las Vegas is one of the last places on earth you want to go with the goal of escaping "the soul-killing nature of your fabricated reality".  Just about everything there is the epitome of Fabricated Reality.  Just saying.

       Yes, but you can drink beer on the streets. That's true freedom. Getting the rubber glove treatment from the TSA is just a minor inconvenience to realizing that true sense of freedom. I'm being sarcastic/ironic/fecetious or whatever you wish.

       Something else completely. I'm pointing out the hypocrisy in their argument because they say that we'll never be satisfied to conform to their opinions because we jump to another theory, but they refuse to step off their big name media high horse and consider some of the things floating around here because we're all batshit crazy according to them.
