<p>As long as there are religions in the world that claim to be the one true way to God, with books written by men from the bronze age that portray the Other as blasphemous evil doers who must be destroyed, you are never going to get rid of this conflict.  Religion is the single must destructive and alienating force in the world today.  It&#39;s tough for two people to get along when their worldviews are based on the idea that they have to kill each other to please their god.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  There are no other words.  It is not propaganda when I can open any religious text and point out litterally hundreds of passages and verses that command its believers that those who don&#39;t believe accordingly must either be converted or wiped of the earth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry.  Shouldn&#39;t have said Christian.  However, if you are trying to make me believe that Muslims are a nice peaceful religion that just wants to get along with everyone else, you&#39;re barking up the wrong tree.  First, there are always going to be fundamentalist nutjobs who will interpret their texts literally and see it as a command to convert or destroy those who believe differently.  Second, it is a wedge dividing nearly every person on earth, leading to hate and, eventually, violence.  And if you can think of any way to describe the outrage by the Muslim world over the cartoons of Muhammad published by a Danish newspaper other than moronic religious fueled hatred, I&#39;d love to hear it.</p>

<p>Religion is a divisive force in the world.  It breeds hatred, violence, and evil wherever it takes root.  Is every religious individual a radical Islamic terrorist or a Bible thumping hate monger?  Of course not.  But the gullible masses will always come together to hate those who believe differently.</p>

<p>People&#39;s inherent greed (for power) is the most destructive force in the world. Religion attempts to create common ground amongst people but it has faced so much &#39;refinement&#39; over generations that it now ends up misleading people, especially with baseless lies. </p>

<p>Besides, most people don&#39;t do research and are simply satisfied with the messages suggested in the media/advertising, and have learned to not question it, like 9/11, the BP oil spill etc. </p>

<p>-- The May 21 B.S. is a great example of how <em>they&#39;ll</em> exploit this simplistic ideal. By associating a Guarantee with a date and advertising it on a national scale <em>(w/o fine print)</em> they&#39;ll alienate a lot of people -- especially the ignorant masses who won&#39;t realize that the advertised guarantee <a href="http://bible.cc/matthew/24-36.htm">contradicts the source itself</a>.</p>

<p>Christians, Muslims and Jews all believe in the same God, but their beliefs have &quot;evolved&quot; overtime to where they completely ignore it... if one were to overlook all <em>propaganda</em> they&#39;d be able to see the bigger picture.. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>No, it does not.  Religion&#39;s goal is to convert as many people it can to it&#39;s specific and narrow way of looking at the world, and anyone who does not, especially those who believe in a different book, are considered infidels, or sinners, or whatever you choose to call them.  It doesn&#39;t bring people together, it pushes them apart.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, I have to disagree with you here as well.  What greed is behind abortion clinic bombings by crazy Christian fundamentalists?  What greed makes muslims from all over the globe go batshit crazy when some Danes publish a cartoon about Muhammad.  Where is the greed when people are killed, beheaded, burned at the stake, stoned to death, all because they read a different book, or don&#39;t believe at all?  Greed, as you put it, may be a problem in the world.  But the crimes against humanity that have been perpetrated in the name of religion have no comparison. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, it hasn&#39;t evolved, and that is the problem.  These religions are still stuck in the dark ages.  They fight because they don&#39;t agree with the others&#39; interpretations of God&#39;s will.  They fight because they don&#39;t agree with the others&#39; dogma.  They fight because the each see themselves as God&#39;s chosen ones, and the only <em>true</em> believers.  The propaganda you speak of simply feeds this hatred between the groups.  Make no mistake, without these backwards religious influences, it would be a much harder task.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been going on for many, many years. In the movies, TV and even childrens saturday morning cartoons, Arabs are portrayed as villians. But since the &quot;terrorist&quot; attack of 9/11, it&#39;s turned exponentially more hateful. What is it in the Middle East that has America so enraged? If you believe Arabs/Muslims were the ones that actually committed 9/11, therefore you hate them all, then concider yourself a victim of the propaganda. Reasons for this continuous anti-Islamic onslaught are mostly geopolitical rather than religious... Israel and its lobbies and zionist infiltration of US government as well as other world governments...especially the Israel puppet regimes that are now under fire in the Arab world. Zionist/Jewish control of the media, 90% of world news outlets, newspapers and magazines along with huge influence in hollywood all make a very powerful propaganda machine. But one theory that has come to my attention deserve further investigation and that is that the differences between the west and the Middle East go beyond culture and religion.....a very powerful difference lies in the banking systems between the west and Islam. Islamic banking does not work on the interest based money making scheme that the western bankers make their millions on. It is against Islamic religion to make money from money. This system runs contrary to the wests and cannot be taken over as the globalist western bankers wish to do. This seems to be another reason why the battle lines could be drawn between Islam and the west.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Albert pike is quoted (in the 1800s) saying: </p>

<p>&quot;The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the &quot;agentur&quot; of the &quot;Illuminati&quot; between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion…We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.&quot; </p>

<p>Whether or not this is a fabrication you will have to decide. </p>

<p>all these years since 9/11 till this very moment, americans have been told that muslims &amp; the middle east are &#39;&#39;enemies&#39;&#39; and cant be trusted.  i hope that with the recent revolutions going on there, more people realize that people there are just trying to survive.  yea, some of them get sucked into this blackhole of violence, but with more images and information as to <strong>WHY</strong> they were desperate to begin with, it might make more sense.  i hope americans and the rest of the west can appreciate the struggle going on there, and maybe even admire them for the insane amount of scary shit theyre going through right now.  </p>

It taught me that while we give money and to charity and feel good about it the people there take it upon themselves to offer up what little they have directly to another in need. That&#39;s the nature of Islam they uphold. In the place I lived in Damascus there was an elderly woman who used to sit outside and every night someone would take her in and feed her.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know.  I am not willing to accept an utterly pluralist worldview that all social values are equal.  </p>

<p>Many nationalists are concerned with <em>status</em>, and by that I mean a <em>static</em> state of relationship with other groups.  This seems to be a very common Chinese attitude.  Meanwhile, the average American seems to view the world as being more flat.  They get a lot of flak for being powerful and influential, but at the same time, do they think of themselves as being better than Australians?  Of Brits?  Maybe, not by a margin that can&#39;t be fixed by fluoridating the water.  The French?  Sure, but not really.  I think we are more interested in being better than our neighbors (who never take in the trash can on time and never trim the hedge) but in a larger sense in having people and society pursue ideals which are better than they can realistically meet.  Aside from that, Americans think of themselves as being terribly ordinary, if just a bit more disciplined than the Joneses.</p>

<p>Americans get a lot of flak for their failings, but how many societies get called to task for not even trying?  I am biased, but I prefer a liberal world to a pluralist world.  Freedom from unnecessary coercion just seems to be terribly important for protecting all the other values we ascribe to pluralism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that the bible is full of immoral things, like slavery, genocide and murder, not to mention all the contradictions contained within it. While there are some decent lessons to be had from the bible, it is definately not a source of human rights, logic and common sense. I could say that the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy teaches these things, and is far more readable to boot. </p>

<p>Just because a book has bits of wisdom scattered throughout it, doesn&#39;t make it a source of knowledge, especially when those bits of wisdom are surrounded by some of the cruel and evil acts found in the bible.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The Bible is meant to be taken literally.  I think the problem you have with interpreting the Bible literally is over time through translating the Bible into different languages certain words have lost some of their meaning.  If you do some research in comparing current translations with the Hebrew Bible you will find the literal meanings to be more clear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Common sense if you ignore the OT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Old Testament is meant to be reference of what the law was before God sent his son Jesus Christ to die for our sins.  Not that we are to still practice the law of the Old Testament.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Christians don&#39;t sacrifice their enemies, if they do they are not Christians.</p>

<p>2) There are many followers of Islam which do not fully understand their religion.  Many Muslims claim that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance which is untrue. The Koran 9:5 (Verse of the Sword): &quot;When the sacred months (the 1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Muslim calendar) have passed, then kill the Mushrikun (non-believers), wherever you find them, and capture and besiege them, and prepare for them each and every ambush. But if they repent and preform As-Salat (the Islamic prayer), and give Zakat (offerings), then leave their way free. Verily, Allah of Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&quot;</p>

<p>Do not take this as an attack on your comment skobywan, this is just research I have taken upon myself to do.  There are radicals in each religion, but no where in the Bible does God instruct Christians to kill all the non believers.  Therefore any Christian who kills another person because they do not believe as they do are not Christians.</p>

<p>Finally anytime you hear someone being interviewed that claims to be an expert in Islam and states those who kill non-believers are just radicals are either lying to you or ignorant on the topic.  In reality who we call &quot;radical Muslims&quot; are just true believers of Islam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9:5 is talking about a specific conflict that was paused to observe the &quot;sacred months&quot; when the Arabs did not fight. Then when those months passed, the conflict resumed. The observance of the sacred months was a pagan custom, and by saying so in the Quran, God is allowing Muslims to observe the ceasing of hostilities during them. </p>

<p>Contrary to what you say, the people who think the verse prescribes world war against non-Muslims are the ones that don&#39;t understand the religion. The verse is both a recognition of the sacred months as well as a call to fight valiantly on the battlefield. Surely, you don&#39;t think only Americans are allowed to fight valiantly and support their troops, right? Also, what&#39;s important, and what you&#39;ll see about every single verse that talks about fighting in the Quran is that they are all tempered with instruction to not fight people who do not want to fight you. Did you read 9:6, the <em>very next verse</em>? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if any of those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God seeks thy protection, grant him protection, so that he might [be able to] hear the word of God [from thee]; and thereupon convey him to a place where he can feel secure: this, because they [may be] people who [sin only because they] do not know [the truth].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Elsewhere, wherever the Quran talks about fighting, it&#39;s always, &quot;fight those who fight you,&quot; and other phrases like if they seek to cease hostilities, then do not fight them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually the propaganda efforts that OP is talking about that try to convince you Muslims want to wage war on all non-Muslims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there was a peace treaty between pagan Arab tribes and Muslims. There was a specific tribe among the pagans, I had to look it up, Banu Bakr, that broke the peace treaty by killing some Muslims. The Prophet Muhammad made demands on the pagans collectively, either make restitution to the families, expel the tribe that killed those Muslims, or prepare for war. The pagan tribes chose war, and preparations were being made when the sacred months came. The verse was revealed to Muhammad to wait until the sacred months had passed. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link about it:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the verse says a lot about how Muslims should treat non-believers, but it does not say that all Muslims are supposed to make unending war on all non-Muslims. It doesn&#39;t even say this specific group of Muslims should make unending war on that specific group of pagans. Only a skin-deep literalist misreading divorced from any historical context or reason for revelation can give you that. Nothing in the Quran is merely a historical accounting. The Quran teaches lessons through parables, recounting of history, and through other methods. If you spend more time with it doing thorough reading and research, you see those kinds of patterns emerge. </p>

<p>Did you read the article I linked? Please read it, I think if you want to thoroughly research the verse as you have stated, then read more than one perspective on it, including Muslim perspectives. The author outlines at least four lessons that he personally derives from the story and I think honestly it&#39;s nothing new or novel in his approach or conclusions. I would expect as much from any average Muslim:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are some basic principles that I think we can derive from this story. Keep in mind, these are just the ruminations of some random guy on the Internet. You&#39;re free to form your own opinion, and certainly please let me know what you think.</p>

<p>The primacy of achieving peace over demanding rights:
Prophet Muhammad agreed to the Treaty of Hudaibiyah against the advice of his companions. The incident at Hudaibiyah could have exposed the contradiction the Quraishi policy toward the Muslims. If they had escalated the situation into a physical confrontation the Quraish would have lost reputation with the Meccan tribes for violating their own law. But if they had permitted the Muslims to make the pilgrimage they would have lost reputation with the Meccan tribes for acquiescing to Muhammad&#39;s authority. By pressing forward to the Kabba the Muslims would have won a blow against Quraishi propaganda either way. Muhammad absolutely had the upper hand, simply by demanding their rights, but either outcome would have increased animosity and potentially escalated hostility. The promise of ten years of peace outweighed the escalation of aggression to secure tribal rights.</p>

<p>The supremacy of contract law:
Contract law can be summarized very simply in 7 words. &quot;Do all that you agree to do.&quot; Whether by oath or by written agreement, it is incumbent on every righteous person of any creed to live by their word. The Treaty of Hudaibiyah affirmed the validity of all private contracts, which indicates to me that rival municipal authorities engaged in international conflict have no authority to interfere with the supremacy of private contracts. Individuals must be allowed to live by their word without political interference. But also the political order itself must live by it&#39;s word. The treaty itself is a contract between Mecca and Medina, and violating that contract was a justification for the use of force. Therefore, enforcing contract law, and holding people at any level of society accountable for their oaths and written agreements is a legitimate use of force.</p>

<p>The superiority of restorative justice over punitive justice:
There are two theories of justice symbolized by the sword and scales in secular iconography. Punitive justice, symbolized by the sword, is an approach where statutory law is enforced through punishment. Restorative justice, symbolized by the scales, is an approach where the focus is upon making the victim whole again. Offenders are made to take responsibility for their actions by repairing the damage they have done. In this theory of justice reparation rather than punishment takes a central role. Remember, when options are given in a series, the first option is the ideal. The first option Muhammad offered to the Quraish was to pay restitution to the families of the Banu Khuzaah who were killed. So, we can deduce that restorative justice is preferable to punitive justice, and the primary role of justice, even at an international level, is to make the victim at the individual level whole again, not to pay an abstract debt to society at large.</p>

<p>The Non Aggression Principle:
The Non Aggression Principle holds that the initiation of physical force, threat or fraud is always illegitimate, and that the use of force is only appropriate when used in defense. This is the defining lesson of this story, and the criterion between when physical violence is legitimage and patient passive endurance is appropriet. Even when the terms of a treaty authorize him, and the traditions of the society permit him, Muhammad does not use physical force against anyone unless they have first aggressed, or supplied an aggressor with material aid.</p>

<p>Clearly the Bible says to love the person and hate the sin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Logic as long as you don&#39;t take it literally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Bible is meant to be taken literally.  I think the problem you have with interpreting the Bible literally is over time through translating the Bible into different languages certain words have lost some of their meaning.  If you do some research in comparing current translations with the Hebrew Bible you will find the literal meanings to be more clear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Common sense if you ignore the OT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Old Testament is meant to be reference of what the law was before God sent his son Jesus Christ to die for our sins.  Not that we are to still practice the law of the Old Testament.</p>
