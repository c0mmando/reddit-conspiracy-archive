        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How many people in r/Conspiracy are at the point in their research that they believe in a cosmic consciousness which is restricting our human race from progressing and liberating itself?  I have been in the conspiracy game for years now, and I have followed one rabbit hole after another until I&#39;ve ended up with the wackiest of all wacky conspiracy theories which involves UFO&#39;s, cosmic beings, the physics of consciousness, etc. I started with our monetary system but now I find myself struggling with this place because it is even more detached from mainstream issues than normal NWO fodder. So much context would have to be established that I simply only talk to those who will listen...This seems to be the case with all of those subscribing to the same theory, and oddly enough seems to be the philosophy of past teachers such as Jesus, Ghandi, MLK, etc.  All of these characters taught until they were murdered, yet I hear many many more of these modern day messianic figures speaking out today and garnering an audience.  The idea is that by simply understanding the physics of consciousness and the science of peace that we can raise the consciousness of our peers, inevitably trickling up to the top.  </p>

<p>Do I sound totally bonkers or is anyone else at this point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The universe is a fractal structure (in my opinion), as we are starting to see evidence black-holes are (perhaps) themselves the creation of new universes.  This means that within the micro, you find the macro, meaning that you already have all the answers; but you must look inward and not out.  Imagine zooming into a fractal on your computer - how does a finite machine hold an infinite amount of information?  </p>

<p>The ying &amp; yang, positive &amp; negative, love &amp; hate, personal battles &amp; triumphs, all echo the nature of reality and it&#39;s fractal repetitive nature.  Fractals are feedback loops - point a video camera at a TV that it&#39;s hooked up to and you will see it first hand.  Life is a feedback loop, where the output of two humans is the input of another.  The same holds true with our universe, it&#39;s all just energy, and we are all part of it. </p>

Complexity on multiple levels and in multiple dimensions. Maybe a form of AI could get a better picture then we could and form a better picture of the universe and how we all connect to it. Until then, I think we are looking at the shadows on the cave wall. We can&#39;t see the fire, much less the entities creating the shadows. </p>

<p>But in all seriousness, this is one of those subjects that I&#39;d rather listen to than just dismiss because it deviates from the traditional things we&#39;re taught. People believe crazier things, so I really see nothing wrong with just discussing something purely theoretical. If anything, we indirectly benefit from thinking about this because it makes us have a more explorative mindset.</p>

<p>The planet Earth is the Universe trying to become aware of itself. The universe makes what Terence calls &quot;Novelty&quot; which is just another word for complexity. We humans are the best at producing novelty apparently because we make things VERY complicated for ourselves. Everything is trying to get connected to everything else and we are accelerating that process, and the pedal is on the fucking FLOOR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>transcendental meditation. It was brought to the US by the Maharishi (somewhat famous indian guru, the Beatles chilled with him for awhile) and it is a simple way to get into a calming meditative state. If you do it twice a day it has been shown to help lots of things with your mind/body. I suggest looking into other forms of meditation though, because it costs 1000$-1500$ or something to &quot;learn&quot; how to do it. Any meditation where your mind is calmed down would probably give similar results.</p>

<p>How many people in r/Conspiracy are at the point in their research that they believe in a cosmic consciousness which is restricting our human race from progressing and liberating itself?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The grand conspiracy is exactly that, cognitive dissonance. It&#39;s directed into a state of mind that rewards ignorance and violence while siphoning more and more freedom away from our race as a whole. This leaves the human race permanently alienated from its divine destiny and spiritual evolutionary endpoint. In these terms, the conspiracy in front of us all is ultimately a religious one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea is that by simply understanding the physics of consciousness and the science of peace that we can raise the consciousness of our peers, inevitably trickling up to the top.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re picking up speed. I feel that you&#39;re very close to the greatest epiphany of your lifetime, all you need is a little boost. I would <em>strongly</em> recommend reading every article on <a href="http://armageddonconspiracy.co.uk/">this website</a> to gain a clearer understanding of what it actually is that opposes you. Use your own intuition in absorbing the information posted on it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do I sound totally bonkers or is anyone else at this point?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all, we need more people like you. If everyone else in r/conspiracy was at LEAST here, we&#39;d be gaining a <strong>LOT</strong> of momentum towards the greatest revolution the universe will ever see. </p>

<p>Everyone telling you what to read or believe in this thread, or saying bullshit like &quot;you&#39;re almost at some great insight that I&#39;ve already had, here think this&quot; is, in my opinion, leading you astray.

We all know what people can do at those rare times when their minds slip the governors that keep them from going at full throttle. Works of genius. But more commonly, we forget things we don&#39;t need to forget. We lose interest in things we should be concentrating on. We try to do something, and then quit just before we achieve our goal. We tell ourselves that we are no good, that we won&#39;t amount to anything, that we never get any breaks, that it&#39;s futile to even try.

    <div class="md"><p>Neurons:Brain::Humans:Society. Since we know the illusion of consciousness can arise from the aggregate interaction of individual neurons, it may be possible that a similar illusion exists for the aggregate interaction of individual humans. I shy away from terms like &quot;cosmic&quot; consciousness though, as that seems to imply alternate dimensions or other voodoo that isn&#39;t supported by evidence. Maybe &quot;collective consciousness&quot; is a better phrase. And I certainly don&#39;t see anything limiting the human race besides humans, but it is fun to think about consciousness on other scales. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first step of any human evolution is to begin to unravel the shit you&#39;ve been taught to believe over your lifetime.</p>

<p>First up, don&#39;t listen to mainstream news. 
Secondly, don&#39;t believe in things because others do - God.</p>

<p>God was created back thousands of years ago to bond people, to give people a sense of reality, a sense of community, a sense of connection. Remember, there was no Facebook, email, internet, fast communication, travel, electricity, etc.</p>

<p>God is something this world needs to drop for us to prosper. It holds us back because so much science is not believed and thus, stopped. </p>

<p>For example; much of the Governments, Presidents, PM&#39;s, parliament, believe in God. If they believe in God, why is there so Government-level corruption? Why do they want to have constant wars KILLING people. &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot;, etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all bullshit because people eat it up.</p>

<p>Once you begin to think &quot;if there were a God, why are there asians? blacks?&quot;. Didn&#39;t it all start from Adam and Eve? If there was a God or Jesus, why is it that different cultures believe in different Gods? Shouldn&#39;t there just be one? </p>

<p>If your Dad is your dad, and someone else outside of your family calls him dad - he is not their dad. It simply makes the word &quot;dad&quot; moot for them. It&#39;s just a name, a character to them.</p>

<p>God is a character that was made up at a time when anything with the smallest amount of power was unbelievably powerful. If there was a God, the shit on this planet would not be happening. If there was a God, he&#39;s an absolutely sick, twisted fucking cunt who lets Priests (hands and voices of God) rape and ruin the lives of children the world over. What God would do this?</p>

<p>Once you unravel this, the questions start - </p>

<p>HOW are we here?
WHY are we here?
If our planet was further from the sun (say, double the distance) - we would not exist. Why is it that we are this distance from the sun? With oxygen, a good atmosphere, gravity, etc?</p>

<p>Why does the Moon only face us in one direction? It should be spinning as all other planets and satellites do - this is not questioned, nor researched. We have only just started to find water on the moon. There was a day when they (scientists, NASA) said there was NO water on the moon.</p>

<p>Our belief system is dynamic, and when research is done, static. We have belief AT THE TIME, that is undeniable - it is the truth AT THAT TIME. Until proven otherwise.</p>

<p>There is a God.
The world is flat.
There is no water on the moon.
9/11 was caused by terrorists.</p>

<p>Do you see a pattern?</p>

<p>Every star is a Sun... can you imagine that? Fuck me... what we can see is but a grain of salt of what exists. What if there are black holes, in black holes, in black holes? Or planets that vibrate on different frequencies so they are undetectable to the human eye (or our current technology).</p>

<p>Once you start to believe EVERYTHING YOU&#39;RE TAUGHT, TOLD and EXPERIENCE is but an illusion... it&#39;s all a movie, made FOR YOU. For EVERYONE. </p>

<p>You begin to see the &quot;matrix&quot;. We won&#39;t advance as a human race... there is too much evil on this planet. Unless there is a form of race that comes down to us and threatens the Government to redraw it&#39;s BULLSHIT from us and re-work the monetary system (let&#39;s face it, it HAS failed and we&#39;re around 1% into the eventual crash that will happen).</p>

<p>When it does, words cannot express what will happen.........</p>

<p>Peel back the layers of your life, re-educate yourself. Everything. and I mean, everything is bullshit.</p>

<p>The news, media, music, movies, the internet - governments, everything... it is all controlled, manipulated and we are stuck on this earth like a leech.</p>

<p>I believe the military is out on other planets - with super-advanced technology that we can&#39;t even begin to comprehend. Go back to the 1950&#39;s and explain the internet to people back then.</p>

<p>BLOW THEIR FUCKING MINDS OFF THEIR SKULLS........ they would never believe you because tehy could NEVER conceptualize what it would be like... TV to them was mind-blowing.........</p>

<p>Everything is an illusion, the famous Matrix saying:</p>

<p>There is no spoon.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Persinger gave the following lecture, titled &quot;No More Secrets&quot;. In it, he detailed his theories on the connection between magnetic fields and the brain, in particular how this relationship could facilitate telepathy and remote viewing. He notes particular experiments and individuals (Ingo Swann, Sean Harribance) that seem to give evidence supporting his theories, and makes some fairly extraordinary claims which I&#39;m sure will lead to some debate.</p>

<p>Of course, in one of last week&#39;s articles, he also said more Christians had been persecuted in the last 100 years than all of the rest of history COMBINED.  Hah!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well aware of it. It&#39;s one facet of the same thing. </p>
