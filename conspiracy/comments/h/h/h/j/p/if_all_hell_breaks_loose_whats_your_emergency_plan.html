       I don't care how many people call you crazy for that-- that's something I personally can respect. In fact, I have a similar plan and have been saving money in a completely isolated account in case of any such event.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of funny because I asked my parents the same thing after I posted this question. Asked my Dad how much he has saved if he has any "end of the world funds" and he looked at me with a solemn look and said "a couple of hundred grand, we'll be just fine son.". My mom looked at him with that same solemn look, back to me, and they both just kind of kept quiet for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the one hand it's comforting knowing this, but very unsettling that they feel a need to prepare
       <em>
        that much
       </em>
       in case of doomsday. I should mention both my parents are retired, and my Dad was a CEO for a very large government health and social services sector who made a fair share of cash (not 100's of millions like corporate CEOs, but a very good amount) so it doesn't surprised me for a second that he actually has this money put away.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Actually, now that I think about the type of person my Dad is... It really wouldn't surprise me if he's got a few million saved-- he always waters down numbers to come across as very reserved (not while he was working of course! haha). If he had told me a few million, I probably would have been pretty scared as to why the hell he would need that much saved for a doomsday fund, and what the fuck he knows that I don't.

       just a heads up, you might want to save that money in assets, or at
       <em>
        least
       </em>
       in
       <em>
        cash,

       You probably shouldn't tell people that though- I know what you mean and why you're anti-semitic, but a lot of people will just take that as "I fuckin' hate Jews cuz' they're stupid and greedy" because a lot of anti-semites are that way.

       You don't know that.  You can't claim to know when or even if the Earth needs that in order for the rest to survive.  What is the max capacity of life for this planet?  How can you know?  We have not really put serious effort into technology that might preserve life instead of the mentality  to let everything go to hell and pick up the pieces later.  That's almost a cop out, its the lazy mans route.
      </p>
      <p>
       If life was precious, just like I know you believe YOUR life is precious, we would be looking for ways to do things smarter.  Honestly, this is not the best of our effort.  Time moves on, things get better slowly but surely.

       That number of 200-500 mil, is ludicrous.  You prefer much less, wtf kind of thing to say?  Been at this a long time?  Even at that number you'd be culling huge numbers of people or controlling their production directly.  That is a sick fucking world to think about.  The one that says you aren't born because "Ooops, we're all full up!  Don't want any more people on my green lawn.....and bike path"
      </p>

       You're a sick person to endorse that kind of message. Good thing you are not in control and that kind of thinking is exactly what should be "ignored" by people.

       Sure, as you like.  The question is, who do you think you are that you should be allowed to make such decision?  Don't you understand those people in the "real power centers" would have you removed if THEY have their way?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not special, they won't single you from the crowd and say, "YOU!  You are one of us....you think like us, you can stay...."

       You think you're special somehow?  It's called luck of the draw.  Like George Carlin said, You and I are not in the big club!

      <p>
       You were not randomly born with a silver spoon in your mouth.  You were born on the factory floor just like the rest of us.  Deal with it, if those people make a decision and your death is a result of it, you're essentially saying you're OK with that because you would do the same if you were in that same position.

       Good luck to you to, I sure was born on the factory floor, i still support population reduction through any means, while i would prefer less breeding and everyone dieing of old age, the me me me culture will never be able to make any sacrifices for future generations so it will have to be done by stealth
