    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care how many people call you crazy for that-- that&#39;s something I personally can respect. In fact, I have a similar plan and have been saving money in a completely isolated account in case of any such event.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of funny because I asked my parents the same thing after I posted this question. Asked my Dad how much he has saved if he has any &quot;end of the world funds&quot; and he looked at me with a solemn look and said &quot;a couple of hundred grand, we&#39;ll be just fine son.&quot;. My mom looked at him with that same solemn look, back to me, and they both just kind of kept quiet for a while.</p>

<p>On the one hand it&#39;s comforting knowing this, but very unsettling that they feel a need to prepare <em>that much</em> in case of doomsday. I should mention both my parents are retired, and my Dad was a CEO for a very large government health and social services sector who made a fair share of cash (not 100&#39;s of millions like corporate CEOs, but a very good amount) so it doesn&#39;t surprised me for a second that he actually has this money put away. </p>

<p>EDIT: Actually, now that I think about the type of person my Dad is... It really wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he&#39;s got a few million saved-- he always waters down numbers to come across as very reserved (not while he was working of course! haha). If he had told me a few million, I probably would have been pretty scared as to why the hell he would need that much saved for a doomsday fund, and what the fuck he knows that I don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Happens all the time, in fact every civilisation has been lost. Ever single one of them bah none.</p>

<p>Max capacity is between 200-500 million, i prefer much less.</p>

<p>Technology is there already, just not usable within the current populations numbers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, as you like.  The question is, who do you think you are that you should be allowed to make such decision?  Don&#39;t you understand those people in the &quot;real power centers&quot; would have you removed if THEY have their way?</p>

<p>You&#39;re not special, they won&#39;t single you from the crowd and say, &quot;YOU!  You are one of us....you think like us, you can stay....&quot;</p>

<p>You think you&#39;re special somehow?  It&#39;s called luck of the draw.  Like George Carlin said, You and I are not in the big club!  </p>

<p>You were not randomly born with a silver spoon in your mouth.  You were born on the factory floor just like the rest of us.  Deal with it, if those people make a decision and your death is a result of it, you&#39;re essentially saying you&#39;re OK with that because you would do the same if you were in that same position.</p>

<p>Wow, good luck out there Sir.</p>
