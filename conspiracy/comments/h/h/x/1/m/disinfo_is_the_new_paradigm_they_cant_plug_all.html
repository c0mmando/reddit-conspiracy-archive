    <div class="md"><p>&quot;How many divisions does the Pope have?&quot; What scares me the most is this Bin Laden piece. It seems they don&#39;t even feel they have to make a logical narrative anymore. It would be a strong indicator that they have decoupled from any fear of reprisal. It&#39;s possible, that the coup is complete and they are in total control without any laws, repercussions, or restraint to their power. Their level of boldness has reached new heights. One can only observe with awe their next set of actions. Our only guide at this point is the historical record of empire.</p>

<p>Capitalist motivator: &quot;Work! Because it might result in a reward.&quot; Soviet motivator: &quot;Work! Because not working <strong>will</strong> get you in prison.&quot;</p>

<p>Now that it&#39;s obvious to anyone who cares that the system is rigged, the capitalist motivator will give way to the Soviet one.</p>

<p>A lot of people will consider it a blessing, true freedom to live outside of the camp - even at 500 grams of bread per adult per day. This scenario will reveal itself by the expansion of Gestapo powers (not their getting away with murder as today, but new laws granting them 100% immunity).</p>

<p>On the other hand, taxpayers in the West still think they have a lot to lose - that is, they can be pacified by a simple threat to modify their &quot;net worth&quot;, &quot;credit history&quot;, or &quot;social security&quot;. This will keep the class war cold for a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for one, at the lowest level. Democrats are bought out by the banks and Republicans are bought out by industry. Which is why we&#39;re seeing some really awkward policies right now. TPTB don&#39;t want us to know they exist. So we can never call them out and they will keep the charade going until they no longer can. We&#39;ll either get wiped off the face of the earth in nuclear war, or we can revolt. Eventually there will be nuclear warfare. Not if but when, they want to kill us off. I believe most of the agenda is depopulation and world control. Pretty much what every evil entity has ever sought, fiction or not. Someone is striving for world domination. That much is clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or you could look at it the other way: their disinfo is a sign of increasing weakness. If they did have a logical narrative (of the bin Laden death) they would have put it out. But something went very wrong on the mission, so they just shovel out semi-random details at us in the hope that &quot;that&#39;ll do&quot;.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a sign of their power. Obama needed a bounce, and he got it, but he didn&#39;t even get a newsworthy photo of the body out of the mission, and it&#39;s a <em>long</em> time until the election, and there&#39;s a lot more shit to unravel yet, about what went down.</p>

<p>If they were as powerful as you suggest, why does the story change to one so full of holes? Why not just say bin Laden was firing machine guns at the SEALs and stick with that story?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that a disinfo bukkake harms the mainstream media more than the internet, because the former will piss off the rest of their audience, whereas the latter has been dominated by bullshit since its inception and has learned how to deal with it. The internet&#39;s problem is that at this time it has no paper of record and very little influence in FRAMING issues. It&#39;s getting better, but slowly. In other words: bring&#39;em on, swamp&#39;em all with crap -- the internet can absorb arbitrary quantities of it, whereas the mainstream media might finally choke on it. Anything wrong with that theory? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the disinfo spread on the internet becomes the new paradigm.  On reddit we call it the hivemind.  In the conspiracy subreddit, we are generally at odds with the hivemind.  This illustrates that disinfo achieves the same results on the internet as it does as direct propaganda within the mainstream media.</p>

<p>No, it has a whole bunch of them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite informative seeing how rt, presstv, nytimes, haaretz, jerusalem post, the guardian, the daily fail, news.com.au, wikipedia, and smh.com.au all frame the same issues.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s a good theory, but I think it&#39;s even better than you say, because I think some media organizations still have some integrity, and are also on the Internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We CAN decipher Disinformation. It takes discernment, intuition common sense and critical thinking*****.
It also takes self confidence. If you don&#39;t believe in yourself then you allow others to make your decisions (and opinions) for you.</p>

<p>*****Our Critical thinking, so very dear and important to deciphering Disinfo is under attack from television (turning Beta waves into Alpha waves ; google 1969, Herbert Krugman), MSG in food ( Google Dr. Russell blaylock <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kgJfw699E">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kgJfw699E</a> ), organic foods (Monsanto) , and DNA recombination.</p>

<p>Once you pay attention and deal with the inhibiting factors, you can learn to sort out the truth from the disinformation presented (Albeit sometimes very thin amounts).</p>

<p>There is hope. Don&#39;t stop fighting back.</p>
