       As is always the case as more time passes this issue will too fade away as many others have, despite the fact that it should not be allowed to!  I don't know how to go about it but we should demand proof from our government that Bin Laden is indeed dead.

       I hear you. The level of insanity that has been achieved in one decade is astonishing. And it shows no signs of a turnaround. Hell, nobody's even
       <em>
        trying
       </em>
       to turn it around. The so-called Patriot Act has been extended. Again.

       The thing I don't understand is why the USA even bothers trying to justify its 
actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't it just say:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Yeah, we tortured people at Guantanamo, but that's just training for when we get into genuine counter-insurgency and need to terrorize and subjugate the populations of the countries we invade for their oil."

       You know that your boss is powerful and he can fire you at any moment with little justification if her or she wants you, but they still pretend that there are rules because they wants you to feel invested in the system enough to work your butt off and make them money.

       The assumption is that people will keep believing the lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been around long enough that if my boss lied to me, I think I'd call him on it.  It's not as if we're not both just cogs in the machine; he actually has only a little more power to influence things than I do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once it becomes blindingly obvious that one is being lied to, there is little reason in maintaining the pretence, except as a cowardly way to deflect questions.

       People wanted the military to concentrate on Bin Laden which turned out to be a a hurdle for expanding to other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with Bin Laden out of the way, they can start gearing up for Iran.  Fox News is already making claims that
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dyy_osNeBw">
        Iran was involved in 9-11
       </a>
       according to "new evidence."

      <p>
       They needed Bin Laden gone to start switching more blame onto Iran as an accomplice.

       Why didn't Bush pull this out of the bag instead then?

       Certaintly would've boosted the popularity of the Republican party, and helped McCain's election.
      </p>

       And if this whole thing was a setup why would they wait for a year and half before his election to announce it? Surely this time next year would've been a far better time to do this?

       Agreed, except that the 'evidence' was as pathetic as the 'official story'. Whoever greenlighted it was either counting on the fact that we are by and large a nation of morons, or does not understand the information age.

       They only get away with things like this because of one reason only.

       The average Americans total apathy and ignorance of all things global.

       The privatised version of the operation mockingbird media makes out that anyone who doesnt believe official lies is a conspiracy theorist.

       The media liked to portray the world as hating america for its freedoms when the reality is the world hates america because most americans are as dumb as bricks while wrapped up in a me me me walmart oprah culture.

       I wish that were true. But american culture is spreading.

       I suspect if/when america takes on china, and if china wins. We will see a culture shift, that will be a wake up call for many. Till then it's the western way.

       And wouldn't you think that if the U.S. could verify that someone publicly making such a claim was "al-Qaeda", they would also have enough information to swiftly apprehend him, or (silly me) more likely rain Hellfire missiles at or near his last known location?

       Not only has no proof been provided, but everything done during and after the raid seems calculated to sow as much doubt and confusion as possible. None of it makes any sense. Why was he executed instead of captured? Why was his body just dumped into the ocean? Why were the cameras turned off at the White House during the raid? It's all loony.

       Best thing I've seen posted on Reddit was posted in the aftermath of bin Laden dying. Can't find the original post but I saved it, here it is:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "A man is killed.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        And the politicians will say "behold the bad guy, dead by our righteous hands." And the good hearted people will *rejoice and sleep in their beds and know justice exists in this world. And the few will lord over the many. And
       </em>
       the*
       <em>
        wars will continue. And bombs will still fall. And people will still die. And one day a McDonalds will stand where once a missile struck like lightning. And an orphan will super-size your meal for an extra dinar."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Say what you want but the whole thing truly doesn't matter to you or me. They could produce a picture of it tomorrow and the only thing it'll do is shut people like you up and give Al Qaeda an either bigger incentive to attack.
       <br/>
       I'd rather discuss the evidenced that shows theat Pakistan helped him hide out there to be honest.

       Oh and considering Al Qaeda, the President and the reactions of those who idolised him, I'd say it'd ok to say he's dead and died on May 2nd.

       If they really DID kill him, what would they get out of proving it to you?  It's not going to make him any deader, but it might make him more of a martyr, which they might be anxious to avoid.   Chances are anyone who would disbelieve the story wouldn't find the story any more credible with photographic evidence.  They'd just dismiss it as photoshopped.

       I think you fit perfectly here.  You seem like exactly the kind of person who belongs in this kind of arena.
