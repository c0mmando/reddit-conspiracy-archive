       Hey everyone!
      </p>
      <p>
       This same seem like a simple question and I am really lost with the plethora of information here and conflicting arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, where does it say Bin Laden was never indicted for 9-11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we think of him when people say 9-11?
      </p>
      <p>
       WHY wasn't he charged with mass murder for 9-11, or was he?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who were the big players, what was his role in comparison to the "other" heads?
      </p>
      <p>
       What was Bin Laden stance on this, didn't he take credit for the attacks? If not, what attacks was he responsible for?
      </p>
      <p>
       When EKIA (Enemy Killed in Action), who else was killed with him? Son? Women, what relation? by Seal Team-6. Is Seal Team-6 like Rainbow Six back in the day?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you everyone helping to clear the smoke. Really appreciate it!

        Whoever committed the act of September 11 are not the friends of the American people. I have already said that we are against the American system, not against its people
       </p>
       <p>
        The United States should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself; the people who are a part of the US system but are dissenting against it. Or those who are working for some other system; persons who want to make the present century as a century of conflict between Islam and Christianity so that their own civilization, nation, country, or ideology can survive
       </p>
       <p>
        Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United Sates? That secret government must be asked who carried out the attacks.

       For the love of god, of course he denied it, he was trying to sow the seeds of chaos, what is more chaotic than a foreign terrorist attack?  a homeground terrorist attack.  Hook, line and sinker.  That is the goal of terrorism, to spread... terror, cause reaction, then overreaction, then revolution or capitulation.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ummat is known for interviewing Osama bin Laden shortly after the 9/11 attack. In the interview he declared: "I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle." [1]
       </p>
       <p>
        However, the validity of the interview with Osama Bin Laden has come under question as the reporter never actually met Bin Laden, but merely sent written questions to the Taliban government (at that time in power in Afghanistan and facing an attack from the US/UN) and received written replies.[2]

        The interview with the accused terror mastermind appeared in the Karachi daily Ummat, believed to have close connections to Islamic groups in Afghanistan.

        The newspaper says it submitted questions for bin Laden to Taliban officials and received written replies.

       Quoted from the above section:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is contrary to almost everything released by Osama bin laden. 
So what's more reliable? this one interview conducted by telegraph to "Osama" or everything else "Osama" has ever released?
      </p>

       Do some research instead of believing what you're told. Open your eyes to your conspiratorial masters making you think what they want you to think.

       December 13, 2001 seems to be the first time he said anything supporting the official story, months after denying involvement multiple times. Not only is that inherently inconsistent, but so is the specificity of his later message regarding logistics that simply do not work with the 9/11 timeline as known, including his initial statements up to this point. According to other sources found on the front page of this subreddit today, senior members of the military and intelligence community had already received knowledge of Bin Laden's death thanks to detailed knowledge of his medical condition. The CIA was also later known to make fake tapes, certainly by 2007. None of which can overwrite his initial reaction, if you accept it.

       The main page of whatreallyhappened.com is a collection of links to other web sites, many of which are corporate news sites. Typically the links are followed by a brief commentary by the owner of the site. The site also contains some in depth opinion pieces, such as the one linked by strafefire. These opinion pieces tend to be loaded with citations.

       I think the assumption we are supposed to make is that the government has secret information linking Bin Laden to the 9/11 attacks. Because they certainly don't have very much overt, public evidence against him. Not nearly enough to bring him to trial, or convict him in a fair and open court of law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, you are being asked to trust your government to know best what to do, even though it keeps its reasons hidden from you.

       Well there was the "video confession" released to the public. Also, OBL was the publicly acknowledged leader of Al-Qaeda. And there was apparently enough "overt, public evidence" to 'justify' the invasion of Afghanistan.

       Actually the first 'video confession' consisted of him condemning the attacks and the people who perpetrated it, but that footage and his message were quickly overridden by new, subsequent 'confessions' where he claimed responsibility.  The latter are considered to be forgeries by many people.

       The vast majority of citizens have zero proof that there was a moon landing; they must believe what the government tells them.  Some believe everything the government says, some believe none of it.  Clearly the government tells the truth sometimes, and lies sometimes, so somewhere in the middle is the appropriate balance.

       Those who strongly doubt the government's honesty view the rest as naive, while those who trust the government see the rest as paranoid.

       I have no proof of germ theory because I am not a doctor, biologist, etc.  However, there are millions in the world who are, and would know if germ theory was false.  In order for germ theory to be false, millions of professionals all over the world would have to be either lying or incompetent.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, for the moon landing to be false, only a relative few in the government need to lie.  There is no outside verification; no civilians or foreigners were there, or are capable of inspecting the landing sites.  The proposition that the moon landing occurred implies trust in the federal government.

       But it's not.  Being funded by is not the same thing as being directly operated by.  It's not part of any branch of government unlike the military which is DoD and the FBI which is part of the judicial branch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, it's almost the same thing, but I'm pointing out the distinction.

       You don't really think the US invaded Afghanistan because of Bin Laden, do you? The invasion plan was set in place and all ready to go when 9/11 happened. Getting Bin Laden was a convenient excuse, which Bush forgot about as soon as the invasion had taken place. No, the US invaded Afghanistan because Israel wanted dominance of the Middle East, but didn't want to do it (and couldn't do it) with their own money or troops. The neocons caused the invasions of both Afghanistan and Iraq. Neither invasion had anything at all to do with terrorism.

       when i read comments like that i still think there is hope for humanity. why doesn't everyone see what is so blatantly obvious? It has nothing to do with intelligence but more a preservation of a value system that would be too traumatic to the average person to have compromised by the very disturbing and inconvenient truth.

       Bin laden is a fantasy. He is a symbol that was used to justify a geo-political agenda. As for the trillions of dollars etc. war=profit for the military industrial complex. hence the fictitious 'war on terror', it is a war on a concept that can never be won by definition. They can drag it out as long as they want to and spend as much money as their psychopathic hearts desire. You really still don't think Bin Laden was behind 9/11 do you? Come on. Invest some time and get informed and tell your friends to do the same. The future of your country depends on it.

       Was Pearl Harbour considered a crime back then, anyway?  My understanding is that 'preventive war' only became defined as illegal after WWII - if you didn't have UN approval (bit of a cop out).

       The mainstream media was already spewing the fairytale just an hour or two after the 9/11 attacks. Somehow, just a couple hours after the attacks, they knew exactly what happened. It was Osama Bin Laden and 19 hijackers! The story has been the same ever since. Well, except the story they gave us for Building 7, that story is always changing.

       9/11 was considered from the beginning by the U.S. to be a military attack, not a criminal one. (

       </a>
       ) The U.S. military would handle it, not the police services.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may notice that after Pearl Harbor, the Americans responded with bombers and aircraft carriers instead of police there too. There was no talk of criminal charges until after the war - and even then it was for war crimes, not Pearl Harbor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Osama was already indicted and wanted by the FBI. Further indictments can come later after he's captured. From a judicial standpoint, at this time, there is no compelling reason to indict him again. Once he's captured - if captured alive - you could expect many other indictments to follow, some of them not even related to 9/11. There's nothing unusual about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI agrees:  (

       )

       "Exhaustive government and independent investigations have concluded otherwise, of course, and bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders have proudly taken responsibility for the hijackings. FBI officials say the wanted poster merely reflects the government's long-standing practice of relying on actual criminal charges in the notices.

       "There's no mystery here," said FBI spokesman Rex Tomb. "They could add 9/11 on there, but they have not because they don't need to at this point. . . . There is a logic to it."

      <p>
       "When our nation was attacked on September 11th, the President recognized what had happened as an act of war and that it must be treated as such, not a law enforcement matter" (

        On June 5, 2006, the Muckraker Report contacted the FBI Headquarters, (202) 324-3000, to learn why Bin Laden’s Most Wanted poster did not indicate that Usama was also wanted in connection with 9/11. The Muckraker Report spoke with Rex Tomb, Chief of Investigative Publicity for the FBI. When asked why there is no mention of 9/11 on Bin Laden’s Most Wanted web page, Tomb said, “The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11.”

       He's really an attention whore, that osama BL.  My guess is the old fuck was dying of kidney disease or something, and decided he wasn't going to shrivel away in a cave...so he bought a mansion and started making smoke signals until the marines popped him in the head.

       Correct.  Whether you consider them peacetime or war crimes, the US commited them.  And you can't just pin it on Bush II and his cronies:
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the 2004 election, it was already evident that the U.S. had gone to war on false pretenses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the 2004 election, the torture and in Iran and Afghanistan was already known. And people could see that the methods used were more than suspiciously similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the 2004 election, the world knew that the U.S. was kidnapping (er, performing extraordinary renditions) around the world, shipping people off to other countries. (It turns out they kidnapped over 100 people from Europe alone.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the 2004 election, the world already knew about the U.S. detention/torture centers in Eastern Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the 2004 election, Maher Arar - a Canadian telecommunications engineer who was kidnapped by the U.S. while waiting for a connecting flight in New York on his way back to Canada - had already been cleared and released after 10 months of torture and beatings, with an unofficial "er, never mind." And it wasn't the only such case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the 2004 election, the world already knew about the Aug. 1, 2002 Office of Legal Counsel memo on torture that advised the CIA and White House that torture was just peachy keen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the 2004 election, the Washington Post had already confirmed that torture, extraordinary renditions, failure to register detainees with the Red Cross and other violations of the Geneva Conventions were official policy, approved by the White House.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Did senior officials "permit" torture? A Pentagon-led task force concluded in March 2003, with the support of the Justice Department, that the president was authorized to order torture as part of his war-making powers and that those who followed his orders could be immunized from punishment. Dictators who wish to justify torture, and those who would mistreat Americans, have no need to read our editorials: They can download from the Internet the 50-page legal brief issued by Mr. Rumsfeld's chief counsel.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Washington Post, July 21st, 2004
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So US Defense Forces acted in a barbaric manner as a matter of policy.  Worse, the very people responsible were RELECTED, by an even greater margin than their first term, so Americans as a whole approved of it.  Even with a new administration from a different party, there's not even talk of anyone being prosecuted for it.

      <p>

       The statements above are not mere "opinions".  It was a state DECISION to treat 9/11 as a military attack, not a criminal one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether the state was right or wrong to do so, is an opinion.  There's plenty of good arguements either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would not find it hard to believe that Osama was kept alive for interrogation.  But with his own daugher saying that he was executed in the attack, it seems unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the evidence that he was already dead, there are plenty who say that he never existed
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       he died at Tora Bora
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       he died peacefully of kidney failure
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       he's still alive and free. All point to evidence that convinces them of this.

       They were prosecuted for war crimes, or allowing war crimes to happen under their command.  Stuff like torture, rape, killing of prisoners, intentionally targetting civilians, etc.  The Pearl Harbor attack was NOT considered a war crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       If 9/11 was a military act, than it was still a war crime by any standard definition, as it was an attack on civilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Look,
       </strong>
       I'm not blindly backing the US government.  My accusations are simply different than yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example The US prosecuted Japanese soldiers for waterboarding and other techniques that the US now considers to be peachy-keen.  And there's at least one US action in the Iraq war that could be considered a "targetting civilians" war crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conducting military operations while surrounded by civilians is also a war crime, as it leads to civilians being killed.  A couple hundred attacks have been done using Predator drones - a whole lot of people including innocent bystanders killed - by operators sitting at consoles in Californa.  So if one of those operators - and a bunch of innocent civilian bystanders - is killed by a bomb while stopping at WalMart for Doritos on the way home, who is commiting the war crime:  The bomber, or the operator and his commander?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's enough questions and enough real crimes involved, without making stuff up.

       That would be the
       <strong>
        Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists
       </strong>
       (Pub.L. 107-40, 115 Stat. 224, enacted September 18, 2001).  (

       )
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't a traditional declaration of war, because this wasn't a traditional enemy.  Mullah Omar and his Taliban group didn't even control the whole country - they were in a civil war.  And the backbone of the Taliban were outsiders brought in from arab countries by bin Laden - the locals called them "tourists."
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to define the enemy was a mess, so trying to define the fight against them was a mess.  And the response was micromanaged not from the Pentagon but from the White House by Bush II, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Rove, and anything they touched turned into a mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, I'm not saying that it was an intelligent decision.  But it was the decision.

       Perhaps.  But not everyone falls for it every time.
December 2003:
69% of Americans supported the Iraq war.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other 31% opposed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was in the 31% because I simply did not believe the propaganda about WMDs, Yellow cake in Nigeria, etc, etc.  The reason I didn't is because if you listened closely, some very smart and knowledgeable folks were telling a different story.  Folks like Blix, Ritter, Plame's husband... among others.

       I'm sure critical thinkers everywhere are applauding you.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is that for all of the critical thing you (and the rest of us do) it's virtually impossible for us not to be exposed to disinformation. Some of which we will accept hook, line and sinker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, while many news watchers just passively 'watch' the news, those of us who are actively questioning the official story and searching for knowledge are perhaps even more prone to alternative theories and may be even more open to disinfo stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure we will remain better informed than most, and will be more critical of the spin we see on the evening news but to suggest we are immune to propaganda is to be overconfident in our ability to think critically.

       But KingsX has the advantage that he questions his sources:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Is it a reliable source?

       <li>

       </li>
       <li>
        Is there propaganda value to the source of the message?
       </li>
       <li>
        Are any sources questioning it?
       </li>
       <li>
        Is the message crazy or unbelievable in any way?
       </li>
       <li>
        Is the message too pat (I mean, using his wife as a human shield?  Did Tom Clancy write that?)

       This type of humor requires no skill or wit. Just as generic as dick and fart jokes. It also confuses people and makes you look like a hardcore Republican to the people who might have mistaken your obvious sarcasm.

       It just takes one lie on 9/11 to sake questions on the other doubts. So I put forward this one...if an airplane hit the Pentagon, yet didn't damage the lawn and the wings never smashed a pane of glass, which can be seen in pictures taken before the front wall fell down, and no wreckage of these wings can be found. Then what the fuck hit it? And WHY WON'T THEY RELEASE THE NUMUROUS VIDEOS AND PUCTURES?

       The reason they didn't charge Bin Laden was to avoid legal restrictions. Charging someone under criminal law gives that person certain rights, based on both national and international law. The Bush administration wanted to frame everything in a war context, since war law is much hazier and less restrictive than criminal law. But they went even further. In a (seemingly successful) attempt to avoid any legal restrictions whatsoever they began designating enemy soldiers and prisoners as "illegal enemy combatants" by way of flagrantly unprincipled interpretations of the Constitution and Geneva conventions concocted by sleazy lawyers like John Yoo. This dovetailed with their desire to use "enhanced interrogation techniques", another euphemism designed to avoid legal culpability.

       I suupose it would be interesting to note that the videos that show him taking credit for the attacks were both broadcast by Al Jazeera.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I will explain to you the reasons behind these events, and I will tell you the truth about the moments when this decision was taken, so that you can reflect on it. God knows that the plan of striking the towers had not occurred to us, but the idea came to me when things went just too far with the American-Israeli alliance's oppression and atrocities against our people in Palestine and Lebanon.[18][18]

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And this one - May 23, 2006
      </p>
      <p>
       On May 23, 2006 Al Jazeera broadcast a 5 minute audiotape from bin Laden where he claims he alone assigned the hijackers to perform the September 11, 2001 attacks. Bin Laden comments on the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the imprisoned journalists Sami al-Hajj and Tayssir Alouni, denying any of them (apart from a few Guantanamo Bay prisoners) were connected with Al-Qaeda.[22]
      </p>
      <p>
       Bin Laden tells viewers Zacarias Moussaoui
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "had no connection at all with Sept. 11. I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers and I never assigned brother Zacarias to be with them in that mission. I am certain of what I say because I was responsible for entrusting the 19 brothers ... with the raids.".[23]

       This is just not true.  I'll agree that there are a bunch of naive idiots out there in the US, perhaps even the majority, but to say that they're all idiots is too much.  There are plenty of rational, intelligent, and patriotic people all wanting the same shit from the government that you are.  There are actually people who know about such things, but they're typically smart enough to know they can't do anything about it but be aware and spread the news.  That's what I do at any rate.

       I would assume it's because he wasn't in US jurisdiction when planning the attacks, which would make it hard/impossible to convict him. Anyway, it doesn't really matter whether or not he did 9/11, since we already wanted him dead for the 93 WTC bombing, some embassy bombings, the 2000 attack on the USS Cole, etc.

       You're missing my point entirely.

       if you ask the average man on the street what bin Laden is guilty for, I bet you 10 internets not a single one says "the USS Cole attack". But I'm willing to bet at least 90% replies with something he wasn't actually charged with.

In any case, even if Bin Laden didn't know anything about the 9/11 attacks, he was the leader of the people responsible for him, which makes him guilty by association. Oh yeah, and whoever's downvoting me needs to read about reddiquette. Just because you disagree with what I'm saying doesn't merit downvotes.

       We agree. My point is that bin Laden's death will surely be used to justify more fucked up policies by the USG, and ignorant Americans (who known nothing of your nuanced points about OBL) will go along with it because they believe STILL that he was the one that "did" 9/11, even though 2 years ago, they were sure Saddam did it.

       That would be the
       <strong>
        Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists
       </strong>
       (Pub.L. 107-40, 115 Stat. 224, enacted September 18, 2001).  (
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_Terrorists">
        citation
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't a traditional declaration of war, because this wasn't a traditional enemy.  Mullah Omar and his Taliban group didn't even control the whole country - they were in a civil war.  And the backbone of the Taliban were outsiders brought in from arab countries by bin Laden - the locals called them "tourists."
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to define the enemy was a mess, so trying to define the fight against them was a mess.  And the response was micromanaged not from the Pentagon but from the White House by Bush II, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Rove, and anything they touched turned into a mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, I'm not saying that it was an intelligent decision.  But it was the decision.

       when i read comments like that i still think there is hope for humanity. why doesn't everyone see what is so blatantly obvious? It has nothing to do with intelligence but more a preservation of a value system that would be too traumatic to the average person to have compromised by the very disturbing and inconvenient truth.
