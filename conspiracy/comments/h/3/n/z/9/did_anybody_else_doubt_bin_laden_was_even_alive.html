    <div class="md"><p>I think its safe to say that amongst the non-trolling members of this subreddit, no one did.  Aside from the fat, vigorous, dissimilar Osama video. there was the will published in non-American press, the Musharraf statement that he was likely dead by 1/02, the UAE doctor who gave him the kidney dialysis machine saying the same, the rise in prominence of his son in the organization in early 2002, the completely dissimilar content of &quot;his&quot; videos post-9/11, his miraculous reinvigoration post-fat bin Laden video, the grainy quality of post-9/11 videos, the convenient fact that they dumped the body in the sea (<em>not</em> in accordance with Islamic tradition as was universally reported) and so on and so on.  </p>

<p>That this is being reported as indisputable fact is simply another reflection of how low standards of evidence for government assertions have sunk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a politically expedient and well calculated PR move on the part of a Presidential Administration that has seen its credibility collapse all around them.</p>

<p>Just look at the lower class in the US.  They&#39;ll get raped in the ass by both parties, see their empire collapse all around them, lose their future from economic terrorism from the Fed and Wall Street, but they&#39;ll celebrate the death of an ex CIA asset that&#39;s been dead for ten years. </p>

<p>If I read this in a science fiction novel, I&#39;d say the writer was unrealistic and too sensationalist. Oh wait, I have read this in a science fiction novel, it&#39;s called 1984, and Bin Laden is Goldstein.</p>

<p>Down with Goldstein! USA! Kill Bin Laden! And don&#39;t have an NFL lockout!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So in your version of the story there are now two scenarios.  Bin Laden is either still alive somewhere or he was already dead.  If Bin Laden is still alive then all he has to do is come out and prove that he is alive.  This would completely destroy the US government&#39;s public perception.  If Bin Laden has been dead for a while then you still get the same situation.  If the US government knew he was dead but did not have the body then whoever does have the body can now come out and destroy America&#39;s reputation.  If they did have his body all this time then why now?  This isn&#39;t a particularly significant time in the political cycle, so what exactly were they waiting for?  What benefit do they get by taking the risk that their lying is exposed?</p>

<p>If you think about if from the government&#39;s perspective then I don&#39;t see any way you could argue that this operation was all a farce.  There&#39;s way too much risk involved that is out of their control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bin laden has been dead for almost 10 years. He was reported to be in a Pakistani hospital by CBS days before 9/11. He was being gaurded by the ISI, which was created by the CIA. So most likely the ISI or the CIA took his body, and I think they can be confident that this show can go on uninterrupted.</p>

<p>There is a 2012 election on the table, if you remember correctly, May 1st was also the day that Bush declared &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;.
I will agree, this is rushed, but the US gov is trying to push the idea of getting troops in Pakistan on the Iranian border to prepared for war with Iran.    They are getting too impatient because they are losing support for all of their wars.</p>

<p>Remember the Jessica Lynch &quot;hero&quot; story what was later proven to be entirely made-up?   Well the news-cycle and election demographics sure didn&#39;t.   This is the same exact kind of story, and the lack of evidence only further proves that.</p>

<p>The &quot;death&quot; of OBL (provably dead since December 26th 2001) helps them to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Justify a presence in Pakistan (&quot;they were harboring him, how could they <em>not</em> have known!?)</p></li>
<li><p>Lay the Stage for new &quot;retaliatory&quot; false-flag attacks, to justify even further engagement of &quot;al-qaeda&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Have all of this conveniently occur before the 2012 elections to boost morale and reelect someone who has proven to be a wonderful hypocrite and brand name.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When Israeli interest controls ALL media, you will see this <em>lie</em> quickly turn into a truth.   Even if we provided ALL OF THE EVIDENCE in the world that Osama had died 10 years ago, they would call us CoNsPiRaCy theorists.   So sit back, and enjoy the show.   Because apparently there&#39;s not a god damn thing we can do to warn these porn-sugar-football encrusted brain fucked people that they are being lied to and exploited to be prepared for real war.</p>

<p>You thought Iraq was bad.... just watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would he come out? They aren&#39;t looking for him any more so he can finally rest easy. </p>

<p>The concept of Al-Quada has already transcended Bin Laden and his goal of financially ruining the US is already pretty much accomplished. </p>

<p>What would he gain by revealing himself that he doesn&#39;t already have? </p>

<p>Can you imagine the disinfo machine that would go to work if he ever released a video? We&#39;d have every intelligence official on the planet telling us the video is a fake and that the real Bin Laden is already dead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was inclined to believe he was dead. It didn&#39;t seem likely to me that he would avoid the camera so much were he alive -- I didn&#39;t see any reason for it. Now the US government says they&#39;ve found and killed him. Well, maybe. I hesitate to believe anything the government says. It lies too often. I&#39;m willing to grant that maybe this raid took place, and maybe it even killed Bin Laden, but I&#39;m not yet convinced of it, and still more inclined to believe he&#39;s been dead for years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.
Did you heard the statements of the corporate mass media? They are saying that conspiracy theorists believe that Osama is still alive and they do not believe that he was killed, but I did not hear that once. Instead everybody is telling them that even &quot;credible sources&quot;, those which are controlled by CFR and Bilderberg, had reported that he died between 2001 and 2003. They will not touch that, will they? It is all a distraction. Let us wait if they are stupid enough to release photoshoped pictures of OBL. </p>

<p>And that is what they call &quot;black propaganda.&quot; Throw in a chupacabra and some LGMs and you smoke out all the raving nutters in their &quot;compounds.&quot; (Fuck, if I add another machine shed for the new lawn tractor, I&#39;m havin&#39; me a &quot;compound.&quot;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Number one - I think the guy is now officially irrelevant. When he died is of secondary importance.</p>

<p>For me, the last notable thing OBL did was to interject his opinion during the 2004 Presidential Campaign. Whether that was him, or someone pretending to be him ... that&#39;s a mere technicality.</p>

<p>The myth is more powerful than the truth in this situation.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care, really, if they just popped him out of the freezer and into the ocean. It&#39;s part of a turning point in the wars that might signal a reduction in war costs. In other words, Leon Panetta going to SecDef is a more important event. This is just jerking off the public so they feel better. And if that leads to less war, well, warm up the lube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Leon Panetta. There&#39;s your actual story. I recall reading late last week about he and his replacement basically being the embodiment of the initiative to further politicize the military. You know who&#39;s replacing Panetta?</p>

<p>Petraeus. The quintessential Bush era political animal. Watch out America, fascism&#39;s got a brand new bag.</p>
