They probably killed him years ago, but I thought this was a valid idea that I havnt heard anywhere yet.  Seeing him sitting there watching that crappy tv I was instantly reminded of jail and the compound itself looks more like a mini jail than anything else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, how about this.</p>

<p>One obvious difference would be if OBL (and his friends/family) were prisoners, they wouldn&#39;t be allowed to have guns. In case they shot their way out.</p>

<p>On the otherhand if OBL, and his friends and family, were hiding out, then they could have guns. For killing anyone who came to take him.</p>

<p>If the briefings are to be trusted, there was just <em>one</em> person firing from the compound. Which, to follow this line of thought through, could have been a guard of Bin Laden and co.</p>

<p>Nobody else managed to get a shot off. Why not?</p>

<p>Possible answer: nobody had weapons to hand.</p>

<p>Either they were really stealth attacked and didn&#39;t get a chance to reach them (anyone comment on whether that&#39;s possible?) or ...</p>

<p>... they didn&#39;t have guns to hand, at all.</p>

<p>Which might (big might) support the idea that they were imprisoned.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I know there&#39;s a lot of assumptions in the above. But ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>New York Times:
&quot;Administration officials said that the only shots fired by those in the compound came at the beginning of the operation, when Bin Ladenâ€™s trusted courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, opened fire from behind the door of the guesthouse adjacent to the house where Bin Laden was hiding.&quot;</p>

<p>I (pathetically) can&#39;t find the guesthouse location to work out if it would make a good guardhouse.</p>

<p>Worth perhaps noting that a courier would be a good candidate for a guard, seeing as the courier left the compound sometimes (and thus, in this theory, wasn&#39;t a prisoner there).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Decent theory. The &quot;raid&quot; was really just his release....</p>

<p>After years of trying to come up with some evidence to link him to 911, after thousands of torture sessions in Guantanamo, the US still couldn&#39;t come up with a link....</p>

<p>An agreement between all parties (Bin Laden family, Carlyle Group, Bushes, etc) was that if no evidence was found he would be let go. </p>

<p>Hence his burial at sea. </p>

I would have felt more satisfaction of he was apprehended, questioned, convicted and sent to prison.

    <div class="md"><p>There was no firefight , and that was no mansion! That was a prison! 40 minute firefight no bullet holes anywhere. That&#39;s a 5 minute operation. 40 minutes was used to &quot;ready the set&quot; and this heroic American tale was set in Pakistan , the movie stars were the brave &quot;seal team 6 &quot; and President Obama. Produced by the CIA and the NSA . And we were the audience! No good guys hurt or shot only bad guys dead. Just like a Hollywood action movie where we stand up and cheer the good guys. Jessica Lynch rescue? No Americans were injured there either. They stormed a hospital that was undefended by the Iraqi army, and used blank bullets. Filmed it and released the video after being edited by the pentagon .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that OBL has been dead since 2001.</p>

<p>As far as the next attack, I think its going to be more sophisticated than last time. Specifically, I don&#39;t think its just going to be some bomb or airplane event....I think it will involve the internet. </p>

<p>Something like, one day 3 major nuclear reactors on the east cost suddenly go crazy...blowing out large portions of the electrical grid in the region....meanwhile air-traffic control goes dark and they are seemingly unable to bring it back online. </p>

<p>Eventually more power stations collapse and big parts of the power grid are permanently damaged. </p>

<p>Power is out for 1 to 2 months and it takes air traffic control 3 weeks to bring their system back up. In the ensuing melee, tens of thousands die and mass pandemonium breaks out as the several states in the blackout all try to migrate en-mass to other parts of the country. </p>

<p>Some smaller cities power infrastructure is so damaged that the whole city closes down permanently. Easier for the 15,000 citizens to move than to absorb the cost of a total rebuild. </p>

<p>Multiple insurance companies and banks collapse and trillions are wiped off the market. </p>

<p>From the first moment of the disaster, a video will surface of bin ladens replacement declaring the launch of a cyber attack against the US. </p>

<p>After the 3rd day, the President signs an executive order shutting off the internet in the US. Multiple other countries follow suit... </p>

<p>Eventually, limited access is allowed again but in a totally new landscape. For one, all users need Internet ID&#39;s which are tagged to all packets leaving their router and can positively identify everyone. Any financial transaction requires the seller to store the Internet ID in their records and use that for reporting to IRS. </p>

<p>Moreover, websites cannot just be freely created. All websites require a license to operate. As part of this new licensing scheme, content on licensed websites is monitored daily. Any &quot;subversive&quot; or &quot;anti-government&quot; content results in fines, being shutoff, or jail time for the operator. </p>

<p>If one thing is clear, they <em>must</em> destroy the internet if they are going to complete their eventual goal of total human enslavement. You can&#39;t have people openly talking about the Federal Reserve, false flags, etc...</p>

In the end all that is needed is fear, all day every day if possible.  9/11 is a good example, only ~2000 people were sacrificed and look what kind of mileage they got out of it.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If you took that quote to heart, you&#39;d go insane.</p>

<p>I beg to differ.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t take it to heart, you <em>are</em> insane.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not everything that the gov does is a conspiracy. Some stuff really is true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe so, but it the dividing line between what is/isn&#39;t a conspiracy/lie isn&#39;t based on &quot;whether or not the president says it&quot;.</p>

<p>What strikes me odd, here, tex... is that you seem so eager to swallow (and encourage others to swallow) this lie, just because Obama said it... while I don&#39;t think you feel the same way about claims made by Dubya.</p>

<p>This current death claim began to come unraveled within minutes after being asserted (he was armed, then he wasn&#39;t armed. he used a human shield, then he didn&#39;t. Obama watched the whole thing, then he didn&#39;t. etc.)... the most catastrophically self-destructive, flimsy, and lame announcement ever made by this president... and here you are lending it credence.</p>

<p>Bleah.</p>

<p>Ya just lost me, bro.</p>
