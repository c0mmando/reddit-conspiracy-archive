<blockquote>
<p>False flag (aka Black Flag) operations are covert operations designed to deceive the public in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by other entities. The name is derived from the military concept of flying false colors; that is flying the flag of a country other than one&#39;s own. False flag operations are not limited to war and counter-insurgency operations, and can be used in peace-time.</p>

Or full on nukes, though I don&#39;t think they will because they are saving that for bona-fide nuclear exchanges in the world war that emerges from the attacks on various potential Chinese oil suppliers such as Libya and Iran. Venezuela is still on the hit list too, and may in-fact be the tipping point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy theory crowd has successfully predicted thousands of the last zero false flag attacks.  Usually these get copied to Reddit and Digg and elsewhere from PrisonPlanet, WorldNetDaily and various 9/11 troofer sites.  Including but certainly not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Another 9/11 style attack - a false flag attack - would result in martial law being declared.  (Just like it, er, wasn&#39;t declared country-wide on 9/11.  Not even in New York City itself.)</p></li>
<li><p>A false flag attack was going to provoke martial law and prevent the 2004 election, to keep Bush &amp; Cheney in power.</p></li>
<li><p>A false flag attack was going to provoke martial law and prevent the 2006 mid-term elections, to keep Bush &amp; Cheney in power.</p></li>
<li><p>Another claim was that the US signed an agreement whereby a virus outbreak would provoke martial law &quot;declared by the WHO and backed by UN troops.&quot;  Scores of WorldNetDaily readers reposted the message across the internet.  SARS happened.  No martial law.  H1N1 happened.  No martial law.</p></li>
<li><p>As Hurricane Katrina reached shore the usual crowd declared that the gub&#39;mint would take advantage of the crisis to declare martial law.  It didn&#39;t happen.</p></li>
<li><p>A false flag attack was going to provoke martial law and prevent the 2008 election, to keep Bush &amp; Cheney in power.</p></li>
<li><p>A false flag attack was going to provoke martial law and prevent the January 2009 handover of power.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Dunno what&#39;s next, but you count on the usual conspiracy sites to successfully predict thousands of the <strong>next</strong> zero false flag attacks.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a remarkably lame and dishonest claim.</p>

<p>Huge numbers of people have predicted martial law in America.  Nor was there any shortage of people predicting bin Laden - who had already attacked the US a number of times - would attack yet again.  None of those people have been killed.</p>

<p>Cooper was the subject of an arrest warrant for &quot;aggravated assault with a deadly weapon&quot; against a local doctor shortly before his death.   He wrote on his web site that any attempt to execute unlawful arrest warrants &quot;will be met with armed resistance.   In July and September 2001 he was accused of brandishing a handgun to threaten passersby near his home.  When police tried to arrest him for that, he shot one of them in the head.  The obvious reaction followed.</p>

<p>Cooper publicly declared ahead of time that he woud attack police if arrested, and he publicly made sure that they would come to arrest him.  It was &quot;suicide by cop.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t an &quot;anything and everything is a False Flag and don&#39;t you dare disagree&quot; forum.  I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist in a general conspiracy theory forum.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t stand the idea that other conspiracy theorists disagree with YOUR PARTICULAR pet conspiracy theory, don&#39;t post it in a general conspiracy theory forum.</p>

<p>If can&#39;t stand the idea of your pet conspiracy theory being critiqued by the public, don&#39;t post it in a public forum.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t stand the idea that some will point out the last 300 times that your conspiracy theory was applied to other events - and proven wrong by hindsight each time - don&#39;t post where other conspiracy theorists might hang out.</p>

<p>In other words, take your own advice.  Stop being an atheist on a Christian forum.</p>
