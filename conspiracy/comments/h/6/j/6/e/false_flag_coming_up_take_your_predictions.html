      <p>
       Take your predictions here and when something arises in a week or so we can reflect if we were right or wrong.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        False flag (aka Black Flag) operations are covert operations designed to deceive the public in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by other entities. The name is derived from the military concept of flying false colors; that is flying the flag of a country other than one's own. False flag operations are not limited to war and counter-insurgency operations, and can be used in peace-time.

       Dirty bombs on the west coast so the Fukushima fallout (both economic and physical) will no longer matter or have to be dealt with, and of course it will be tied somehow to Iran. Or full on nukes, though I don't think they will because they are saving that for bona-fide nuclear exchanges in the world war that emerges from the attacks on various potential Chinese oil suppliers such as Libya and Iran. Venezuela is still on the hit list too, and may in-fact be the tipping point.

       I don't think it's coming just yet but I'm waiting for a false war on an "invading" alien civilization when obviously this is not the case. The NWO is in it's death throws but things will get worse before they get better. Maybe a dispersal of aerosolized pathogens?

       I don't think they declare them anymore; frees them from constitutional restraints and political liability. We are already in an economic war with China, but it's the last thing either side would call it.

       <li>
        New Madrid activity - seems like more than buzz
       </li>
       <li>
        'Retaliation' attack(s) - An obvious progression in the storyline, but       originality isn't their strong suit.

       Really, this would have to outdo 9/11 in theatrics and make the people fall to their knees and pray for the government to send in soldiers. I've noticed a general on-edge feeling these days, so who knows? Are they gonna break us down?

       They do things in steps. And Katrina was a test case in which martial law was deliberately provoked with negligence in an emergency, and then applied with great brutality;

       It could go that way since Iran is on the list.  They could do something along the lines of a mini-nuke and say Iran retaliated and threatened to do the same in Israel. They even said on TV that Wikileaks confirmed that Iran is building nukes.  I thought they hated wikileaks.

       They already said some bullshit about trains and public transport.  It would have to be something that would have a profitable solution.  If a train or subway blew up, it would be an excuse to install the same airport scanners at all the stations for hefty profits.

       I am aware I will be downvoted horribly, but I feel the necessity in stating we are in times that were foretold a long time ago. I cannot say I predict, but I have a feeling we will see the second coming of Jesus Christ. I chose my side a long time ago.

       The conspiracy theory crowd has successfully predicted thousands of the last zero false flag attacks.  Usually these get copied to Reddit and Digg and elsewhere from PrisonPlanet, WorldNetDaily and various 9/11 troofer sites.  Including but certainly not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Another 9/11 style attack - a false flag attack - would result in martial law being declared.  (Just like it, er, wasn't declared country-wide on 9/11.  Not even in New York City itself.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A false flag attack was going to provoke martial law and prevent the 2004 election, to keep Bush &amp; Cheney in power.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A false flag attack was going to provoke martial law and prevent the 2006 mid-term elections, to keep Bush &amp; Cheney in power.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Another claim was that the US signed an agreement whereby a virus outbreak would provoke martial law "declared by the WHO and backed by UN troops."  Scores of WorldNetDaily readers reposted the message across the internet.  SARS happened.  No martial law.  H1N1 happened.  No martial law.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As Hurricane Katrina reached shore the usual crowd declared that the gub'mint would take advantage of the crisis to declare martial law.  It didn't happen.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A false flag attack was going to provoke martial law and prevent the 2008 election, to keep Bush &amp; Cheney in power.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A false flag attack was going to provoke martial law and prevent the January 2009 handover of power.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Dunno what's next, but you count on the usual conspiracy sites to successfully predict thousands of the
       <strong>
        next
       </strong>
       zero false flag attacks.

       This proves your ignorance of available material.  Bill Cooper did predict 9/11 and was killed shortly after.  Sometimes you add to the conversation, but I can't help but feel you are simply here to troll - like an atheist in a christian forum.

       What a remarkably lame and dishonest claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Huge numbers of people have predicted martial law in America.  Nor was there any shortage of people predicting bin Laden - who had already attacked the US a number of times - would attack yet again.  None of those people have been killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cooper was the subject of an arrest warrant for "aggravated assault with a deadly weapon" against a local doctor shortly before his death.   He wrote on his web site that any attempt to execute unlawful arrest warrants "will be met with armed resistance.   In July and September 2001 he was accused of brandishing a handgun to threaten passersby near his home.  When police tried to arrest him for that, he shot one of them in the head.  The obvious reaction followed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cooper publicly declared ahead of time that he woud attack police if arrested, and he publicly made sure that they would come to arrest him.  It was "suicide by cop."

       The uncertainty principle predicts an electron can be in two places at once, so if I guess wrong does that mean the principle is wrong? Stop making sweeping accusations amongst the group here, part of the purpose of this forum is to boil down wide conspiracies into tangible ones.
