       I'll tell you off the bat there are NO extraterrestrials.   If you go on YouTube and look for something like "Lockheed UFOs," there's a testimony given by an old LM engineer who claims that we have all kinds of strange propulsion technologies.  We also know for a fact at this point that the USAF has built some very strange aircraft.  So that's that.

       Makes money.  Always did.  Trillions upon trillions of dollars - you can remake a whole society in your image.  Hint: Koch Brothers (who are toilet paper magnates), Anthony Weiner, WikiLEAKS + Julian Assange broken condom allegations, Obama's Birth [certificate] -&gt; Osama's death, O[b/s]ama Hussein, etc....the birth certificate being signed by "Ukelele"....they make fun of you way more often than you might guess.  It's an example of sociopathic narcissism.

       Obama has about two weeks to redeem himself after this Bin Laden business.  He was obviously put into power by the Rothschilds/Goldman Sachs/JP Morgan syndicate.  If he withdraws troops and starts dramatically cutting gov't spending, he may be OK after all.  As far as I can tell, he's testing the water right now.

Why are Americans not calling for the blood of Wall Street/Mortgage Companies?  I don't really think Americans are retarded, just really uninformed, so with that said, why are we just sitting back and asking them to be gentle as they rape us?

       I dont think thats entirely true.  I first heard of the mortgage fraud while reading Huffington Post, not that i'm saying their any better than Fox or others, but just that it was in an article on a popular news site.  Regardless of how the news covers a story (See the protest in the middle east minus Egypt) people will know just by going to an online news source.  Other than that, it's not like this was just a few hundred people, there were hundreds, maybe thousands, of people getting fucked by BoA on mortgage loans, so i'm not sure how much any news organization is going to play a roll in the dissemination of this news.

       Can you give us a brief course or point at the material that lead you to this concept you have? Do you have any other information you feel it would be necessary to reveal? Lets say you have a burning desire to spread this information to people that would be extremely resistant to hearing, how would you go about it?

       Yeah I'd be delighted to.  It was a multi part trap, beginning in about August, 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 1) Host a huge public discussion on the Holocaust and 9/11 to draw out the attention of the propagandists.  This happened on reddit.  Several trolls started following me - some of you may already be familiar with them -  - jcm267, tzvika316, No___, etc.   This was based on heavy suspicions that the U.S./Israeli relationship had something to do with the Federal Reserve and 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 2) Establish beyond a doubt that the trolls were following me for the purpose of propaganda (using Reddit Enhancement Suite to capture vote rigging through proxies on discussion threads, which I did conclusively for about 4 different threads).  The whole process was to draw them out into prolonged, stupid arguments.  They did not know Reddit Enhancement Suite existed, and so they were only working off of vote totals, like morons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 3) Use hundreds of puppet accounts to scare the shit out of them - after figuring out who was who conclusively (as I already knew the name Rothschild), it was just a matter of posting their names (Rothschild, Rockefeller) in a place they'd see it.  Post the evidence repeatedly and make them freak out.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that, it was all about explaining what was going on to reddit.

       I dont think thats entirely true.  I first heard of the mortgage fraud while reading Huffington Post, not that i'm saying their any better than Fox or others, but just that it was in an article on a popular news site.  Regardless of how the news covers a story (See the protest in the middle east minus Egypt) people will know just by going to an online news source.  Other than that, it's not like this was just a few hundred people, there were hundreds, maybe thousands, of people getting fucked by BoA on mortgage loans, so i'm not sure how much any news organization is going to play a roll in the dissemination of this news.
