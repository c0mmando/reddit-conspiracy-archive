<p>I&#39;ll tell you off the bat there are NO extraterrestrials.   If you go on YouTube and look for something like &quot;Lockheed UFOs,&quot; there&#39;s a testimony given by an old LM engineer who claims that we have all kinds of strange propulsion technologies.  We also know for a fact at this point that the USAF has built some very strange aircraft.  So that&#39;s that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;d be delighted to.  It was a multi part trap, beginning in about August, 2010.</p>

<p>Step 1) Host a huge public discussion on the Holocaust and 9/11 to draw out the attention of the propagandists.  This happened on reddit.  Several trolls started following me - some of you may already be familiar with them -  - jcm267, tzvika316, No___, etc.   This was based on heavy suspicions that the U.S./Israeli relationship had something to do with the Federal Reserve and 9/11.</p>

<p>Step 2) Establish beyond a doubt that the trolls were following me for the purpose of propaganda (using Reddit Enhancement Suite to capture vote rigging through proxies on discussion threads, which I did conclusively for about 4 different threads).  The whole process was to draw them out into prolonged, stupid arguments.  They did not know Reddit Enhancement Suite existed, and so they were only working off of vote totals, like morons.</p>

<p>Step 3) Use hundreds of puppet accounts to scare the shit out of them - after figuring out who was who conclusively (as I already knew the name Rothschild), it was just a matter of posting their names (Rothschild, Rockefeller) in a place they&#39;d see it.  Post the evidence repeatedly and make them freak out.</p>

<p>After that, it was all about explaining what was going on to reddit.  </p>
