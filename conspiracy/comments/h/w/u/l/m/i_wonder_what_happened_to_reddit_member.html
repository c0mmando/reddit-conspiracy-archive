       I liked reading his posts, but for some reason his page is gone. I used to link directly to his posts, now I need a replacement, any suggestions?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       mod donbueno states that he was not banned, so maybe IAJA simply moved on. I can understand that, sometimes only the complainers are vocal, while fans (like me) dont say thank you to good members often enough... anyway....  I hope he comes back, his efforts were appreciated and he will be missed, as shown by the number of people commenting.

       here's the thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       if he was banned/shadowbanned, what's to stop him from realizing his account is no longer visible, signing up with a new one, and alerting us to the fact that his account got removed? Nothing is. Anyone can do this, easily. Especially with this thread about it being plainly observable at the top of the board.
      </p>
      <p>
       if he was actually targeted
       <em>
        offline,
       </em>
       as it seems some here are speculating, then why would his Reddit account also disappear? Why just his account? Why not his posts? Yadda yadda. Lots of questions. So even if we assume this is what happened, it still doesn't add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       meanwhile, look at the OP. Reddit member for 17 days? Four posts, total? Then magically notices the most frequent poster to this forum is gone before anyone else does? And skyrockets to the top of the forum? Hmm. Quite peculiar.
      </p>
      <p>
       is it possible to delete one's own Reddit account? I suppose it is by engaging in ban-worthy behavior even if there is no other way, so it doesn't even matter, really.
      </p>
      <p>
       isn't it obvious? Unless it's just a site error, IamJulianAssange false flagged
       <em>
        himself
       </em>
       in order to get us riled up.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is my preliminary guess, anyway, until we get more data.

       I think you're on to something here. I got the vibe that he might have been a little frustrated with the lack of effort by everyone here to do something proactive, get organized, start a revolution, or whatever it may be...

       Your speculation on what may have happened is silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been told by moderator illuminated wax that there was an auto filter which targeted me because of the number of posts to r/world that were deleted. I assume they were deleted for editorializing in the post titles. I do not want to abandon this user ID because it infuriates the bury brigades.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am trying to get people to focus on what is happening in, around and to them so that they can make informed choices about how to respond. TS has already HTF. We need to focus on a rebuilding phase.

       The whole purpose for having specific places to put things is to keep things loosely resembling organized... It's just rude to not make an effort. If the kind folks from 'The Agency' haven't picked him up, he'll be back under a new name.

        "Many in the Russian-speaking community were stunned when 17 of their members — six Claims Conference employees in a New York processing office and 11 accomplices — were arrested last November on charges relating to a fraud that siphoned an estimated $42.5 million from Holocaust funds. At the time, five of the accused pleaded guilty."

       People with the time and expertise can find my IP address (I don't even know what that is) and locate me in the physical world but that is a counterproductive exercise because I am nobody and they can only make me rich and famous if they try to make me into a somebody.

       Actually, he's one of the few that make it readable. I've honestly preferred ATS lately, and that wasn't easy to admit, mind you.

         Automatic cries of "Disinfo agent!!!" or "Wake UP SHEEPLE"  whenever honest debate is presented. If you think we're not listening, or just not getting what you're trying to say, maybe you need to examine
         <em>
          your
         </em>
         clarity and conciseness.

         A lack of good links, except for IaMJulianAggange's, for the most part. Say what you want, he appears to put effort into it. He links to many more places than his blog, btw. Many here simply link to whatever bullshit Alex Jones is sprouting today and be done with it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A lack of good discussion and critical analysis. Half of the links here are quieter than r/jailbait. Furtive lurkers and trolls, lately.

       I disagree, man, and let me also say that I think what makes this a great subreddit is that besides the links, it invites some great theoretical self.posts.  When there is a link in here, more often than not it is to AlexanderHigginsBlog (IAmJulianAssange's blog, I'm sure), RevolutionaryPolitics, and most recently LewisWhitefieldHixon.  All of the links to these sites are spam, and the usual suspects all link to them (IAmJulianAssange, TheBluestLight, RadioactiveMilk,  Kr3at, etc).  These are all spammers trying to drive traffic to their website, and you fall victim to it.

       Sure, but entertaining speculation isn't what people are always looking for. Good, solid, alternative news links is what I prefer in the end.

       I've ended up deleting all the attempts I've made in the past. Well-sourced and rational alternative news links downvoted into oblivion?

       I've got a friend named Dave. We all know a Dave. After a few beers, the conspiracy theories, smug talk about being Awakened, and refusal to engage in debate all start coming out. "You're not listening to what I'm saying" repeated in the face of every logic flaw pointed out. I'm not close-minded, I just want to see
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        sources
       </em>
       .

       This subreddit reminds me of Dave after almost every conversation.

       The only people who are out to get me are the self-appointed keepers of the truth. They do not want any version of reality but there own to exist in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       People with the time and expertise can find my IP address (I don't even know what that is) and locate me in the physical world but that is a counterproductive exercise because I am nobody and they can only make me rich and famous if they try to make me into a somebody.
