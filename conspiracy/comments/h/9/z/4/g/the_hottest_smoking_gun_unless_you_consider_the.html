        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At the moment of the planes hitting the towers our top security people Porter Goss and Bob Graham were conspiring with the top ISI commander, Mahmoud Ahmad concerning bin Laden.  </p>

<p>Mahmoud Ahmad&#39;s office (Ahmad Umar Sheikh specifically)  was reported by the FBI  to have written the check that paid the hijackers  for their work.</p>

<p>Can you give me a legitimate reason why the man who paid the hijackers  was with our top security staff  as the attacks happened and why  the man was subsequently allowed to retire back at home instead of being arrested ?</p>

<p>It is now apparent that bin Laden was hidden by the ISI with the full knowledge of the U.S. government , The ISI is known to be the agency that has  customarily paid al Queda for the American government.</p>

<p>Mahmoud Ahmads presence in our Capitol Building on the morning of September 11th is a smoking gun as to who and what was behind the 9/11 attacks. </p>

<p>The next day our present vice president met with Ahmad and will not answer questions as to what his conversations included. </p>

<p>These meetings are now the most important issue concerning  OBL and our real national security.</p>

<p>Was it an ‘intelligence failure’ to give red carpet treatment to the ‘money man’ behind the 9-11 terrorists, or was it simply ‘routine’?

<p>Random quotes.</p>

<p>Presidential candidate Senator Joe Biden admitted meeting with the chief financier of the 9/11 hijackers in the days after September 11 after being confronted by We Are Change founder Luke Rudkowski in the press room following Sunday&#39;s Democratic debate in New Hampshire.</p>

<p>According to the FBI and as confirmed by various news reports at the time, Pakistani ISI General Mahmoud Ahmad instructed Omar Saeed Sheikh, the alleged assassin of Daniel Pearl, to wire $100,000 to alleged lead hijacker Mohammed Atta in the summer of 2001.</p>

<p>Arriving exactly one week before 9/11, the general met with Pentagon, White House National Security Council and CIA officials, including George Tenet and Marc Grossman, then U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs.</p>

<p>On the very morning of 9/11, Ahmad was at a breakfast meeting on Capitol Hill hosted by Senator Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss, the chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence committees.</p>

<p>Two days after the attack on the twin towers and the Pentagon, on September 13th, Senator Joseph Biden, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met with the ISI chief.</p>

<p>No adequate explanation has been forthcoming as to why top government and intelligence officials were meeting with the money man behind the alleged hijackers before and after 9/11.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Democratic debate had finished on Sunday, Prison Planet reporter Rudkowski was able to get access to the CNN spin room and confront presidential candidate Biden about his 9/11 meeting with the Pakistani General.</p>

<p>We asked him the question - what was he doing with the head of the Pakistani ISI General Mahmoud Ahmad, said Rudkowski, he told me - he admitted that he met with him - he met with the head of the Pakistani ISI.</p>

<p>He said I told them not to do it, I told them not to wire the money - I told them to stop supporting the Taliban, which shows he had foreknowledge of them supporting him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told him - sir, he funded the hijackers, you did business with him, you let him go - he&#39;s free,&quot; said Rudkowski, to which Biden responded, &quot;Get a life kid,&quot; after which Rudkowski was pushed away by Biden&#39;s security staff.</p>

<p>Pakistan weekly spills 9/11 beans
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT</p>

<p>New Delhi, March 12: The Pakistan foreign office had paid tens of thousands of dollars to lobbyists in the US to get anti-Pakistan references dropped from the 9/11 inquiry commission report, The Friday Times has claimed.</p>

<p>The Pakistani weekly said its story is based on disclosures made by foreign service officials to the Public Accounts Committee at a secret meeting in Islamabad on Tuesday.</p>

<p>It claimed that some of the commission members were also bribed to prevent them from including damaging information about Pakistan.</p>

<p>The magazine said the PAC grilled officials in the presence of foreign secretary Riaz Mohammad Khan and special secretary Sher Afghan on the money paid to lobbyists.</p>

<p>“The disclosure sheds doubt on the integrity and honesty of the members of the 9/11 inquiry commission and, above all, the authenticity of the information in their final report,” it said.</p>

<p>The report quoted an officer as saying that dramatic changes were made in the final draft of the inquiry commission after the lobbyists got to work. The panel was formed to probe the September 11 terror attack and make suggestions to fight terrorism.</p>

<p>After the commission tipped the lobbyists about the damaging revelations on Pakistan’s role in 9/11, they contacted the panel members and asked them to go soft on the country. The Friday Times claimed that a lot of money was used to silence these members.</p>

<p>According to the report, the lobbyists also helped Pakistan win the sympathy of 75 US Congressmen as part of its strategy to guard Islamabad’s interests in Washington. “US softened towards Pakistan only because of the efforts of the foreign office,” an official was quoted as saying in the report.</p>

<p>The Pakistan foreign office defended the decision to hire the lobbyists, saying it was an established practice in the US.</p>

<p>An observer at the Islamabad meeting said money could play an important role in buying powerful people. The remark came in response to comments made by some US officials after 9/11 that “Pakistanis will sell their mothers for a dollar”.</p>

<p>Pakistan had emerged as front-runner in the fight against terrorism unleashed by the US after the terror strikes. Washington pumped in billions of dollars to win President Pervez Musharraf’s support in launching a crackdown on al Qaida network thriving on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
