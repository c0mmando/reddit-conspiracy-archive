The lost art of critical thinking has become critical for the continued welfare/survival of our own people.  For those of you ready to take the red pill, here is a good starting place for you.... --&gt;  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.strike-the-root.com/">http://www.strike-the-root.com/</a></p>

<p>I, also, urge you to read and watch the major news outlets (and subsequent propaganda) with more of an open mind and ask more questions about what you are hearing, who is saying it and what they stand to gain by saying such things.  Practice until you can cut through the bullshit more quickly and effectively.  </p>

<p>TL;DR: It is crucial that more people begin to use their critical thinking skills and start asking questions more often.  Do not limit the intake of your information regarding the world around you.  Instead, take in as much information from as many sources as you can find and then compare and contrast intelligently.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Privately sponsored&quot;, huh?</p>

<p>If at this point you guys can&#39;t come out and call the media what it is--a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mossad--then seriously, what&#39;s the point of r/conspiracy?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just an open mind that is required here.  There also has to be a willingness to dispense with dogma and disregard taboos.  These monsters have built a mile-high wall around the truth and the only way to peer over it is to suffer the slings and arrows of ridicule they practice firing every day.</p>

<p>You gotta be willing to take the hit, to call it <em>exactly</em> like you see it.</p>

<p>When every President of a cable news network and every President of a broadcast network news division--or the network itself--is a Jew, and when the odds of that happening by chance are like a billion-to-one, and when then to suggest conspiracy in the face of such a reality is to elicit cries of anti-Semitism and racial hate, even when the product of the news produced is propaganda for war against Muslim nations, then your problem isn&#39;t &quot;private sponsorship&quot;.</p>

<p>Your problem is a very Jewish news media.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t speak truth to power, especially now, then why in the fuck are you here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The implication is that there is an explanation for such an improbable concentration of power within one small group.</p>

<p>Simply by being Jewish, they are in a sense of Israeli &quot;descendence&quot;, as it entitles them to citizenship.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not difficult to understand.  What you should be considering right now is how much of your resistance to the idea is on account of your being conditioned to reject such suggestions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That I&#39;m too old to really be able to effect shit. What am I going to do go next door and grab my Latino neighbor and make him see the light. He probably doesn&#39;t even know all the details we&#39;re going over, all he knows is someone at the latin dance club told him he was killed on the news and he said &quot;oh how about that&quot; then went back to dancing in the club. Even if I did give him the scoop on all the bullshit he&#39;d just go back to the latin club and dance because that&#39;s what he likes to do.</p>

<p>So what are we all supposed to do? Buy gold and call efoods direct so I can have my little disaster kit all worked out so I can stay alive one more day to witness the elite&#39;s completed plan and hope I can get a job working as a butler for one of the elite&#39;s kid&#39;s kid? That seems to be the only solution Alex Jones seems to offer up. Vote for Ron Paul? Ok, what in the meantime? Oh buy me a berkey water filter? Okay!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... Because I did not post this to start a debate on the merits of any particular political or social viewpoint.  I was, only, hoping that i could throw something out there to get at least one person thinking, learning and filtering out the many dissenting opinions out there.  I believe what I believe and I am not going to cram it down anyone&#39;s throat.  You (not specifically you) are free to believe your own beliefs based on your own research and your own bs filters.  My intention is to tell others NOT to believe any idea simply because somebody said it but to open their minds to all sources and take what you want and leave what you want according to their own convictions.  I offered a starting place for some ideas floating around out there.  I think people already know how to watch FOX or CNN without me linking it here.</p>

<p>I thank you for your thoughtful and eloquent response.  I appreciate that you refrained from &quot;shitting on, downvoting or taking a condescending tone&quot; when considering my personal view.  You are entitled to your own.  </p>

What I do &amp; what I was trying to propose via this ppost is to take into account all opinions, question their sources &amp; potential ulterior motives &amp; make up your own mind.
