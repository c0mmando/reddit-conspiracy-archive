Are they lying to us about him being dead?  No.</p>

<p>Are lying to about how and when it happened?  Probably.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  I&#39;ve realized over the past few hours that even if OBL&#39;s death on May 2nd was faked, I&#39;m going to stop asking questions about it in hopes that it serves as a catalyst to get us out of the Middle East.  I&#39;ll resume asking questions once the troops are all home and the politicians that sent them there have to actually face the music.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to disagree.  While I&#39;m more than willing to consider Obama&#39;s account of what happened when he releases some more evidence, it seems that others are eager to reject any evidence that may contradict the fact that OBL was just killed.  On one side, we have people simply asking questions, and on the other side, we have people downvoting questions and engaging in personal verbal attacks against anyone that dares question the official story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk if we&#39;ll ever really know the whole story. I agree some stuff sounds strange, but it may be for other reasons than you&#39;re thinking. Perhaps we shot an unarmed man who was begging to be arrested? It wouldn&#39;t bother me, but I&#39;m sure some people would have some argument. Maybe some soldiers fucked up his corpse a little.... Who knows?</p>

<p>A lot of people don&#39;t believe it because they never believed in Bin Laden in the first place. I do, I mean he does have kids, and parents. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard for people to trust the govt because of proven conspiracies like the Kennedy assassination. Some people believe the govt blindly. Because what else can you really do? This whole thing is weird, and questionable. But it&#39;s not advantageous enough to be some kind of bald faced conspiracy.</p>

<p>This is our moon landing argument. We&#39;ll talk about this forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was it seems that theres a choice between one of two extremes. Either you&#39;re a crazed conspiracy theorist, a fucking lemming, or somewhere in between. The reality is there is little that can even be done at this point no matter which side is correct.</p>

<p>That makes things like this particularly hard for people who do think critically of what their govt tells them to believe. Nobody will know what to think.... Ever. So technically the critical thinking still leads to one being stymied.</p>

<p>I thought for a long time that OBL had been dead for years, buried in some nameless cave in the mountains, body unrecoverable.  I am perfectly happy to believe &quot;We Got Him&quot; on 2 May.</p>

<p>The talk that we&#39;ve had him dead for years and on ice is stupid. Bush would have trotted him out and taken credit. If the whole thing is a hoax I think you&#39;d have a hard time convincing the entire SEAL Team 6 to go along with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that I belong to the May 2nd camp or not.  I&#39;m just saying that it seems to me that if Osama died in a random airstrike awhile back, yet no American troops were aware of his death, his fellow insurgents could have just covered it up so as to make him an immortal ghost of sorts.  Obama announcing that he was killed on May 2nd puts an end to the speculation, yet the amount of proof he&#39;s put forth thus far that Osama was in fact killed on May 2nd is suspect at best.  That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.</p>

The presence of his threat to the west was imperative to continuing operations in middle east.

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t take it personally. When I found the r/philosophy reddit, I was totally psyched, until after a few months it became clear to me that they&#39;re not really looking for the truth, they&#39;re looking for the truth as they already know it. To each his own. This is America pal, and if you don&#39;t like it, GTFO... could easily be changed to &quot;This is r/philosophy, pal...&quot; or &quot;This is r/soccer, pal...&quot; etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not personal and don&#39;t be discouraged. </p>
