<p>I couldn&#39;t find anything else about flooding causing earthquakes, however I thought I&#39;d put this out there on the chance something does happen. I strongly believe that the weather is being manipulated for esoteric purposes; to cause more &quot;natural&quot; disasters and push the Elite&#39;s depopulation agenda could be the reason. My best wishes go out to all of you who are having to deal with these weather-induced hardships at present. </p>

<p>Check out 1949...I&#39;m not antisemitic but Israel seems to have a hand in many &quot;cookie jars&quot;.</p>

<p>*Also in the births 1933 - Louis Farrakhan was born on May 11th.</p>

<p>*Also, in 1310 fifty-four members of the Knights Templar are burned at the stake as heretics.</p>

<p>But I think what not to the sky was hinting at was 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i personal saw a talk by a seismologist on la local channel of a university maybe usc where he showed that the flooding of the california food basin in the past always lead to a break in the san andreas fault.</p>

<p>that happened up until the levee building in the early 1900&#39;s</p>

<p>should be easy to find the guy&#39;s work if you look.</p>

<p>he was with usc i think but at least a local california university.</p>

<p>joked about never eating talapia again after doing so many seismic studies from a boat on the salton sea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if I buy flooding causes earthquakes. I mean we see tons of flooding each year in the US. Also, if this were the case for the new madrid fault zone, why didn&#39;t anything happen in 1937 when the river reached higher crests then it is expected to this time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It obviously isn&#39;t going to cause an earthquake every time. Even if an earthquake (in susceptible areas) is caused only 1/100 floods, that&#39;s still a reason to consider when flooding any area on purpose. </p>

<p>Take a look at Georedd&#39;s article below, shown is more evidence to suggest that flooding can cause earthquakes. Based on this IMO it doesn&#39;t seem smart to flood an area on purpose right about an unstable seismic zone. </p>
