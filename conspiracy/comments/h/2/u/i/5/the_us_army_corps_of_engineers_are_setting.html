       I couldn't find anything else about flooding causing earthquakes, however I thought I'd put this out there on the chance something does happen. I strongly believe that the weather is being manipulated for esoteric purposes; to cause more "natural" disasters and push the Elite's depopulation agenda could be the reason. My best wishes go out to all of you who are having to deal with these weather-induced hardships at present.

       i personal saw a talk by a seismologist on la local channel of a university maybe usc where he showed that the flooding of the california food basin in the past always lead to a break in the san andreas fault.
      </p>
      <p>
       that happened up until the levee building in the early 1900's
      </p>
      <p>
       should be easy to find the guy's work if you look.
      </p>
      <p>
       he was with usc i think but at least a local california university.
      </p>
      <p>
       joked about never eating talapia again after doing so many seismic studies from a boat on the salton sea.

       My brother was evacuated from the flood plain approximately 24 hours ago. We have not been able to contact him or anyone else who was evacuated since then. I am quite(read; pretty fucking worried) nervous.
Edit: He is home safe, thank goodness, I was worried. Only took 2 fucking hours on the phone with the fed government to track his ass down..

       This is why we preach to make a plan for friends and family before hand.  Everyone should have one other out-of-state family member to contact.  Obviously, if flooding along the Mississippi is a problem, perhaps someone outside of a flood zone would be good.

       I don't know if I buy flooding causes earthquakes. I mean we see tons of flooding each year in the US. Also, if this were the case for the new madrid fault zone, why didn't anything happen in 1937 when the river reached higher crests then it is expected to this time.

       It obviously isn't going to cause an earthquake every time. Even if an earthquake (in susceptible areas) is caused only 1/100 floods, that's still a reason to consider when flooding any area on purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at Georedd's article below, shown is more evidence to suggest that flooding can cause earthquakes. Based on this IMO it doesn't seem smart to flood an area on purpose right about an unstable seismic zone.
