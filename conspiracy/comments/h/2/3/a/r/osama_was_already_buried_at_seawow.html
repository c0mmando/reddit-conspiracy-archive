       I'm not one for conspiracies but this shit is just ridiculous. We're supposed to just believe he died earlier yesterday and they buried him in the sea as per "Muslim tradition?" I call bullshit so much. We "had his body" and they didn't want to do anything with it? Yeah, I get it we're a civilized people or whatever we want to call ourselves this week, but this is the most hated man in American history. Why would they be so quick to burying him after "obtaining DNA evidence?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm shocked that this seemed to be swept under the radar. If there has ever been a reason to believe in a conspiracy this is it. Not inconsistencies in documents, grainy videos, etc. This is us being told in 5-6 hours that we killed Osama, verified he was who we thought he was, and buried him? Bull fucking shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: It's easy to find with a Google search but I'll post the ABC News article with an interesting statement.

       "To avoid that, an informed source tells me, the intention is the bury his body at sea -- leaving no definitive location for the final resting place of his body."
      </p>
      <p>
       No definitive evidence of his final resting place so terrorists don't make it into a shrine? I hate everything about this. It's so frustrating not knowing the truth.

       Reuters didn't make the fake pic, reuters was only responsible for the
       <em>
        original
       </em>
       image of OBL that was used/merged with another photo to make the fake death photo. Reuters themselves was not pushing it as a legit death photo, they were actually the ones that saw the death photo and said "hey that looks familiar, that was made using one of our pictures".
      </p>

       So I guess if you believe it you are retarded, because not even Reuters (who you claim released it) is claiming its legitimate. The people publishing it were pakistani TV and newspapers, Iraqi TV, and a bunch of random tabloid'ish papers like The Daily Mail and others of that journalistic aptitude.

       look, I didn't put time into researching the entire background of that picture, I just remembered that I had seen one that looked like a P-shop Noob-job..  I never wrote that Reuters said it was true, I never said I 'believed it', I know that Middle East tabloids published it a lot.. you're seeing way more conspiracies in my simple posted line than there is in the age old story of that funny fake pict that had emerged at once.. I don't think inventing perceptions behind somebody's statement justifies calling them retarded.. I'll put the blame on the fact that reading a line does no convey the tone with which it should be read and next time I'll post a :) next to the sentence for peeps that can't grasp Irony.

       My apologies if I was mistaken, it's just you said "the fake Reuters pic that came out in 2009 if they pull it back from the shelves again"
      </p>
      <p>
       You called it a Reuters pic, and implied they might "take it off the shelves again" like there was something intentional Reuters was doing to re-propagate it. The manipulated fake was never
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       picture as you seemed to imply.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was misguided, my bad, but when reading your sentence again I still read it as you implying Reuters was intentionally putting this pic
       <em>
        back
       </em>
       into publication or something.

       Yeah. That one caught my attention too. I suppose they could assume that with his notoriety, diggers might want a piece of him to remember him by. I'm sure people can be that sick. However, I'd still say it's a very lame excuse to do so. Smells very...conspiracyish. Woudn't you say? I mean, it's not like they stopped to bury every terrorist they killed nevermind even tossing them into the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       But assuming they did do it out of respect to the Muslim tradition (holding that the laws in Islam actually do call for burial at sea for certain circumstances), I certainly hope they've retained some form of rock-solid evidence that the body is of the guy who they say they killed.
       <strong>
        If
       </strong>
       there is a body. The plot thickens.

       Think of it this way. The US Government is worried about pay back for killing him. What would pictures of his body next to smiling US Troops do?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many reasons to keep his body but there are many reasons not to. If this is a conspiracy then saying they buried it in the sea is perfect. If it isn't then I can imagine this decision was not easy. Think about the discussion that has to take place.

       <p>
        If a person dies on a ship and if there is no fear of the decay of the dead body and if there is no problem in retaining it for sometime on the ship, it should be kept on it and buried in the ground after reaching the land. Otherwise, after giving Ghusl, Hunut, Kafan and Namaz-e-Mayyit it should be lowered into the sea in a vessel of clay or with a weight tied to its feet. And as far as possible it should not be lowered at a point where it is eaten up immediately by the sea predators.

       The custom was that he be buried quickly after death.  This is why he was buried quickly.  Being buried at sea had nothing to do with custom.  That was just so that people couldn't visit his final resting place.

       Not entirely sure that fulfills the 'traditional part', but technically you would be right. They could bury him under the earth below the sea.

       I'm pretty sure the American army consists of people from all sorts of religions so no, I wouldn't say they're a Christian army. But I don't get why you're asking that though?
      </p>
      <p>
       True, most wars are of a religious nature deep down, but I only think that most of the Muslim population would not consider the things he was accused of doing to be very Islamic (e.g. killing of innocents)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Oh, I'm an idiot. You meant "Christian" as in having the property of being Christian. I think killing enemy
       <em>
        combatants
       </em>
       is perfectly acceptable (assuming that wars are acceptable in the first place, which I really think it shouldn't be). On the other hand, killing children and women and the elderly would not be a very Christian thing to do.

       But American soldiers have also killed innocents including women and children (I know most/all was accidental, but it still remains true).
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course this major difference is that the radical Muslims (such as Osama) saw ALL Americans as the enemy...not just males...they were not targeting 'innocents' by their definition.  The term 'innocents' was something that we (as westerners) gave anyone who was not in active combat...but to them anyone with the western ideals were the enemy, and therefore not 'innocent'.

       I do understand that most Muslims don't see it that way...my point was just that some do, and it is those ideals that they were following.  It is like the difference between Orthodox, Catholic and Anglican really...all branches of the same religion...but difference interpretations of such.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly...I don't particularly care about religions and such...I just know that too often people are painted with the same large brush that the media and propaganda have taught us to.  I just enjoy bringing the perspective to the argument.  :)

       Kewlness! I like discussions like that. But I think you and I are of the same thought: war sucks. It used to work in a world that was still new and you never knew what danger lurked in foreign lands, but now that we know what's going on, war is such a hassle. Kills quite a bit of people too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, the Taliban dudes are a bit off their rocker. Their interpretations of the ideals of Islam are a bit more violent than your garden variety Muslim.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, based on rough evidence of events that I just so happen to know of, I would say that a lot of the violence in the world is generally caused by people who have too much faith. In
       <em>
        any

       religion. Those crazy Aburame Shino guy in Japan. Your Timothy McVeighs. That crazy man from Texas. Osama bin Laden. Religion. It's madness.

       Unfortunately, the killing of women and children by US soldiers is not just a case of misunderstandings.  Look at
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_Massacre">
        My Lai
       </a>
       or consider the rash of rapes and sport killings in our latest wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory, which is just an extrapolation of On Killing, is that our psychological training techniques have become too effective at creating killers out of young men.  Gone are the days of the Civil War, where something like 60% of shots taken were intentionally fired above the enemy lines instead of into them.

       Why would you not believe it, out of curiosity? They kept the body long enough to get a conclusive ID and take DNA samples, which takes under an hour. Why would they want to hold onto the body and transport it? Should they have waited a week to dump the body simply because it's fun? I'm not debating, I'm just genuinely curious.

       Bin Laden was wanted because he allegedly committed crimes. I can't imagine any domestic criminal's body being disposed of so quickly, usually they want to hang on to evidence until they get all the facts together, or at least results from the DNA samples. This whole thing seems like a white-wash.

       They did get results from DNA samples, that takes less than an hour. And they had all the facts together from surveilling the estate -- once they'd confirmed whose body was whose, there was no reason to keep them around.

       I'm not debating either I'm just taking guesses on why they might want to hang on to an important piece of evidence in one of the biggest crimes in modern history. Personally, I don't place any weight on anything the white house says anymore. I know 911 was an inside job, so whether or not they caught Bin Laden doesn't mean shit to me.

       You're right, in fact I can't even be sure that Fukushima melted down. I'm thousands of miles away, all I can do is piece together information I find and come up with a hypothesis. Philosophy 101: How can we know anything for certain?

       That was highly criticised by a number of military and political figures, including Obama. The policy for the last 2 years has been to show respect to religious customs at every opportunity to fight the ill-will generated by military operations in Islamic countries. It's better PR this way.

       Honestly, I'd accept it at 100% evidence. I already believe them 95% anyway. But I wouldn't be a septic if a red flag didn't fly when they said they buried him at sea.

       Don't be so jumpy...people are trying to think and assimilate all this information.  I knew that it was reported that he was killed last night and I got that before I went to bed but I was shocked to find out that the body had been buried at sea.

       I'm not saying he's still alive. I'm not saying he was killed at an earlier period either. I just don't understand the line of thinking that our government used here. This totally adds fuel to the "he died in 2001, etc." fire and the "he's still alive" theories.

       Don't get me wrong, it disgusts me to see the way in which this being used by Obama for political gain (not that I think the Republicans would have done any less if they had been in power when this happened), but I think a burial at sea is the way to go here.

       Easier? I thought they were trying to respect his customs. Otherwise, why the 24hr limitation? They didn't state it was to avoid further conflict, they stated it was to respect his customs. And if they only stated that as an excuse to just get rid of the body quickly to avoid further conflict, what else has been said to just keep us safe? Give me a fucking break.

       There are always nut jobs.  They generally are not allowed to be effective in their aim unless it serves the clandestine organizations.  Think about it if you are trying to set up a job like 911 it is a piece of cake to find some nut jobs to sacrifice themselves.  They will always be there.  Waging a series of wars across the planet to eliminate nut jobs is not effective in eliminating them, if that is even the goal.

       There must have been a deal made somewhere along the way, that the US would let him live out his life, but when he died, find a way to take credit. Between burying him at sea (wtf lame) and being found in a mansion near a military base, there are some big holes in this story.

       I figure that it takes at least four inane details to deliver each little payload.  I work at my friends store one day a week and I have fun playing with peoples minds.  If I think that someone can take it I will look them straight in the eye and tell them something really crazy having to do with new alcohol laws.  For example a guy about 21 or 22 was trying to buy a tequila bottle shaped like a tommy gun and I told him a few times that he needed to be 25 years old because of the violent connotation and that there was nothing that I could do.  He was ready to admit defeat and then I filled him in and it was a jolly old time.  I do this shit all of the time when I am in an energetic mood.  My point is that people are conditioned to accept any ridiculous new law or idea.  Anything is possible now and as long as I have a confident demeanor most people are willing to accept anything.  Of course not everyone has the good humor to appreciate when they have been gotten over so is a developed skill in selecting weak targets that won't hold a grudge.  Additionally I can determine if someone is going to be a pain in the ass by the time that they have passed through the front door.  Likewise I believe that most people have already accepted the lie before it has been spoken.  Playing it out is simply a ritual derived from their calculated weakness.

       Under Bush, Hussein was taken down and made a spectacle of for months and months. None of it made anything any better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Obama, Bin Laden is finally found and killed, and instead of doing the stupid thing (bragging about it more than necessary, and showing off his body), they instead emphasize treating his body with respect, and dispose of it in such a manner as to reduce the commotion as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion this makes perfect sense, even though I fully understand how a lot of people are going to be dissatisfied with it. My guess is that the CIA has more than enough samples and evidence to convince anyone with a high enough clearance level, but that they couldn't care less what people discuss about it on the internet.

       Frustration and genuine ignorance does not a conspiracy make.

       Nope. destroyerofwhirls took what I said (me
       <em>
        guessing
       </em>
       what the CIA
       <em>
        probably
       </em>
       did, and how they
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       have reasoned), and turned it into a statement of opinion (that I somehow said that is how I
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       the CIA
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       do it). There were no facts involved, at all, in destroyerofwhirls' reply. He simply took what I said, inferred his own meaning into it, and asked me if I defended that view.

       So they can stage a military maneuver in a hostile country, losing helicopters and blowing up buildings, but they can't get "3rd-party observers" to verify their lies for them?

       I don't get why it has to be more complicated than it is. They went in, after months of recon and planning, killed him in battle and decided the smartest thing to do, to minimize any kind of
       <em>

       impact (I think they prioritize repercussions and revenge acts over convincing conspiracy theorists on the internet), was to bury the body as respectfully and quickly as they could. It's all over, done with, case closed. Everyone can move on.

       This analogy is moot, because the very issue is whether or not the Loch Ness monster even exists. We know Bin Laden exists, the question is whether or not he's dead. It really doesn't matter if he's gone, silent and passive, because for all intents and purpose
       <em>
        he might as well be
       </em>
       dead. That's the point. We're just squabbling over details. Bin Laden's
       <em>
        gone
       </em>
       either way.

When you reference "They" or "Them" actually type out who you believe are doing this. I'd like to know if I'm reading someone who thinks the Illuminati are doing it or The Molemen or aliens.

       That is nice if it is knowable but I have found that it is easier to study methodologies.  Just like the carpenters train the journeymen the people that practice these methodologies train the next generation.  I think that it is easy to see an overarching methodology that is far greater than the people who are purported to be in power.  While many pawns might do things for different reasons than their controllers I believe that it is much more relevant to look at the actions.  If you wear a mask long enough you become it, fruits and trees and all of that.

       But Muslim clerics and many, many people criticised Bush for that. It was a minor international incident. Obama's goal has always been to improve the American image in the Middle East. So this wasn't anything about offending
       <em>
        Osama's
       </em>
       beliefs, it was about not damaging the reputation of the US, which had just stormed into an allied country.

       Yeah right! The reputation of the US is damaged. We annihilate the fuck out of Muslims every day. This wasn't some civilian, this was Osama Bin Laden, he is accused of killing 3,000 people. There is still no proof that this even happened. There is still a video of a house that Osama was supposedly held up in. Osama has been dead for years. REELECTION BID!

       They don't give a shit about his beliefs. They just didn't want a backlash for doing something "Unholy" with his body and they didn't want to have to deal with him being immortalized with a grave. It is the smartest thing they could have done with his body and they did it quickly so there wouldn't be time for people to debate.

       They got rid of him at sea to cover the fact they didn't get him at all.  He died years ago. Kidney failure whilst on the run from the us military = death.  The pakidtanis have known him dead for years.

       Trotting out the other one's was viewed by the Obama administration as a mistake that was counter-productive in the past. New ways to deal with the killing of al-queda leaders (mostly dealing with NOT waving the dead body/pictures of it around) were in the works since the death of Uday and Qusay, and this is the first time we've seen them in action.

       Interesting, yes, but I think this is far more an example of a possibly-imperfect foreign policy rather then some sort of perfect conspiracy.

       What gets me is how we have a CIA created savior cult of personality Obama killing a CIA created arch enemy cult of personality Osama.  Then you have Osama at one time being the hero fighting against the previous existential enemy Communism and then literally becoming the embodiment of new existential enemy radical Islam.

       Did anyone else remember an interview on BBC with Benezhir Bhutto where she was asked who was out to assissinate her she responed, matter of factly with, the same people who killed Osama bin Laden?

       It seems they are stopping the wars.  They announced the shakeup last week at the CIA and the DOD.  This week they announce his death, because they had to do it sometime.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's mostly likely that he died well before the 2004 election.  This simply means that he can no longer be used as propaganda.

       I found the coincident timing of shakeup at the top of intelligence the most interesting thing too. More interesting than the other events such as Ghadafi's kids being killed by Nato, and the birth certificate thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we accept the story at face value, then it must have been the intelligence chiefs who were responsibile for identifying OBL's location. By rights they ought to be being celebrated and decorated with medals and yet they are sacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively if there's foul play at work, then it's still a bit too soon for the new guys to learn to pull the party line. All very strange.

       You are correct, they do need something to compare it to.  They took a sample from his sister, when she died at Boston Medical.  They search for specific markers that would show up between related individuals (i.e. sister, brother, fater) with a 99.99% acturacy.

       You're thinking of DNA sequencing, where they map and record every part of the DNA. All they had to do here was check certain markers against the DNA of his sister (who died in a Boston hospital) and make sure they match (proving a sibling relationship). This takes maybe an hour in a commercial lab, and when a mission to kill or capture him was started, the lab would have been preparing for a test and had the markers of his sister already up for comparison.

       I don't find the burying at sea to be suspicious, it makes perfect sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't understand the whole killing him part. As far as I can tell, it was him, his son, his wife, and two couriers.  I'm sorry, but they didn't shoot the guy in the head.  When a man has to use a woman as a human shield to stave off death for a few moments longer, then he isn't really in a position to stave off these soldiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would bet that they are torturing the hell out of Bin Laden right now in order to gain intelligence information.  No doubt that they caught him, but saying he's dead allows them to torture him without any real repercussions.

       You are so naïve... You really think they'd bury his body at sea? Right now that fucking thing is being dissected or at the very least it's being blown to shit by 4 navy seals who love explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it's a Muslim tradition to bury a body within 24 hours the smartest thing the US could have done was to tell the world they buried him at sea so that non-radical Muslims would respect the US and that radical Muslims would be refused a memorial location of his body to worship.

         Close enough. I believe if I remember correctly Muslims can be buried at sea under certain circumstances. That said, I don't think anyone really cares all that much about respecting his body.

       I would like to point out that there is a long seafaring tradition amongst Arabs. Many non-Arab moslems also belong to seafaring nations. In the days prior to refrigeration, I'm sure that many an Arab mariner found his last resting place at sea.

         Pretty sure his own family would take the body, but also sure that it wasnt being offered to them. All the martyr bullshit is just that: bullshit. They can transport the body to the US or GITMO or any other US base.

         Childish questions deserve childish answers. That's not questioning facts, it's creating questioning where it wasn't necessary.

         His family
         <em>
          would not
         </em>
         take his body actually. If you've read the literature on the Bin Laden family, most of his family have disowned him. It would also be a laborious task to kill him, move his body, use his body for U.S. needs (DNA confirmation), contact a family member, and have the body moved within 24 hours (as Islam require body disposal within 24 hours). That all said, the point still stands. No country wants a "martyr's grave" within their borders.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That was more to the point that the U.S. has stated that his body was disposed *as per Muslim protocol" which require burial as the only means of disposal for a body, unless there is reason to believe the body may be dug up. This means that burial at sea due to such special circumstance.

       I was also glad to read that they will release pics soon. I'm fine if they say "we are holding back on pics right now to let things cool down a bit". That would be logical.

       The water burial is common in India, not at all common among muslims. Muslim burials are usually a wash and wrap, sometimes there's a little gathering and burial.

       It also avoids a potentially violent domestic situation. We have his followers in this country, whether they are active terrorists or not. What happens when we bring him here and also throw their customs to the wind? It has the potential to create a Patroclus situation.

       Im also sure that in the next few days we will see pics of his bloodied, broken body, which is enough to prove (to me anyway) that other 'terrorists' have been killed.

       I'm also feeling rather skeptical about this whole thing, but I can't for the life of me figure out why the Obama administration would lie about this, especially now when it really serves no purpose. It will be forgotten about by election time and it doesn't seem like they're trying to divert attention from anything else.

       I always suspected he was dead for years, but the proof was hidden to avoid a holy war supporting him as a martyr.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what was said recently is exactly true (which I doubt), then it appears that America can simply go into any supporting country and kill a foreigner without trial or reasonable proof. Gee, that is convenient.

       Guys, guys, come on! He died a week ago after being shot yesterday by a CIA/SEAL team/unidentified shooter. Pictures were taken, we know this because the white house said so, you won't get to see them and doubting their existence is a conspiracy theory and you're crazy for being so unpatriotic! There's also only a video of the alleged house he was found in, but no video evidence of him and he was given a questionably traditional burial at sea, we don't know which sea or where he was "buried" in this sea, but he was. Trust me, the White House said so.

       The last thing that you want is a radical Muslim community having one more thing to rage about. In observance with Muslim customs his body was buried at sea to prevent is further desiccation due to his infamy.

       I can't imagine there isn't enough video, photo and DNA evidence to go around.

       Besides - if they brought a body back, theorists would just say it was a fake anyway. Doesn't really matter where it's a corpse, box of ashes or a polaroid picture.

       Well who knows.  It certainly appears suspicious, but I can understand wanting to avoid antagonising the enemy more than necessary, especially considering it would be used to recruit more soldiers.

       There is a difference between simply killing an enemy, and stealing their body and putting on display.  It would look like grandstanding.

       I believe quite a few conspiracies about our current state in America and these seems absolutely feasible. I doubted how long he could have been alive in caves needing dialysis since '99. But, I also heard he was seized by United States Marines and knowing quite a few of the company's in that area they would have made his body swiss cheese.

       There's widespread government corruption in Pakistan and it's been widely believed since the late Bush administration that people within the Pakistan military had been concealing him within their borders. This is why Obama was determined to initiate drone missions in Pakistan despite its unpopularity in 2008. The only people who claimed he was in a cave were South Park writers.

       His sister died in a Massachusetts hospital in what, 2005, 2006? Her body was quite famously seized by US authorities, I don't know how you could've missed that in the papers. And 5-10 days, that's 1990s talk. For $200 you can get

       to test you and your sibling's DNA and get a report on the match within 24 hours. That's twelve hours per test including the business' downtime, queues, processing, billing... Familial relationship matches in a law-enforcement lab take less than an hour.

       I read another article a few mins after this post that said they matched it with a family members dna, didn't know it was his sisters brain. I was going to edit the post but was too lazy.  Still though there have been no released pics and its very convenient how they dumped the evedence in the ocean asap accodrding to islamic "cusoms" which are apparently bogus because he died more than 600 miles from the ocean and it is a slap in the face so to speak to have not buried him in the ground.  Essentually we have to take their word for it with no proof.  Obama administration has a perfect record for keeping to the truith eh?

       If we have DNA evidence, doesn't that mean we already had DNA to compare it?  Not exactly ironclad.

       If this wasn't bullshit, there would be an independent pathologist involved.  For example, we'd be able to preserve slides of kidney tissue, and confirm signs of renal failure.  There are a lot of other known biometrics.

       I would say yes, it is to avoid a final resting place so to not make a tourist attraction for terrorists.  I hope they kicked his body out of the back of a cargo plane from 20,000 feet, far from the Middle East.  Maybe a live grenade stuffed in his pocket.

       Why not just bring him to America and prove it's him in a different way than just taking their word for it? They claimed he's being buried at sea somewhere that no one will ever know. They're basically saying, "He's dead so we'll just get rid of him. Take our word for it."

       Seeing how he have been reported dead for 10 years and most likely kept in a big freezer in some military base, it would be a bit awkward to explain to anyone looking at him why he looks recently defrosted.

       then you have to explain what you did with the body after you got it here.  Dump it in the ocean, Sopranos style, and there is nothing that can be done about it.
       <br/>
       I see what you're saying, but I think it's more trouble than it's worth.  I'm sure they got pics and DNA samples, after that, the body is just more trouble than it's worth.

       But won't they continue to instill fear regardless of Bin Laden's body being disposed at sea? It seems to me that if you're worried about giving terrorists reason for doing things, then maybe you shouldn't have occupied countries looking for this one guy... only to get rid of him as soon as possible because you are worried.

       Yes, but anything they do from now on is
       <em>
        unjustified
       </em>
       . People will be scared (they always are), but also
       <em>
        angry
       </em>
       . Anger is good, because it unites people, where fear alone separates them. Because most people saw 9/11 as unprovoked, it made people scared but also united them towards a common goal. If the US were to take the body back, keep it and potentially mutilate it (I haven't read anything about any autopsies, again, much likely to avoid unnecessary anger and aggravation), I think a lot of Americans could even relate to it (think of leaving a US soldier with the Talibans) and the anger would dissipate into only fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my take on it, at least.

       Oh, come on. You saw people cheering when they hung Saddam. This is war. If you mounted his head on a spear in front of the white house, people would go there to celebrate victory every day. No American would relate to it, as they never related to any of the atrocities committed during these wars. If you didn't want people to be scared, why would you publicly announce high risks of terrorist attack every week? Nothing the US government has ever done was intended to stop fear of terrorism. This is no reason to get rid of such important evidence.

       I don't think you understood what I wrote. I said people
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       be scared (they
       <em>
        are

       scared), but that the only difference is whether or not they'll be more or less
       <em>
        angry
       </em>
       as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not talking about the loud-mouthed air-heads, I'm talking about most of the people of the US. I think the majority are intelligent enough to realize the difference between random attacks against "the west", and specific attempts to reclaim the body of their leader, held for little reason by the people who killed him.

       I see it as a clear attempt to minimize the impact of his death. I'm not the least bit surprised that Obama had the brains to realize that was the best way to do it. He has a track record of trying to appease those who disagree with him, without giving up entirely. This was a beautiful enactment of precisely that strategy.

       It's only ridiculous because you compare it to nothing but your own expectations. If you look at things from Obama's point of view, it all makes perfect sense. He just did what he had to do, when given the chance, and tried to minimize the impact of it. Osama is dead, his body is gone, case closed. Everyone can move on.

       Finger prints, DNA and blood samples have probably been had by the US even before 9/11. The photos and the video I'd like to see, but the body would be the best evidence there is. Say I had shown up myself with a blood sample from him and claimed a reward for having killed him. Would you have paid me?

        know
       </em>
       he's dead. Are you saying they should risk
       <em>
        even greater
       </em>
       backlash as well as the possible anger of the greater Muslim world for desecrating a body for... what? Having a keepsake? A memento? What you're proposing makes no sense whatsoever. What they
       <em>
        did do
       </em>
       makes perfect sense in every respect.

       Hah!

      <p>
       While I agree that, in a perfect world, that would be the case, the problem is that the people of the USA didn't elect a government that prided itself on transparency and its responsibility towards its people.
      </p>
      <p>
       And do tell me, how far do they have to go in this "duty" of theirs to prove it? When is enough enough? Can the last conspiracy nut demand to keep Bin Laden's body in his own fridge for the government to fulfill its "duty"?
      </p>
      <p>
       The duty I see your government prioritizing is the duty to protects its people. Obama chose to do that in a way that might not satisfy the more paranoid citizens, but that most likely will appease a large number of foreign people and powers, that would otherwise have been angry. I'd say that duty far supersedes its duty to come to your house, to your comfortable chair, and present
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       with evidence that
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       might be convinced that they went into foreign territory, engaged a terrorist base, and killed the world's most hated person with a bullet to the head.

       You didn't issue the bounty. The government did. Are you saying the government has to cut off Bin Laden's head and show it

       before it can believe it killed Bin Laden?

       the proof as well?
      </p>

       Have you seen hard proof of Bradley Manning being in prison? If not, why do you object to him being in there? You obviously can't believe anything the government says, so obviously Manning is still free.

       That's your choice. I'm just saying you're taking it to ridiculous degrees.

       But that's what I don't get. If Bin Laden is dead, then if anything, that's reason to put pressure on Obama to
       <em>
        stop
       </em>
       spending the money. And as long as he's gone, what difference does it make? Again, it seems this request that Obama
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       present evidence that Bin Laden is dead has absolutely nothing to do with responsibility or accountability towards the people, and everything with everyday "he has power, therefor he is corrupt and a liar" conspiracy mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask you this: if Obama keeps refusing to present evidence, what is the worst that will happen? In my opinion, the worst possible scenario to come from this is... nothing. Nothing happens. People carry on with their lives, Bin Laden is never heard from again, and there is
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       good reason to pressure Obama to withdraw from Afghanistan. That's it. To keep pushing on this evidence thing is to risk inflaming Bin Laden/Al Qaeda supporters, risk retaliatory attacks (which are already a risk, and would only become greater) and, at worst, to pull down whatever it is they've built up in some kind of effort to ensure stability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Bush, the big conspiracies were all about reasons to invade other countries. Under Obama, the supposed conspiracy is all about
       <em>
        ending
       </em>
       all the hostilities.
       <em>
        Why
       </em>
       would Obama lie about something that benefits his country more than himself (because, let's face it, this alone is nowhere near enough to ensure victory in 2012)? Answer me that, because everyone else actively refuses to.
       <em>
        No one
       </em>
       dares to tell me what Obama's motives are, yet they're
       <em>
        so sure
       </em>
       he's lying about something.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Yes. In my opinion, the reasons Obama gave for doing what he did were
       <em>
        excellent
       </em>
       . For once, the USA actually cared about doing right, and treating someone they
       <em>
        executed
       </em>
       with even the least bit of respect. They collected enough evidence so that if some day someone
       <em>
        truly
       </em>
       doubted what they had done (that is, not just conspiracy nuts on the internet), they could present it and prove it beyond reasonable doubt. Refusing to take Obama's word is ridiculous, when he has
       <em>
        no reason
       </em>
       to lie about it.
       <em>
        Everything
       </em>
       about what happened benefits the people of the USA. It's not enough to say "but it benefits Obama too", and pretend that that's somehow a
       <em>
        bad
       </em>
       thing.

       First, you tell me how he would have justified it. A more reasonable scenario is that he would claim to have found radioactive materials that were unsafe, and had to be locked down securely.

       For the gazillionth time, tell me what Obama's motives to lie are. If he has none, then yes,
       <em>
        it absolutely is
       </em>
       ridiculous to accuse him of lying. Not to appeal to authority, but there's probably good reason why you
       <em>
        don't

       have clearance to see everything the administration and the president sees on a daily basis.

       He basically delegitimized their presence in Afghanistan, and now it's up to the people to demand the US withdraws. Iraq has been illegitimate since Bush, so there's really no difference there. Obama
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       begun withdrawal from Iraq. Yes, things are going painfully slow, but it's not like Obama is ramping things up. Even Libya is largely an

       If it is as you say, that Obama and his friends are all corrupt, then again I ask, why focus on Obama? Why not focus on educating the public about corruption? Questioning one particular thing that happened in Pakistan isn't going to accomplish much. You're focusing on the wrong things, in the wrong way, if you really want things to chance.

       Yes, it's funny how government is all about lies and corruption when it doesn't benefit you. But whenever it builds a better road to work, or improves your neighborhood school, it's quite useful, and you don't stand outside demanding full transparency on every deal made to get those things done. No, only when it's convenient do you assume the government lies and deceives and takes advantage of you. That is my problem with "truthers" and conspiracy theorists.

       The difference is that hundreds of thousands of deaths went unpunished and could have been prevented, had the American people been less trusting of their government. But that's beside the point. Finding out the truth is motivation enough by itself.

       You can read into it anything you want, I'll buy the official story of not wanting to create a defacto shrine or place where Bin Laden is revered and celebrated. Thic could become a focal pint for more terrorist activity/recruitment.

       I don't think the United States, Israel, etc. organized the 9/11 attacks, and I'm pretty sure that Al Qaeda did, but I think the circumstances of Bin Laden's death and burial at sea are pretty weird. I honestly don't even think the public evidence for Bin Laden being the guy in charge of Al Qaeda is all that strong. How do we know that he wasn't providing cover for some other bad guy, or that the guy living in his home wasn't some kind of double? And why on earth wouldn't they keep the body of such a controversial guy around for a day or two so people could get a good look at it? I guess the best the argument that he's really dead is that, if the government was faking his death, you'd think they'd do a good job at it. But maybe there's some reason they want to make his alleged death ambiguous on purpose.

       Let's take this a step at a time. What the fucking fuck are you expecting them to do with the body? Drag it around the streets? That's deplorable. Bury him on US soil? We wouldn't stand for it, he would be dug up and thrown out to sea within 24 hours anyways. We got all the evidence we need, now his body is trash.

       So what are you suggesting DID happen? Why should the USA claim to have killed OBL if they haven't, 10 years after the event? Wouldn't he just release another video making the USA look like idiots (and liars)? Anyone dreaming up a conspiracy here just doesn't have enough real issues in their lives to occupy them.

       There is no way the US govt could have handled this to a point where everybody would be happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, we got rid of the body, rather quickly but it was a FUCKING TIME BOMB. I mean, honestly keeping it would have only been worse. It's been posted and I agree, there are plenty of pictures and we more then likely got more evidence then we needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope we show it, but more so that it leaks because I don't think we want the blood on our hands literally. Yes we killed him, no we don't want to talk about it and piss more people off.
      </p>
      <p>
       To those saying it was just to boost election status for Obama, why do it now and not a lot closer to the election?

       I knew it would be down voted. I'm not new to conspiracy. However I just hate seeing so many people not united. All my friends are bitching over how it's W's victory, all my christian friends are bitching we didn't save him and show "compassion to all men" and then there are the people who refuse to believe it because it's not a world corpse tour where you can touch his brain. We need to stand together for fucks sake.

       You really think holding onto Bin Laden's body for a few more days would be more of a recruiting sergeant than randomly killing villagers with drones.

       Honestly, I'd accept it at 100% evidence. I already believe them 95% anyway. But I wouldn't be a septic if a red flag didn't fly when they said they buried him at sea.

       Just a picture of a soldier and Bin Laden's body would suffice. I'd just like it confirmed.

       So they can stage a military maneuver in a hostile country, losing helicopters and blowing up buildings, but they can't get "3rd-party observers" to verify their lies for them?

      <p>
       I don't get why it has to be more complicated than it is. They went in, after months of recon and planning, killed him in battle and decided the smartest thing to do, to minimize any kind of
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       impact (I think they prioritize repercussions and revenge acts over convincing conspiracy theorists on the internet), was to bury the body as respectfully and quickly as they could. It's all over, done with, case closed. Everyone can move on.

       It's not about harm, it's about the truth. But harm
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       been done. If Obama moved to expose the farce from day one, he could have already withdrawn from both Iraq and Afghanistan. The people responsible for 9/11 could also be prosecuted.

       You're the only one focusing on Obama. What Bush did was much worse.

        Yes, it's funny how government is all about lies and corruption when it doesn't benefit you. But whenever it builds a better road to work, or improves your neighborhood school, it's quite useful, and you don't stand outside demanding full transparency on every deal made to get those things done.

       But in defense of the statist truthers, roads and schools cost
       <em>
        so much

       less than war and don't involve a false flag attack against their own people.

       The difference is that hundreds of thousands of deaths went unpunished and could have been prevented, had the American people been less trusting of their government. But that's beside the point. Finding out the truth is motivation enough by itself.
