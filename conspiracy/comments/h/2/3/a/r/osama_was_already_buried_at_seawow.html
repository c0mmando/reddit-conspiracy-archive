        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not one for conspiracies but this shit is just ridiculous. We&#39;re supposed to just believe he died earlier yesterday and they buried him in the sea as per &quot;Muslim tradition?&quot; I call bullshit so much. We &quot;had his body&quot; and they didn&#39;t want to do anything with it? Yeah, I get it we&#39;re a civilized people or whatever we want to call ourselves this week, but this is the most hated man in American history. Why would they be so quick to burying him after &quot;obtaining DNA evidence?&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m shocked that this seemed to be swept under the radar. If there has ever been a reason to believe in a conspiracy this is it. Not inconsistencies in documents, grainy videos, etc. This is us being told in 5-6 hours that we killed Osama, verified he was who we thought he was, and buried him? Bull fucking shit.</p>

<p>edit: It&#39;s easy to find with a Google search but I&#39;ll post the ABC News article with an interesting statement.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2011/05/osama-bin-laden-body-headed-for-burial-at-sea-officials-say.html">http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2011/05/osama-bin-laden-body-headed-for-burial-at-sea-officials-say.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;To avoid that, an informed source tells me, the intention is the bury his body at sea -- leaving no definitive location for the final resting place of his body.&quot;</p>

<p>No definitive evidence of his final resting place so terrorists don&#39;t make it into a shrine? I hate everything about this. It&#39;s so frustrating not knowing the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reuters didn&#39;t make the fake pic, reuters was only responsible for the <em>original</em> image of OBL that was used/merged with another photo to make the fake death photo. Reuters themselves was not pushing it as a legit death photo, they were actually the ones that saw the death photo and said &quot;hey that looks familiar, that was made using one of our pictures&quot;.</p>

<p>So I guess if you believe it you are retarded, because not even Reuters (who you claim released it) is claiming its legitimate. The people publishing it were pakistani TV and newspapers, Iraqi TV, and a bunch of random tabloid&#39;ish papers like The Daily Mail and others of that journalistic aptitude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>look, I didn&#39;t put time into researching the entire background of that picture, I just remembered that I had seen one that looked like a P-shop Noob-job..  I never wrote that Reuters said it was true, I never said I &#39;believed it&#39;, I know that Middle East tabloids published it a lot.. you&#39;re seeing way more conspiracies in my simple posted line than there is in the age old story of that funny fake pict that had emerged at once.. I don&#39;t think inventing perceptions behind somebody&#39;s statement justifies calling them retarded.. I&#39;ll put the blame on the fact that reading a line does no convey the tone with which it should be read and next time I&#39;ll post a :) next to the sentence for peeps that can&#39;t grasp Irony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My apologies if I was mistaken, it&#39;s just you said &quot;the fake Reuters pic that came out in 2009 if they pull it back from the shelves again&quot;</p>

<p>You called it a Reuters pic, and implied they might &quot;take it off the shelves again&quot; like there was something intentional Reuters was doing to re-propagate it. The manipulated fake was never <em>their</em> picture as you seemed to imply.</p>

<p>If I was misguided, my bad, but when reading your sentence again I still read it as you implying Reuters was intentionally putting this pic <em>back</em> into publication or something.</p>

<p>&quot;a list of possibilities:</p>

<p>2) stuff it and display it at the Smithsonian</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. That one caught my attention too. I suppose they could assume that with his notoriety, diggers might want a piece of him to remember him by. I&#39;m sure people can be that sick. However, I&#39;d still say it&#39;s a very lame excuse to do so. Smells very...conspiracyish. Woudn&#39;t you say? I mean, it&#39;s not like they stopped to bury every terrorist they killed nevermind even tossing them into the sea.</p>

<p>But assuming they did do it out of respect to the Muslim tradition (holding that the laws in Islam actually do call for burial at sea for certain circumstances), I certainly hope they&#39;ve retained some form of rock-solid evidence that the body is of the guy who they say they killed. <strong>If</strong> there is a body. The plot thickens.</p>

<p>There are so many reasons to keep his body but there are many reasons not to. If this is a conspiracy then saying they buried it in the sea is perfect. If it isn&#39;t then I can imagine this decision was not easy. Think about the discussion that has to take place. </p>

<p>If a person dies on a ship and if there is no fear of the decay of the dead body and if there is no problem in retaining it for sometime on the ship, it should be kept on it and buried in the ground after reaching the land. Otherwise, after giving Ghusl, Hunut, Kafan and Namaz-e-Mayyit it should be lowered into the sea in a vessel of clay or with a weight tied to its feet. And as far as possible it should not be lowered at a point where it is eaten up immediately by the sea predators.</p>

<p>True, most wars are of a religious nature deep down, but I only think that most of the Muslim population would not consider the things he was accused of doing to be very Islamic (e.g. killing of innocents)</p>

<p>Edit: Oh, I&#39;m an idiot. You meant &quot;Christian&quot; as in having the property of being Christian. I think killing enemy <em>combatants</em> is perfectly acceptable (assuming that wars are acceptable in the first place, which I really think it shouldn&#39;t be). On the other hand, killing children and women and the elderly would not be a very Christian thing to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But American soldiers have also killed innocents including women and children (I know most/all was accidental, but it still remains true).  </p>

<p>Of course this major difference is that the radical Muslims (such as Osama) saw ALL Americans as the enemy...not just males...they were not targeting &#39;innocents&#39; by their definition.  The term &#39;innocents&#39; was something that we (as westerners) gave anyone who was not in active combat...but to them anyone with the western ideals were the enemy, and therefore not &#39;innocent&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kewlness! I like discussions like that. But I think you and I are of the same thought: war sucks. It used to work in a world that was still new and you never knew what danger lurked in foreign lands, but now that we know what&#39;s going on, war is such a hassle. Kills quite a bit of people too.</p>

<p>And yeah, the Taliban dudes are a bit off their rocker. Their interpretations of the ideals of Islam are a bit more violent than your garden variety Muslim.  </p>

<p>In fact, based on rough evidence of events that I just so happen to know of, I would say that a lot of the violence in the world is generally caused by people who have too much faith. In <em>any</em> religion. Those crazy Aburame Shino guy in Japan. Your Timothy McVeighs. That crazy man from Texas. Osama bin Laden. Religion. It&#39;s madness.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not debating either I&#39;m just taking guesses on why they might want to hang on to an important piece of evidence in one of the biggest crimes in modern history.

<p>There must have been a deal made somewhere along the way, that the US would let him live out his life, but when he died, find a way to take credit. Between burying him at sea (wtf lame) and being found in a mansion near a military base, there are some big holes in this story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I figure that it takes at least four inane details to deliver each little payload.  I work at my friends store one day a week and I have fun playing with peoples minds.  If I think that someone can take it I will look them straight in the eye and tell them something really crazy having to do with new alcohol laws.  For example a guy about 21 or 22 was trying to buy a tequila bottle shaped like a tommy gun and I told him a few times that he needed to be 25 years old because of the violent connotation and that there was nothing that I could do.  He was ready to admit defeat and then I filled him in and it was a jolly old time.  I do this shit all of the time when I am in an energetic mood.  My point is that people are conditioned to accept any ridiculous new law or idea.  Anything is possible now and as long as I have a confident demeanor most people are willing to accept anything.  Of course not everyone has the good humor to appreciate when they have been gotten over so is a developed skill in selecting weak targets that won&#39;t hold a grudge.  Additionally I can determine if someone is going to be a pain in the ass by the time that they have passed through the front door.  Likewise I believe that most people have already accepted the lie before it has been spoken.  Playing it out is simply a ritual derived from their calculated weakness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Under Bush, Hussein was taken down and made a spectacle of for months and months. None of it made anything any better.</p>

<p>Under Obama, Bin Laden is finally found and killed, and instead of doing the stupid thing (bragging about it more than necessary, and showing off his body), they instead emphasize treating his body with respect, and dispose of it in such a manner as to reduce the commotion as much as possible.</p>

<p>In my opinion this makes perfect sense, even though I fully understand how a lot of people are going to be dissatisfied with it. My guess is that the CIA has more than enough samples and evidence to convince anyone with a high enough clearance level, but that they couldn&#39;t care less what people discuss about it on the internet.</p>

<p>Frustration and genuine ignorance does not a conspiracy make.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get why it has to be more complicated than it is. They went in, after months of recon and planning, killed him in battle and decided the smartest thing to do, to minimize any kind of <em>actual</em> impact (I think they prioritize repercussions and revenge acts over convincing conspiracy theorists on the internet), was to bury the body as respectfully and quickly as they could.

<p>This analogy is moot, because the very issue is whether or not the Loch Ness monster even exists. We know Bin Laden exists, the question is whether or not he&#39;s dead. It really doesn&#39;t matter if he&#39;s gone, silent and passive, because for all intents and purpose <em>he might as well be</em> dead. That&#39;s the point. We&#39;re just squabbling over details. Bin Laden&#39;s <em>gone</em> either way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is nice if it is knowable but I have found that it is easier to study methodologies.  Just like the carpenters train the journeymen the people that practice these methodologies train the next generation.  I think that it is easy to see an overarching methodology that is far greater than the people who are purported to be in power.

New ways to deal with the killing of al-queda leaders (mostly dealing with NOT waving the dead body/pictures of it around) were in the works since the death of Uday and Qusay, and this is the first time we&#39;ve seen them in action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t find the burying at sea to be suspicious, it makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t understand the whole killing him part. As far as I can tell, it was him, his son, his wife, and two couriers.  I&#39;m sorry, but they didn&#39;t shoot the guy in the head.  When a man has to use a woman as a human shield to stave off death for a few moments longer, then he isn&#39;t really in a position to stave off these soldiers.</p>

<p>I would bet that they are torturing the hell out of Bin Laden right now in order to gain intelligence information.  No doubt that they caught him, but saying he&#39;s dead allows them to torture him without any real repercussions.  </p>

<p>Because it&#39;s a Muslim tradition to bury a body within 24 hours the smartest thing the US could have done was to tell the world they buried him at sea so that non-radical Muslims would respect the US and that radical Muslims would be refused a memorial location of his body to worship.</p>

<li><p>Childish questions deserve childish answers. That&#39;s not questioning facts, it&#39;s creating questioning where it wasn&#39;t necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>His family <em>would not</em> take his body actually. If you&#39;ve read the literature on the Bin Laden family, most of his family have disowned him. It would also be a laborious task to kill him, move his body, use his body for U.S. needs (DNA confirmation), contact a family member, and have the body moved within 24 hours (as Islam require body disposal within 24 hours). That all said, the point still stands. No country wants a &quot;martyr&#39;s grave&quot; within their borders. </p></li>
<li><p>That was more to the point that the U.S. has stated that his body was disposed *as per Muslim protocol&quot; which require burial as the only means of disposal for a body, unless there is reason to believe the body may be dug up. This means that burial at sea due to such special circumstance. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m also feeling rather skeptical about this whole thing, but I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out why the Obama administration would lie about this, especially now when it really serves no purpose. It will be forgotten about by election time and it doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re trying to divert attention from anything else.</p>

<p>Anyone have a plausible theory?</p>

<p>Yes, but anything they do from now on is <em>unjustified</em>. People will be scared (they always are), but also <em>angry</em>. Anger is good, because it unites people, where fear alone separates them. Because most people saw 9/11 as unprovoked, it made people scared but also united them towards a common goal. If the US were to take the body back, keep it and potentially mutilate it (I haven&#39;t read anything about any autopsies, again, much likely to avoid unnecessary anger and aggravation), I think a lot of Americans could even relate to it (think of leaving a US soldier with the Talibans) and the anger would dissipate into only fear.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my take on it, at least.</p>

<p>You&#39;re making the blind and unfounded (and silly) assumption that they didn&#39;t acquire what they needed <em>before</em> disposing of the body?

<p>I see it as a clear attempt to minimize the impact of his death. I&#39;m not the least bit surprised that Obama had the brains to realize that was the best way to do it. He has a track record of trying to appease those who disagree with him, without giving up entirely. This was a beautiful enactment of precisely that strategy.</p>

<p>Finger prints, DNA and blood samples have probably been had by the US even before 9/11. The photos and the video I&#39;d like to see, but the body would be the best evidence there is.

<p>While I agree that, in a perfect world, that would be the case, the problem is that the people of the USA didn&#39;t elect a government that prided itself on transparency and its responsibility towards its people.</p>

<p>And do tell me, how far do they have to go in this &quot;duty&quot; of theirs to prove it? When is enough enough? Can the last conspiracy nut demand to keep Bin Laden&#39;s body in his own fridge for the government to fulfill its &quot;duty&quot;?</p>

<p>The duty I see your government prioritizing is the duty to protects its people. Obama chose to do that in a way that might not satisfy the more paranoid citizens, but that most likely will appease a large number of foreign people and powers, that would otherwise have been angry. I&#39;d say that duty far supersedes its duty to come to your house, to your comfortable chair, and present <em>you</em> with evidence that <em>you</em> might be convinced that they went into foreign territory, engaged a terrorist base, and killed the world&#39;s most hated person with a bullet to the head.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s what I don&#39;t get. If Bin Laden is dead, then if anything, that&#39;s reason to put pressure on Obama to <em>stop</em> spending the money. And as long as he&#39;s gone, what difference does it make? Again, it seems this request that Obama <em>must</em> present evidence that Bin Laden is dead has absolutely nothing to do with responsibility or accountability towards the people, and everything with everyday &quot;he has power, therefor he is corrupt and a liar&quot; conspiracy mentality.</p>

<p>Let me ask you this: if Obama keeps refusing to present evidence, what is the worst that will happen? In my opinion, the worst possible scenario to come from this is... nothing. Nothing happens. People carry on with their lives, Bin Laden is never heard from again, and there is <em>more</em> good reason to pressure Obama to withdraw from Afghanistan. That&#39;s it. To keep pushing on this evidence thing is to risk inflaming Bin Laden/Al Qaeda supporters, risk retaliatory attacks (which are already a risk, and would only become greater) and, at worst, to pull down whatever it is they&#39;ve built up in some kind of effort to ensure stability.</p>

<p>Under Bush, the big conspiracies were all about reasons to invade other countries. Under Obama, the supposed conspiracy is all about <em>ending</em> all the hostilities. <em>Why</em> would Obama lie about something that benefits his country more than himself (because, let&#39;s face it, this alone is nowhere near enough to ensure victory in 2012)? Answer me that, because everyone else actively refuses to. <em>No one</em> dares to tell me what Obama&#39;s motives are, yet they&#39;re <em>so sure</em> he&#39;s lying about something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Really? Dumping a body in the sea hours after the kill is not ridiculous, but not wanting to take someone&#39;s word for it is?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. In my opinion, the reasons Obama gave for doing what he did were <em>excellent</em>. For once, the USA actually cared about doing right, and treating someone they <em>executed</em> with even the least bit of respect. They collected enough evidence so that if some day someone <em>truly</em> doubted what they had done (that is, not just conspiracy nuts on the internet), they could present it and prove it beyond reasonable doubt. Refusing to take Obama&#39;s word is ridiculous, when he has <em>no reason</em> to lie about it. <em>Everything</em> about what happened benefits the people of the USA. It&#39;s not enough to say &quot;but it benefits Obama too&quot;, and pretend that that&#39;s somehow a <em>bad</em> thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine Bush claimed he found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but quickly dumped them all in the sea, would it have been ridiculous to doubt him?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, you tell me how he would have justified it. A more reasonable scenario is that he would claim to have found radioactive materials that were unsafe, and had to be locked down securely. Would you doubt that? Would you insist on seeing those materials? Touching them? What would be enough for you to trust it happened?</p>

<p>For the gazillionth time, tell me what Obama&#39;s motives to lie are. If he has none, then yes, <em>it absolutely is</em> ridiculous to accuse him of lying. Not to appeal to authority, but there&#39;s probably good reason why you <em>don&#39;t</em> have clearance to see everything the administration and the president sees on a daily basis.</p>

<p>No, they are not. They are all about reasons to invade countries as well. We think bin Laden was a scapegoat who has been dead since 2001. We think Al Qaeda does not exist as this global organization the government presents it to be, and never has.</p>

<p>Well, of course. I want the same thing. I&#39;d <em>like</em> for Obama to release everything about what happened, but there&#39;s a difference wanting someone to tell the truth, and demanding someone explain everything they do, because you automatically assume they&#39;re lying. I&#39;m a big fan of transparency, but I <em>do</em> reserve my government the right to keep certain business from me. It&#39;s their responsibility to handle the weight of what they do, and full transparency means full weight on me as well. That&#39;s not what anyone actually wants.</p>

<p>And if this is true, again, what harm has Obama&#39;s supposed &quot;lie&quot; done? If anything, he&#39;s taken steps to <em>dismantle</em> the conspiracy about Al Qaeda.

<blockquote>
<p>Making war does benefit him more than the country. The lies are about the threat of terrorism itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and the &quot;lies&quot; make the threat of terrorism out to be <em>less</em>, not greater. He&#39;s warned of some retaliatory attacks (or, at least, the media has), but overall the big message is that the world is a <em>safer</em> place now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having an independent third party verify it. This isn&#39;t going anywhere if you are not willing to understand that wanting anyone else to check it out is different from wanting to do it myself.</p>

<p>As far as I know, there <em>have</em> been other people who have verified the images. Obama&#39;s wife identified the body in Pakistan. Now you&#39;re just arguing over <em>which</em> third parties it is who get to see it.</p>

<p>Now, you tell me how this isn&#39;t going to become another birther-thing? Can you tell me you won&#39;t just accuse the third parties of lying or being &quot;in on it&quot;? Can you tell me how you&#39;ll know that Obama hasn&#39;t just made really good fake photos for these third parties to view? Can you tell me what will <em>really</em> stop the conspiracy theorists from questioning everything, no matter how ridiculous?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>He basically delegitimized their presence in Afghanistan, and now it&#39;s up to the people to demand the US withdraws. Iraq has been illegitimate since Bush, so there&#39;s really no difference there. Obama <em>has</em> begun withdrawal from Iraq. Yes, things are going painfully slow, but it&#39;s not like Obama is ramping things up. Even Libya is largely an <em>international</em> issue, with the US merely being a part of operations there.</p>

<p>If it is as you say, that Obama and his friends are all corrupt, then again I ask, why focus on Obama? Why not focus on educating the public about corruption? Questioning one particular thing that happened in Pakistan isn&#39;t going to accomplish much. You&#39;re focusing on the wrong things, in the wrong way, if you really want things to chance.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s funny how government is all about lies and corruption when it doesn&#39;t benefit you. But whenever it builds a better road to work, or improves your neighborhood school, it&#39;s quite useful, and you don&#39;t stand outside demanding full transparency on every deal made to get those things done. No, only when it&#39;s convenient do you assume the government lies and deceives and takes advantage of you. That is my problem with &quot;truthers&quot; and conspiracy theorists. It&#39;s all so obviously selfish and self-centered. It simply doesn&#39;t matter what the government does, you&#39;ll <em>find</em> a conspiracy in there somewhere regardless. And if there isn&#39;t one, you&#39;ll make one up, by claiming the birth certificates are fake, or that the third-party statements we <em>do</em> have somehow aren&#39;t good enough.</p>

<p>Time will tell if you&#39;re right. I just wonder if it even makes any difference whether you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the United States, Israel, etc. organized the 9/11 attacks, and I&#39;m pretty sure that Al Qaeda did, but I think the circumstances of Bin Laden&#39;s death and burial at sea are pretty weird. I honestly don&#39;t even think the public evidence for Bin Laden being the guy in charge of Al Qaeda is all that strong. How do we know that he wasn&#39;t providing cover for some other bad guy, or that the guy living in his home wasn&#39;t some kind of double? And why on earth wouldn&#39;t they keep the body of such a controversial guy around for a day or two so people could get a good look at it? I guess the best the argument that he&#39;s really dead is that, if the government was faking his death, you&#39;d think they&#39;d do a good job at it. But maybe there&#39;s some reason they want to make his alleged death ambiguous on purpose.</p>
