       I hope more ppl see your comment &amp; begin to develope a new life skill;  usage of the brain.  Its all theatre.  Smoke &amp; mirrors (and bless photoshop).  This seems to be another  grand example of our "lea d er s" houdini-esque art of mis dir ection.   now would be a great time for ppl to start reading between the lines &amp; get off this spoon fed baby food.  More power to you, man!

       Another 9/11 or OK city bombing type event could be on the way the government needs to build up another buggyman quick.

       It is at least partly to do with them taking that talking point off the table for the up coming election.  They don't want people to bring that up.  So, they picked a day they can also tie in with Hitler of all people, and end the Bin Laden story.  Done!

       This is a historic day on a lot of levels. I've never seen the full power of the propaganda machine in effect, today you can view it full force maybe for the first time ever. All the domestic propaganda organs are deploying at full speed, every desk manned, every base is being covered. Obama can smell four more years, and nothing is going to in the way. Observe in awe the power of trillions of your tax dollars being spent. They are rewriting history in front of your eyes, and have pre-planned the desired response. You might never see a bigger orchestration in your life, but I'm guessing they have a few more planned.
