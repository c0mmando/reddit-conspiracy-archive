       building 7 was supposed to have a plane hit it but that plane crashed and  I guess they (mossad) wanted to take out the George Washington Bridge as they were found with a van of explosives dressed up 'like Palestinians.' What else was supposed to happen?

       What else was suppose to happen? Flight 93 was supposed to take out the capitol with Congress in session, thus leaving Bush in charge of everything. But the takeoff was delayed and it sat on the runway for an hour. So most of those in Congress were taken to a place of safety and we were saved, at least somewhat.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The U.S. Capitol Building, not the White House, was the fourth target of the Sept. 11 attackers, a German magazine reported Sunday citing results of interrogations of suspected al Qaeda leaders.
        <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0002551/2003/10/27.html#a465">
         http://blogs.salon.com/0002551/2003/10/27.html#a465
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        The plane was scheduled to take off at 8:00 a.m., and in fact the Boeing 757 did push back from Gate A-17 at 8:01. But, as is often the case at Newark International, runway traffic delayed the takeoff. For the next 40 minutes the plane remained on the ground.
       </p>
       <p>
        The traffic jam in which Flight 93 sat that morning may have been a key factor in saving thousands of lives-and perhaps even our nation's Capitol.

       Guess what? My dad photographed the twin towers that september too before they collapsed. Are you saying that just because he is white and a citizen he's not a suspect? But people who are brown are automatic terrorists who aren't allowed pictures.

       Haha way to be an assuming idiot. No, dude, I'm just a college student that actually can think on his own and not freak out about other religions, races, etc taking pictures of a place. I realize there are minorities in this world that try and do extreme actions but I would still

       to see your evidence, which I doubt exists. If I can see
       <strong>
        any

       evidence at all, then I'll lay off, but until then you're no better than a hillbilly down South who thinks that an alien abducted them.

       And you're no better than fucking Benjamin Netanyahu, so we're at an impasse. Apparently you're sharp enough to grasp the fundamentals of the intarwebz, slick. I'd suggest you being your search with "Israeli student visa/tourist visa, deported, photographing embassies, mexico city."

       1) I have searched it. Know what I find? Typed up transcripts on the websites they're hosted on. Know who else can type a transcript? This guy.

       2) Netanyahu is an idiot. Thanks for comparing me to him, but unlike you I can look at both sides and see you are both idiots. There's a middle here and its called

       I wrote that at 2AM my time, I think a spelling mistake is allowed. I am in college, technically Law School. So I think I'm a fine researcher. I only accept legitimate evidence I guess, instead of taking the word of an "official transcript" which I could just as easily fake.

       Yep, and when Bush had anthrax sent to congress the Republicans tried to get Congress to close down leaving Bush with the power of the purse. Even though they tried to kill him Tom Daschle wouldn't play. He refused to go along with it.

       They needed that plane to fall in Pennsylvania... because the state and it's opinion is so large and bridges the southern and northern gap, close to the mason dixon line area too .  By having that crash, everyone in the state would back the army and it would be in the state's psyche too
