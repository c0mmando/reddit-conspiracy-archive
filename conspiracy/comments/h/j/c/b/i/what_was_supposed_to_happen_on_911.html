    <div class="md"><p>What else was suppose to happen? Flight 93 was supposed to take out the capitol with Congress in session, thus leaving Bush in charge of everything. But the takeoff was delayed and it sat on the runway for an hour. So most of those in Congress were taken to a place of safety and we were saved, at least somewhat. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Capitol Building, not the White House, was the fourth target of the Sept. 11 attackers, a German magazine reported Sunday citing results of interrogations of suspected al Qaeda leaders.  <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0002551/2003/10/27.html#a465">http://blogs.salon.com/0002551/2003/10/27.html#a465</a></p>

<p>The plane was scheduled to take off at 8:00 a.m., and in fact the Boeing 757 did push back from Gate A-17 at 8:01. But, as is often the case at Newark International, runway traffic delayed the takeoff. For the next 40 minutes the plane remained on the ground.</p>

<p>The traffic jam in which Flight 93 sat that morning may have been a key factor in saving thousands of lives-and perhaps even our nation&#39;s Capitol. <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/730909/posts">http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/730909/posts</a></p>

<p>2) Netanyahu is an idiot. Thanks for comparing me to him, but unlike you I can look at both sides and see you are both idiots. There&#39;s a middle here and its called <strong>each side has an adgena</strong>. That doesn&#39;t mean the United States bombed our own land and that it&#39;s the Jews who were behind it. </p>
