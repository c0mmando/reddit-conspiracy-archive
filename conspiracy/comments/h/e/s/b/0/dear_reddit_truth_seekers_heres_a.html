    <div class="md"><p>Generally, nothing is really required. Trolls run on <em>your</em> fuel. If you don&#39;t like them, just downvote them and move on. If you respond, they win. Takes two to tango. So if you are sick of trolls &quot;disrupting&quot; discussions, don&#39;t respond to them. No disruption. Problem solved. </p>

<p>Plus, what looks like &quot;trolling&quot; to you is sometimes actually someone legitimately arguing with you. There&#39;s no good way to tell.</p>

<p>What I did in <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a> was to implement the most subjective definition of &quot;trolling&quot; I could think of. I asked <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> if it was necessary here, and the community said &quot;no.&quot; I haven&#39;t gotten anyone telling me about legit troll problems, and no one has pointed me to any self posts about discussing these sorts of things.</p>

<p>Reddit is very good about controlling &quot;brigades&quot; and such -- those problems are administrative and if you see them, report them. Mods don&#39;t have the power to ferret that stuff out, and &quot;trolling&quot; is so subjective that it&#39;s merely a waste of time to try and delete comments that are &quot;trolls&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not afraid of anything in particular, but I recognize that the kinds of things in that list of rules contribute to the degradation of rational discourse.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Things like using stupid nicknames like &quot;twoofer&quot; or &quot;conspiratard&quot; contribute nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>Or insulting conspiracy theorists or skeptics in general. E.g. &quot;of course truthers are so dumb they can&#39;t be convinced&quot; or &quot;stupid sheeple will believe anything they&#39;re told.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>The drama surrounding complaints abuot people having sockpuppets, like this very post, just gets in the way. If the insults and things are moderated, then the only issue would be downvote campaigns, which I DO think there should be allowed discussion on, but it cannot single anybody out, cannot be personal, and in general should be kept between the users and the administrators. If the admins do nothing, then the issue should be allowed to be discussed by the community - but still without necessarily pointing fingers or trying to create personal drama.</p></li>
<li><p>Or personal attacks - how do they serve to facilitate meaningful discussion? They don&#39;t. If there&#39;s a personal problem, then take it to private messages, or message the moderators.</p></li>
<li><p>Or if your comment is just about insulting someone - that&#39;s a waste of time and is just creating needless drama, not to mention it&#39;s mean.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that complaining about downvotes CAN be a legitimate issue, but it really depends on the manner in which it is addressed. If I say &quot;WTF? Why do I have a thousand downvotes for saying that americans are stupid?&quot;, that&#39;s out of line. But I say &quot;I&#39;d appreciate an explanation for why my comment received so many downvotes&quot; then I think that&#39;s acceptable.</p></li>
<li><p>posting simply to be disruptive - that isn&#39;t beneficial at all.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I mean, nothing about this position implies fear of any kind, just a desire to improve the quality of discourse that takes place here, to clear up all the trash that gets in the way. I suspect that a lot of people are afraid to comment on r/conspiracy posts because of the high emotionality and drama, the insults and whatnot, and that&#39;s a terrible loss.</p>

<p>This is not for you to undertake by yourself. The proper method is to take the list of offenders to the administration of reddit and have them deal with the situation. Do not try and start witch hunts here on reddit; it creates drama and is counter-productive and you put yourself at risk for being subject to the same repercussions as these people would be. Eye for and eye and all that.</p>

<p>Calling me names like that was not called for.</p>

<p>Tell that to all the people you&#39;ve just called names by putting them on the list of &quot;shills, disinfo artists, agents, conspiritards.&quot;  Now you have the fucking <strong>balls</strong> to say that calling you a name was uncalled for? Fuck me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ll have to delete the thread to delete my list. I will not participate in any kind of forced or unforced censorship. I will not participate in a coverup. PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW who&#39;s behind the dowonvotes and harassment here in r/conspiracy and reddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>conspiracy fantasy proven; did i call this shit or what</p>

<p>This is not about censoring your &quot;uncovering&quot; of a &quot;cabal&quot; -- this is about not letting you become judge, jury, and executioner of your own little fantasy conspiracy.</p>

<p>I know this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but I am always going to call out any kind of reddit-based &quot;conspiracies.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>PS: How nice that finally one you Mods has come out and started PARTICIPATING in this subreddit!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t gotten a single message in my mod mailbox in the last month except for spam reports and exemption requests. If you so desperately require mod intervention (something which I don&#39;t think is necessary), why don&#39;t you try and contact us?</p>

<p>And just for the record, people have suggested mod intervention in the subreddit before -- the only thing I would consider would be similar rules to what is in place in <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a> -- and every time, the community rejects it. The up and down votes are there for a reason. If there is a cabal downvoting, the reddit admins will find out and they will be punished. Just as you will be if you insist on making your own cabal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for stating this. From now on I will report activity that seems to be disrupting the conversation or egregiously violating the user agreement or reddiquette, and I will message the moderators when I suspect downvoting campaigns. I&#39;ll also encourage others on this reddit to do the same. Thank you.</p>

<p>edit: I would like to request that information about disinformation be posted in the sidebar. You may not be a conspiracy theorist, but most of the users of this reddit are, and not all of us are able to recognize the trolling when we see it. At the very least, a link to these two pages, and perhaps a reminder/link for reddiquette would be good: </p>

<p>These racist, supremacist scum keep the list of us and harass and downvote us so it&#39;s only fair to return the favor.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think downvotes are called for unless it&#39;s on an obvious trolling comment or post. I don&#39;t even know if banning them will work. So long as they (the blatantly obvious trolls like herklmer and jcm) spend time in the same account, they can be handled. I&#39;m speaking not about all the members of your list per se, but the people who DO troll and defame conspiracy theorists and downvote stuff. We can&#39;t let the community devolve into an inquisition, but perhaps a little bit more active moderation is needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, it never ends does it.  </p>

<p>Yes, it IS possible to claim that, but no one has made that argument, so I can conclude that either </p>

<p>a) no effort has been made to search my comment history for the offending behavior (and either failed, posting the &quot;it&#39;s been deleted&quot; argument; or succeeded, posting the comments in question) </p>

<p>or </p>

<p>b) I&#39;m not seen as enough of a &quot;threat&quot; to even refute with such an argument.  Which is, frankly, disappointing after being sort of called out.</p>

<p>This compounded on top of everyone else&#39;s lack of comment-based-evidence (on both sides of the argument) leads me to believe this whole thing is a circlejerk or a petty attempt at soiling users&#39; names.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree that the two possibilities you mentioned are very reasonable conclusions.</p>

<p><strong>Paranoia/Divide and Conquer</strong> - one of the most effective ways to destroy a group is to sow distrust among members. COINTELPRO is known to have supplied false information in order create suspicion between authentic progressive activists.

<p>The terrible part is that I DO strongly suspect that the ones who are causing all of the drama, saying &quot;he&#39;s a shill! You&#39;re a disinfo agent! Go back to your conspiratard buddies!&quot; etc. are actually the very people trying to disrupt the community.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s something I haven&#39;t thought about!  It actually sounds like a decent strategy, too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure this kind of stuff has been posted here before (the link you gave me), but it&#39;s new to me.  I guess that just goes to show how little time I actually spend here (though the name &quot;COINTELPRO&quot; is vaguely familiar).  </p>

<p>Sadly, the solution isn&#39;t as simple as &quot;hey guys, ignore these kinds of posts and focus on this, this, or that.&quot;  I guess it&#39;s the nature of a community like this to latch on to things that show distrust, whether real or manufactured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I glanced at sugardeath&#39;s profile and realized that I didn&#39;t feel like spending 30 minutes looking for troll behavior or posts in conspiratard. If you can provide me with just one post he has made in conspiratard that you&#39;re already aware of (to save time), that will at least satisfy me that you didn&#39;t make it up. Also, cherrypicking doesn&#39;t work when you provide a link to the source of the information, so if you give me a link to his activity that demonstrated trollish behavior, I can click &quot;context&quot; or &quot;full comments&quot; and see the full story.</p>

<p>AIPAC 101 — What Every American Should Know </p>

<p>AIPAC 101 — What Every American Should Know </p>

<p>AIPAC 101 — What Every American Should Know </p>

<p>Dr. Alan Sabrosky, former Director of Studies at the US Army War College, a USMC Vietnam vet, a Jewish American says that Israel was behind 9/11 and that US military knows that:</p>

<p>Those are Zionist Neocons and you can name every one of them... we all know what they want: greater Israel and more wars with Muslims/Arabs to protect their state. Just look at how many dual-citizenship, Israel-firster traitors we have in our government... it&#39;s sickening.</p>

<p>Ted Koppel, former ABC news anchor &amp; NPR contributor advocates the Israeli gov&#39;t stance on the pages of the WSJ:</p>

<p>It&#39;s just another Mossad false flag operation designed to keep Obama in check and to distract people with nonsense so they don&#39;t see the theft of a millennia that&#39;s happening on Wall St.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just bread &amp; circuses for idiot goyim masses.</p>

<p>Another character, Philip J. Berg, is a jewish lawyer. This is all a Mossad job from start to finish.</p>

<p>Why do you still bother replying to me, Hasbara shill?</p>

<p>But if you show the facts that Jews are over-represented in US government, media, finance... if you show facts that CEOs of all of the Hollywood studios are jewish, you&#39;re thrown in jail, fired, called silly names</p>

<p>And if you dare point out at who the original terrorists are and who invented modern terrorism, they&#39;ll call cops on you.</p>

<p>Give this a listen: <a href="http://theuglytruth.podbean.com/2011/04/21/the-ugly-truth-podcast-april-21-2011/">http://theuglytruth.podbean.com/2011/04/21/the-ugly-truth-podcast-april-21-2011/</a>
It will explain pretty much everything wrt to revolutions in North Africa and Middle East.
(In the thread &quot;The CIA/Mossad&#39;s False Flag Terror Program to bring complete upheaval in the Middle East is taken up a notch!&quot;)</p>

<p>CIA &amp; Mossad killed JFK mostly due to his Fed policies (research Executive Order 11110) and his stance towards Israel&#39;s secret nuke program </p>

<p>What else would you expect from another Hasbara? Not enough threads about killing Palestinians in <a href="/r/israel">/r/israel</a> so you&#39;re now trolling <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?
(About a copyright post in a copyright thread)</p>

<p>Can you guess where they are? Give up? Here&#39;s a clue:
Following Zakheim And The Pentagon Trillions To Israel And 911</p>

<p>Over the years, I&#39;ve come to realize that all these &quot;Black Popers&quot; and &quot;Jesuiters&quot; are either mentally ill or are Rothschild/zionist agents.</p>

<p>Israel was behind 9/11 and that US military knows that</p>

<p>that the 9-11 terrorist attacks were run by Mossad, and that this was common knowledge among global intelligence agencies:</p>

<p>Alan Hart, retired BBC reporter and a man who knew both Golda Meir and Yassir Arafat has recently come out publicly and said that his sources tell him that Mossad was behind 9/11</p>

<p>the Mossad operation that became 9/11 would have been aided and abetted by certain corrupt American leaders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>No, Mumberthrax.</strong>  He honestly believes it.  Look at his posting history - just the first page alone:</p>

<p>&quot;I can understand being downvoted by posting a anti-jew statement in a pro-jew thread but why would I get downvoted by posting an anti-jew comment in an anti-jew thread?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;YOu realize that Ron Paul is a jew-supporter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;the jews do a lot of bad things. It&#39;s ridiculous once you find out. Did you know that the jews had a hand in the Pearl Harbor attack?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m not on the list with all my facts about the holocaust not happening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Most jews are atheists.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Carlin was just another jewish gatekeeper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They want to destroy Christianity and the white race&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pearl Harbor was caused by the jews as well. Jews convinced Roosevelt to but an oil embargo against Japan. This made the japanese very angry so they attacked pearl harbor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What you fail to realize was that the jews were destroying Germany. Unemployment was 30 % before Hitler took over. Hitler gave 6 million germans jobs during his leadership. The jews took that 6 million number and twisted it around to make it say that 6 million jews were murdered. That&#39;s where the jews got the 6 million number. The jews were sucking the life out of Germany. The jews made a pact with Great Britain to get what we now know as Israel so at the end of the war, the jews all fled to Israel. They had to. They had just betrayed the Germans.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;actually, the jews were well fed in the camps. They even had a swimming pool, a soccer field, theater, and medical facility. It was kind of like a miniature city inside the camp. The only thing the nazis wanted from the jews was their free labor. They didn&#39;t want to kill any of them. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;the difference between whites and jews is that whites don&#39;t pool their money to destroy nations and races.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;how come Jews aren&#39;t listed as a possible race? And BTW, the holocaust never happened so have fun looking at that museum full of fake crap.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Mumberthrax:</strong>  Why do you deny that someone like this is antisemitic - with all the evidence right in front of you - when you have no problem believing unsubstantiated claims that those who criticizes or down-vote such posts are part of some JIDF-organized conspiracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, in general. All of this nonsense needs to stop. The moderators need to step in and enforce reddiquette and the user agreement. That&#39;s all. If someone gathers evidence of a conspiracy to game the site, then that can be presented. If someone wants to discuss the idea of how people may be conspiring to game the site, that can be presented, but can&#39;t devolve into an inquisition or witch hunt, and the emotions need to be checked at the door.</p>

<p>The terrible part is that I DO strongly suspect that the ones who are causing all of the drama, saying &quot;he&#39;s a shill! You&#39;re a disinfo agent! Go back to your conspiratard buddies!&quot; etc. are actually the very people trying to disrupt the community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, just to give a report on my feelings or interpretation of this post and the comments posted at this time (3:30 pm CST, 05/19/2011):</p>

<p>Texmex is either </p>

<ul>
<li>a member of this community who is hypersensitive about trolls and shills, to the point of labeling individuals as trolls or shills or disinfo agents or members of r/conspiratard when they disagree with him</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
<li>A double-agent, that is, an agent provocateur of sorts, attempting to stir up an inquisition and make users of this community more paranoid than they need to be, and to paint us as morons who jump at the slightest thing.</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe that the issue of a conspiracy to game the site, or this particular reddit, is a serious one and there are actual administrative mechanisms in place to prevent such things. That&#39;s right, the admins recognize the risk of conspiracy. The question is how we respond to that risk, and the risk of trolling and psychological operations here. I don&#39;t believe we can begin compiling databases and records on users, because who will be the judge? By what metric will you determine when someone is a troll, a shill, or just a skeptic, or someone who just doesn&#39;t find the content interesting?</p>

<p>There are two things that must be done to begin to resolve this. First, users must familiarize themselves with the tactics used by shills, disinformation sources, trolls, etc. and downvote material that matches those patterns, as well as commenting on exactly how that material is not constructive or does not facilitate meaningful conversation. Here are a few resources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.proparanoid.net/truth.htm">http://www.proparanoid.net/truth.htm</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.truthmove.org/content/disinformation/">http://www.truthmove.org/content/disinformation/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Second, the moderators must take a more active role in enforcing the user agreement and reddiquette by removing the personal attacks and warning users who attempt to disrupt the flow of conversation. If the moderators don&#39;t care about this, then I respectfully propose that new moderators be selected to perform this duty.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: I&#39;ve just read what <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hesb0/dear_reddit_truth_seekers_heres_a/c1uz5yd">illuminatedwax has stated regarding moderator activity in the reddit</a>. It depends upon <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hesb0/dear_reddit_truth_seekers_heres_a/c1uyzr2">reports and messages to the moderators</a>. They aren&#39;t likely to involve themselves if nobody notifies them of a potential problem. It is up to the users of the reddit to be proactive and click &quot;report&quot; and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23conspiracy">send messages to the mod mail</a> if you suspect a downvote/upvote campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a program devised by the government of Israel wherein jews around the world work together to censor or &quot;correct&quot; anything that is critical of Israel or the jewish people. They have a program that you run on your computer that notifies you when something on the internet is criticising israel or is saying something potentially harmful to Israel&#39;s interests, and then you and tons of other jews will visit the link and leave comments or vote in the poll or whatever it is. That&#39;s the idea, at least. They also recruit college students to promote israel and criticise anyone who appears to be &quot;anti-semitic&quot; on campus. The JIDF is a related group.</p>

<p>People like jcm267 troll anyone who criticizes israel, as well as anything conspiracy or ron paul related. They may not be hasbara per se, but still follow similar patterns of behavior.</p>

Regarding the holocaust, what do you think about the photographs and the red cross report and the graves and things, then?

The reason you had pictures of graves is because when you herd people into a camp like cattle,  that camp becomes your entire life.  People inside the camp, ate there, they played soccer there...they went to theater inside the camp.  They lived their lives inside the camp.  Okay?  So if someone dies of disease inside the camp, then there is going to be a complete record of that and a grave and everything.  If someone dies inside a camp, that doesn&#39;t mean the Nazi&#39;s gassed them, it means Louse broke out and the disease spread and people died.  That can happen lots of places.  The Nazis did not want the Jews to die because they were using them for free labor.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you saying that if reddit bans users for trolling that it&#39;s against the constitution of the United States? The amendment only states that congress shall make no laws about those things. It says nothing about reddit banning users.</p>

<p>Now, the user agreement and reddiquette DO say things that are relevant here, but they are only selectively enforced and hold little value. The rule of the mob, or the &quot;hive mind&quot;, is all that truly matters.</p>

<p>Also, calling him a neonazi or a scumbag is defamation, and does not invalidate his opinion or argument. If you want to attack his character, then do it separately from this issue.</p>

<p>Well, antisemitism is a fine word and all, but it doesn&#39;t really give any specific information.</p>

<p>Oh, come off it.  &quot;Neo-Nazi&quot; might be open to question, but if you&#39;d actually look at his posting history for the last few months, you&#39;ll see post after post after post where he blames Jews for everything that&#39;s ever gone wrong.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how you&#39;re open to the idea of everyone who disagrees with him being &quot;JIDF or hasbara, etc.&quot;, &quot;It would be good to know...&quot;, but entirely closed to the idea of him being a neo-nazi, let alone the easily-proven-if-you&#39;d-only-look anti-semite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never claimed I was closed to the idea of him being a neo-nazi or a racist. I simply haven&#39;t yet seen evidence supporting the assertion. If you&#39;re so convinced that he is one, and you claim to see posts from him that prove it, then why not link them? I only looked at the first five pages of his comments before I realized it was a waste of time.</p>

<p>Dr. Alan Sabrosky, former Director of Studies at the US Army War College, a USMC Vietnam vet, a Jewish American says that Israel was behind 9/11 and that US military knows that:</p>

<p>Those are Zionist Neocons and you can name every one of them... we all know what they want: greater Israel and more wars with Muslims/Arabs to protect their state. Just look at how many dual-citizenship, Israel-firster traitors we have in our government... it&#39;s sickening.</p>

<p>Ted Koppel, former ABC news anchor &amp; NPR contributor advocates the Israeli gov&#39;t stance on the pages of the WSJ:</p>

<p>It&#39;s just another Mossad false flag operation designed to keep Obama in check and to distract people with nonsense so they don&#39;t see the theft of a millennia that&#39;s happening on Wall St.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just bread &amp; circuses for idiot goyim masses.</p>

<p>Another character, Philip J. Berg, is a jewish lawyer. This is all a Mossad job from start to finish.</p>

<p>Why do you still bother replying to me, Hasbara shill?</p>

<p>But if you show the facts that Jews are over-represented in US government, media, finance... if you show facts that CEOs of all of the Hollywood studios are jewish, you&#39;re thrown in jail, fired, called silly names</p>

<p>And if you dare point out at who the original terrorists are and who invented modern terrorism, they&#39;ll call cops on you.</p>

It will explain pretty much everything wrt to revolutions in North Africa and Middle East.
(In the thread &quot;The CIA/Mossad&#39;s False Flag Terror Program to bring complete upheaval in the Middle East is taken up a notch!&quot;)</p>

<p>CIA &amp; Mossad killed JFK mostly due to his Fed policies (research Executive Order 11110) and his stance towards Israel&#39;s secret nuke program </p>

<p>What else would you expect from another Hasbara? Not enough threads about killing Palestinians in <a href="/r/israel">/r/israel</a> so you&#39;re now trolling <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?

Following Zakheim And The Pentagon Trillions To Israel And 911</p>

<p>Over the years, I&#39;ve come to realize that all these &quot;Black Popers&quot; and &quot;Jesuiters&quot; are either mentally ill or are Rothschild/zionist agents.</p>

<p>Israel was behind 9/11 and that US military knows that</p>

<p>that the 9-11 terrorist attacks were run by Mossad, and that this was common knowledge among global intelligence agencies:</p>

<p>Alan Hart, retired BBC reporter and a man who knew both Golda Meir and Yassir Arafat has recently come out publicly and said that his sources tell him that Mossad was behind 9/11</p>

<p>the Mossad operation that became 9/11 would have been aided and abetted by certain corrupt American leaders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of these seem to be about Israel, not about Jews - except for two:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the comment about goyim being idiots. Id like to see the link for that one to get a better context.</p></li>
<li><p>The other comment about how people who have mentioned that many jews have positions of prominence have been jailed, fired, or called names. I&#39;d like to see the context on that one too.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is that people say &quot;you hate me because of my race/ethnicity&quot; when the problem has nothing to do with race or ethnicity, but behavior of specific individuals, or the behavior of governments. I concede that there ARE truly racist people - I&#39;m not a moron. I believe that there are some people who really do make generalizations about how all jews are evil.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s say that that somewhere in the archives of his posting history there are incidents of true racism.</p>

<p>So what? How does it affect any argument about a conspiracy about hasbara or disinformation agents conducting downvote campaigns or regularly trolling r/conspiracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree that the two possibilities you mentioned are very reasonable conclusions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I would call it a circlejerk. I would call it an attempt to sow distrust in the community. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Paranoia/Divide and Conquer</strong> - one of the most effective ways to destroy a group is to sow distrust among members. COINTELPRO is known to have supplied false information in order create suspicion between authentic progressive activists. Seemingly paradoxically, disinformation agents may actually promote discussion of disinformation/infiltration in order to increase paranoia. Such efforts may be targeted at creating suspicion around real and effective evidence/materials/activists.</p>
