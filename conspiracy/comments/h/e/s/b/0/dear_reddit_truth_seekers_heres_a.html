       But seriously, surely if you've spent any time on this reddit you've observed the trolls, the people being hateful and dafamatory, the people spewing vitriol and disrupting discussions. It should be apparent that this kind of thing is diminishing the intellectual value of the community, and the website in general. What are the moderators doing to fix this?

       Generally, nothing is really required. Trolls run on
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       fuel. If you don't like them, just downvote them and move on. If you respond, they win. Takes two to tango. So if you are sick of trolls "disrupting" discussions, don't respond to them. No disruption. Problem solved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, what looks like "trolling" to you is sometimes actually someone legitimately arguing with you. There's no good way to tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I did in
       <a href="/r/911truth">
        /r/911truth
       </a>
       was to implement the most subjective definition of "trolling" I could think of. I asked
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       if it was necessary here, and the community said "no." I haven't gotten anyone telling me about legit troll problems, and no one has pointed me to any self posts about discussing these sorts of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is very good about controlling "brigades" and such -- those problems are administrative and if you see them, report them. Mods don't have the power to ferret that stuff out, and "trolling" is so subjective that it's merely a waste of time to try and delete comments that are "trolls".

       I don't know what the culture was like at that time, but I can't really imagine why anybody would be opposed to those rules unless they just loved trolls, or thought that the reddit itself was just a joke. I, for one, would appreciate it if they were implemented.

       Interesting. So what if there is conflict? with some wanting rules like that, and others believing that the voting is good enough? Would you be inclined to leave it as it has been?

       I'm not afraid of anything in particular, but I recognize that the kinds of things in that list of rules contribute to the degradation of rational discourse.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Things like using stupid nicknames like "twoofer" or "conspiratard" contribute nothing.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Or insulting conspiracy theorists or skeptics in general. E.g. "of course truthers are so dumb they can't be convinced" or "stupid sheeple will believe anything they're told."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The drama surrounding complaints abuot people having sockpuppets, like this very post, just gets in the way. If the insults and things are moderated, then the only issue would be downvote campaigns, which I DO think there should be allowed discussion on, but it cannot single anybody out, cannot be personal, and in general should be kept between the users and the administrators. If the admins do nothing, then the issue should be allowed to be discussed by the community - but still without necessarily pointing fingers or trying to create personal drama.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Or personal attacks - how do they serve to facilitate meaningful discussion? They don't. If there's a personal problem, then take it to private messages, or message the moderators.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Or if your comment is just about insulting someone - that's a waste of time and is just creating needless drama, not to mention it's mean.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I think that complaining about downvotes CAN be a legitimate issue, but it really depends on the manner in which it is addressed. If I say "WTF? Why do I have a thousand downvotes for saying that americans are stupid?", that's out of line. But I say "I'd appreciate an explanation for why my comment received so many downvotes" then I think that's acceptable.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         posting simply to be disruptive - that isn't beneficial at all.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I mean, nothing about this position implies fear of any kind, just a desire to improve the quality of discourse that takes place here, to clear up all the trash that gets in the way. I suspect that a lot of people are afraid to comment on r/conspiracy posts because of the high emotionality and drama, the insults and whatnot, and that's a terrible loss.

       Lol, okay. Thanks. I do tend to disagree with you that calling him a piece of shit isn't a personal attack. I personally think r/gonewild and the other pornographic reddits should continue to stay on the site, but that the user agreement should change to reflect their admittance - AND that the personal attacks stuff still needs to be in there and needs to be enforced, either by warning and subsequent banning or something.

       This is not for you to undertake by yourself. The proper method is to take the list of offenders to the administration of reddit and have them deal with the situation. Do not try and start witch hunts here on reddit; it creates drama and is counter-productive and you put yourself at risk for being subject to the same repercussions as these people would be. Eye for and eye and all that.

       I haven't gotten a single message in my mod mailbox in the last month except for spam reports and exemption requests. If you so desperately require mod intervention (something which I don't think is necessary), why don't you try and contact us?

       And just for the record, people have suggested mod intervention in the subreddit before -- the only thing I would consider would be similar rules to what is in place in
       <a href="/r/911truth">
        /r/911truth
       </a>
       -- and every time, the community rejects it. The up and down votes are there for a reason. If there is a cabal downvoting, the reddit admins will find out and they will be punished. Just as you will be if you insist on making your own cabal.

       I don't think downvotes are called for unless it's on an obvious trolling comment or post. I don't even know if banning them will work. So long as they (the blatantly obvious trolls like herklmer and jcm) spend time in the same account, they can be handled. I'm speaking not about all the members of your list per se, but the people who DO troll and defame conspiracy theorists and downvote stuff. We can't let the community devolve into an inquisition, but perhaps a little bit more active moderation is needed.

       Can you provide some links showing his bad behavior in the past? I mean, if you're going to accuse someone of being a troll or a shill, let's see some good evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just, if you want to do anything about this you're going to need to calm down and approach it very professionally without the emotions getting in the way. Passion is good! But getting pissed off and insulting someone is not going to help your cause.

       Let's see...looks like sugardeath has the occasional post in conspiracy, but most of his post are technological in nature. Specifically seems to have serious, intelligent conversations in those subreddits. What few posts I find addressing conspiracies seem to be simply pointing out facts with no insults or anything of that nature.

       Yes, it IS possible to claim that, but no one has made that argument, so I can conclude that either
      </p>
      <p>
       a) no effort has been made to search my comment history for the offending behavior (and either failed, posting the "it's been deleted" argument; or succeeded, posting the comments in question)
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       b) I'm not seen as enough of a "threat" to even refute with such an argument.  Which is, frankly, disappointing after being sort of called out.
      </p>
      <p>
       This compounded on top of everyone else's lack of comment-based-evidence (on both sides of the argument) leads me to believe this whole thing is a circlejerk or a petty attempt at soiling users' names.

COINTELPRO is known to have supplied false information in order create suspicion between authentic progressive activists. Seemingly paradoxically, disinformation agents may actually promote discussion of disinformation/infiltration in order to increase paranoia.

        The terrible part is that I DO strongly suspect that the ones who are causing all of the drama, saying "he's a shill! You're a disinfo agent! Go back to your conspiratard buddies!" etc. are actually the very people trying to disrupt the community.

       Now that's something I haven't thought about!  It actually sounds like a decent strategy, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure this kind of stuff has been posted here before (the link you gave me), but it's new to me.  I guess that just goes to show how little time I actually spend here (though the name "COINTELPRO" is vaguely familiar).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, the solution isn't as simple as "hey guys, ignore these kinds of posts and focus on this, this, or that."  I guess it's the nature of a community like this to latch on to things that show distrust, whether real or manufactured.

       Yeah I think that the best thing would be educating people to recognize the trolling and behaviors that disrupt the discussions (especially the vitriol, insults, personal attacks, etc.) and to have moderators that actually give a darn about these things and warn people not to do them.

       I glanced at sugardeath's profile and realized that I didn't feel like spending 30 minutes looking for troll behavior or posts in conspiratard. If you can provide me with just one post he has made in conspiratard that you're already aware of (to save time), that will at least satisfy me that you didn't make it up. Also, cherrypicking doesn't work when you provide a link to the source of the information, so if you give me a link to his activity that demonstrated trollish behavior, I can click "context" or "full comments" and see the full story.

       They absolutely destroyed Digg. They were even more damaging there because they would exploit any opportunity they could to silence their opposition by piling on top of one another to 'report' and ban people at any slightly untoward comment. Before you knew it most of the good submitters vanished and the front page was dominated by nothing more than spam and hasbara.

       Yeah seriously. I don't understand why more people don't know about this. It's patently obvious from just a glance at any of the major subreddits that there is a huge amount of people just trying to push the Jewish Agenda. Just try to mention anything bad about a Jew and see what happens. Even well established facts just get downvoted into oblivion.

       Personnaly i do not enjoy being on a list of downvotes because i disagree with some who are pro Israeli, it doesn't mean i'm a nazi, but i would like you to stop these people from mass downvoting every thing i post for no reason even if has nothing to do with them. You say it is against rediquette and i agree with you but will you have a word with Carasso over this? The way i see it texmex was just replying to the fact that there is already a list of mass downvotes directed at us.

       Yeah these kinds of lists are dangerous and can cause everybody to become more paranoid than they need to be. Don't just accept that this list is shills or trolls, everyone. If you're that interested, then look at the users' post histories for traditional troll behavior.

      </p>
      <p>
       Those are Zionist Neocons and you can name every one of them... we all know what they want: greater Israel and more wars with Muslims/Arabs to protect their state. Just look at how many dual-citizenship, Israel-firster traitors we have in our government... it's sickening.

       It's just another Mossad false flag operation designed to keep Obama in check and to distract people with nonsense so they don't see the theft of a millennia that's happening on Wall St.

Following Zakheim And The Pentagon Trillions To Israel And 911

       that the 9-11 terrorist attacks were run by Mossad, and that this was common knowledge among global intelligence agencies:
      </p>
      <p>
       Alan Hart, retired BBC reporter and a man who knew both Golda Meir and Yassir Arafat has recently come out publicly and said that his sources tell him that Mossad was behind 9/11

       TexMex listed me, merely for pointing out that he was was a pathetic little neo-nazi submoron.  Anyone who disagrees with me, I can simply point to his list of posts full of anti-semitic disinfo and shilling.  Heck, I can can simply point to HIS OWN list, to show all the people who agree.

       Why do you deny that someone like this is antisemitic - with all the evidence right in front of you - when you have no problem believing unsubstantiated claims that those who criticizes or down-vote such posts are part of some JIDF-organized conspiracy?

       No. That user account is for trolling and quite possibly to be used as an excuse to scream "ANTI-SEMITISM IS ALL OVER REDDIT". Nobody cares about him. Nobody agrees with him. How much "karma" does he have? Chill out.

       Riiiiight.  When people post anti-semitic post after anti-semitic post after anti-semitic post, you claim that they're just trolls, and nobody cares about them.  But you're full of concern and quick to defend posts by the same people when they claim that those who down-vote their posts are part of a JIDF conspiracy.

       Now wait a second, I defended the troll when he was downvoted? No, I did not. Conspiracies to downvote any comments critical of israel are quite different from downvotes given to obvious trolls like gss99.

       Look, anyone can feel free to look through my history. The one anti-conspiracy theory post I submitted was a link to a scientific journal. It is not like I am going around bating people into getting angry at me. I am mostly sick of people in this reddit and others claiming everyone who doesn't agree with their viewpoint is a troll/shill/disinfo agent. It is really insane. I rarely even visit r/conspiracy. Like I said, feel free to make a psychological profile on me based on my posts, but it seems like a waste of time.

       I agree with you, in general. All of this nonsense needs to stop. The moderators need to step in and enforce reddiquette and the user agreement. That's all. If someone gathers evidence of a conspiracy to game the site, then that can be presented. If someone wants to discuss the idea of how people may be conspiring to game the site, that can be presented, but can't devolve into an inquisition or witch hunt, and the emotions need to be checked at the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       The terrible part is that I DO strongly suspect that the ones who are causing all of the drama, saying "he's a shill! You're a disinfo agent! Go back to your conspiratard buddies!" etc. are actually the very people trying to disrupt the community.

       Alright, just to give a report on my feelings or interpretation of this post and the comments posted at this time (3:30 pm CST, 05/19/2011):
      </p>
      <p>
       Texmex is either
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        a member of this community who is hypersensitive about trolls and shills, to the point of labeling individuals as trolls or shills or disinfo agents or members of r/conspiratard when they disagree with him
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        A double-agent, that is, an agent provocateur of sorts, attempting to stir up an inquisition and make users of this community more paranoid than they need to be, and to paint us as morons who jump at the slightest thing.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I believe that the issue of a conspiracy to game the site, or this particular reddit, is a serious one and there are actual administrative mechanisms in place to prevent such things. That's right, the admins recognize the risk of conspiracy. The question is how we respond to that risk, and the risk of trolling and psychological operations here. I don't believe we can begin compiling databases and records on users, because who will be the judge? By what metric will you determine when someone is a troll, a shill, or just a skeptic, or someone who just doesn't find the content interesting?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two things that must be done to begin to resolve this. First, users must familiarize themselves with the tactics used by shills, disinformation sources, trolls, etc. and downvote material that matches those patterns, as well as commenting on exactly how that material is not constructive or does not facilitate meaningful conversation. Here are a few resources:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.proparanoid.net/truth.htm">
         http://www.proparanoid.net/truth.htm
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.truthmove.org/content/disinformation/">
         http://www.truthmove.org/content/disinformation/
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Second, the moderators must take a more active role in enforcing the user agreement and reddiquette by removing the personal attacks and warning users who attempt to disrupt the flow of conversation. If the moderators don't care about this, then I respectfully propose that new moderators be selected to perform this duty.

       It's a program devised by the government of Israel wherein jews around the world work together to censor or "correct" anything that is critical of Israel or the jewish people. They have a program that you run on your computer that notifies you when something on the internet is criticising israel or is saying something potentially harmful to Israel's interests, and then you and tons of other jews will visit the link and leave comments or vote in the poll or whatever it is. That's the idea, at least. They also recruit college students to promote israel and criticise anyone who appears to be "anti-semitic" on campus. The JIDF is a related group.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like jcm267 troll anyone who criticizes israel, as well as anything conspiracy or ron paul related. They may not be hasbara per se, but still follow similar patterns of behavior.

      <p>
       At least, this is my understanding of it. I could be wrong.

       Sorry,you're saying 'they' are conspiring to prevent people from being aware that there is such a thing as anti-semitism? That is a really, really silly thing to believe.  Please don't believe that. Seriousl.

       I'm trying to tell people the truth.  I've done a lot of research.  I work for no one.  I've been researching since 2006.   In my opinion, the holocaust never happened.   The jews were partly responsible for Pearl Harbor.  The Jews were responsible for 9/11.   The jews are now working on gaining control of US food supply.   To understand how the jews operate, you need to read "The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion".  They often use controlled opposition to maintain power.

       That's fascinating. When you say "The Jews" are you referring to every single jew, or a group of jews who act independently from all of the others? I think that when you make such sweeping generalizations it makes you sound a little loony. Regarding the holocaust, what do you think about the photographs and the red cross report and the graves and things, then? I can imagine that it's possible that events didn't take place exactly as history records them, but find it difficult to believe that it never happened at all.

       I don't have much sympathy for any jew.   Who gives a shit about generalizations.  If I'm speaking about 95 % of them then that's enough for me to make generalizations.  I don't like black people either.  yes, I've met one or two who didn't try to steal from me or kill me but I'll make generalizations about them because the majority of the blacks that I have met either were completely racist against me, stole something from me, stole something from my mom, or threatened to kill me.   The majority of contact with blacks has been negative.  I haven't seen one jew who I respected, either.

       I"m a strong believer in racial genetics.  Certain races have certain characteristics.  The negro is dumb and lacks reasoning skills.  The Jew doesn't like to work and likes to leech off of others.  Lots of people are brainwashed to believe that we are all equal but I know that is not true.

       continued...a holocaust means people were put to death.  Jews and dissenters were not put to death.  The reason you had pictures of graves is because when you herd people into a camp like cattle,  that camp becomes your entire life.  People inside the camp, ate there, they played soccer there...they went to theater inside the camp.  They lived their lives inside the camp.  Okay?  So if someone dies of disease inside the camp, then there is going to be a complete record of that and a grave and everything.  If someone dies inside a camp, that doesn't mean the Nazi's gassed them, it means Louse broke out and the disease spread and people died.  That can happen lots of places.  The Nazis did not want the Jews to die because they were using them for free labor.

       Are you saying that if reddit bans users for trolling that it's against the constitution of the United States? The amendment only states that congress shall make no laws about those things. It says nothing about reddit banning users.

      <p>
       Now, the user agreement and reddiquette DO say things that are relevant here, but they are only selectively enforced and hold little value. The rule of the mob, or the "hive mind", is all that truly matters.

       Also, calling him a neonazi or a scumbag is defamation, and does not invalidate his opinion or argument. If you want to attack his character, then do it separately from this issue.

       Yes, it is pretty apparent that polymathgonewild is likely a sockpuppet, and not a very good one at that. It's too bad. I appreciate good sockpuppetry trolling, it's one of the most entertaining new forms of performance art I've seen. Part-timers like this just take up the form, but ignore the essence of the game.

       The biggest enemy the truth has is the ignorant of all things global Americans.

       Now before you waste your down vote I am talking about the general indoctrinated by the now privatised version of operation mockingbird Americans and not the enlightened brethren here in reddit.

      <p>
       Main street has become struggle street and people are to busy trying to survive to care about what is true or not.

       Also Reddit itself has means of shadow banning users and posts, some that have been of importance for truth seekers during world events.

       Again, you bring zero proof, or even reasonable evidence, that any of this is going on to hide Truth or whatever. AFAIK, shadow banning is for people who constantly spam with commercial sites.

       Idea? it occurs very regularly in reddit, the user logs in and all their comments and posts are there except they are the only one who sees them. so they don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       The process is designed to quieten people down and so they don't just open another user name and repost when banned
      </p>
      <p>
       They always blame it on the spam filter which doesn't filter spam

       If I am shadow-banned and I see a change in the kind of voting I'm getting, if I log out will I still see my comments or posts? If I access the page from a different IP address while logged out, will it still be there?

       Well, antisemitism is a fine word and all, but it doesn't really give any specific information. It doesn't cause me to have any particular emotional response except a groan and rolling of the eyes when the term is thrown out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, do you actually think that the reddit admins care about racism here? How often have you seen the user agreement enforced?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, do you have any shining examples of this anti-semitism? Not that the admins care, but if this guy is actuall a neo-nazi or white nationalist or whatever then it might be good to know. In the same way that it would be good to know whether someone is part of the JIDF or hasbara, etc.

       Oh, come off it.  "Neo-Nazi" might be open to question, but if you'd actually look at his posting history for the last few months, you'll see post after post after post where he blames Jews for everything that's ever gone wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny how you're open to the idea of everyone who disagrees with him being "JIDF or hasbara, etc.", "It would be good to know...", but entirely closed to the idea of him being a neo-nazi, let alone the easily-proven-if-you'd-only-look anti-semite.

       I never claimed I was closed to the idea of him being a neo-nazi or a racist. I simply haven't yet seen evidence supporting the assertion. If you're so convinced that he is one, and you claim to see posts from him that prove it, then why not link them? I only looked at the first five pages of his comments before I realized it was a waste of time.

      <p>
       Those are Zionist Neocons and you can name every one of them... we all know what they want: greater Israel and more wars with Muslims/Arabs to protect their state. Just look at how many dual-citizenship, Israel-firster traitors we have in our government... it's sickening.

Following Zakheim And The Pentagon Trillions To Israel And 911
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the years, I've come to realize that all these "Black Popers" and "Jesuiters" are either mentally ill or are Rothschild/zionist agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel was behind 9/11 and that US military knows that
      </p>
      <p>
       that the 9-11 terrorist attacks were run by Mossad, and that this was common knowledge among global intelligence agencies:
      </p>
      <p>
       Alan Hart, retired BBC reporter and a man who knew both Golda Meir and Yassir Arafat has recently come out publicly and said that his sources tell him that Mossad was behind 9/11
      </p>
      <p>
       the Mossad operation that became 9/11 would have been aided and abetted by certain corrupt American leaders.

       All of these seem to be about Israel, not about Jews - except for two:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         the comment about goyim being idiots. Id like to see the link for that one to get a better context.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The other comment about how people who have mentioned that many jews have positions of prominence have been jailed, fired, or called names. I'd like to see the context on that one too.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The problem is that people say "you hate me because of my race/ethnicity" when the problem has nothing to do with race or ethnicity, but behavior of specific individuals, or the behavior of governments. I concede that there ARE truly racist people - I'm not a moron. I believe that there are some people who really do make generalizations about how all jews are evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, let's say that that somewhere in the archives of his posting history there are incidents of true racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what? How does it affect any argument about a conspiracy about hasbara or disinformation agents conducting downvote campaigns or regularly trolling r/conspiracy?

        - one of the most effective ways to destroy a group is to sow distrust among members. COINTELPRO is known to have supplied false information in order create suspicion between authentic progressive activists. Seemingly paradoxically, disinformation agents may actually promote discussion of disinformation/infiltration in order to increase paranoia. Such efforts may be targeted at creating suspicion around real and effective evidence/materials/activists.
