But when you&#39;re a full-time UFOlogist, I wouldn&#39;t imagine you have much other income coming in to support your day job, so to speak. I think their theories are excellent food for thought and, at the very least, give non-religious folks a reason to give these ancient, Biblical stories a second look and consider how we would tell stories of &quot;Gods&quot; descending from the skies.</p>

<p>If nothing else, it (hopefully) helps people keep an open mind and consider that maybe we don&#39;t have the <em>whole</em> story from our past. Just my two pennies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it, gods have three places to come from. The ground, the ocean, or the sky. The sky makes more sense than the others, even though some religions cite the other two as the origin of humans or their Gods. The sky gives us; life giving rain, sunlight, helps with navigation, and tells us the time of year. To an undeveloped society it would seem all good things come from the sky so god must also come from the sky. Also great unexplained thins happen in the sky like lightning and meteors. </p>

<p>If people are interested they recently discovered ancient gold mines in Africa and articles can be found in search engines,  </p>

<p>Instead of them mining for it now they have us working a global economy based on money backed by gold.</p>

<p>Those gold reserves are being stock piled and will be going somewhere soon.</p>

<p>The sumerians were the only ones to tell the truth and the abrahamic religions like Judaism, Christianity and Islam all deprive their religious texts from the Sumerian tablets, over 25,000 of them in various museums and storage facilities etc</p>

<p>The two Iraq wars have devastated the cradle of civilisation and destroyed so much more.</p>

<p>The ancient astronaut theory is correct and has more scientific merit than a blind faith system.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pity that the theory automatically discounts human ingenuity. I haven&#39;t seen anything to convince me humans weren&#39;t responsible for these ancient mysteries. It&#39;s possible that certain methods and skills have become forgotten over time.</p>

<p>What are the chances our atmosphere is conducive to their respiration? Or how about our gravity, wouldn&#39;t it be very coincidental if that suited their anatomy as well? There&#39;s no good reason why they should have built anything, and it&#39;s far too small of a chance that this planet was so similar to their own that it could support their way of life.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sitchin.com/adam.htm">223 extra genes</a> in the human genome seemingly appeared from nowhere and can&#39;t be traced to a predecessor whereas all genes in all other animals can be traced to their evolutionary predecessor.  </p>

<p>Zecharia Sitchin, who studied and deciphered Sumerian cuneiform tablets that predated the bible found texts and carvings of a double-helix meant to represent DNA along with models of the solar system with an extra planet with a 3600 year backwards orbit.  </p>

<p>He proposed that the ancient aliens took their genes and spliced it with primates of local regions to create semi-intelligent, commandable slaves to mine for gold and grow their own food.  Splicing with different primates produced different outcomes and behaviors in different regions.  </p>

<p>Sumeria, which is now part of Iraq is reportedly the 1st place in history where farming was discovered along with advanced architecture and complex societies.  </p>

<p>I see this argument a lot but, in considering how old the universe is and how &quot;young&quot; planet Earth is, it&#39;s very plausible for an intelligent species to be able to have a million, or even a billion years head start on us. With that said, if we were to go a million years in the future, who is to say FTL travel wouldn&#39;t be technologically feasible or even commonplace?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s plausible, but we need to evidence to go beyond postulating. It&#39;s true that the Earth is &#39;young&#39; in terms of cosmic standards, but most elements conducive to life took a while to be produced in the first few stars (before they exploded, they were very large and very short lived) and spread necessary elements into the surrounding area. </p>

<p>And even then, intelligent life took almost 5 billion years to even start dabbing it&#39;s toes into the cosmos. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s possible, but given the immense size of a possibly infinite in size universe, it&#39;s just as likely as it is that we were visited by aliens. </p>

<p>You should also take into account that these intelligent races haven&#39;t destroyed themselves, or died out before they could spread out of their solar system. Even if one or two races did discover FTL, it&#39;s still a massive distance to cover.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And why would alien beings with the technology to go all the way across the solar system (not just once but several times), find the only solution to mine gold, after their workforce revolted, was to create a new species that took time to teach and multiply.

You have the technical prowess to go from planet to planet with ease, why not invest some of that energy into finding a way to make gold molecules yourself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one said they didn&#39;t have machines. Of course they wouldn&#39;t LEAVE their technology to us. I don&#39;t think the aliens in this case are benevolent. They used us as slaves, in this context. Why build STONE structures? Because monuments made of out material that can easily be destroyed wouldn&#39;t last very long. These structures were made to stand the test of time. Obviously.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t buy that the pyramids were completely made by humans. I don&#39;t think anyone has given a good conclusion about how they were built. Just lots of theories. (not saying that Aliens teaching us how to build them is fact, but this IS <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.) It&#39;s just a fun subject, obviously we&#39;ll never truly know. Unless the Aliens come back and tell us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You missed my point. If they even came here and had &quot;machines&quot;, which I sincerely doubt an civilization with interstellar travel capacity wouldn&#39;t have very advanced robotics or nanotechnology, why would they need a worker to do the work? A worker they needed to modify genetically. It&#39;s not like they landed, saw an apelike creature and said: &quot; You know what, fuck it, we have all this awesome technology but the warranty is about to expire and i think we lost the receipt anyway. You now how much of a bitch Astro Depot&#39;s return policies are. Lets just just create a new species using the apes DNA and our DNA, mix that shit together and see what pops out. Give it a few years so we can train it to do what we need it to do and hang out in Cozumel while this all goes down. High five everyone!&quot;</p>

<p>There wasn&#39;t an advanced mothership with infrastructure built in,nor thousands of alien colonists to start from scratch.</p>

<p>Compared to the ease of just splicing some genes,and let them multiply like rabbits and you have a workforce immediately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that theory got some compelling evidence.
1 thing that caught my attention was the stones used to create the egyptian pyramids. Each of these stones weigh at least 2 tons each while on the other hand, in a near by temple, each stone weigh 100 tons each.
Now you can ask yourself, why would ancient people who hadn&#39;t discovered the wheel yet would build one temple with 2 tons stones and another temple with 100 tons stones?</p>

He&#39;s a &quot;Hindu creationist&quot; who believes that the human race has existed long before the theory of evolution or the Judeo-Christian records account for.  According to the Vedic literature these &quot;aliens&quot; are just demigods given control over certain aspects of material nature and created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu">Vishnu</a> who resides in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goloka">spiritual abode</a>.  I personally think the Vedic/Indian spiritual tradition explains reality in a way that completely blows modern science and half-baked Christian creationism out of the water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all conjecture. Some take it a bit seriously. We&#39;ll never really know, but some of the evidence out there fits together so well. It&#39;s easy to dismiss it. However, there is plenty of history out there that people willingly accept in their every day lives that is outright bullshit. Knowing how to digest the information, and keep it there for future use is important. Every theory should be welcome, even if it sounds silly and outlandish like &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot;.
