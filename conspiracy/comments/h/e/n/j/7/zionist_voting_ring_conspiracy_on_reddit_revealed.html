    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re on the right track.</p>

<p>Most of the frequent commentators on r/conspiracy are not racist anti-semites; they&#39;re concerned anti-zionists. Some folks are a little paranoid and believe that there&#39;s a conspiracy amongst some of the wealthier jewish population to support zionism; but from what I&#39;ve seen even they are often quite reasonable to discuss with.</p>

<p>I rather enjoy the discussion on r/conspiracy. Aside from those who trash the commentators on this subreddit in drive-by slander, most of the discussion is remarkably mature. More so than most other subreddits, I daresay.</p>

<p>My other favourite havens of reasonable discussion include r/trees, r/programming, r/cigars, and r/proper. :)</p>

<p>Are you new to r/conspiracy? Why don&#39;t you stick around and join in the discussion. You seem like a nice person</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, Jews as a group tend to support Isreal and its Zionist policies. Insofar as we are criticizing the actions of Isreal, we also criticize such support. But there is a minority of Jews who are highly vocal and who stand against Zionism and do not support Israel&#39;s actions against the Palestinians. Spokespersons for that group, such as Norman Finkelstein and Noam Chomksy, get a very warm reception here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By link:</p>

<ol>
<li>Link to a list of wealthy Jews. Discussion is mostly about whether talking about this is anti-semitic, and the interesting over-representation of Jews amongst the Forbes 400. No prevailing antisemitism.</li>
<li>The vast majority of the discussion is around how mass-downvoting is against rediquette, and how Johnny_Cash is an anti-semitic ass. I suppose you could construe otherwise, if your sarcasm detector is broken.</li>
<li> Most of the discussion is about how likely it is that Mossad killed that man, and trite remarks on the pro-Israel movement&#39;s tendency to quell free speech; not about that man&#39;s crazy holocaust-denying beliefs.</li>
<li>Top voted posts all seem to correct the misrepresenting title. Rest of discussion is on how free speech should remain free.</li>
<li>Barely up-voted link; all comments above 0 appear to be about maintaining the freedom of speech.</li>
<li>Yes, the topic of discussion was that the media was labeling a Jewish person as an anti-Semite. Your point is what, exactly?</li>
</ol>

<p>You know, there&#39;s actual anti-semitic folks that occasionally creep their way onto r/conspiracy; but like the rest of reddit, r/conspiracy tends to do a half-decent job of down-voting them away. You, on the other hand, have confused relevant and meaningful discussion about matters of free speech with antisemitism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree to an extent. It&#39;s just a silly up-vote down-vote system that people don&#39;t have to pay attention to. People are also capable of getting information from other websites. But I think the organization of a down-vote campaign, or even just an implication of organization, is what troubles people most. You don&#39;t have to agree with what someone says, but that doesn&#39;t mean you need to order around some sheep to down-vote submissions or comments, especially if said down-vote is not accompanied by a well articulated reply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By link:</p>

<ol>
<li>Link to a list of wealthy Jews. Discussion is mostly about whether talking about this is anti-semitic, and the interesting over-representation of Jews amongst the Forbes 400. No prevailing antisemitism.</li>
<li>The vast majority of the discussion is around how mass-downvoting is against rediquette, and how Johnny_Cash is an anti-semitic ass. I suppose you could construe otherwise, if your sarcasm detector is broken.</li>
<li> Most of the discussion is about how likely it is that Mossad killed that man, and trite remarks on the pro-Israel movement&#39;s tendency to quell free speech; not about that man&#39;s crazy holocaust-denying beliefs.</li>
<li>Top voted posts all seem to correct the misrepresenting title. Rest of discussion is on how free speech should remain free.</li>
<li>Barely up-voted link; all comments above 0 appear to be about maintaining the freedom of speech.</li>
<li>Yes, the topic of discussion was that the media was labeling a Jewish person as an anti-Semite. Your point is what, exactly?</li>
</ol>

<p>You know, there&#39;s actual anti-semitic folks that occasionally creep their way onto r/conspiracy; but like the rest of reddit, r/conspiracy tends to do a half-decent job of down-voting them away. You, on the other hand, have confused relevant and meaningful discussion about matters of free speech with antisemitism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, Jews as a group tend to support Isreal and its Zionist policies. Insofar as we are criticizing the actions of Isreal, we also criticize such support. But there is a minority of Jews who are highly vocal and who stand against Zionism and do not support Israel&#39;s actions against the Palestinians. Spokespersons for that group, such as Norman Finkelstein and Noam Chomksy, get a very warm reception here.</p>
