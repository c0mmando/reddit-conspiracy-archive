       can't separate the shit that Israel does from stereotyping all jews.

       I'm not very familiar with zionism but here is the thing my dislike of anti-semitism appears to be the same as others dislike of zionism which is described by
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism">
        wiki
       </a>
       as a possible racist ideology.

       You're on the right track.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the frequent commentators on r/conspiracy are not racist anti-semites; they're concerned anti-zionists. Some folks are a little paranoid and believe that there's a conspiracy amongst some of the wealthier jewish population to support zionism; but from what I've seen even they are often quite reasonable to discuss with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I rather enjoy the discussion on r/conspiracy. Aside from those who trash the commentators on this subreddit in drive-by slander, most of the discussion is remarkably mature. More so than most other subreddits, I daresay.
      </p>
      <p>
       My other favourite havens of reasonable discussion include r/trees, r/programming, r/cigars, and r/proper. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you new to r/conspiracy? Why don't you stick around and join in the discussion. You seem like a nice person

       The thing is, Jews as a group tend to support Isreal and its Zionist policies. Insofar as we are criticizing the actions of Isreal, we also criticize such support. But there is a minority of Jews who are highly vocal and who stand against Zionism and do not support Israel's actions against the Palestinians. Spokespersons for that group, such as Norman Finkelstein and Noam Chomksy, get a very warm reception here.

       <li>
        Link to a list of wealthy Jews. Discussion is mostly about whether talking about this is anti-semitic, and the interesting over-representation of Jews amongst the Forbes 400. No prevailing antisemitism.
       </li>
       <li>
        The vast majority of the discussion is around how mass-downvoting is against rediquette, and how Johnny_Cash is an anti-semitic ass. I suppose you could construe otherwise, if your sarcasm detector is broken.
       </li>
       <li>
        Most of the discussion is about how likely it is that Mossad killed that man, and trite remarks on the pro-Israel movement's tendency to quell free speech; not about that man's crazy holocaust-denying beliefs.
       </li>
       <li>
        Top voted posts all seem to correct the misrepresenting title. Rest of discussion is on how free speech should remain free.
       </li>
       <li>
        Barely up-voted link; all comments above 0 appear to be about maintaining the freedom of speech.
       </li>
       <li>
        Yes, the topic of discussion was that the media was labeling a Jewish person as an anti-Semite. Your point is what, exactly?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       You know, there's actual anti-semitic folks that occasionally creep their way onto r/conspiracy; but like the rest of reddit, r/conspiracy tends to do a half-decent job of down-voting them away. You, on the other hand, have confused relevant and meaningful discussion about matters of free speech with antisemitism.

       The most offensive part of the anti-semitism I see on r/conspiracy is the fact that r/conspiracy is supposed to be filled with rational, objective people who shouldn't be so easily swayed by obvious scapegoating techniques like racism or ethnic discrimination.

       You should go outside of reddit to try to gain influence. Maybe start a Twitter hash tag (I don't think that Twitter is a Jew-owned site, so it won't be censored) to get people to sign up to reddit and downvotes their links and comments.

       and
       <a href="/r/politics">

       just the same kind of blackball list?

       I agree to an extent. It's just a silly up-vote down-vote system that people don't have to pay attention to. People are also capable of getting information from other websites. But I think the organization of a down-vote campaign, or even just an implication of organization, is what troubles people most. You don't have to agree with what someone says, but that doesn't mean you need to order around some sheep to down-vote submissions or comments, especially if said down-vote is not accompanied by a well articulated reply.

       He's been doing the same and is advocating those on the list be massdownvoted?

       You should go outside of reddit to try to gain influence. Maybe start a Twitter hash tag (I don't think that Twitter is a Jew-owned site, so it won't be censored) to get people to sign up to reddit and downvotes their links and comments.

       By link:

      <ol>
       <li>
        Link to a list of wealthy Jews. Discussion is mostly about whether talking about this is anti-semitic, and the interesting over-representation of Jews amongst the Forbes 400. No prevailing antisemitism.
       </li>
       <li>
        The vast majority of the discussion is around how mass-downvoting is against rediquette, and how Johnny_Cash is an anti-semitic ass. I suppose you could construe otherwise, if your sarcasm detector is broken.
       </li>
       <li>
        Most of the discussion is about how likely it is that Mossad killed that man, and trite remarks on the pro-Israel movement's tendency to quell free speech; not about that man's crazy holocaust-denying beliefs.
       </li>
       <li>
        Top voted posts all seem to correct the misrepresenting title. Rest of discussion is on how free speech should remain free.
       </li>
       <li>
        Barely up-voted link; all comments above 0 appear to be about maintaining the freedom of speech.
       </li>
       <li>
        Yes, the topic of discussion was that the media was labeling a Jewish person as an anti-Semite. Your point is what, exactly?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       You know, there's actual anti-semitic folks that occasionally creep their way onto r/conspiracy; but like the rest of reddit, r/conspiracy tends to do a half-decent job of down-voting them away. You, on the other hand, have confused relevant and meaningful discussion about matters of free speech with antisemitism.

       The thing is, Jews as a group tend to support Isreal and its Zionist policies. Insofar as we are criticizing the actions of Isreal, we also criticize such support. But there is a minority of Jews who are highly vocal and who stand against Zionism and do not support Israel's actions against the Palestinians. Spokespersons for that group, such as Norman Finkelstein and Noam Chomksy, get a very warm reception here.
