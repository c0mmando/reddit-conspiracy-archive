       This is absolutely true, slavishmuffin. This is manipulation, and like anything else it can be used for good, or for evil. In absolutely any instance, trying to explain somebody with one word is impossible. Situations are dual in nature so you are missing at least half the story. All you have to do is set up the context and a word or group of words can mean whatever you want it to mean. The power of words is incredible.

       Imagine an invading army attacks your city.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indiscriminate shelling leaves hundreds dead and homeless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occupying force rules the wrecked city ruthlessly, engaging in acts of violence and sadism with population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attacks on 'insurgents', done with superior, state-of-the-art technology, cause civilian casualties all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then one day you remaining family and loved ones are brutally massacred in front of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you assemble some kludgey weapon and try to avenge them? Would you gang up with others to attack the invading forces? Would you try to inflict some damage to any occupier, showing no mercy, knowing that you aren't likely to survive?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you maintain a clear head and contain your anger on the invaders, and not the entire population and government of the invading country?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you managed to escape to another country, could you stifle your anger, your bitterness, your grief, and be able to avoid being manipulated by others promising 'revenge' and 'retaliation'?

       As to your original questions: I'm in no position to judge someone who is under attack. Like how some escaped slaves would show sheriffs any old papers to prove that they had been freed. The sheriff was illiterate: "I was about to haul you back, boy. Good thing you kept those papers." Sheriff wouldn't question the slave because he didn't want to lose face and reveal to the slave that he couldn't read. Anyway, this action may have been "deceptive" and "illegal" but I'd think we'd agree it was quite legitimate. In fact, everything Hitler did was legal. So if someone is raping my family... I don't think it's unreasonable to physically stop the assault.

       A good question. For me the answer is no. But I would call them people. In a totally hypothetical scenario, I would choose to kill those people who happen to have chosen to be soldiers. They are not my enemy. They are people, and their behaviour is no longer acceptable. Therefore, they should be horizontalised. And I will accept the responsibility of that.

       There was an article in the paper recently about "sex offenders" becoming a growing menace in society. Just to see how it would look, I replaced every occurrence of "sex offender" with "negro" and it looked like an article that would have appeared during the Jim Crow era in Mississippi. They try to make this fear sound rational - but it's all word play. The media hasn't really changed too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, there was a recent story about Banksy on the front page. And the general sentiment was "hey cool, could it really be him?" As opposed to ten years ago when graffiti was considered solely criminal and related to gangs. The acceptance of Banksy is probably due to the fact that the populous knows that he is white and ultimately an artist. But still... things have changed somewhat.
