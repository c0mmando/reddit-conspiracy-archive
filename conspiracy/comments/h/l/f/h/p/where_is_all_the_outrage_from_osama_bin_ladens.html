       If he was such an influential leader to the terrorists of the world then where is all the outrage?  If he was such a threat to us then why aren't there retaliations?  Did his shelf life as the head of the boogie men expire and he simply wasn't good enough anymore for our news media to be able to keep propping up as a scary Muslim?

       Well Al-qaida and Osama Bin Laden were not well liked in most parts of the world.  In the countries that are more pro al-qaida than pro-west the news coverage for us westerners to see is less prevelant.  I do remember seeing some ceremonies marking his death in Pakistan, and other parts of Southeast Asia though.

       I can't imagine most people liking him and what he stood for that's for sure.  He embarrassed us and we overreacted with 2+ wars and over $1trillion spent.

       I guess you can choose any of the 9 times he have died.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Then on
        <strong>
         December 26, 2001
        </strong>
        , Fox News reported on a Pakistan Observer story that the Afghan Taliban had officially pronounced Osama Bin Laden dead earlier that month. According to the report, he was buried less than 24 hours later in an unmarked grave in accordance with Wahabbist Sunni practices.
       </p>
       <p>
        What followed was a string of pronouncements from officials affirming what was already obvious: supposedly living in caves and bunkers in the mountainous pass between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Osama would have been deprived of the dialysis equipment that he required to live.
       </p>
       <p>
        On
        <strong>
         January 18, 2002
        </strong>
        , Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf announced quite bluntly: “I think now, frankly, he is dead.”
       </p>
       <p>
        On
        <strong>
         July 17, 2002
        </strong>
        , the then-head of counterterrorism at the FBI, Dale Watson, told a conference of law enforcement officials that “I

        personally think he [Bin Laden] is probably not with us anymore,” before carefully adding that “I have no evidence to support that.”
       </p>
       <p>
        In
        <strong>
         October 2002
        </strong>
        , Afghan President Hamid Karzai told CNN that “I would come to believe that [Bin Laden] probably is dead.”
       </p>
       <p>
        In
        <strong>
         November 2005
        </strong>
        , Senator Harry Reid revealed that he was told Osama may have died in the Pakistani earthquake of October that year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In
        <strong>
         September 2006
        </strong>
        , French intelligence leaked a report suggesting Osama had died in Pakistan.
       </p>
       <p>
        On
        <strong>
         November 2, 2007,
        </strong>
        former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto told Al-Jazeera’s David Frost that Omar Sheikh had killed Osama Bin Laden.
       </p>
       <p>
        In
        <strong>
         March 2009
        </strong>
        , former US foreign intelligence officer and professor of international relations at Boston University Angelo Codevilla stated: “All the evidence suggests Elvis Presley is more alive today than Osama Bin Laden.”
       </p>
       <p>
        In
        <strong>
         May 2009
        </strong>
        , Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari confirmed that his “counterparts in the American intelligence agencies” hadn’t heard anything from Bin Laden in seven years and confirmed “I don’t think he’s alive.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Now in
        <strong>
         2011
        </strong>
        , President Obama has added himself to the mix of people in positions of authority who have pronounced Osama Bin Laden dead. Some might charge that none of the previous reports had any credibility, but as it is now emerging that Osama’s body was buried at sea less than 12 hours after his death with no opportunity for any independent corroboration of his identity, the same question of credibility has to be leveled at this latest charge. To this point, the only evidence we have been provided that Osama Bin Laden was killed yesterday are some images on tv of a burning compound and the word of the man currently occupying the oval office.

       This is all speculation.  We killed him on May 1.  The organization that Osama was in charge of confirmed this and said he died on May 1.  The Pakistani govt said we killed him on May 1.  Karzai said he died on May 1. Now please dont give me some conspiracy theory of how the CIA forced these leaders to say this.  No one could confirm his death for the last ten years and it was pure speculation.

       What's even worse is that no confirmation of death was given this time either. In fact, the reports of said 'death' are themselves speculation turned into truth by the media and accepted by the sheeple as truth.

       You got it right with the boogeyman thing.. His expiration date had come and gone, and it's time for a new bad-guy to threaten people with to support the War on Terror™. As far as retaliations, they're on Capitol Hill or Quantico or wherever they convene and light up a blunt while they weave horrible fear-based tales to scare us with. Now that they know we will accept anything they tell us as fact (as evidenced by the bin Laden 'death'), get ready for some tall tales.

       There has been 2 incidents, actually.. One of them were the ~10 taliban warriors that fortified themselves and their ~17 hostages on a Pakistani military base.. They held out for 16 hours or so..
I'm on the run, can look for sources when I'm home if you want!
