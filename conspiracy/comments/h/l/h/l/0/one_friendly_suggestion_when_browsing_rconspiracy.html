       That is to say, treat the links here with the same attitude as you would if you would see it on the front page. I often have to remind myself of this. I basically get in the habit of upvoting everything that is exposing any part of the conspiracy we are facing or even has any interesting information worth considering. To each his own of course, but we do have a common goal of reaching people. At least we should. And obviously I don't mean letting go of all critical thinking, just keeping a general positive mindset.

       I can't say I agree with this.  Upvoting as you've suggested would devalue the content of the articles and the integrity of this thread.  It's nice to see that people can neutrally embrace conspiracy without assimilating any preconceived notions of the typical "conspiracy" theorists propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, there are a lot of questionable articles submitted here which are rightfully challenged by the readers here.  If it can hash through the conversations back and forth and there is a legitimate truth than it deserves an upvote.

       Now if I've misinterpreted you're note above, I apologize and ignore this comment.

       I don't know, did you? I am not saying you shouldn't be critical, just that I think it would serve us well to upvote everything that we think is worth getting attention. And I definitely don't mean to upvote everything, obviously there are statements here I don't agree with or theories I don't think are accurate. I just find that sometimes I browse through a lot of stuff I agree with but am not always conscious enough to leave an upvote. I think we would be well to consider that the readers and submitters on this subreddit are in general our allies and we should show each other support.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe based on real evidence that there are bots or agents with multiple accounts that are downvoting links here and we would do well to consider this in our efforts. Upvoting generously is one way to do that.

       Paranoia is often the heart of conspiracy. Maybe there are just a lot of readers who think what you believe is crazy.

       The great thing about conspiracy "theories" is that you can discuss the

       of something without compelling evidence.

       Why should we dispense with critical thinking when we come to this subreddit? How does that make any sense? Blind upvoting will only accelerate the loss of credibility that this subreddit already suffers from.

       As a caveat - blind downvoting will do and has possibly done the same. Seems like the votes, both up and down, get thrown around in this subreddit with no consideration for content. Only "I'm right, you're wrong" type shit.

       This is probably true; but the OP specifically said not to let go of critical thinking. I think he is right. The message is clearly to push the good stuff... the OP wants to expose the conspiracy. A noble goal :)

       Surely conspiracy theories should stand and fall on their believability to their readers rather than some sort of acceptance of reality through a policy of mindless self promotion.
      </p>
      <p>
       That will just make the crap float higher and will confirm to the rest of reddit the common belief that conspiracy theorists are just gullible nuts.

       I think it makes sense to upvote anything that helps expose the conspiracy in any way - but as long as it makes sense to you. The worst thing that can happen is that we push some disinformation to the top; but hopefully we are mainly pretty critical thinkers, so I'm not so worried about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your definition of Conspiracy is true, but why should we be ashamed to be part of a conspiracy to push interesting stories out into the open? I say we do it and be open about it; if it isn't a secret then we cannot be accused of deceiving or misleading... and there is no defrauding going on... so there is nothing to be ashamed of.
