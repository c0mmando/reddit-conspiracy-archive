<blockquote>
<p>This President&#39;s pretty much a victim of success. We haven&#39;t had an attack in five years. The perception of the threat is so low in this society that it&#39;s not surprising that the behavior pattern reflects a low threat assessment. The same thing&#39;s in Europe, there&#39;s a low threat perception. The correction for that, I suppose, is an attack. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>FOIA revealed a group of ex-military &quot;message force multipliers&quot; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/us/20generals.html?ex=1367899200&amp;en=a816de69351ad0df&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">that work for various television news outlets</a>.</p>

<p>They have been caught pushing right-wing propaganda for the pentagon.  </p>

<p>Rumsfeld&#39;s quote is from a luncheon where these propagandists complained that people don&#39;t see enough of a terrorist threat.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>in other words...  </p>

<p>&quot;We are losing the public on the whole &#39;invading other countries for their resources&#39; and blaming it on cleaning out <em>terrorists</em>.</p>

<p>So we will need to set up another 9/11 false flag attack.</p>

<p>Call Mr.X at the CIA and let&#39;s see what we can come up with&quot;</p>

<p>The problem with any &quot;terrorist attack&quot; these days, that comes from TERRORIST that don&#39;t even have any real M.O., is that it&#39;s bound to be false flag, just to fuel peoples fear and keep the US war machine running.</p>

<p>Watch this space...</p>

<pre><code>EDIT:
</code></pre>

<p>To clarify what I mean by &quot;terrorist that don&#39;t even have any real M.O.&quot; :</p>

<p>I recently watched <em>Stewart Lee&#39;s Comedy Vehicle</em>, where he made jokes based on how the IRA were &quot;Good terrorist.&quot;, joking how they at least had an achievable goal; To break N.Ireland away from British rule and join Ireland.</p>

<p>He then went on to say how he didn&#39;t like this &quot;new lot... this... Al-Qaeda!&quot;, saying how they don&#39;t even have any achievable goals.  Their goal is &quot;The DESTRUCTION of all western civilization.&quot;</p>

<p>And whilst Mr Lee was &quot;just being ironic&quot; (his own words.  The skit was about how comedians use irony to say things they don&#39;t really believe in.) It actually made a good point and that is what I mean by no real M.O.</p>

<p>The new TERRORIST, don&#39;t really have an M.O.  They&#39;re just a convenient tool; a puppet in this silly media propaganda war, waged against us, the people.</p>

<p>Al-Qaeda, which many people suspect is a fabricated tool in this &quot;war on terror&quot;, don&#39;t really stand for anything.  You can&#39;t bring about &quot;The DESTRUCTION of all western civilization&quot;.  In fact, that is <em>just</em> the sort of bullshit M.O. that an agency might make up, in order to force feed and brain wash, non questioning civilians.</p>

<p>But yes... just wanted to make that clearer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was actually, originally, the CIA funded organisation headed by Bin Laden, to unite the Arab tribes against the Russians in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>As with most coup de tete since the middle of the last century...   CIA funded.</p>

<pre><code>EDIT:  
</code></pre>

<p>Here&#39;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472062/">a film about it.</a> All be it...  A Hollywood film.</p>

<p>Here is the wikipedia &quot;alleged&quot; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda#Alleged_CIA_involvement">blah blah blah</a></p>

<p>...and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Photographer-War-torn-Afghanistan-Doctors-Without/dp/1596433752">here is a wonderful book</a>, almost like a graphic novel, using photographs, that tells the story of a man sent into Afghanistan during Bin Laden&#39;s corralling of the tribes, to photo-document the events, that deals and eludes to this &quot;alleged&quot; blah blah blah.</p>

<p>The key thing to note is, that while it can&#39;t be proved yet (Until the information is declasified, much like all the CIA&#39;s involvement in the South American Coup&#39;s has been now.), there is strong links of the CIA to what is the current &quot;Global Baddie Terrorist Organisation&quot; and a whole bunch of Saudi Arabia ties, the oil rich country that has trillions invested in wall street and so on and so on...</p>

<p>But now they are some Arabs in a cave.  Want to blow the whole western world, and everything you believe in!!!</p>

<p>What can we do about it?  Whine on a forum and get called Conspiracy-Nut-Jobs by some people and some other people.  Then in 25-50 years after the information is declassified go, in decrepit old voices...</p>

<p><em>&quot;See.  I told you so.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Much like the people who voiced concern over all the CIA ties to South America did, in the last century, and got laughed at by the good honest citizens, who guffawed... &quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous!&quot;</p>

<p>So basically.  We can&#39;t do anything about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was the whole process from start to finish.  From the question and the actual innocent thought that the world is perfect, why wouldn&#39;t information X or Y be put out for all to see??</p>

<p>Then the correction by others who see past the charade now.  The questioner understands already half the issue but never in context like this before.  The questioner now sees a problem and will continue from now on to see the obvious intentions of big business and big Government instead of the roses and green grass as painted to everyone else as the norm.  </p>

<p>Where: He owns land in Taos, NM.  Call it a &quot;ranch&quot;, which is common for anyone who lives in northern NM who happens to be either a celebrity or rich person in general.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a complete dick in my mind and probably has a hard time dealing with the &quot;hippies&quot;/liberals/spicks in Taos.  He should sell the property and leave the country.  There are lots of lovely places for ex-dictatorial people to watch the sunset as their lives decompose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not new to this sort of thinking.  PNAC&#39;s blueprint for America known as  <a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf">Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses</a> asserts that to create tomorrows dominant force, a new Pearl Harbor-like event will be needed.  </p>

<p>From section 5 of the document:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event––like a new Pearl Harbor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes on to talk about war plans for Iraq, Iran, Libya and Syria and Clinton&#39;s need for &quot;fudging&quot; intelligence on Pakistan.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Signatories_to_Statement_of_Principles">PNAC members</a></p>

<p>Most notable members ended up being in the GW Bush administration:</p>

<p>Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, John Bolton, Richard Armitage, and Elliott Abrams.</p>

<p>Look at the list of names and you&#39;ll also see where the Jewish conspiracy theory part of 9-11 came from.  PNAC was founded by Kristol and at least 35 of the signatories are Jews.  The rest are neo-cons and their associates.  </p>

Whether he&#39;s concerned that the security theater is suffering or concerned that we&#39;ll be attacked again for real is perhaps up for debate, but he is clearly not advocating for an attack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s a shame we don&#39;t have the maturity to recognize the seriousness of the threats...the lethality, the carnage, that can be imposed on our society is so real and so present and so serious that you&#39;d think we&#39;d be able to understand it</p>

<p>- more of the quote</p>

<p>I find it amazingly hypocritical for you to criticize people pushing propaganda when you&#39;re doing exactly what they are by attempting to shape a story with a misleading headline.  No where in the Rumsfeld quote does he call for an attack or say 9-11. You are lying to shape the story the same why you&#39;re accusing them of lying to shape stories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to say something similar. The entire quote, in context, seems to say simply that he perceives national security threats and is concerned that the Democrats or the Americans who voted them into office don&#39;t. </p>

<p>The analyst thing was reprehensible, but it&#39;s a different issue. Or an outgrowth of his worldview; if he sees a high threat level and worries that others don&#39;t see the threats, perhaps he felt that the ends justified the means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. What&#39;s he&#39;s saying is that, because there have been no attacks over the last 3 years (and it&#39;s impossible to prove WHY something DIDN&#39;T happen -- it could be from the enlargement of the TSA, the Intelligence community, the wars, or just plain economy), the American people don&#39;t believe there will be an attack, and are getting complacent.</p>

<p>Complacency will cause holes in security to open up, which will create the opportunity for an attack.  Unfortunately, as long as there is no attack, complacency will occur.</p>

<p>You people read what you want to hear into the words, of course, instead of taking into account the context.</p>

<p>Were Rumsfeld trying to say what readers suggest (that the US should create an attack), he surely wouldn&#39;t do it in a place where his words could be recorded...</p>

<p>AFAIK, he was not advocating an attack. He just said that an attack in/against the US would increase public support for new/more anti-terrorism initiatives. Anyone with half a brain can understand that public opinion works that way. Is Rumsfeld callous, manipulative, etc.? Certainly, but I think most here are reading too much into this statement.</p>

<p>Rumsfeld&#39;s reasoning: The USA faces a large number of credible threats it its security. We need to work hard to prevent actual incidents. We lack the political capital to do that, because people don&#39;t feel like we are under threat. In other words, there is an incongruity between the actual threat and the perceived threat (by the public), at least in Rumsfeld&#39;s mind. Rumsfeld feels that this incongruity will disappear when a new attack show the public that there is still a valid threat that they should be afraid of.</p>
