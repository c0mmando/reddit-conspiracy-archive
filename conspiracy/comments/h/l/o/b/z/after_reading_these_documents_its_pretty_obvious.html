<p>Japan is our new target of attack through <a href="http://www.lawfulpath.com/ref/sw4qw/">silent weapons of a quiet war</a>
(ie: HAARP, economic destabilization, and secret missions, though mainly from the use of HAARP lately).</p>

<p>Proof:</p>

<p>Japan is the second largest debt holder for America. Holding around 800 billion in debt, taking out japan could seem like a possible motive for the almost defaulting U.S government. </p>

<p>After two earthquakes, tsunamis, and now a lvl 5 typhoon, weather seems to be really taking a toll on japan. But since the 1970s we have been researching weather control, and as of 2010, China, Russia, and America, each have their own HAARP station.  Through simple research, one can find HAARP has obvious potential as a &#39;silent weapon&#39;. </p>

<p>Finally, my last point is more of an opinion and my form of common sense. But the last we heard about our officials planning to &#39;invade&#39; other countries was in 1999, with the [PNAC]. (<a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/">http://www.newamericancentury.org/</a>) That was over 10 years ago! After having an economic recession, and possibly the bankruptcy of the entire U.S, motives might have changed, and removing debt is obviously a very big motive.  </p>

<p>I believe that is what is going on with Japan, and I am open to debate it, but friendly debating please =)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s right. HAARP is capable of pumping electromagnetic energy into the ionosphere. I&#39;ve yet to see any of these HAARPies explain a mechanism for transferring any of that energy to tectonic plates.</p>

<p>HAARP (and related facilities) are of military interest because they are able to <a href="http://arcticcircle.uconn.edu/VirtualClassroom/HAARP/acf.html">form lenses in the ionosphere</a>, allowing radio transmissions to carry over a greater distance.</p>

<p>But basically, HAARP can create a outward buldge in the upper atmosphere, and in doing so, lift up the tectonic plates. </p>

<p>On January 10th, FEMA was in hati doing an earthquake response drill. On the 11th, there was the earthquake. </p>

<p>On the 12th, the data for the past experiments that was publicly available on HAARPs website, was deleted. </p>

<p>HAARP is known to &#39;go down&#39; around times of massive earthquakes, and when it is down, all the stats and data that are on the website and on file, is no longer seen. It went down for 3 days during the earthquake in Australia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a clear case of you not doing your homework.  A multitude of things could have triggered the earthquake, the least likely of which was a natural shift in tectonic plates.  Natural being defined as what the average Japanese quake has been for the last known 100 years or so.  However, your assertion that there is no economic instability in Japan?  Clearly, you do not know what you&#39;re talking about.  Japan is essentially a United States colony which is forced at gunpoint to make electronic consumer goods and sell them for cheap to the United States.  Their &quot;natural consequences&quot; are absolutely &quot;unnatural&quot; not only by the financial bullying of our Federal Reserve bank but by the uniformly horrendous policy of Yen printing in the wake of the Tsunami.  While the Yen has risen dramatically in the last 30 years relative to the dollar, it is still kept in check by Rockefeller, FRB and crew.  Do your homework.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That very page you linked to explains it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These kinds of observations are consistent with an idea called the Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling mechanism. The thinking is that in the days before an earthquake, the great stresses in a fault as it is about to give cause the releases large amounts of radon.</p>

<p>The radioactivity from this gas ionises the air on a large scale and this has a number of knock on effects. Since water molecules are attracted to ions in the air, ionisation triggers the large scale condensation of water.</p>

<p>But the process of condensation also releases heat and it is this that causes infrared emissions. &quot;Our first results show that on March 8th a rapid increase of emitted infrared radiation was observed from the satellite data,&quot; say Ouzounov and co.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was referring to the title of the post that said there is a &#39;secret war&#39;.</p>

<p>I saw what you mentioned, I think the sum was 800 million yen.</p>

<p>I can see how they might have tried to trigger an earthquake and it spiraled out of hand. I don&#39;t see how, even if you take into account the negative effects the radiation will have on fertility, how the eugenicists would want to create a disaster worse than chernobyl. </p>

<p>Earthquake weapons I don&#39;t doubt, I mean the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Bill Cohen, talked about the possibility &#39;terrorists&#39; would use them in &#39;99. And then there is <a href="http://current.com/news/89003708_teslas-earthquake-machine-haarp.htm">Tesla</a>, who supposedly developed a device to shake buildings by matching their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_resonance#Earthquake_machine">mechanical resonance</a>. I do remember reading an article from a magazine in the early 1900&#39;s that talked about using dynamite exploded at the right frequency to cause earthquakes as well. I wish I could find that, but the other things are enough for me to say this might be a &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; but a believable one.</p>

<p>An example of mechanical resonance btw, is how a small group of people could flip a car if they get it shaking back and forth properly, using the momentum plus added effort to their benefit. Or how you can move a boat you are standing on just by shifting your weight from foot to foot. Scaled up, why not earthquakes?</p>

The use of new weapons is not limited to governments and sophisticated science laboratories. In April ,1997, the United States Secretary of Defense, William Cohen made the following comment:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Others are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter climate, set off earthquakes,

<p>volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.&quot;</p>

<p>Could another country be inducing this phenomena? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight, and I apologize if I interpreted the OP incorrectly, but you are suggesting that we (the USA) caused the earthquakes in Japan so that they would destabilize their economy?
