There are HUNREDS of articles from hundreds of different sources all saying the same thing.</p>

<p>To me this is one of the biggest crimes against humanity in a long time. </p>

<p><strong>Can you imagine radiation free cancer therapy that literally costs pennies per pound to grow?</strong></p>

<p>It seems that the dosage levels need to be pretty high to actually cure cancer, something like 1g of pure hash oil every day for a few months. It also seems like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol">Cannabidiol</a> has much to do with the process, but unfortunately seedbanks all over the world do not carry excessively high CBD strains, because it has been sacrificed for THC production. I think we&#39;ll see some crazy medical benefits of CBD. </p>

<p><strong>TLDR;; CBD is practically proven to stop tumor growth and metastasis. THC is practically proven to kill cancer cells. Ladies and gentlemen, the cure for cancer is cheap, readily available, and <em>illegal</em>.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a daily potsmoker, and I also happen to work at a cancer molecular imaging lab at a Top 5 ranked school</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had experience in labs focusing on various neural tumor lines (gliomas, blastomas), and currently, I&#39;m running experiments on motility and overall biomechanics of metastatic/nonmetastatic breast cancer lines.</p>

<p>There is many things wrong with the links you posted. 5 links to journals does NOT prove anything. A single paper can have 50+ citations normally.</p>

<p>Cancer is not a caused by any one reason. Any &quot;cure&quot; for cancer is not going to be a miracle pill. The reasons for metastasis are different among tumor types, and among individuals. </p>

<p>In addition, killing cancer cells is not the focus, and hasn&#39;t been. Okay, you kill 95% of the tumor, but the remaining 5% will grow back and metastasize. So any cure for cancer, has to solve the metastasis problem, which is arguably much more important than killing the cells. Nobody ever dies from a primary tumor, its the transition from benign to malignant that kills you. The reasons for the transition known, but the effects are well known, elevated motility, reversal of cell polarity, reduction of focal-adhesion proteins, etc. </p>

<p>The challenge is understanding the root causes of this transition, as well as reversing this trend. Several theories have been put forward through the years, but no single therapy has managed to address this problem. There are ideas that cancer cells are forms of stem cells due to the myriad of similarities they share, and there are also ideas that the key to stopping metastasis lie in tissue engineering of the external tumor milieu and microenvironment.</p>

<p>Some of the sources you cite are shaky at best as well. Take this source:</p>

<p>&quot;Cannabinoids Induce Apoptosis of Pancreatic Tumor Cells&quot;</p>

<p>Published in an excellent journal. However, this experiment was carried out <em>in vitro</em>. Great, that proves nothing. I can design an <em>in vitro</em> experiment and kill cancer cells with practically anything. There is absolutely no mouse model (required for any clinical testing), no viable delivery method into the tumor, no studies showing actual tumor reductions, no imaging to show decrease in metastasis, not to mention no delivery drug. Are you going to inject pure THC into the tumor? </p>

<p>I have heard this argument many times. &quot;Big Pharma&quot; is conspiring to keep a cure for cancer off. It&#39;s bullshit. We are nowhere near curing cancer, and though THC/CBD may have therapeutic effects, it is nowhere close to a viable treatment for a person with T2+ cancer. </p>

<p>Through sensationalized headlines, Reddit cures cancer for the umpteenth time this week. While there is corruption in science, this field is more transparent than I daresay 95% of all other jobs. All the data and research is published and peer-reviewed. Current understanding shows that THC/CBD do not represent a miracle treatment to cancer, though it helps very much with the pain-relief aspect. </p>

<p>Marijuana is great, I smoke it everyday. But to build this plant up to a mythical status and herald it as a cure to cancer is a joke. It&#39;s a plant. It just grows, and it happens to get you high if fire is applied. Should it be legal? Absolutely. Is it a cure to cancer? Absolutely not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;current understanding&quot;. you leave no room for future application. What if the issues are (like some <em>in vitro</em> issues) simply how to get it to the affected area? </p>

<p>I agree with your dissertation except with how certain you are about it not being a cure. &quot;<em>absolutely not</em>&quot;. </p>

<p>better said would be &quot;there&#39;s not proof yet of it working <em>in vivo</em>&quot;</p>

<p>People do go off the rocker with <em>in vitro</em> success, and that is wrong, but i personally think that it&#39;s nowhere near the &quot;absolutely not&quot; stage. Everyone is still studying it. </p>

<p>Oh, and my main question to you, you work at a cancer molecular imaging lab, have the people where you work studied THC and CBD? Since it&#39;s a top 5 ranked school, my assumption is probably not.</p>

<p>And, there are many examples of how <strong>Big Pharma</strong> has given doctors incentive to prescribe their medicine. This is a corrupt practice, and has led to misdiagnosis many times. There is a conspiracy there. Maybe not in this case, but to say that it&#39;s ridiculous that big pharma has no corrupt interest is false. lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh absolutely, THC and CBD have been shown to reduce the size of tumors. So have chemicals in ground up dandelions.</p>

<p>My point is, there are numerous chemicals that can reduce the size of tumors and drive cellular apoptosis. Taxol is the most famous. It&#39;s all natural, synthesized from the Pacific Yew tree, and one of the most famous cancer therapies of all time. </p>

<p>We are in absolutely no shortage of drugs that can kill tumorigenic cells: Taxol, Gleevec, doxirubicin, and countless hundreds of drugs can all do it.</p>

<p>The problem is NOT with killing cancer cells. You could kill 95% of the tumor, but if you don&#39;t kill the metastatic cells in the tumor, coincidentally, the hardest to kill, then you&#39;ve done nothing. The cancer will come back in 6 months, and likely metastasize now.</p>

<p>However, the mechanism of why these hard to kill cells are so metastatic, and how these cells acquire their metastatic phenotype from trillions of cells in the original tumor is an ENORMOUS question. </p>

<p>I do not doubt THC&#39;s ability to kill cells, but it&#39;s certainly not solving the problem of metastasis, and that has been, currently is, and will be the biggest question of stopping cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it&#39;s statistically common.</p>

<p>The placebo effect is absolutely impossible to ignore. In light of large sample sizes of meta-studies (studies that collect the results of hundreds of other studies), which can range up to thousands of patients; there will be bound to be some patients that &quot;magically&quot; recover.</p>

<p>In addition, there are different types of cancers varying in their 5 and 10-year mortality rates. Being afflicted with pancreatic cancer, is very much much  worse than having breast or skin cancer (pancreatic cancer has a 10-year mortality rate of 97%). </p>

<p>Even among the same cancer, there are variations in grade and type. For example, MDA-MB-231, MCF-10A, and MCF-7 are all different types of breast cancer. MCF-10A is essentially non-metastatic, MDA-MB-231 is highly metastatic, while MCF-7 is moderately so. A patient with the MCF-10A type could feasibly get away with a quack treatment. Patients that do recover without treatment, will likely attribute their &quot;cure&quot; to either a divine figure or a miracle cure. More likely than not, they&#39;re extremely lucky.</p>

<p>The ultimate proof would be to conduct a metastudy following 10-year survival rate of a homeopathic treatment, compared with a common chemotherapy. You would no doubt see much higher survival rates attributed to chemotherapy.</p>

<p>However, this study, for good reason, will likely never be done. There is not a single doctor in the US I would imagine that would allow a cancer patient to simply undergo homeopathy, it would be ethically akin to allowing someone to die.</p>

<p>What kind of logical fallacies are we arguing here? You cannot definitively state that Glenn Beck DID NOT rape and kill a young girl in 1990.</p>

<p>You can never prove something doesn&#39;t work, you have to prove it does work. THC/CBD has never been shown to reverse metastasis. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its not 5 journals, its more like 150+ different studies. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>150 studies is a drop in the water compared to the last 60 years of cancer research. There are literally tens of thousands of studies on Gleevec, Taxol, and any number of therapeutic drugs that all do the same thing your study purports:</p>

<p>Decrease the size of the tumor and drive apoptosis. Currently there are absolutely &quot;0&quot; drugs that reverse metastasis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of them are in vitro because its currently illegal to do it on live subjects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely not. Drug development happens on live subjects right now. As a matter of fact, our lab is recruiting volunteers to test out a new F18 tracer molecule for PET/CT imaging of the brain (this new molecule penetrates the blood/brain barrier better).</p>

<p>Live subject testing is strictly controlled by the IRB. There is a hierarchy of animals you work through, and if a drug shows promise, can be fast-tracked to human testing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CBD is the answer for stopping metastasis. I think you owe it more credit than you&#39;re giving it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re elevating this plant to godlike status because you like smoking it. Me too, but to say CBD is the &quot;miracle pill&quot; to metastasis is ridiculous. Like I said in my original post, metastasis of cells is caused by many things, it could be hypoxic environments, it could be overexpression of a protein, it could even be because select cancer cells are &quot;cancer stem cells&quot; and give rise to the whole tumor. I don&#39;t know. Nobody does.</p>

<p>The reasons why cells escape their regular cycles of division is hugely complex and the explanations for why are likely just as varied. It would be extremely naive to say a single molecule can stop metastasis and can cure cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting and cool. I love it that it was carried out at my <em>alma mater</em>. The article touches on some important things I mentioned in my original post. Namely:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Almost no one dies from primary ovarian cancer... <strong>You can remove the primary cancer, but the problem is metastasis</strong>. A good deal of the metastasis in ovarian cancer comes from cancer cells sloughing off into the abdominal cavity and spreading the disease that way.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t dream of doing an AMA though. There are tons of people far more qualified and more knowledgeable than I to answer these questions.</p>

<hr/>

<p>My own research interests deal with one possible way of metastatic reversal. To give background, cancer is a disease of phenotypes. What this means is that benign and metastatic tumors all share the same genetic code, but different expressions. The metastatic version of a tumor is a phenotype of the cancer, just like the benign form is also a phenotype. Obviously the million-dollar-question is how you reverse the phenotype from it&#39;s metastatic form, into its benign form.</p>

<p>Well, in recent years, a theory called &quot;tensegrity&quot;, first postulated by Donald Ingber at Harvard University, is gaining popularity. Tensegrity hypothesizes that the differences in phenotype is a result of differences in the extracellular stiffness. </p>

<p>You see, cells take external cues from their microenvironment. Cancer cells grown on stiffer surfaces are far more aggressive than cells grown on soft surfaces. Part of this is thought to arise from physical links from the cellular surface, into the nucleus where expression happens. </p>

<p>The cell can generate greater traction forces on stiff surfaces, so there is a dynamic rebalancing of the cellular cytoskeleton to find it&#39;s &quot;tensional homeostasis&quot;. To put simply, think of a person sleeping on a hardwood floor, as opposed to a person sleeping on a soft bed. The muscles of the person sleeping on the hardwood floor are likely to be more tense. This is what is occuring within the cells.</p>

<p>The big breakthrough in this theory was spurned by a paper called <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16169468">&quot;Tensional Homeostasis and the Malignant Phenotype&quot;</a>, cited over 550 times, this paper showed that in an <em>in vitro</em> environment, tumorigenic cells can be made to reverse their phenotype if there is a change in microenvironment stiffness. </p>

<p>So while the theory is that tissue engineering of the microenvironment will revert back cells from their metastatic phenotype, into their benign form, no therapeutic treatments are possible for this yet, though there is much work into this.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Another popular theory for metastatic reversal is the cancer stem cell theory, which highlights the similarities between cancer cells, and stem cells. </p>

<p>One of the defining moments of metastasis is the EMT, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial-mesenchymal_transition">epithelial-mesenchymal transition</a>. This transition is characterized by high motility, loss of cellular polarity, as well as loss of adhesion proteins such as E-cadherin and laminin.</p>

<p>The reason I bring this up, is because cells after this transition, display remarkable similarities to stem cells, namely, the ability to self-propagate, but also give rise to other cell types (benign, or metastatic cells).</p>

<p>The cancer stem cell theory is such: that the entire tumor is generated from a single aberrant stem cell, a &quot;cancer stem cell&quot; (CSC). Killing the tumor off is no good, if you don&#39;t kill the <em>right</em> cells, in this case, the CSC&#39;s.</p>

<p>This theory is also supported by a certain experimental evidence. Basically, the researchers did flow cytometry (a technique to identify cells with certain surface markers) on a diced up tumors from 8 breast cancer patients.</p>

<p>They found that certain populations of these tumors, were MUCH more tumorigenic than their host populations. They then implanted these cells back into mice, where the cells subsequently seeded and metastasized.</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s where it gets interesting. The researchers took a metastase from one of the mice, and reimplanted it into a new mice. If cancer cells are &quot;inherently&quot; metastatic, then you would expect this metastase to be more aggressive. This was not the case. What this means, is that even a metastatic growth of the tumor was no more metastatic than the original.</p>

<p>However, the researchers then added a population of stem cells, and the tumor metastasized greatly. They hypothesized that through cellular-signaling, that the &quot;CSC&quot; in the tumor were activated, and metastasis occurred.</p>

<p>What they hypothesize, is that to reverse metastasis, the <em>correct</em> cells must be killed, and those lie in the cancer stem cells. Unfortunately, to conclusively prove this theory, you would need to actually find, track, and follow a single cancer stem cell as it proliferates into a tumor. </p>

<p>Literally a needle in a haystack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I call your bullshit.  Why are you wasting your time studying cancer cells if there is no way to stop it?  What you think you are just going to pour some shit in a test tube one day and be  &quot;OMG I FOUND IT!!&quot;  Cancer is just something that will never be cured.  Get over it.  Seriously, THC has been shown to slow it down.  Cancer is just something that any life form that lives a long life will maybe have to deal with.  Look at bugs for example, they dont get cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pot is also a spiritual experience, which science will never measure, look at meditation and yoga... those things can cure a lot as well because our brains are fucking crazy like that and smoking weed only makes your brains even crazier, no one will ever know what really goes on in your body, mind and soul scientifically. If you work with science and you a pothead than how you going to say it doesn&#39;t cure cancer? because there is plenty of people saying it did, isn&#39;t that statistics? then again who cares how or why, it did!!!!! The truth is you can&#39;t say it doesn&#39;t and we can&#39;t say it does. There is just something beyond our understanding. not sure if this will make sense to many but think of it this way.... our brain can do crazy shit, right? so things such as negative thinking, stress, anger, anxiety.... can cause a lot of damage to a physical body even though these are just thoughts, now if you smoke you pretty much let all that go and relax, but most importantly i think we go on some sort of an &quot;auto&quot; pilot which is like the true us that knows what we need and just does it with out consulting it with our retarded conscious minds. thats what i call a cure for all of the cancers and anything else that might be wrong with us. to me science is dead like hip-hop because it&#39;s all about money and not really about helping people with it&#39;s medication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out what point you&#39;re trying to make. There&#39;s no cure for cancer, therefore cannabis is the cure? There&#39;s no cure for cancer, therefore any old shit will work? Make stuff up if you don&#39;t have the answers?</p>

<p>Medical science has gotten substantially better at treating cancer over the years to the point where you have a much, much greater chance of surviving than you did even just a few years ago. We can&#39;t &quot;cure&quot; cancer with a magical pill, but we can kill some cancers in some people by force with chemotherapy, and we can remove tumors with surgery giving people a much better chance of surviving than if they believe in hokum like yoga and magical thinking.</p>

<p>If those things worked, they wouldn&#39;t be alternative medicine, they would be <em>medicine</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the Netherlands, the ministry of health welfare and sport wants to register medicinal cannabis as an ordinary medicine. There was a research among GPs and medical specialists and they found the use of medical cannabis completely acceptable.</p>

<p>According to wikipedia, 3 different types of cannabis are available at the pharmacy. &quot;Bediol granulaat&quot; contains 7.5% cannabidiol and only 6% THC, which means you won&#39;t get &#39;high&#39; very much, and thus making it more suitable to use as a medicine.</p>

<p>However, GPs are only allowed to prescribe medicinal cannabis in a few situations, so patients will go to the coffeeshop instead if they want the weed. So yeah, the researches definitely prove weed has a lot of potential as a medicine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m doubtful of some of the links here, I think of it this way...</p>

<p>There is no logical reason to have cannabis illegal for SO long, with such little progress towards legalization being done (let&#39;s be honest here, the people don&#39;t have control). </p>

<p>It seems to me that the government gives us a bunch of bullshit reasons why it shouldn&#39;t be legalize and finds ways of indoctrinating this propaganda to us at an early age (anyone ever have DARE program in elementary school?) so at a later age even though we see the facts, we still have this feeling that &quot;drugs are bad&quot; and cannabis is included in that term.</p>

<p>So while I&#39;m no scientist, I don&#39;t see it as ridiculous to believe the idea that THC can cure or help people with cancer based on a) the amount of bullshit fronts governments perpetuate and b) the huge effort governments put in to censor people spreading this message.</p>

<p>Something along the lines of, yes it grows quickly and has great fibres. Does not grow very tall/root system does not go as deep as some other crops, so while others take longer to grow, they work out fairly evenly when everything is averaged out over a decent period of time. For a quick turnaround on a crop though, hemp would be very effective. Also the study did not address long term effects on the growth environment, so I&#39;m not sure about sustainability arguments on either side. Just throwing that in</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it&#39;s statistically common.</p>

<p>The placebo effect is absolutely impossible to ignore. In light of large sample sizes of meta-studies (studies that collect the results of hundreds of other studies), which can range up to thousands of patients; there will be bound to be some patients that &quot;magically&quot; recover.</p>

<p>In addition, there are different types of cancers varying in their 5 and 10-year mortality rates. Being afflicted with pancreatic cancer, is very much much  worse than having breast or skin cancer (pancreatic cancer has a 10-year mortality rate of 97%). </p>

<p>Even among the same cancer, there are variations in grade and type. For example, MDA-MB-231, MCF-10A, and MCF-7 are all different types of breast cancer. MCF-10A is essentially non-metastatic, MDA-MB-231 is highly metastatic, while MCF-7 is moderately so. A patient with the MCF-10A type could feasibly get away with a quack treatment. Patients that do recover without treatment, will likely attribute their &quot;cure&quot; to either a divine figure or a miracle cure. More likely than not, they&#39;re extremely lucky.</p>

<p>The ultimate proof would be to conduct a metastudy following 10-year survival rate of a homeopathic treatment, compared with a common chemotherapy. You would no doubt see much higher survival rates attributed to chemotherapy.</p>

<p>However, this study, for good reason, will likely never be done. There is not a single doctor in the US I would imagine that would allow a cancer patient to simply undergo homeopathy, it would be ethically akin to allowing someone to die.</p>
