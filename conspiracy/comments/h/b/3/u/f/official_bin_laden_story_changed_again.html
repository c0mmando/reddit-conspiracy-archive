       First they said there was no footage of the raid because of a 25 minute video blackout of the headcams on the Navy Seals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they're saying it was a 40 minute operation and there is video footage.

       Firstly, that question is for the people to decide and all of your listed substitutes are supported by the present standing government. I can only wonder where we would be if the founding fathers shared your special optimistic enthusiasm.

       Democracy doesn't work well in an insane asylum; and most of the population is ignorant to reality. Yours or mine.  What makes you think a revolution will pave our roads with gold again?  American revoII, besides an tremendous slaughter of our population, would become far more of a philosophical driven civil war and exiling of specific labeled groups out of areas. More freedoms (martial law) would be restricted then they currently are, in order to help keep the peace. If we managed to somehow, bring peace to a war torn nation and hold a legit non-corrupt election without corporate puppet overloards, they
       <strong>
        MIGHT
       </strong>
       have the power to really change things.  So what change does the nation really want? Lower taxes? Less enviro laws? More science funding? Freedom to merge religion and education? Making the teaching of a specific philosophy or religion illegal?  Shutting down the borders, or remaining the country that takes the worlds "tired and hungry" the way we were founded? Do we just want to start from scratch, where our founders made a land where "all men are created equal", but slavery was legal and moral?...  Do you think america can ever agree on a functional non political driven foundation after a century of corporate media has merged &amp; unified while simultaneously dividing us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me futher try to explain why even these crucial questions can even become insignificant post revolution in a corporate oligarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile back to our local communities... If we want to decrease security, we will have to instate re-education camps to insure all americans think alike and do not attempt to get revenge for the perceived murdering of their family members during the war.  By the way this war created more domestic terrorists that murder innocents then we can count, or keep track of.  They are not unified or related cells.
 Our grandparents, parent, freinds, teachers, bosses... will lose their pensions and will lose their homes when the stock market crashes (when the war starts) and probably eat cat food to survive.  Unions and workers rights groups will be disbanded and quality of life for most americans will drop.  Corporations (which are already the most wealthy in the world) will continue to grow wealthier and more powerful due to unrestricted freemarkets. These corporations also create and distribute the worlds weaponry.  Americans will buy from them because they will have the resources and $ to produce at a far cheaper rate then any small buisness ever could compete with.  These corporations will buy or stomp out competition and will probably have no repercussion to re producing and selling what we consider intellectual property today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporate rule, is not better then what we have.  I would be interested to see how you think this reality is avoidable and how america could truely stand as one when most americans think the rest are crazy and "destroying society" with their values and interests.

       I would just like to see an end to this game of
       <strong>
        king of the hill
       </strong>
       all together. We have had to enslave the majority of the world; we’re constantly paranoid and more likely than not am about to be pushed off by the Chinese in a couple of years. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have a problem with our prosperity or freedom* just the fundamentals of the game (king of the hill). I feel a game of kick ball would be more beneficial.

       You do realize that the 'founding fathers' had no idea what the world would be like today and while they did their best to create a system with longevity, they never intended for their choices and decisions to be permanent.
      </p>
      <p>
       That, and some of the founding fathers were actually pretty short-sighted and not all of them are the 'great' super-beings most Americans make them out to be.  Ain't that America.

       Seems to be the obvious explanation. The cameras almost certainly had local storage; a satellite video feed dropping out in the middle of a firefight doesn't seem far fetched, but the video still would have been stored on whatever media the cameras were recording to.

       Since they have not released any recognizable images of Osama, then the only conclusion that can be made is that it was not the real Osama they have killed.  This is reminiscent of the terrorist-mastermind al-Zarqawi. Who was one of the reasons the Bush Administration went to war with Iraq because Saddam gave refuge to al-Zarqawi.  Later the Administration blamed al-Zarqawi for the insurgence in Iraq.  But just like Osama, they were not interested in capturing him alive to get valuable information from him.  Instead they wore making sure he is killed by dropping two five hundred pound bombs on him.

       I wouldn't say it was the only conclusion, but it's not unreasonable. It makes so little sense not to retain the corpse, and not to have it available for independent examination, and not to publish photographs of the corpse.

       they always said that it was a 40 odd minute operation, but the blackout was during the "critical" period. we know they wont release the footage because it will most likely show an unarmed man trying to surrender.

       Guys it's obvious. Osama is very a valuable asset alive. There is no way they would just kill him. I think they want us to think he is dead, so that they can secretly torture him for information about terrorists. Think about it a water burial?!?!?!!? If you look at this knowing they want us to think he's dead, so they can torture him, it all makes sense....

       There was obvious video of it because the President and his staff were watching it live as it happened. But the Military obviously does not want people to see it because it will divulge some intelligence that we might have gathered as well as give away identities of the SEALS and reveal technology we have. And I'm sure they did some shit that we don't know about either.
