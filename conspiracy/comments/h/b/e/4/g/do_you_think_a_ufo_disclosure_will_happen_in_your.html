       So many once-classified files have been released from all sorts of  governmental agencies all across the world, so many sightings as of late, so much discussion and more widespread media coverage - events seem to be building up to
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think? Bullcrap? Or am I not alone?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Or do you think something bigger than a disclosure may happen&gt;

       Disclosure is already happening.  It's been slowly building up for at least 25 years, but it's getting much faster.  I mean, in the past month the NSA and FBI released a load of documents on UFOs, the Disclosure Project is getting national attention, the rate of UFO sightings in global media has skyrocketed, and scifi movies and tv shows have been on the rise for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect disclosure by the end of next year, if not before 2011 closes.

       new world order will stage an alien event i believe to unite the  world under one government. Possibly in 2012 to take advantage of the peoples fears and preconditioned mentality that something will happen.

       Stephen Greer is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to UFO researchers.  Worse than being a horrible researcher he is a fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you like your UFO "information" with a bunch of new age lies and bullshit?  The go ahead and listen to the liar Stephen Greer.  Did you know that he claims to be in constant mental contact with the E.T.s?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you would rather keep your feet on the ground and your head out of the secret moon bases when dealing with this subject then check out the work of Bruce Macabee, Stanton Friedman and James Fox.  Maximum quality research and minimum speculation.

       I've been reading about UFOs since I was in Jr. High School back in the early 80's and my opinion on the subject is that there may be a very small division somewhere in the US government that has the responsibility of documenting the very best cases, but I don't think they have a lot of stunning information to release.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that John Callahan has a lot of credibility on this topic and he said that when some people from the CIA showed up to talk to him they were all excited that they finally had 30 minutes of radar footage to go over...that was in 1987, long after all of the hoopla in the 40's, 50's and 60's over this.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I look at the best documented cases with the most credible witnesses, I come away thinking that no one really knows that much about them.

       Nope.  To what end would the government admit that it has no control over E.T and their motives?  If we have back engineered alien craft and have discovered fantastic technologies why would we disclose that?  The economic effect may be such that we, as a country and as a planet, could never recover in time.

       I hope so, but it doesn't seem likely. The current misinformation campaign being waged by the US is proof positive that our government wants to keep us in the dark. Hats off to the UK, Russia, and Mexico for at least disclosing some of their 'classified' UFO files.

       UFO "disclosure" will
       <em>
        never happen

       The U.S. government has backed themselves into a corner from which they can never escape without major, major repercussions.  It ain't gonna happen that way.

       I've seen many objects in the sky that I can not identify, but I have not jumped to the conclusion that these objects I've seen come from another planet.  Not even dead little green bodies would prove they come from another planet.

       Don't disagree you'll get down voted. Almost as if it were a conspiracy.

       No. Never. Here's why. There are hundreds of trillions of intelligent races in the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       But not a single one will ever travel faster than light. Period. Communication between branes, sure. FTL, zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without FTL, the probability of a visitation is vanishingly small.

       But maybe a civilization will create a Von Neumann swarm? To replicate and make contact?
      </p>
      <p>
       A selfish act because such a civilization could wind up converting a significant amount of the matter in the light cone of their origin into their stupid "contact" probes.

       i dont think you understand how physics work. You don't
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to actually "travel" to get to a point in space. And i seriously don't think you have anywhere near the knowledge to preach what a civilization millions of years ahead of us can or can't do, because chances are very high that they can do whatever the hell they want.

       Oh yeah, I have enough knowledge. Decades of laymen reading on the subject.

       Try reading the Lorentz equations as a starter. This is why FTL is impossible now and forever. For material objects

       Notice what happens when velocities approach c? You do know what c is, right?

       There is no arguing with me. Only accepting science!
