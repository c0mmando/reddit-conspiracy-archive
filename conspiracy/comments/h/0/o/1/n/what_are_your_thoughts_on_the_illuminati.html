        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what to think about this.  I listen to a lot of hip hop and there is all this talk about Illumaniti this and Illuminati that.  There are tons of videos about how these guys supposedly control hip hop and all the Illuminati imagery in videos.</p>

<p>I think that aspect of it is nonsense.  I don&#39;t think there is any one organized group trying to control everything.  I think there are many corporations/elites that keep steering us into different wars for their own financial gain, but I don&#39;t think there is any spooky secret societies running it all.  I think the whole concept of the Illumanti is just a convenient distraction. </p>

<p>What do you think about it?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s frustrating for me, I see my friends constantly watching these videos about the Illuminati, but I bring up real shit like how a lot of oil contracts were decided long before we invaded Iraq and they don&#39;t even flinch.  Very disappointing, the distraction is working.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> After reading the responses it seems a lot of the people who  believe there is actually a group of people behind the scenes controlling everything also believe there is a man in the sky watching everything you do.  Go figure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of a sort of epiphany I had about conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Basically, they can be comforting. It&#39;d be nice to believe that we aren&#39;t just a bunch of idiots flailing around, chasing things as petty as money, willing to endorse things as terrible as Soulja Boi just so some exec can make a dollar. It&#39;d be better if there was this thing behind it, a method to the madness. Everything is calculated, someone&#39;s in control. They may be a heartless and evil dickhead, but they&#39;re still not gonna let shit get out of hand to the point where they no longer control it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost 7 in the morning and I haven&#39;t slept, so I hope that made at least a bit of sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate this crap so much. We have so many enemies in the world right now, so many lies to deal with, and all of them quite tangible. The Illuminati is just a gigantic red herring, if anything, and it continues to be a black mark on any &quot;truth hunter&quot; that reveals him/herself to the public. Look at what is going on in the world today! Increasingly bad gaps in wealth, police corruption, government corruption, etc, all worldwide. No country is safe! Just today I watch a video showing protesters being arrested BEFORE THE PROTEST EVEN BEGINS!</p>

<p>Then! Then you have more than a few lies about the possibility for aliens and other &quot;fringe&quot; ideas. Secrets that are kept to &quot;keep the public calm&quot;, rather than aid in overall human enlightenment. Dusty tomes of &quot;classified&quot; documents that were classified because someone thought they knew better than everyone else.</p>

<p>So just ask yourself, sir, is the Illuminati real? I think we have enough tangible enemies to chase before we start barking up imaginary ones. And yes, I realize your stance on this appears to be the same as mine, but your friends preoccupation with fiction is PRECISELY the point of the Illuminati myth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is plenty of evidence that there are groups which are in the shadows behind the scenes, pulling strings.  I think there&#39;s evidence of multiple groups, sort of like fiefdoms.  Do any of these groups call themselves the &quot;Illuminati&quot; or other popular conspiracy-based names?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  More likely, &quot;Illuminati&quot; is a convenient label for those who are behind the scenes, whose ideologies promote an almost religious lust for power and possibly have power roots going back millennia.  We know there are secret societies from the fact that some fizzle, and some are exposed.  Is it unreasonable to believe there are those which have yet to be?</p>

<p>As for the symbolism, I think it is mixed.  Some of it is very possibly intentional symbolism with nefarious goals.  Almost certainly another portion is just people playing with symbols which they don&#39;t really understand.  I&#39;ve seen the videos showing the hip-hop crap.  I don&#39;t listen to hip-hop but some of the imagery, with its styling, and the consistency of the lyrical themes, suggest that there MAY be something more going on behind the scenes.  Hooray for the culture industry.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, if there IS such a group, or sets of groups, would they not be behind the scenes in the financial system, corporatocracy, and global governmental structures?   It&#39;s not like we&#39;re any more likely to see someone actually go to jail for the Iraq lies than for being a part of a &quot;mythical&quot; elite...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact is, there ARE plenty of groups and individuals &quot;in the shadows&quot;, in the sense that you never hear or will know of them. It happens every day in government, and a sizable amount OF government is kept from public eye. If you want to know who the Illuminati is? It&#39;s the government, regardless of country. It is the indentured slavery we willingly vote ourselves in to every election year, and refuse to dig ourselves out of.</p>

<p>Even worse, particularly in my country (USA), are the laws and the behavior of the enforcement of those laws. If you think police corruption is bad, you should see the raw and unlimited power granted to FBI agents in their respective witch hunts. It doesn&#39;t matter who gets burned, or how illegal the methodology behind the burning is, all that matters to the FBI is that someone gets blamed.</p>

<p>With this in mind, Prowler33, how can you even put a joking stock in &quot;Illuminati&quot;? Everyone in the shadow already has a name, and those without names aren&#39;t super genius evil chess players that plot the destruction of the world for Millennia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This depends on what you&#39;re trying to prove.  As it is, I&#39;m saying that it is possible, which is trivial to prove.  It IS possible.  The burden of proof that it is not ACTUAL is on you.  Incidentally, due to the nature of the topic, you cannot reasonably prove that it is not actual because you cannot gather and present perfect data about everything and everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your terrible grammar aside, you are not entirely wrong. If your assertion is simply &quot;It is possible&quot;, then that is perfectly fine. On the other hand, it is equally cromulent for me to say &quot;it is possible that little green leprechauns dance on the moon when we aren&#39;t looking&quot;. This may let me escape the burden of proof, but it&#39;s the weakest argument you could ever possibly present.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Illuminati worships the Lightbringer aka Lucifer, the one who fell to Earth at pre-flood times. He reigned on Earth along with the other Nephilim for an eon, but his civilization was wiped out when God grew tired of mankind&#39;s evil. The Nephilim had corrupted the human race with their seed.</p>

<p>Now, as you see all the pre-conditioning for the modern-day public&#39;s first contact with alien life, thousands of UFO sightings, all the hype in the media, it is only a matter of time until the morning star, Lucifer, comes back to claim his throne as the beast out of the sea.</p>

<p>When I refer to the OWO, I am not referring to the present world order, but the one that existed years ago.</p>

<p>In contemporary mythology, the Illuminati have been branded as the puppetmasters who stand behind the establishment, pulling the strings, orchestrating the enslavement of the people of the world. The opposite is true. <strong>The Illuminati have always led the resistance against the tyrants</strong>. On occasions, they have come tantalisingly close to success, but mostly they have endured catastrophic defeats. They have tried to infiltrate the establishment, tried Trojan Horse strategies, guerrilla tactics and popular uprisings, tried to win the intellectual and religious debate, tried to subvert and undermine the establishment. Most attempts have ended in disaster, with the establishment unmolested and more powerful than ever. But it is never acceptable to surrender or abandon the struggle.</p>

<p>Too many people retreat into their micro-worlds of petty comforts where they pose no threat to the establishment, and that&#39;s exactly what the establishment desire - our compliance and obedience, our refusal to stand up to them. The game of the establishment is nothing new. It was explicitly set out in Machiavelli&#39;s The Prince, which baldly states the unscrupulous principles of how those with power should hold onto it. Lying, cheating, brutality, cruelty, pitilessness, inspiring fear and terror, breaking solemn oaths, hypocrisy, greed, bribery and corruption, extermination of rivals, making pacts with your enemies only to break them when it suits you, are all advocated as necessary tools. This behaviour is still on display every day from every government on earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thisis actually close to what I think. There are several groups, some on the side of elites and their plans and a few on the side of the people (or at least in opposing the other societies for human betterment or their own control). I think multiple groups vying for control (whether most be malevolent and some benevolent) makes more sense than a singular group bringing elites together with one goal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My honest opinion is that the Illuminati does not exist. Sure, there are probably a small group of individuals calling themselves the &quot;Illuminati&quot; -- people can call themselves anything. For example, some people call themselves Nazis, even though the Nazi Party was abolished in 1945. But calling yourself something doesn&#39;t mean that others should take you seriously. The idea that the Illuminati are a powerful group of wealthy men who control the destinies of nations is absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Illuminati is very real and is just as it is portrayed.</p>

<p>All over the globe high level intelligence people, political puppets and international bankers are working together to create a more integrated world.</p>

<p>It has the power it has because it is working to a larger agenda that outstrips the needs of any one man or country. It does not operate within the restrictions of boarders, race, or religion.</p>

<p>Do your research on the Royal Institute of International Affairs which was a primary think tank that put together a Anglo Saxon pact to go forward and and build a one world government.</p>

<p>People should embrace it. It would be easier if they just went ahead and reduced the population before establishing the New World Order.</p>

<p>Order which is being built out of chaos and ideology shifting false flag operations.</p>

<p>It wishes to remain unknown and likes being called a conspiracy theory which it can hide behind.</p>
