       Let me reiterate that this is not an attack on your beliefs - some of which I surely share - but an honest question that I often ask my friends and people I meet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it entirely possible that most of what you think are conspiracies are just, without a better word, accidents or coincidences? That maybe there really is no one at the top thinking deeply about these things? That you actually give too much credit to the people supposedly running the show and instead of being conniving they're actually bumbling or just haven't had the time to think through an inefficient or strange policy?
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, I'm a journalist and get a lot of emails from people asserting that my news organization and myself are part of a media conspiracy or that our coverage of an event is part of cover-up or, alternately, a plan to bring down whatever we were reporting on. These emails are elaborate, they have applied a motive, asserted how we might have done this and then say I shouldn't bother to reply because it would simply be a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if the reason we didn't cover something that day was as simple as two people in the newsroom called in sick and we had other assignments we thought were more important? Or that, no, we never had a giant editorial board meeting where we talked about how to play up a story to trick the masses but instead just told our editors what stories we think our readers and viewers would be most interested in?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if that video on r/conspiracy about the police turning away reporters at a mile from the makeshift morgue in Joplin was really only because the people trying to identify the bodies know that a lot of people would show up if they let anyone in and they're already understaffed and having a hard time doing the job?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need an answer for that specific case, but I'm curious about what you think of that bigger picture option I presented.

       Depends on the nature of the 'conspiracy'.
      </p>
      <p>
       A one-time event - a la the morgue at Joplin - yes, very likely over-stressed cops. A story that didn't make it to the front page, yes co-worker was out sick.

       Sometimes it simply goes beyond the point of being acceptable as a "coincidence".  For example, this video of insider trading before 9/11.  The chances of a coincidence are astronomical.

       It is as possible for a conspiracy to be true as it is for it to be untrue. I think some exit and some are just over active imaginations. People like conspiracy theories, I think it's like a real life mystery that cures boredom or is something to get people thinking of possibilities. I think we should question just about everything...but some people turn everything around to be some big juicy gossip story instead of finding true answers.

       Chip, its so obvious what going on right now is a cover up by every major news outlet. 
Take Fukishima, if you would have talked to any nuke plant employee, he/she would have told you major lies were being told from day one. I guess over 100 lies have been told on that story.

       Again, you give people too much credit. It's stupidity and laziness, not malice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing people who work for those major news outlets, most of the more reputable ones would kill one another to get a controversial scoop. My guess is that their reporters are either lazy or, more likely, can't get someone to go on the record and talk about these things. So many times you'd be amazed at how afraid people are to talk to reporters about even minor incidents. It also wouldn't surprise me to learn that CNN was too cheap to hire a translator or to send a producer to where plant employees live.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, for what it's worth, one of my best friends, someone I've been close with for probably 20 years, is an high-level engineer at a nuclear power plant. Whenever something nuclear-related happens, I get his take on the coverage. His assessment is that the reporting has been terrible in the sense that none of the reporters has been able to get even the littlest detail fully accurate and that much of what is being said is a scare-tactic meant to draw in viewers. Nancy Grace and her fresh-out-of-college assistant producers don't know anything about the nuclear industry or the manner in which a plant or radiation actually works. (As I mentioned in another response, don't let major cable TV journalists give the other 99 percent of us a bad name).

       It's obvious that the situation at Fukushima was
       <em>
        much worse
       </em>
       than that originally reported, and here you are saying that all reporting has been "scare tactics".

       1) They would kill each other to get the scoop... if they were applying themselves enough to realize there was one. They're not online reading what other people are writing about this stuff.

       2) He thinks the news is focusing on all the wrong things. When they talk about technical stuff, they get all the terms wrong. And then they spend all their time talking about how this is going to make cows in Los Angeles grow fifth legs or something. They're getting the details wrong and they're taking the things that aren't important or dangerous and making them so.

       If you are what you say you are, a journalist, wich i doubt, don't act like you dont get orders from higher up of your corporate hierarchy. If you dont, then im guessing you are working in a really small and irrelevant media outlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tell you this right now and it is a fact. People in media are told what to do and what to report and if you are arguing with that then
       <strong>
        you are lying

       1) That part about my friend is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I work at a mid-sized regional newspaper right now, but I've written for national publications and wire services. The people who work at the NYT and BBC, etc., account for about 1 percent of all journalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Really, I don't get orders from higher-ups. Every morning I go to work, begin working on what I think the biggest stories on my beat are. Mid-morning I meet with my editor to discuss what I'm working on so he has an idea, and I get back to work. People at every news organization I have ever worked for are vociferously independent, and even the lowest editor on the chain would probably lose his job over exposing it if a higher-up came in and told him not only what to cover but the angle that needed to be taken.

       It is entirely possible.  Though, I see a lot of the real stuff lumped together with the crazy off the wall stuff and so it all gets lost in the mix.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are real issues though, it does happen as history shows.  There are efforts to distract the public and focus attention on anything except the goal of some very rich and powerful people.

       However,
       <em>
        somebody

       You should be getting out there and getting the dirty on what's happening in politics, but all you guys seem to do is self-censorship, regurgitate press releases, and tell us what Paris Hilton's bum is doing this weekend.

       In the USA, I believe that journalists will not report

       they get told "off the record".

       I never said someone should look into these things, and I never said I didn't agree that some things are in fact conspiracies put together by people with some very strange and well-hidden motives. Most of the bits of corruption or inappropriate government behavior I uncover and report on are actually just a result of people's negligence or a stupid oversight, not the kind of malice so many people believe is at play. That's exactly how I came to the viewpoint that led me to my original question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now please don't blame me - an actual hard-working, ethical journalist - for what the 1 percent of us who make onto cable TV do or what those who write for celebrity gossip magazines do. For every one of those fools reporting on Paris Hilton, there are 500 real reporters doing good work in reporting on real problems in local governments and public safety. It's those cable-TV idiots you remember, though, because they're piped into everyone's home each night. And remember, they wouldn't be reporting on Paris Hilton if media consumers didn't buy it, so blame the person sitting next to you on the train home before you blame me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And per your "off the record" mention, I'll tell you what just about 99 percent of all actual newspaper journalists do when someone specifies something is off the record. 1) They say, "No, you just gave me this info. I don't do off the record interviews." 2) If they refuse to be named as a source, you take their info and you track down another source to verify it instead. 3) You could just name the original person as a source if you're ready to burn that bridge, but if you think someone else will verify it, that might be better if you plan on retaining them as a source in the future. But really, most reporters I've worked with go to great lengths to convince someone to go on the record or find someone who will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, let me point out a misconception that drives me insane. People always say things like, "Instead of reporting on this minor local issue, why don't you uncover what really happened on 9/11?" Well, that's because the editors at the newspaper that puts a check in my bank every two weeks know that we don't have the money to send me on some giant fact-finding mission when doggedly reporting on local news is our niche. If you want someone to do that, talk to someone at a place with the resources of the New York Times. Better yet, do it yourself. My only special skill is my ability to write. A journalist isn't someone who has some magical power, it's anyone with the time and energy to make some phone calls and do some footwork.

       I am speaking a little under false pretenses, as I'm actually living in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do get the impression that the media in the UK and Australia are a little less deferential to those in power, and are capable of asking hard questions to power.

       I think that really goes to reinforce the point I am trying to make: why is it so common for politicians to go "off the record", and why do journalists allow it?  The impression I have is that journalists feel some kind of kudos to be "in the loop", but in reality are betraying their customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If all journalists had integrity, then "burning bridges" would not be a threat.

       Sure, but it's amazingly clear that journalists in the USA are
       <em>
        not asking the correct questions
       </em>
       , even in interview situations.  Why not ask Obama, straight out, what ten years in Afghanistan has accomplished?  Why not challenge him on the bullshit story that the USA is in Afghanistan to fight terrorism?  Why not begin reporting on the healthcare debate in an honest way, and stop pandering to drug companies and the corporate tea-partyists?
      </p>
      <p>
       While Australia is not perfect, we're not in the jam that the USA is, and I believe that people like yourself are partially responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no wonder that conspiracy theories thrive in such an atmosphere, because the media
       <em>
        are not asking the questions that have to be asked
       </em>
       .

       TV journalists in the USA are not asking tough questions. There's lots of good journalism going on, mostly in newspapers and long-form magazine pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
       The off the record thing is more about retaining a source. If your job is to cover Congress and there's controversial issue, you may only have one source. And if he doesn't want to be named as the person leaking it and you hope to continue using him as a source, you take what he told you and find a different path to prove it, whether that be confronting someone else with the info or knowing where to look in the official documents. The second you burn that bridge, that guy will never talk to you again and he was your only source. Good luck getting any info now. Keep in mind that getting something off the record is different than not reporting it at all and that having integrity in the eyes of your readers doesn't mean a source is going to talk to you ever again. And most newspapers will not use unnamed sources for stories. Places like the New York Times are unique in that they bend a lot of ethical rules other journalists at small papers wouldn't.

       My big beef with the NY Times is not the ethical rules which it bends.  It's the fact that it's a so-called liberal rag that was gung-ho about going to war.

       In that Joplin situation I would put my money on the coroner or police chief running the thing told them not to let anyone in because they are inundated with around-the-clock work and don't want to have people poking around and making it worse. What's so hard to believe about that? Isn't the simplest solution at least often the most likely to be the best?

       "we had other assignments we thought were more important?"
Problem is right there buddy, those assignments are more important to who?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is important to the people and what is important to the elitist corporations are two very different things. And it has been demonstrated without a shadow of a doubt which side the mainstream media serves. Look at what the media did to Michael Jackson, or at the Waco massacres or Sinéad O'Connor after she tore a picture of the pope in half saying fight the real enemy. Absolutely dishonest coverage and EVIL intent... They are definitely not reliable sources of information at best and treasonous at worse. Call it a conspiracy if you want but it doesn't change the fact that those things happened and are continuing to happen. When they do cover an important issue like a massive protest, they spin it to promote the perspective of the government and the opposition's views are silenced, distorted and ridiculed. They never look at the points the protesters bring against what government does and when they do they interview a fake protestor to make protestors look like stupid angry anarchist troublemakers and don't tell me they never fake news:

       The only reason he's using an example of 20 years ago is because it's proven.  If someone used a more recent clip and said something is wrong with it, there'd be cries for 100% absolute proof.  The proof is there in history, and history repeats itself my friend.  Everything is a cycle.  Even if it happened 1000 years ago, it will still happen again.

       My point was that when most people think of journalists, they think of Fox News and TMZ. Those people represent about 1 percent of journalists. There are great journalists working all over the country. Go to the Pulitzer website and look at the stories that won the public service awards. That's what most other journalists aspire to be like, not the ones who ever have to write a story about Michael Jackson or Sinead O'Connor.

       It is related, Michael Jackson was one of the greatest American patriot and activist we'll likely see in our lifetime. He fought for the people and was silenced. Michael Jackson's story is complete and in the public record. Researching this man's life exposes everything that's wrong with the media. Michael was the greatest ambassador for the "real" USA; preaching equality, freedom and harmony all over the world and he walked his talk. He's done nothing but good in the world yet the media persecuted him relentlessly. Seriously, research this guy, pay attention to what he said, did and stood for then compare that to the media reports about him and you'll see just how diabolical it is. Michael was the most popular man on the planet, very influential and he was challenging the power that be very successfully. Pay close attention to the lyrics in his songs.

       Here Michael PROVED that the media manipulate the truth:

       Just saying you are a journalist doesn't give us much info. There is no doubt that there is a "conspiracy" at the highest levels of Fox News to influence their unfortunate audience in a certain way. Yes, it is about ratings but there is also a worldview being expressed. Same goes for the other bigs, just not in quite such an obvious way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that people tend to overestimate the powers that be. There are very powerful people who have conglomerated into very powerful groups, and if you understand this fact you can't help but giggle when you hear about Bill Gates "The Worlds Richest Man". These groups push their own agendas and compete with each other but also share common interests and come together when it counts. I think this is where people have derived their notions of a singular, invincible new world order that pulls all the strings. This is a dramatic, addictive notion, but it's also a naive oversimplification.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in many ways slaves. I won't get into the specifics here, but it is true that they live and we sleep. This is undeniable to those who have awoken to it. But at the end of the day it's the same business-as-usual that we see playing out at the corporate level, just on a much larger scale. The people at the top, as corporations can be perceived, are simply sociopaths lacking any empathy for their fellow man.

       You make a good point.  I think with the little things, like your example, there could totally be coincidences.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the more you study the occult or secret societies though, and find all the related symbols and track records of corporations and key figures, the revolving doors, the economic and military climates of our world and our governments -there is no coincidence for me.

       Factions will fight with other factions, yes, but there is definitely a ruling plutocracy with hidden agendas of world domination that go back as far as ancient Egypt and the Cult of Aton.  That's what I believe.  I know it sounds crazy, but George Costanza says it best:  "It's like an onion, the more layers you peal...  The more it stinks.

       Fucking hell Chip, what is the point in you starting this thread?  You're using this as a forum to put a certain point of view across which is fine, except you've tried to dress it as a question in your OP.  You may think that you can put across the idea that those at the top of society are bumbling idiots and unable to conspire  but you're omitting just how far Western society has advanced in the last one hundred years.  Do you think this happened because of bumbling idiots?  There are obviously far superior intelligences to you that hold the power.  You're either trolling, shilling or uninformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest I think that the bumbling idiot is a bit closer to home, you come in here with your insider knowledge but you're getting destroyed, surely you can do better?

       Both of these (somewhat oddly worded) sentences suggest that
       <em>

       some conspiracies you believe in. Perhaps you'd like to share your thoughts on those?

       And you doubly can't be trolling us if this friendly little question -- not an attack! -- is one that you ask your friends AND people you meet.

       I'm not trolling. I have a lot of friends who are very involved in running alternative libraries, independent bookstores, different styles of local reporting on DIY news sites, etc. I grew up with some of them and have spent countless hours engaging them in conversations about this same topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the government has a lot of unlisted spying rules they use to monitor what we do; I believe they do it without laws anyway; I believe the government plants news stories with cable TV news companies; I believe we were knowingly led to war in the Middle East under false pretenses (many, many times over many years); I believe many of our government leaders are getting far more kickbacks from big companies than we even could guess at.... I could go on, but you probably get the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then a lot of stuff I also think is just people searching too hard for a motive when in reality it's just a coincidence or the result of people being lazy or inefficient.

       I'm just saying that maybe not EVERYTHING is a conspiracy and that maybe people should require a little bit of solid evidence and unbiased testimony before jumping to conclusions and spreading them as truth. Some of the things I read on r/conspiracy just make me roll my eyes, and like I said, even I get emails about being part of some media coverup conspiracy myself. Sometimes the simplest explanation really is true: businesses and governments are giant machines with inefficient parts that unfortunately fuck things up sometimes, and it may turn out it's not always by intention.
