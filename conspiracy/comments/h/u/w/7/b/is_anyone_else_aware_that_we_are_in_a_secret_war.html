It is more than obvious that there is a bed of oil in Somalia that is worth securing. Just look at Chinese oil derricks in Ethiopia, they go all the way to the border with Somalia and then end abruptly, that&#39;s no geographical coincidence, not only that, but Italian and British colonialists reported seeing oil seeps. The US refuses to allow the successful northwestern parts of Somalia to create their own country and abandon the rest of the archaic state. It would even seem that &quot;Somali pirates&quot; are our shoe-in to justify any acts there. What do you think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. We hit Somalia already- 1993. We had every opportunity to do everything we needed to do. We fucked around and changed the ROE, we absolved ourselves of the command and before it was said and done, we had pilot paraded through the streets- we could have trumped that shit up to infinity had there been any political will to do so. While that was going on- 850,000 people were getting murdered to death and all we did there was evacuate an embassy- there&#39;s nothing in Somalia worth a war. If the chinese have dirks on the border- you can bet your sweet ass they&#39;re cross drilling- no regulation- no police- no oversight and enough money to buy compliance from whatever warlord controls that sector for that week- </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Southern Somalia is undoubtedly a fucking shithole, but northwestern Somalia has prosperous cities like Xingalool where people have actually used anarchy to their benefit and have succeeded in turning it into a safe and modern place to live.

<p>This place? Yes. They recently built a hospital! </p>

<p>Seriously though, it isn&#39;t in the interest of the west to allow stable democratic states to develop. This is another version of Iraq where the national borders were drawn in ways to ensure decades of tribal/racial/religious tension. A stable nation could challenge the interests of the west. That&#39;s why we&#39;ll never have a Kurdish Iraqi state either. Folks in the west get our jollies from idiots believing in our maps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A hospital may not be much to us, but the fact that a <em>new hospital</em> was built in <em>Somalia</em>, should not be overlooked in the least. The only image we have been given of this country is Mogadishu, and the rest of it is devoid of life. These people could get some foreign investor, or put aside some money for a single oil derrick and be on their way to bigger things, but yes, realistically, it&#39;ll never, ever, ever be allowed. The moment these people get free healthcare, farmland and an education, they&#39;ll be bombed into oblivion.</p>
