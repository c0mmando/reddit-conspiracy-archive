       We are backing coalition forces in Somalia and there is still a Conoco headquarters in Mogadishu. It is more than obvious that there is a bed of oil in Somalia that is worth securing. Just look at Chinese oil derricks in Ethiopia, they go all the way to the border with Somalia and then end abruptly, that's no geographical coincidence, not only that, but Italian and British colonialists reported seeing oil seeps. The US refuses to allow the successful northwestern parts of Somalia to create their own country and abandon the rest of the archaic state. It would even seem that "Somali pirates" are our shoe-in to justify any acts there. What do you think

       Well, the piracy thing is due to Western countries dumping nuclear waste in their fishing grounds. The Tribes we're supporting in 'Dishu aren't really doing too well to be quite honest.

       No. We hit Somalia already- 1993. We had every opportunity to do everything we needed to do. We fucked around and changed the ROE, we absolved ourselves of the command and before it was said and done, we had pilot paraded through the streets- we could have trumped that shit up to infinity had there been any political will to do so. While that was going on- 850,000 people were getting murdered to death and all we did there was evacuate an embassy- there's nothing in Somalia worth a war. If the chinese have dirks on the border- you can bet your sweet ass they're cross drilling- no regulation- no police- no oversight and enough money to buy compliance from whatever warlord controls that sector for that week-

       I definitely believe we could be at war with any sort of up and coming government. The last thing that the west would want is for those people to rise up, create a government, and utilize their own oil fields.

       They are decades upon decades away from being able to do that though. The only reason an oil infrastructure exists is because we put it there. My friend went to Somalia as a marine and he compared it to the stone age.

       Southern Somalia is undoubtedly a fucking shithole, but northwestern Somalia has prosperous cities like Xingalool where people have actually used anarchy to their benefit and have succeeded in turning it into a safe and modern place to live. The peoples of northwestern Somalia could definitely build a few oil derricks, but the west is making it impossible for them to break off into a seperate state.

       This place? Yes. They recently built a hospital!

       Seriously though, it isn't in the interest of the west to allow stable democratic states to develop. This is another version of Iraq where the national borders were drawn in ways to ensure decades of tribal/racial/religious tension. A stable nation could challenge the interests of the west. That's why we'll never have a Kurdish Iraqi state either. Folks in the west get our jollies from idiots believing in our maps.

       A hospital may not be much to us, but the fact that a
       <em>
        new hospital
       </em>
       was built in
       <em>
        Somalia
       </em>
       , should not be overlooked in the least. The only image we have been given of this country is Mogadishu, and the rest of it is devoid of life. These people could get some foreign investor, or put aside some money for a single oil derrick and be on their way to bigger things, but yes, realistically, it'll never, ever, ever be allowed. The moment these people get free healthcare, farmland and an education, they'll be bombed into oblivion.

       Somalia's a perfect example of a place where the U.S. could very realistically help to spread "freedom." Unfortunately, we never help anyone anymore. I wish the U.S. had a viable export outside of crushing popular democracy and aiding corporations. Just once I'd like to see us use our military might for some good.
