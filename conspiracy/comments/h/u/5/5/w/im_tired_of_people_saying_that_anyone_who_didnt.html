       Americans can get arrested for engaging in peaceful protest, dancing at public events, or using video equipment.  When cuffed, you might get beaten or even shot in the back.  The thugs who accosted you will cover eachothers' asses, and might get a paid vacation as punishment.

       So come on, armchair Nazi-slayers.  Take up arms against the Gestapo.  Let's see it.  What?  This is different?  If you say so.  I suppose you think Gitmo is the only facility of its kind, too.

       Well, there you go. The Nazis were judged harshly after WW2, not because of what they did, but because of who they did it to. Should the soldiers who were only following orders, and could not have disobeyed those orders without being shot, have been punished with prison or execution? No. Right now, Israelis are doing similar criminal acts, but nobody is punishing them. American soldiers and the CIA are doing similar acts, but nobody is punishing them. American and Israeli politicians are ordering such crimes to be committed, and nobody is punishing them. It was pure hypocrisy to say that "I was just following orders" is no excuse. Of course it is an excuse. They would have been shot had they not followed orders. The Jews in the concentration camps who helped the Nazis did it to stay alive themselves. Nobody is going after them, trying to identify them, expose them, or get them executed. Why? Because they were Jews. Not because of what they did, but because of who they are. The victors aways rewrite history to suit themselves.

       I lurk this sub a lot and see a lot of subtle to incredibly blatant antisemitism. I'm not too keen on all of this, but Jews and Zionists are two different things, right?

       No, they are not the same thing, but most Zionists are Jews. How could it be otherwise,when the central theme of Zionism is a Jewish homeland? The majority of Jews want a Jewish homeland, Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard it said that many Fundamentalist Christians are Zionists, but I don't buy this myself. They may be supporters of Israel, for religious reasons, but this in itself is not the same as Zionism, which is a philosophy of Jewish supremacy through militancy. Let me write that again:
       <em>
        Zionism is a philosophy of Jewish supremacy through militancy.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt most Christian Fundamentalists would agree that Jews have a right to enforce their authority over other lesser races through force of arms. Because if they did agree to this, they would be agreeing that Jews are superior to Christians, and should rightfully be ruling Christians.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be unnecessary to add that merely talking about Jews, Israel, Zionism, or the Holocaust does not constitute anti-Semitism, although many Zionists would love to make this linkage unbreakable, because it would serve to silence their critics. But this idea that anyone who discusses Zionism in anything but the most fawning terms must be a racist is childish. It's tiresome to even have to refute it.

       So most Zionists are Jews, but not all Jews are Zionists. Why are they so often used interchangably? I despise all religions as much as any other guy, but there's just a lot of racism (towards Jews, not Zionists) in this board.

       In most cases here, "Zionist" is applied to anyone and everyone who is Jewish - with the only reason for calling them "Zionist" being that since they're Jewish, they're obviously "Zionist".
      </p>
      <p>
       The two words are absolutely interchangable as used here, while letting the user pretend that they're not antisemitic.  The only people they're fooling are complete morons, but then that sums up their core audience of friends.

       The only reason you see everyone being so butch when talking about Hitler is, because he's already dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then they prance around oblivious to atrocities like the war on drugs and the war on terror, very nearly mindless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most simple way of putting it is that a society so detached from the horrors it commits cannot possibly persist for very long.  The exit from civilization we're watching happen in Israel is going to happen to America too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's particularly tragic too in the case of America since the people who created the country laid it all out for us.  We should know better.

       I've heard this a number of times; however, the one that I hear quite often (and in the media recently) was very similar regarding Muslims - if Islam is such a peace-loving religion why don't the non-radical members of the Islamic faith speak out/stand up against those who are violent.

       well, GDI advanced protection solutions went tits-up in 2009 (and they blame ME for that for quitting during a crucial time...i kind of hope i DID ruin them, they lost a HUGE Exxon contract and were blacklisted)
we built FULLY LETHAL security perimeters for 'mini gitmos' in west texas, AZ, CA....i can't remember the rest. They were run by "Homeland Security" (mall cops with guns), TSA agents (wal-mart greeters with badges), FEMA (not good enough for the ATF/FBI) and Northcom. 
Oh, and they're by no means empty.

       It helps that the term czar came into common use by the media to refer to appointed executive branch officials, back in 1930s and '40s.  Back when the Soviets were our allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       (You could also count Bernard Baruch, who Woodrow Wilson appointed to run the War Industries Board in World War I.  This position was sometimes dubbed the "industry czar".  Russia still had an actual Czar, at least for a few more months.)

       Hitler’s freedom from International Debt Slavery
      </p>
      <p>
       It is always difficult to have a discussion on the topic of WW II Germany, and Hitler, without having emotions run high.And Understandably so. We do not believe that there is a world plot in place by those of the Jewish faith to dominate the world. We do however suspect that there is a plot in place by the major financiers and financial institutions, to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       History is written by the victors” - W. Churchill
      </p>
      <p>
       An interesting perspective on World War II, and the players involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people take joy in saying Wall Street and Jewish bankers “financed Hitler.” There is plenty of documented evidence that Wall Street and Jewish bankers did indeed help finance Hitler at first, partly because it allowed the bankers to get rich (as I will describe below) and partly in order to control Stalin. However, when Germany broke free from the bankers, the bankers declared a world war against Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we look at all the facts, the charge that “Jews financed Hitler” becomes irrelevant. Los Angeles Attorney Ellen Brown discusses this topic in her book Web of Debt…
      </p>
      <p>
       When Hitler came to power, Germany was hopelessly broke. The Treaty of Versailles had imposed crushing reparations on the German people, demanding that Germans repay every nation’s costs of the war. These costs totaled three times the value of all the property in Germany. Private currency speculators caused the German mark to plummet, precipitating one of the worst runaway inflations in modern times. A wheelbarrow full of 100 billion-mark banknotes could not buy a loaf of bread. The national treasury was empty. Countless homes and farms were lost to speculators and to private banks. Germans lived in hovels. They were starving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing like this had ever happened before - the total destruction of the national currency, plus the wiping out of people’s savings and businesses. On top of this came a global depression. Germany had no choice but to succumb to debt slavery under international bankers until 1933, when the National Socialists came to power.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point the German government thwarted the international banking cartels by issuing its own money. World Jewry responded by declaring a global boycott against Germany. Hitler began a national credit program by devising a plan of public works that included flood control, repair of public buildings and private residences, and construction of new roads, bridges, canals, and port facilities. All these were paid for with money that no longer came from the private international bankers.

       Well, honestly if there was a militia or a group of 'rebels' i'd join up.  If I just go out shooting people then it wouldn't make a difference i'd sit in jail for 25 to life.  But I would join a resistance group.  And the Americans aren't burning millions in ovens.

       A big upvote. We are letting the Government get away with death penalty crimes in our names. From Bush/Cheney to the current administration we are guilty of war crimes and of selling  the common man into perpetual sevitude to the criminal banks.

       Its different cause the Nazis lost ww2 and the German people wanted/ needed a scapegoat so they pick Hitler and the Nazi party. Because thats the thing: You keep saying "Nazi Party" but the reality it was and always will be the German people who whole heartily agreed and supported them. It was only after the fact when stuff like the holocaust came to light were the German people "Brainwashed" into believing the Nazi ideal even though if you look at comparatively the Russians and US were just as bad when it came to war crimes. Except the thing is they never lost, and as such winners get to set whats "moral". Like for example lets say the axis won ww2 after the US dropped the nuclear bombs: Truman would have been
       <em>
        executed
       </em>
       as a war criminal and nuclear weaponry banned until the Axis could figure it out themselves.
      </p>

       My point is that you have some grand illusion that "america" was "good" at some point or that in some time in history that protest could be met with open arms despite the loss of property values and laws being broken. Arrested?  The American government has killed protesters since its inception. So has the British, so have the Russians so have, etc. Besides that "armchair Nazi slayers" are probably your typical red blooded American who buys into the whole nationalism speil. Thus they would hate "peaceful" protests that oppose their glorious American government.

       The Holocaust is such an imprecise term, meaning one thing to one person and another thing to another person, that the statement that it happened, or did not happen, is more or less meaningless. Which events? Which sets of events? Which peoples? Which locations? Which years? Of course, some enthusiastic person will rush forth with an exact definition of THE HOLOCAUST, but the trouble is, not evenyone knows his definition or accepts it, or is limited by it. Talking about "the Holocaust" is like talking about God. Which God? Your God or my God?

      <p>
       The Pharisees caused their own people to be gassed in the millions during WW2, the gassings were selective, only some Jews were gassed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Witness Moshe Dyan Kaplan’s testimony re his Amsterdam family emerging unscathed, his claim to be a Pharisee, and his contempt for those Jews who were gassed, Cheesies he called them.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He was a pilot who had served in the RAAF in WW2, who had known Bomber Harris the British commander of the air raid on Dresden in 1945, and had flown on that mission.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the war he had flown Lockheed Electra’s, for KLM in Holland and for Lufthansa, he was the son of a well established Jewish family, with antecedents in Johannesburg South Africa, in Amsterdam, and in Western Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later he was a pilot in New Guinea and dabbled in pawnbroking, he was the image of the actor who played Emmanuel Goldstein, in Michael Radford’s 1984 movie 1984, starring John Hurt and Richard Burton.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When I confronted him with that, and asked him how Radford had obtained the footage, and under what circumstances it had been shot, he was unforthcoming and seemed amused .. he said that after the war he returned to Amsterdam, and took up where he had left off before hostilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       My response was that it must have been heart rending to go back to his European residence, which must have been empty rooms and deserted halls, since Hitler’s men had their way, he said no, that it was good, I said sure, but what about all his friends and rellies..
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He said they were fine .. I said that they could not have been fine, since Hitler had the whole lot of them rounded up and sent to Auschwitz.
       </p>
       <p>
        Indeed The Diary of Anne Frank, a tale of oppression of Jews by the Nazi’s was set in Amsterdam, and Stanley Kramer’s great movie Ship of Fools, based on the true story of Jews fleeing the Nazi’s,
       </p>
       <p>
        Had its culmination in that city where the ship finally docked, after being turned away from Havana Cuba and from New York, the passengers themselves speedily transported to Auschwitz, gas and death.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Moshe nodded sagely, he said that my understanding of the Jews was not all that it might be, he told me that he was indeed a Pharisee, and that the Jews of Amsterdam, as depicted for instance in The Diary of Anne Frank, were although Jews, not in the same category as him.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were he told me, called Cheesies, since their diet consisted largely of that product, and yes they were missing from the community, and that was because they had indeed been gassed .. he gave me to understand that as far as he was concerned, they were neither missed nor mourned.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Look then at The Holocaust as being a collaboration of high ranking Pharisee Jews, who provided the finance, the uniforms and the marching songs, and the Nazi’s who would do the dirty work.
       </p>
       <p>
        To reduce the number of those Jews who might, if they had the numbers, declare the day of the Pharisee at an end, and to clean up any racial minority or dissident group who were perceived as a threat, or were seen as capable of being a threat, some time in the future.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Thus the commo’s, pamphleteers, whacko’s, crazies, and the lunatic fringe were all bundled in with the Cheesies, Gypsies, Russians and Poles and in Hitler’s words exterminated.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After each phase of dirty work proceeded in a master plan devised by the Pharisees, the thugs that had carried the dirty deeds were themselves murdered.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ernst Rohm, murdered with numerous of his thug mates in The Night of the Long Knives massacre in June 1934, was leader of the thug SA movement, the bully boys who did the hands on jobs of thuggery, the scabs of their day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Witness the 1929 murder of numerous members of the Gasfitters Union in Germany, deeds that were done to empower the Nazi’s, after they had emerged as a political force with Hitler at their helm, in the late 1920’s.
       </p>
       <p>
        Murdering, bashing, extorting, and thugging their way along until the Nazi’s were the dominant political force, gaining absolute power in 1933.
       </p>

       Then witness the testimony of a Jewish lady from Budapest, arrested in 1944 by a Jew member of Horsha, the Hungarian thug police, and deported to Auschwitz.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was the only member of her family to survive that place, and as a resident of Sydney in the 1990’s told 60 Minutes reporter Richard Carleton, that the Jew who arrested her was living a few doors up on the same street in Sydney.
      </p>
      <p>
       Placed there we say, by the same Jew underground railway that placed Lebanese and Jew war criminals as scabs on the Australian Waterfront.

       You don't have to be vicious.  I'm just saying you don't benefit by automatically dismissing what is counter-intuitive, which is what you seem to be doing.

       They really believe this.  I've also been told on Reddit in the last month that Jews provoked the Pearl Harbor attack, and that Jews created the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan (somehow using a radio antenna in Alaska).

       Their mix or stupidity and gullibility is just astounding.

       American anti aircraft gunners said there were no enemy aircraft at Pearl Harbor, December 6 1941, source: MovieTone News, in a clip that appeared to have been filmed on location at Diamond Head the same day .. the clip was included in the first cut of 911 hit piece, Loose Change.

       .. The recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan.
      </p>
      <p>
       At 1 minute 44 seconds, the narrator says that post earthquake an explosion disabled the emergency diesel powered generator, only after that the tsunami hit .. Don't it resonate with Willie Rodriguez testimony, that there were explosions at the WTC, before the first air strike!

       This video shows a mushroom cloud rising over a different Japanese nuclear power station  .. says there were missile strikes, like the missile strikes on the WTC and at the Pentagon on 911.

       I just stumbled upon this subreddit and I thought I'd randomly read an article which turned out to be this one. I sincerely regret that decision.. It's reddit front page for me from now.
