        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some things that come to mind.</p>

<p>Evidence of aliens, wtc was an inside job, aliens built the pyramids, cure for cancer that somehow is actively suppressed, etc.  Pretty much anything I have seen come out of this subreddit is just insane to me.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong either, I&#39;m not the guy who just believes the official story.  For a long time I thought 9/11 was an inside job and was generally receptive of most conspiracy theories(exception being stuff like the moon landing was fake, does anyone actually think that here?  Please say something if you do, I&#39;ve wanted to talk to someone like that for a long time).  There just isn&#39;t evidence for this stuff, yet people believe it so strongly.</p>

<p>I mean the wtc has been explained tons of times, it really has.  If there was truth to the claims that people made, there would be engineers and scientists that agree.  Instead there aren&#39;t(maybe a handful but nowhere even close to a respectable amount).  The reports came out and if they were bullshit then people would have spoken up.  Real engineers I mean, not people with an internet degree in the properties of steel.  I remember seeing a website that some guy claimed to have 1500 signatures or whatever of engineers who agree but I tried to look into it and find out who they were but there was nothing.  Furthermore, they didn&#39;t even get proof from those 1500 people that they were who they said they were.  They literally took their word for it.  And that&#39;s what people call proof?</p>

<p>And the aliens helping build the pyramids?  Why?  What about them makes them impossible to do with hundreds of years and unimaginable amounts of work?  When a Pharaoh ordered something, EVERYONE was involved who could help.  They could literally have anyone who could possibly help.  People weren&#39;t allowed to just say no.  What about them is so hard to believe?  Because they made some smooth cuts?  Because the pyramids are big and heavy?  I mean come on.</p>

<p>The cancer one is the most angering in my mind.  One it shows a complete ignorance towards cancer and the way treatments are discovered.  Two, it would be impossible to do.  Straight up impossible.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to try and argue why I should believe any of these or any others, I would love to debate.  Just try and stay civil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there any one of these theories in particular that seems to bother you? Or are you just venting in general? I hardly hang out here but, I do subscribe to the way of thought that most of the posters here express. So from time to time I have commented and asked for opinions on something that may have struck me as odd in current events, and I have always been treated with respect. I am up for any questions that you may have regarding why I see the world in the way that I do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cancer one bothers me the most I guess because it is so ignorant of facts.  Anyone who believes the moonlanding was fake would bother me too but I don&#39;t think many people even here believe that one anymore. Those are the old conspiracy theorists who grew up before stuff like Hubble and Mars rovers.  </p>

<p>9/11 doesn&#39;t bother me as much because I understand why people want to think it was an inside job.  Aliens doing stuff doesn&#39;t bother me as much as confuse me. Like how can you think aliens would help with the pyramids <em>and that&#39;s it</em>.  Not help them in any other way. Government hiding stuff I can believe because of all of the people who were ex whatever&#39;s and have come out and said stuff.  I know that&#39;s a fallacy(appeal to authority) but I still can give it more credibility than the other ones.  I do not think that the government contacted them though not for a second.  If anything they just don&#39;t know anything but either saw or found some really weird shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can say that I do not believe that aliens had anything to do with our early history engineering or influence on religions. I am not sure what &quot;cancer&quot; conspiracy you are referencing? As for the moon landing, I happen to be someone that does not believe that we landed there. The race to land on the moon&#39;s surface and claim victory was reckless on the part of the U.S., where as Russia was taking a much more calculated approach. All that said, my biggest reason for not believing in the moon landing is, the Van Allen Radiation belts. My understanding is that a flesh and blood being could not pass through them without dying. If I am wrong and we did land there, why have we not returned? Our country has a rich history of exploiting anything or anyone that we have viewed as conquered. That is my basic belief of the moon landing. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>My understanding is that the US had not returned because the initial reason to go was the cold war. Nothing to show off means NASA&#39;s budget has been cut substantially. Also, the moon has been studied with satellites since the Apollo mission ended, has been mapped and is considered for building/assembling spaceships. </p>

<p>What would you go get there ? There is lunar rock and dust, things we&#39;ve returned and studied. Lately, we&#39;ve discovered there is water but we had to slam satellites into the poles to discover that. If the moon was filled with Unobtainium, the question would make more sense to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cancer conspiracy is discussed as an obvious fact by a poster in this very thread.  It is basically that pharmaceutical companies(perhaps the government in other conspiracies) have a cure but are hiding it.  I assume it&#39;s supposed to be because &quot;treatment is more profitable than the cure&quot;.    </p>

<p>As for the radiation,  I can&#39;t respond to that this moment because I&#39;m on my phone but ill be able to go on a computer soon to look up information about it.  I&#39;m glad you said that I&#39;m looking forward to talking to you about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem, sometimes a lot of these theories can be tough to swallow. Sometimes they are just plain silly. But no matter what a person believes, it is very important to have open discourse to exchange points of view to rule out what simply does not add up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked on wikipedia in the article about the Van Allen radiation belt and found out that it isn&#39;t just evenly distributed around the earth.  If you go to the article and look at the picture then you can see how it varies and there would be opportunity to bypass nearly all of it if you took the correct route.  That&#39;s exactly what NASA did.  Here is an excerpt from the article that talks about it&#39;s impact on space travel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man has already voyaged through the radiation belt to get to the moon several times. The Van Allen Radiation Belts consist of a doughnut-shaped region centered on Earth&#39;s magnetic equator. The translunar trajectories followed by the Apollo spacecraft were typically inclined about 30 degrees to Earth&#39;s equator, therefore Apollo bypassed all but the edges of the radiation belts, greatly reducing the exposure. [13]</p>

<p>It took the Apollo program only about an hour to pass through the worst part of the radiation belts - once on the outbound trip and once again on the return trip. The total radiation dose received by the astronauts was about one rem. A person will experience radiation sickness with a dose of 100-200 rem, and death with a dose of 300+ rem. Clearly the doses received fall well below anything that could be considered a significant risk. Despite claims that &quot;lead shielding meters thick would have been needed&quot;, NASA found it unnecessary to provide any special radiation shielding</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any reason why you think that is made up or incorrect?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My apologies, my day got away from me yesterday. I saw that you had posted something in regards to the radiation belts. I need to take another look at the article that was posted. As for the cancer theory... That is a tough one. There is part of me that refuses to acknowledge that it is in the best interest of a corporation to keep people sick in the name of profits. The other part of me believes that to be true. A corporation only has interests in keeping the shareholders profitable. Corporations have been know to display psychopathic behaviors in order to retain profits. Take for example Bayer. They knowingly unloaded AIDS tainted medications on unknowing countries, simply because they could not take a loss. There were no consequences to be had, other than being found not guilty (by American courts) since they had acted to protect the financial viability of the share holders. Simply put, they behaved as a corporation should according to law. Only to generate profits. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg-52mHIjhs">Relevant.</a>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea that link about the engineers is the one I was talking about. It&#39;s bullshit.  They didn&#39;t do anything to confirm they were legit engineers. Have fun trying to find out who the people actually were and what their reputations are either.  1500 nameless and faceless &quot;engineers&quot; signing some petition(was it even for anything besides wanting another investigation?) is far from proof.  and I could care less what a pilots opinion is.

    <div class="md"><p>ok well I remember being on that website and not being able ot find a list but alright you showed me that.  the thing is, that doesn&#39;t prove anything.  They signed that because they want an independent investigation done.  So out of all the engineers in the US who have relevant knowledge, they were able to find 1500 who would sign a petition just asking for another independent investigation to be done.  A quick google search showed that just a few years ago there were 1.5million <em>employed</em> engineers.  So .001% of engineers(if they were all employed) think that there should be an independent investigation done.  That&#39;s a worse percentage then the scientists who believe global warming isn&#39;t real. </p>

<p>I did not say that! You keep trying to claim I&#39;m saying things that I am not saying. There is no &quot;proof&quot; that it was an inside job.

The issue is not really how many (which you brought up, by the way) architects or engineers or pilots there are, the issue is what they have to say and the <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/en/evidence.html">evidence</a>  they cite to back it up. </p>

<p>It does matter how many believe it&#39;s true, if most don&#39;t then it doesn&#39;t have credibility.  Experts form a consensus and that&#39;s what people look at to see is legitimate.  How do you explain for all of the engineers that don&#39;t think there should be another investigation, all of the ones who accept the story because it makes sense?  Are they all brainwashed?  Paid off?  What?  You can&#39;t just ignore that and say it doesn&#39;t matter.  It absolutely does matter, it&#39;s not like they haven&#39;t heard of 9/11 or that some people believe it was an inside job.  If any engineers thought it was suspicious and read the report and thought it was bullshit then they would have signed it.  Only 1500 did out of millions.  You can&#39;t just ignore that and it is directly comparable to the amount of scientists who don&#39;t believe in global warming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow you are ridiculous.  First of all, 1.5 million is &quot;millions&quot;.  It is more than 1 million.  I was not using hyperbole I was describing how many engineers there were.  Plus, that was only the number of employed engineers and I guarantee there are over 500,000 unemployed ones so that&#39;s at least 2 million probably.  Does that qualify as millions for you?  You can do nothing but argue about bullshit, you haven&#39;t said anything to support your claim besides showing me one website.  Give me some damn facts, what is wrong with the report?  What parts do you think are fabricated? </p>

<p>What logical fallacies did I commit?  I did not misstate any of your comments, you just have nothing to say.  Tell me what the evidence is man, all you are doing is insulting me.  Notice that I don&#39;t insult you at all but you keep doing it to me and flipping out.  You need to calm down and try to rationally defend what you are saying.  You have provided nothing but the 2 links, one of which was relevant(the engineer one) but the other one wasn&#39;t because pilots are not qualified to tell me whether or not a plane could bring down the towers.  Thinking that pilots know better for some reason is a logical fallacy in itself called appeal to authority.  </p>

<p>Calm down and try and debate like a civilized person please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a feeling this will be like talking to a wall but I&#39;ll try one.</p>

<p>The Flight Data Recorder for Flight 77 (allegedly hit the Pentagon) showed that the <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread522491/pg5">cockpit door was never opened after takeoff</a> (scroll down to post by Turbofan. His charts are no longer there but he does cite where they can be found). How did the hijackers get control without entering the cockpit?</p>

<p>Oh, heck. Here&#39;s some more questions for the NTSB from Pilots for 911Truth.</p>

<p><em>The current FDR shows 480&#39; MSL True Altitude, too high to hit the light poles. What are your findings of True Altitude at end of data recording 09:37:44. Why did you provide a Flight Data Recorder that shows the aircraft too high without a side letter of explanation?</em> </p>

<p><em>Why does the csv file show the altimeter being set in the baro cor column on the descent through FL180, but the animation altimeter does not show it being set?(This is a blatant cover-up to confuse the average layman in hopes no one would adjust for local pressure to get True Altitude. Too bad for them we caught it).</em></p>

<p><em>Why do the current G Forces for the last minute of data correspond to the changes in vertical speed, yet at end of data :44-:45 it shows an increase in vertical speed never accounting for any type of level off to be level with the lawn as shown in the DoD video?</em></p>

<p><em>Why does your animation show a flight path north of the reported flight path?</em></p>

<p><em>Why are there no system indication of any impact with any object up to and after :44?</em> (You&#39;ll recall that the official conspiracy theory claims Flight 77 hit light poles)</p>

<p><em>Why does the csv file and animation show a right bank when the official report requires a left bank to be consistent with physical damage to the generator?</em></p>

<p>That&#39;ll do for a start.</p>

<p>Of course not ! Asking for evidence is always a good idea. I encourage that and knowing what subreddit I&#39;m in, I think one should ask for evidence from all camps, for all claims.</p>

<p>Maybe. Maybe not. There is no evidence, that&#39;s the whole point. </p>

<p>It&#39;s true that one should question, I agree. But one must never despair, in my opinion, and reach for conclusions not supported by all facts. Most importantly, one should not set one&#39;s mind on a conclusion and then work backwards and data mine</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I saw evidence from both camps. Wasn&#39;t very convinced by the conspiracies. It&#39;s not that it wasn&#39;t impossible but the proofs presented required a lot of assumptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tell me your thoughts about the Kennedy assassination? Do you believe the magic bullet theory? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first I was unsure. There were lots of people on the scene used as evidence that there was more than one shot. But then I remembered humans have the worst time remembering anything correctly and can modify their own memories without realizing it (which is why testimonials in court suck so much for everyone).</p>

<p>Of course, the questions still remains, what&#39;s up with the crazy bullet trajectory. I saw a TV show that calmly and clearly debunked it for me by showing the layout of the car, presented how the people aboard the vehicle had only to be slightly turned for the bullet to follow the path. And then, they reproduced the layout, put it ballistic gelatin and bones within it (to simulate the bodies) and had a guy shoot from same distance and angle with the same gun. He didn&#39;t get the bullet <em>exactly</em> at the same place, but it was close enough to convince me it was not at all impossible.</p>

<p>Now, could JFK have been shot by the CIA ? Sure, possible. Believable. Can I prove he wasn&#39;t ? No, I don&#39;t feel like proving a negative of this size. Is the official story possible ? It is as well. The official story requires <em>me</em> to make less extra assumptions that the unofficial story so I chose to believe the official story.</p>

Everybody is pointing at building 7 like it is the smoking gun. I do agree that it is enough evidence itself but the Pentagon is what does it for me. How does one explain away the damage at the pentagon not matching up with the size of a huge plane. Also no REAL footage of a plane striking the Pentagon. I mean to be one of the most protected buildings and all they give is some crappy blurry shit that doesn&#39;t even look like a plane.I would like to believe the official story but there is just no real evidence to.

You have to sift through it all to get to the logical stuff.I know it&#39;s a lot of work but it most be done to find the truth. They tell you that the engines on these planes just disintegrated  but these engines are made of titanium also jet fuel doesn&#39;t get hot enough to melt steel let alone titanium.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s the main problem with all these discussions. It&#39;s also hard to sort because you&#39;d need a panel of at least slightly knowledgeable people to evaluate claims and sort out important but small details.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an pseudo-example of an exchange:</p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li>Fuel didn&#39;t burn hot enough to melt the steel in the Twin Tower&#39;s metal frame</li>
<li>But it doesn&#39;t need to melt, only to weaken the steel.</li>
<li>But it didn&#39;t burn uniformly, howcome the building didn&#39;t collapse at an angle or snap in two ?</li>
<li>It&#39;s because of the weight distribution and heat conduction in metals.</li>
<li>That&#39;s not what the plans showed !</li>
<li>The plans were not respected in the construction and some beams were different.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>And so on. How am I supposed to evaluate these claims ? I don&#39;t know nearly enough material sciences and civil engineering and project management to evaluate all these claims. And even if I did read about them, how many intricate details particular to the situation am I missing out on ?</p>

<p>I say this looking at my own technical field where you need to be in it to understand how it works and how it&#39;s more than just the theory and case situations in the manuals. Which is what people have access to in such cases. In the end, I think that sadly, unless it&#39;s a major fuck up, you can&#39;t really truly tell and you have to rely on the honesty and bravery of the people in the field, not on amateurs.</p>

<p>That being said, you can spot big discrepancies without being in the field, like when you look at acupuncture or homeopathy. </p>

<p>That and people being very condensing and rude or downright insulting (or maybe I do the same) in these discussions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does one explain away the damage at the pentagon not matching up with the size of a huge plane. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>With everything I just said, I&#39;ll answer this by saying I don&#39;t know how a plane acts when it crashes into a reinforced Pentagon.  From the shots I saw it looked legit. There were markings from the nose of the plane and a wing. After a while, there was a huge collapse which might have also kept the fire from spreading. There apparently was a huge-ass generator that was clipped by the plane so that seems to confirm it also.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also no REAL footage of a plane striking the Pentagon. I mean to be one of the most protected buildings and all they give is some crappy blurry shit that doesn&#39;t even look like a plane.I would like to believe the official story but there is just no real evidence to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the footage, you know, you&#39;re asking people to prove a negative. &quot;Prove to me there isn&#39;t footage that shows a not-plane devastate the place&quot;. Sadly, lack of proof is just that, it doesn&#39;t confirm or infirm anything, it&#39;s just lack. Maybe the Pentagon didn&#39;t think it necessary to film it&#39;s every outside walls. Why would they, they have guards and fences; I&#39;ve no idea. Maybe it&#39;s regulations from the past, maybe it&#39;s budget cuts, maybe it&#39;s tradition, maybe it&#39;s bureaucratic incompetence, maybe it&#39;s a conspiracy. Lots of possibilities. </p>

<p>I still feel the plane ..&quot;hypothesis&quot; sounds more reasonable to me. It asks me to accept a lower number of assumptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They tell you that the engines on these planes just disintegrated but these engines are made of titanium also jet fuel doesn&#39;t get hot enough to melt steel let alone titanium.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This relates back to my &quot;no expert in everything&quot; rant. Maybe the engines suffered stress while the plane plunged. Maybe a combination of fire and impact did help disintegrate as engines are made to deal with air pressure, not impact pressure. Maybe <strong>no one</strong> has experience with these things so there is no guy you can go ask that will know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is this so hard to believe? It&#39;s not like they haven&#39;t used false flag operations before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s hard to believe, for me, because it asks me to accept a shitton of assumptions that go against what I know, what I read, what I&#39;ve experienced and my perception of the world.</p>

Ever heard of the &quot;Ancient Alien&quot; series on the History Channel?  It&#39;d be good to watch.</p>

<p>I take it you&#39;ve never heard of &quot;Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth&quot;?

    <div class="md"><p>Wow you call me a &quot;noob&quot; right away, that really makes you look smart.</p>

<p>I responsed to someone else about that bullshit website that has those &quot;engineers&quot; signatures.  </p>

<p>If you think that the article you posted proves that pharmaceutical companies are hiding the cure then you not only don&#39;t understand what happened in that case but as I said you show a profound ignorance towards cancer in general.  </p>

<p>Try reading your own articles and do your own research that doesn&#39;t come from a conspiracy theory website buddy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question.  As far as I can tell, no proof is enough.  Once some people are determined to believe something they just can&#39;t accept that it might not be true.  I mean how else can you be so sure that you are right?  I mean I&#39;m an incredibly skeptical person, I thought about all of these for a long time(well most of them).  I did research and I just can&#39;t agree with the conspiracy theorists.  There just isn&#39;t enough evidence(or any at all in most cases).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember hearing an interview about Jon Kay who recently wrote a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_the_Truthers">book</a> after interviewing a lot of conspiracy theorists. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_the_Truthers#Summary">gist</a> as I remember, besides what wiki states, is that conspiracy theorists are actually smart &amp; educated people. He describes how conspiracy theories are an integral part of their lives and how they have a deep emotional attachment to them first and then rely on their intellectual skills to retroactively explain everything second. Basically, start from an emotionally-driven conclusion and data mine the facts.</p>

<p>Also, keep in mind the human brain is easily fooled and likes to see correlation everywhere, an artifact from human evolution. The brain also sucks at estimating relative risk and calculating probabilities as well as hating uncertainty.</p>

<p>Last, our greatest enemy, cognitive bias, is probably very much at play here.</p>

<p>Wiki summary says it well:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He argues that many people prefer explanations for disasters which feature expansive conspiracies because it is more difficult to cope with the underlying incompetence or vulnerability at the root of such events.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess each human has his or her defense mechanism and this is how some people cope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are several reasons this thread isn&#39;t going anywhere.</p>

<p>For one, they&#39;re probably always on the defensive and for good reason. I really see a <em>us</em> vs <em>them</em> mentality from both sides. People are calling conspiracy theorists crazy, stupid or retarded and conspiracy theorists see everyone as either as corrupt or blatantly blind. So from their perspective, it&#39;s a <em>them</em> asking a question; tribal instincts for the win. I&#39;ve also seen similar responses when a conspiracy theorists asks a similar question (&#39;&#39;why do you non-conspiracy theorists don&#39;t see the truth ?&#39;&#39;) somewhere besides <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>And for second, all this is like old news to them. They&#39;re convinced and you questioning them might be the equivalent of someone coming up to you and asking &#39;&#39;I heard this Newton dude say something about gravity; what&#39;s this gravity stuff and why do you believe it? You sure all objects have masses ? You sure all masses suffer acceleration ? You sure it&#39;s 9.81m/s<sup>2</sup> on average ?&#39;&#39;. </p>

<p>In general though, I really think people underestimate the complexity of the universe and science &amp; the incompetence of humans. </p>

<p>Being in a technical field, I know the <em>details</em> tell the &#39;most&#39; truth and it&#39;s hard to understand the details when the field is not your own. This, coupled with belief in conspiracy theories, makes it nearly impossible to present proof that all who doubt will understand unless they have lots of time to understand the field and a big open mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked on wikipedia in the article about the Van Allen radiation belt and found out that it isn&#39;t just evenly distributed around the earth.  If you go to the article and look at the picture then you can see how it varies and there would be opportunity to bypass nearly all of it if you took the correct route.  That&#39;s exactly what NASA did.  Here is an excerpt from the article that talks about it&#39;s impact on space travel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man has already voyaged through the radiation belt to get to the moon several times. The Van Allen Radiation Belts consist of a doughnut-shaped region centered on Earth&#39;s magnetic equator. The translunar trajectories followed by the Apollo spacecraft were typically inclined about 30 degrees to Earth&#39;s equator, therefore Apollo bypassed all but the edges of the radiation belts, greatly reducing the exposure. [13]</p>

<p>It took the Apollo program only about an hour to pass through the worst part of the radiation belts - once on the outbound trip and once again on the return trip. The total radiation dose received by the astronauts was about one rem. A person will experience radiation sickness with a dose of 100-200 rem, and death with a dose of 300+ rem. Clearly the doses received fall well below anything that could be considered a significant risk. Despite claims that &quot;lead shielding meters thick would have been needed&quot;, NASA found it unnecessary to provide any special radiation shielding</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any reason why you think that is made up or incorrect?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it different?  One is a percentage of experts that don&#39;t believe something that the majority of experts in their field to be true.  The other one is a percentage of experts that believe that something isn&#39;t true that most experts in their field believe is.  Seriously how is it different?  </p>

<p>It does matter how many believe it&#39;s true, if most don&#39;t then it doesn&#39;t have credibility.  Experts form a consensus and that&#39;s what people look at to see is legitimate.  How do you explain for all of the engineers that don&#39;t think there should be another investigation, all of the ones who accept the story because it makes sense?  Are they all brainwashed?  Paid off?  What?  You can&#39;t just ignore that and say it doesn&#39;t matter.  It absolutely does matter, it&#39;s not like they haven&#39;t heard of 9/11 or that some people believe it was an inside job.  If any engineers thought it was suspicious and read the report and thought it was bullshit then they would have signed it.  Only 1500 did out of millions.  You can&#39;t just ignore that and it is directly comparable to the amount of scientists who don&#39;t believe in global warming.</p>
