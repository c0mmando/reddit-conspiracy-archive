    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Bin Laden has been dead for years now and yes, the government strategically announced this just now. Why now? Perhaps to help Obama&#39;s re-election or maybe to prepare a new &#39;war on terror 2&#39;, or perhaps both. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the news will soon inform that &#39;Muammar Gaddafi may be supporting terrorist plot against U.S.&#39;. It&#39;s called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_warfare">information warfare</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s truly saddening to see so many people fall for this sort of manipulation. One man is announced dead after eight years of war and people cheer as if he was a super criminal to blame for everything. No, it&#39;s not an accomplishment, it&#39;s a stain of shame! This only reveals the deceptive nature of the government and the lies that are used to justify their causes. I am truly thankful that there are people who see through all the lies and want to get the truth out there. Makes me feel that there&#39;s still hope left. Thank you all for that and keep the truth alive!</p>

He was never really that much of a threat to begin with.</p>

<p>IF this Al Qaeda even exist, his death won&#39;t stop the organisation at all. If he dies, 10 others can take his place. America hasn&#39;t won shit. Only managed to waste tons of dollars and killed one man, which was either already dead or very ill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, if Osama Bin Laden was actually killed in late April, and wasn&#39;t already dead for six or eight years, Obama had nothing to do with it. Second, it&#39;s always tacky to celebrate any person&#39;s death. Third, the morons in the State Department insured that Bin Laden will live forever in the minds and hearts of Muslims by disposing of his body at sea, thereby making it impossible for any independent group to prove he was actually killed in the raid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it completely unconscionable that the President would get on tv at 11 pm on a Sunday night to make this announcement, and I wanted to smack every single tv anchor across the face for acting so happy and cheerful that we finally got him.  We spent 10 years at war at a cost of thousands of Soldier&#39;s lives and trillions of dollars and created more enemies in the middle east than we could ever hope to kill.  We did everything and more than OBL could have ever dreamed of when his loose organization of terrorists attacked the United States by playing into his hands perfectly and now that he&#39;s dead these fucking morons are acting like the events of the past 10 years are vindicated?  Fuck every single one of them.</p>

<p>The proper strategic move would have been to quietly kill OBL and never mention it.  He could have faded into history a forgotten man, but will now live on as a Martyr for terrorists everywhere.</p>

<p>Seriously, what the fuck were they thinking?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even while r/conspiracy also has its&#39; share of, shall we call &#39;obsessives&#39; with a fix on blaming everything on specific groups, it&#39;s sane to have a place where alternative opinions can be expressed and considered, and useful, not very widespread data and correlations be found.  </p>

<p>One needs a truckful of salt to take anything here, but hey, that&#39;s the attitude everyone should have regarding news and events, mainstream or not. I find interesting the subtext of old rituals having influence on current events, and seeing tidbits about that here, helps me to investigate and do my own small research on those odd things. That&#39;s what this place and others should spark: healthy skepticism to make one a questioning, informed news consumer, instead of just accepting things and statements without thought.  </p>
