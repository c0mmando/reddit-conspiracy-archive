<p>Where has this been stated? I&#39;m honestly curious. I assume they do have photographs and video documentation of the body, but doubt they would release it the media so soon.</p>

<p>Just because the pictures haven&#39;t been released <em>yet</em> doesn&#39;t mean anything. I bet we&#39;ll hear and see a lot more about this in the coming days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all fairness the US government never released that photo nor claimed it was an official photo. That photoshop just resurfaced during all this.

<p>I&#39;m talking about these photos that the government is acknowledging exist, but still debating on whether or not to release.</p>

<p>Where has this been stated? </p>

<p>Well, we haven&#39;t seen any yet. With an event such as this, if it were legit, you&#39;d think Washington would go <em>out of their way</em> to make such footage available - such as the footage of Saddam being captured, or any other famous American propaganda photo ops. Remember the tanks rolling into Baghdad? Yeah, the US made <em>sure</em> there were cameras there. </p>

<p>You assume based on what? A gut feeling? </p>

<p>It also doesn&#39;t mean such photos exist. Until such time as someone proves otherwise, we can assume such photos do not exist. Or do you believe in UFO&#39;s also? If you&#39;re asking people to prove a negative, you&#39;re out of your mind. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not one of those. But I am also highly skeptical, and so far, the official story here smells like dogshit. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t know any of that until anything is actually released. So far you&#39;re just presenting a straw man argument to attempt to discredit those who are legitimately demanding further evidence. </p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m assuming the same way you are assuming they <em>don&#39;t</em> have pictures. Since when are you the only person allowed to assume or have a gut feeling? Plus, unlike what you are saying, there are plenty of government sources and insiders agreeing with me: that the world will want to see the pictures and that they have them.</p>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/158573-former-cia-official-us-will-likely-release-photos-of-bin-laden">http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/158573-former-cia-official-us-will-likely-release-photos-of-bin-laden</a></p>

<p>They will either release the photos soon, or not for years to come. Either way we will know soon. There was already one photo circulating around on some tabloid sites, but it has been proven to be a horrible fake and was thought fake to begin with. The US government said the photo was fake and that none of the photos that were actually taken had been released <em>yet</em>. I still think we will still see the <em>real</em> photos.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>EXACTLY! This is the only reason I originally replied to you, because you so confidently said &quot;they don&#39;t have any pictures or video&quot;, yet now you are <em>agreeing</em> with me and trying to tell me &quot;we have to wait and see&quot;? That was my entire point. Nice flip flop. I&#39;m not trying to discredit anyone, I was trying to stop you from claiming things as fact before we know the whole story.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You couldn&#39;t use it as empirical evidence, I agree, but it&#39;s anecdotal evidence, which is more than exists for the counter-argument. Being skeptical isn&#39;t about denying absolutely everything until you have 100% empirical proof of a certain thing, it&#39;s about balancing probabilities and being willing to change your mind when new evidence comes to light. I won&#39;t say that it&#39;s incontrovertibly true that bin Laden was killed, but to make the insane claims that are littered throughout this thread without one shred of evidence to support them is not the same thing as honest inquiry.</p>

<p>If you tell me you drive a Honda, I can believe that without needing to visit you in person and check your VIN and confirm your registration because it&#39;s a benign claim with eminent plausibility. But if you tell me you drive a Honda and it runs on water, well that needs a lot more evidence before it enters the realm of possibility, so I&#39;m more likely to be skeptical.</p>

<p>So, when evidence (anecdotal, I agree) is presented to suggest bin Laden has been killed in Abbottabad, I can believe that relatively easily as the balance of probability is clear. But if someone claims there&#39;s a grand conspiracy (which would necessarily be incredibly complex and involve potentially dozens if not hundreds of conspirators), a lot more evidence is required before it becomes reasonable.</p>

<p>So you can continue to claim you&#39;re walking the middle line and continue your unsophisticated, pseudo-philosophical ruminations, but I have a suspicion that no evidence will ever convince you because you&#39;ve already made up your mind to be cynical about this issue.</p>

<p>you wish buddy.</p>

<p>I actually mentioned downvotes... and FYI the voting system is used as a point of agreeing/disagreeing with the usefulness or content of a post. I went up, you went down. Even my little package of insults for you went up, clearly this undermines your claims of nonsequitority. Put into simple terms even someone who manages to believe their own twisted version of the truth as much as you can understand, this means that other people who read this thread agreed with what I had to say and disagreed with you. I&#39;ll scratch that up as an obvious win, you can live in whatever fantasy land you want, nothing I could do to stop you anyway.</p>

<p>Read and re-read and re-re-read again until it makes sense, if you&#39;re not just trying to be obtuse, to use your own argument. You might as well have started an argument with me by accusing me of being defensive, for all the validity your points have provided; they are just rhetoric that bounces off insults twisted with irrelevant symantics. I&#39;ve explained it all, and I&#39;ve made a perfectly reasonable point. Having said that, it appears some more information is surfacing. Have yet to scroll through it all. In a nutshell, you&#39;re the one twisting words, and you&#39;re also the one who resorted to name calling right off the bat. I joined you in round 3 for shits and giggles.</p>

<p>Pathetic to try and put an insult back on the person making the argument rather than approaching and refuting (refuting not disputing, which is all you managed in between thinly veiled insults) the argument itself. I say from you continually using this as an excuse for debate would suggest this is a defining point of your character.</p>

<p>Above, I was making a point about what namecalling acomplishes, quite well I would say, while enjoying the bonus of insulting a pseudo-intellectual and a hypocrite... kill two birds with one stone.</p>

<p>Keep it coming sunshine, good to see you putting those first year college debating skills to SOME use. Practice makes perfect, maybe one day you will actually be able to address the point someone is making. I&#39;m waiting for more of your pathetic wannabe-smartass insults with baited breath. This could go on forever, I got a whole bag of logic to put against your lack of cognitive thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re saying that news about killing quite possibly the most evil terrorist of the century is equivalent to a &#39;benign claim&#39;? Sure plenty of people have given anecdotal evidence, but how accurate is that? Most of your religions are based on oral traditions, would you say religion is absolute truth? Given, the conspiracy theory <em>is</em> slightly hard to swallow, but you&#39;ll have to agree that the government has yet to show solid evidence that they really did get Osama. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The complaint was that people thought Bin Laden was dead for a long time, and then as soon as they found out he wasn&#39;t they stopped posting about how they thought he was dead for a long time. This was positioned as somehow being a crazy thing to do, when in fact it&#39;s what ANY rational person would do when they found out they were wrong.</p>

<p>The difference between those people and conspiracy theorists is that when conspiracy theorists are faced with disconfirming evidence, <em>they ignore that evidence</em>.</p>

<p>Yes they thought that, but the complaint was that they also asserted it as fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which they were wrong to do, and when they discovered their opinion was wrong, they <em>changed their opinion</em>. Why is this so difficult to explain to you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What rational people did was just say: &quot;I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s dead or not&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rationality doesn&#39;t depend on your previous convictions, you can make a single rational decision at the same time as being a total nutcase in other areas of your life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Disconfirming&quot; evidence? There was no &quot;confirming&quot; evidence to disconfirm. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not how disconfirming evidence works. I can&#39;t believe you aren&#39;t being intellectually dishonest here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as if it&#39;s okay to be full of shit, as long as it&#39;s not academic in nature. But it&#39;s not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between asserting bald fact as scientific truth and discussing your opinion, but that&#39;s irrelevant because again, it has absolutely nothing to do with the point I was making. </p>

<p>Here, I&#39;ll spell it out:</p>

<p>People had the opinion bin Laden was dead. It turns out he wasn&#39;t. They changed their opinions. Somehow that&#39;s wishy-washy to people like you.</p>

<p>The concept of &quot;opinion&quot; exists to allow you to communicate your intuition, heuristics and personal tastes to others. People who assert their opinions generally have no integrity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree, but I have to say again that this is beyond the point I was making: people changed their opinions based on the best available evidence (anecdotal, such as it is), and that&#39;s not fickle, that&#39;s rational.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But obviously, a nutjob making a single, isolated rational decision doesn&#39;t magically acquire credibility, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that could be a point of contention, I would suggest that even if 100% of every decision you&#39;ve ever made has been irrational, as soon as you make one single rational decision you are, from that moment forwards, a rational person... unless you revert to irrationality later on. But this is just semantics and I take your point on board.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was slighting the idea that a statement which only exists due to knee-jerking is a valid statement which can be disconfirmed. You&#39;re not wrong though, I should have used my own terminology, my play on the word was ambiguous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What about this analogy: if you flip a coin and tell me to pick heads or tails, I say I think it&#39;ll be tails, and you reveal the coin to be heads, I have evidence that disconfirms my original opinion and it would be irrational of me to continue saying I think it&#39;s tails. Granted, we don&#39;t have empirical (or even strong anecdotal) evidence regarding the death of bin Laden, but (I think) we have more evidence one way than the other.</p>

<p>To be frank, I think the evidence we do have is poor at best and suspicious at worst, and I&#39;m <em>stunned</em> that they&#39;d dispose of the body so quickly and before any public scrutiny could be applied.</p>

<p>An Egyptian newspaper published his obit on December 26, 2001.  It said his funeral was ten days earlier.</p>

<p>There seems to be no solid evidence that obit is wrong.  That is, I have not seen any credible evidence that UBL was alive in or past the year 2002.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so convenient how the whole supposed fictitious &#39;war on terror&#39; hinges upon this one symbolic man. as though his life/death determines everything. the masses have been conditioned to believe that everything rides on this one man and with that, the PTB can manipulate mass opinion by the simple announcement that this one man is dead....just like flicking a light switch. So fundamentally Pavlovian. This is not to say that they want you to think that the war on terror is over. no, not at all. just that bin laden was killed under Obama&#39;s watch and that &#39;everything is now under control&#39;, re-elect him because he finally achieved what he set out to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Negative, sir, or whoever you are.. Adolf Hitler was a genius with a twisted vision of the world. Politically, he was a ruthless bastard, which was a talent that served him well. He knew how to capitalize and he brought the country in on his side by giving them jobs, places to live, and hence hope. From there it was easy to feed them the poison of the Aryan supremacy concept. But the things he had done to fellow human beings were absolutely atrocious. However, credit being given where it&#39;s due, the Reich did give us some great inventions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what this particular &quot;switch&quot; is supposed to accomplish, though. The elections are a long way off, and there&#39;s so much else to overshadow anything Obama did <em>now</em>, when the elections finally start. Also, if the point was to score points in favor of Obama, why shut everything down so quickly? Why kill him, and immediately get rid of the body and go home? Surely, milking the entire thing would be far more efficient, perhaps even scoring more sympathy points when Obama successfully fends of attackers trying to reclaim the body.</p>

<p>Nothing, I think, points to this being in any way politically orchestrated. If it is, then it is fantastically poorly done, and at a really stupid time.</p>

<p>Also, compared to this, &quot;snubbing Trump&quot; is like swatting a fly. He was just another birther, who happened to also have access to TV and media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading some comments and skimming others, I get the feeling that a lot of what people are saying is very much reactionary.</p>

<p>Could it be true that Bin Laden was indeed still alive until a week ago? Sure.</p>

<p>Could it be true that Bin Laden was a fictitious individual the whole time? Sure.</p>

<p>Could it be true that the whole story is a political concoction in one way or another? I would say probably.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m thinking at present is that something is fishy here. Something&#39;s not right. Initial reports said that a bomb was dropped; subsequent reports said it was a ground operation. The documentary history around Bin Laden is so foggy and varied that it would be difficult to ever get a solid bead on it as a civilian...</p>

<p>All I know is that something stinks around here, and it&#39;s not my socks, because I&#39;m used to that smell.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>From eyewitness reports (like a guy who tweeted the whole thing from a nearby house), it was a ground operation involving helicopters. He said there was lots of fighting, and shooting. He heard two small explosions, and then one big explosion and one of the helicopters attacking the compound crashed and exploded.</p>

<p>The helicopters were probably carrying troops/seals/whatever, and dropped them on the ground. Osama was shot by a gun fired by a troop supposedly, but there was some fighting before hand. The &quot;bomb&quot; rumors are because there were some explosions, but it is believed to be a helicopter that crashed.</p>

<p>You can read the tweets or many articles about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/05/someone-live-tweeted-the-osama-bin-laden-raid-without-knowing-it/">http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/05/someone-live-tweeted-the-osama-bin-laden-raid-without-knowing-it/</a></p>

<p>Not arguing any of your other points or anything, just saying that it does sound like it was a ground operation, but one of the helicopters must have been shot down with a RPG or a stinger.</p>

<p>Yeah, neither do I, but if you go back and read the guys Tweets that&#39;s what he saw and wrote. It&#39;s very possible that he saw an explosion (maybe a rocket or something) and incorrectly thought it was the helicopter crashing. It could have been he just had a sub-optimum viewpoint from where he was.</p>

<p>Also, theoretically a helicopter could take a hit from an RPG and it might look like an explosion and send the chopper to the ground, but it wouldn&#39;t <em>have to</em> kill anyone, though chopper crashes are generally pretty messy and very fatal. But if the fireball was just fuel going up in flames, and nothing else, the fireball could have been quick and blown off, allowing crew to escape.</p>

<p>Since no one official has said anything about a helicopter crash it probably didn&#39;t happen or at least no one was killed, OR it wasn&#39;t an American helicopter that went down (No <em>Americans</em> died). But a couple eyewitnesses both reported a helicopter crashed, so who knows. But in all the pictures I&#39;ve seen of the compound I don&#39;t see any fiery wreckage or scarring that would be caused by a chopper crash, so it seems kind of non-existent at this point in the story.</p>

Of course, we&#39;ll introduce him with a terrorist attack worthy of such a dastardly and inhuman monster. They just don&#39;t want the American public to get their ragheads mixed up, so we gotta make sure everyone knows Bin Laden is dead <em>first</em>.</p>

<p>I hope I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>Any takers on the location of the next terrorist attack?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t the plan shifting gears into uniting Earth, now?</p>

<p>One could assume that the terrorism vehicle has been used to establish a successful attack on civil liberties and set the stage for the introduction of more extreme global political measures?</p>

<p>The media certainly seems to shifting towards aliens, what with the controlled release of information from three letter agencies, and terrorism seems to be getting diminishing returns - while we&#39;ve seen a tightening of the noose in recent years, all the major jumps (like the suspension of habeas corpus and the creation of DHS) occured years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s finally going to be China; here&#39;s why:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_public_debt#Ownership_of_debt">China holds the note for the largest chunk of our debt (1.1 TRILLION)</a>.</li>
<li>We&#39;re so deep in debt that it will take generations to repay it.</li>
<li>We have the world&#39;s largest military.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t think that this country is willing (or able) to live under the necessary austerity measures it would take to pay off this debt.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army">PLA (People&#39;s Liberation Army)</a> is starting to get a little too close to parity with their military capabilities, especially their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Navy">naval forces</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore...I think things are about to get really busy over WESTPAC-way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The keynesians in the government never planned to have this debt paid. The idea is to keep increasing it exponentially in order to continually boost the economy. A huge debt is something they&#39;re proud of, not something they need to get rid of. The only thing that would make the debt go away is the dollar going away and a new currency being introduced in its place, not a war with China. The US actually <em>needs</em> to increase the debt to pay for any war with any country, so it wouldn&#39;t be wise to make war to decrease the debt. That wouldn&#39;t work at all.</p>

<p>I&#39;m worried that this is getting us ready for another attack on US soil that is either perpetuated by or allowed to happen by the government/secret society/whatever.  All I know is I think something bad will happen to innocent US civilians sometime between the next few weeks and a month or so before the next Presidential election. :(</p>

<p>Okay if you believe that 9/11 was a farce do you all of a sudden now believe there will be revenge attacks?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether you believe the official story or not, I think more attacks are inevitable.</p>

<p>Two options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bin Laden really responsible for 9/11.  He&#39;s now dead, and others will plot revenge attacks, while others compete to fill the power void.</p></li>
<li><p>Bin Laden not responsible for 9/11.  But the Iraq war inflamed the region, along with drone strikes and other meddling, so the US killing a man who is seen as a hero to many will piss alot of people off even more.  New attacks, and real terrorists trying to fill the void.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So either way I see things getting worse and not better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also see a third option:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bin Laden is not responsible for 9/11.  The government knows this, yet they warn of revenge attacks for his death.  This means that the government is getting us ready for something that they know is coming.</li>
</ul>

<p>All three options are bad.  The only possible good outcome is that <strong>1)</strong> Bin Laden was responsible for 9/11, <strong>2)</strong> the government is telling the truth, and <strong>3)</strong> our security is good enough to deal with the new threats.  This worries me because while I may be able to believe any one of those three things, I have a hard time believing that all of those things will simultaneously be true.  9/11 has a lot of unexplained issues, the government doesn&#39;t often tell the truth, and we all know how bad security actually is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem in the belief that war is good for the economy, is that it isn&#39;t. It was once, but isn&#39;t anymore. WWII pulled us out of the depression for a lot of reasons, but the biggest, being that everyone suddenly had jobs. The money was able to flow properly again. The government basically took everything they could get their hands on, employed people, BAM! Money! Liquidity!</p>

<p>Not so in today&#39;s wars. The privatization of our military manufacturing process hasn&#39;t really stimulated our economy. Economic progress since &#39;03 has been shaky at best. No-bids contracts being a huge portion of that.</p>

<p>So, on top of that, and beyond it, war really doesn&#39;t leave any lasting beneficial effects. Just destruction. It quite literally makes dollars go up in smoke. I mean think about it, when you invest in a new high speed rail, you&#39;ve got a railway that can be used long after the money has paid it off. That&#39;s a real, tangible, lasting benefit. When you invest in a new bomb, what&#39;s left is a crater. Long after the money has paid it off, you&#39;ve still got nothing but a nice big hole in the ground.</p>

<p>They said that OBL was in a pretty well established area, near a military base, so it makes you wonder who in Pakistan knew about it. I personally think that some evidence will come out that will make us go after them. Which is scary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden
By the CNN Wire Staff
May 2, 2011 5:56 a.m. EDT
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/05/02/bin.laden.raid/index.html?hpt=T1">http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/05/02/bin.laden.raid/index.html?hpt=T1</a>
(CNN) -- In the dark of night, U.S. helicopters approached a high-walled compound in Pakistan on a mission to capture or kill one of the world&#39;s most notorious terrorist leaders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, let’s keep that in mind. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Less than 40 minutes later -- early Monday morning in Pakistan -- Osama bin Laden was dead, along with four others inside the complex, and the U.S. forces departed with the slain al Qaeda leader&#39;s body to fulfill a vow that originated shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The US had the body in their custody and never once took a picture, retrieved a DNA sample for testing, or made any other attempts at providing actual evidence of his death?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking from the White House Sunday night, U.S. President Barack Obama announced the successful raid. Senior administration officials provided further details on the assault on the compound they believe was built five years ago for the specific purpose of hiding bin Laden.
The compound is in Abbottabad, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. The city sits in a mountainous region of Pakistan and is not heavily populated. Many of the residents are army personnel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the world’s most notorious terrorist is sitting pretty in a mansion, very close to a military base, surrounded by army men, for 5 years. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>While senior administration officials would not offer a breakdown of the U.S. mission&#39;s composition, a senior defense official said U.S. Navy SEALs were involved.
After years of intelligence work and months of following a specific lead, they traced a courier linked to bin Laden to the compound in Abbottabad.
When first built, the compound was secluded and reachable by only a dirt road, the officials said. In recent years, more residences built up around it, but it remained by far the largest and most heavily secured property in the area, they said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the most noticeable thing in the area. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mission ordered Friday by Obama encountered outer walls up to 18 feet tall topped with barbed wire, with two security gates and a series of internal walls that sectioned off different portions of the compound, the senior administration officials said. The main structure was a three-story building with few windows facing the outside of the compound, and a third-floor terrace had a seven-foot privacy wall, they said.
Months of intelligence work determined that the compound was custom-built to hide a high-value terrorism suspect, almost certainly bin Laden. The officials noted there was no telephone or Internet service at the dwelling, which was valued at more than $1 million, and its occupants burned their trash, rather than leave it out for collection like other area residents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this took 5 years?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Calling the U.S. operation a surgical raid, officials said it was conducted by a small team and designed to minimize collateral damage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we’ll do airstrikes in Libya but when it comes to Bin Laden, we need to minimize collateral damage? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon landing, the team encountered resistance from bin Laden and three other men that resulted in a firefight.
In the end, all four of the combatants in the compound were dead, along with a woman whom one of the men used as a human shield, the officials said. Sources said bin Laden was shot in the head.
At some point, one of the assaulting helicopters crashed due to a mechanical failure, according to the officials. It was destroyed as the U.S. team flew away, they said.
Obama and the senior administration officials said no U.S. forces were harmed in the operation, which took place very early Monday morning Pakistan time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of questions that could be brought up by this, but let’s move on to the body.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>U.S. officials said they used a number of methods to identify the body as bin Laden.
One official said it was clear to the assault force that the body matched bin Laden&#39;s description, but they used &quot;facial recognition work, amongst other things, to confirm the identity.&quot;
A senior national security official told CNN that they had multiple confirmations that the body was bin Laden, saying they had the &quot;ability to run images of the body and the face.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? So they’ve got a portable CSI Miami machine that accurately does facial recognition and excludes the need of DNA or photographic evidence? Plus, he was allegedly shot in the head, something that has the potential to make facial recognition a bit difficult depending on the location. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another U.S. official told CNN that bin Laden has already been buried at sea. The official said his body was handled in the Islamic tradition, but did not elaborate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no Islamic tradition of sea burials, in fact, they are very specific about grave site requirements and the placement of the body. And it appears that the convenience of cremation couldn’t be used because it is forbidden by Islamic law. But think of this again. The US military has his body in their hands and takes the time to transport it to perhaps a clergy member or someone who will “follow Islamic law,” who also happens to be near a sea, approximately 500 miles south of where they captured him. And they didn’t gather evidence of his death and then dispose of the body. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A senior administration official also said bin Laden&#39;s body would be &quot;handled in accordance with Islamic practice and tradition. This is something that we take very seriously, and so therefore this is being handled in an appropriate manner.&quot;
According to the senior administration officials, intelligence work determined at the beginning of 2011 that bin Laden might be located at the compound in Pakistan. By mid-February, the intelligence was considered strong enough to begin considering action pledged by Obama when bin Laden&#39;s whereabouts had been determined.
To discuss that intelligence and develop a plan, Obama chaired five National Security Council meetings from mid-March until late April, with the last two on April 19 and April 28 -- last Thursday. The next day, on Friday, Obama gave the order for the mission, the officials said.
The key break involved one of the few couriers trusted by bin Laden, according to the officials. About two years ago, intelligence work identified where the courier and his brother lived and operated in Pakistan, and it took until August of last year to find the compound in Abbottabad raided Sunday, they said.
&quot;When we saw the compound where the brothers lived, we were shocked by what we saw -- an extraordinarily unique compound,&quot; one senior administration official said. &quot;The compound sits on a large plot of land in an area that was relatively secluded when it was built. It is roughly eight times larger than the other homes in the area.&quot;
Noting that the courier and his brother had no discernible source of wealth to live at such a property, intelligence analysts concluded the compound was &quot;custom-built to hide someone of extraordinary significance,&quot; the official said, adding: &quot;Everything was consistent with what experts thought Osama bin Laden&#39;s compound would look like.&quot;
Another senior administration official told reporters that Obama&#39;s administration did not share intelligence gathered beforehand with any other country -- including Pakistan -- for security reasons. The official said that only a small group of people inside the U.S government knew about this operation in advance.
However, a senior Pakistani intelligence official said members of Pakistan&#39;s intelligence service, the ISI, were on site in Abbottabad during the operation. There was no way to immediately resolve the apparent discrepancy.
CNN&#39;s Nick Paton Walsh, Ed Henry, Tom Cohen, Elise Labott, Pam Benson, Dana Bash, Chris Lawrence and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT: My theory is as such:</p>

<p>There must have been a deal made somewhere along the way, that the US would let him live out his life, but when he died, find a way to take credit. Between burying him at sea (wtf lame) and being found in a mansion near a military base, there appears to be long-time knowledge of his whereabouts and a desire to not expose the state of his body. Any medical examiner could identify the difference between pre and post mortem injury. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe he&#39;s been dead for a decade because there is no clear reason to announce this at this time, even for re-election. Somehow, it seems much simpler to me that he died, they made arrangements, and that was that.</p>

<p>No thankyou.  For a start with Obama you feel like there is some intelligence in that head and the free world is not headed by an utter fucking <strong>moron</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bear in mind, things could still go rather wrong for him (and us) between now and election time.  For example, we did all this without informing our counterparts in Pakistan.  This was no doubt in part because we don&#39;t know whether or not they are compromised, as it is generally accepted that there are al Queda/Taliban sympathizers within the government&#39;s ranks.  Regardless, it makes the government look weak and incompetent, and not only might they have to worry about retaliation from al Queda, but protesters and dissidents from their local populace who balk at the idea of the US coming and going as they please.  This could plunge the country further into chaos, and as a result, allow al Queda and the Taliban to strengthen morale, numbers, etc.</p>

Since the Democrats and Republicans are all run behind the scenes by the capitalist pigs I mean. Otherwise Bush would have released Osamas body while he was still in office to give the Republicans a better chance at the Presidency, and not let it be saved to boost Obama&#39;s approval ratings.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So it is a fact that he was already dead because high-ranking members of the PAKISTANI military told us he was?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well.. Given that they were payrolling him for years, and were effectively his &quot;minders&quot; - yes, absolutely they are more credible than the Americans, who apparently couldn&#39;t manage to find him, despite sending 350,000 heavily armed soldiers to the region.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While he was HIDING in Pakistan?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ISI <em>created</em> Al Qaeda, with CIA support in the 1980&#39;s to defeat the Russians. Pakistan may be an &quot;ally&quot;, but they are a tenuous one at best.  It was not only Pak military sources who said he was dead, it was Benazir Bhutto (who was later assassinated as we know, so never lived to qualify her statements), and none other than the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharaff. They may just be untrustworthy &quot;brown people&quot; to you, but on the balance of available evidence, paltry though it may be, he was dead <em>years</em> ago. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>surely we can believe there are countless reasons why members of the Pakistani military might say this, whether it was true or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see why you don&#39;t apply the same skepticism to American officials. What makes them inherently more credible than Pakistanis? Because they&#39;re <em>white</em>? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I always said it was a possibility he was long dead from his medical problems. Now it turns out he was not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hang on - so your confirmation that he was not, is from western media sources. However, when those same western media sources over the years reported the claims of Pakistani sources citing that he was already dead - the news is somehow less credible? You&#39;re not being skeptical, you&#39;re selectively choosing which news to consider credible, even though it&#39;s coming from the same source. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Occam&#39;s razor tells me it&#39;s far more likely he just died today than some massive conspiracy was just put in motion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite a bit of audacity required to cite Occam&#39;s razor in this case, when your perception is clearly biased and clearly driven by the mainstream media narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A decent chunk of the conspiracy theory bandwagon is fucking schizo. I don&#39;t believe that Obama is an inter-dimensional lizard being, or that Lady Gaga is a poster child for the NWO. There are plenty of reasons why those ideas are hard to swallow, but...you know, to each his own. The Bin Laden thing - eh, I could go either way on, but frankly I hardly see it as the point. </p>

<p>The thing is, nobody&#39;s &quot;grasping at straws&quot; in questioning the honesty of the government. We know they lie to us <em>constantly</em>. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the entire government, but definitely enough of it. The CIA is dealing drugs, the FDA is headed by private consultants for pharmaceutical companies, everything that ever happens is classified and the NSA has turned our computers and cellphones into fucking baby monitors just in case we might be &quot;terrorists&quot;. I wouldn&#39;t doubt for a second they&#39;d lie to us about this too. </p>

<p>One could assume that the terrorism vehicle has been used to establish a successful attack on civil liberties and set the stage for the introduction of more extreme global political measures?</p>

<p>The media certainly seems to shifting towards aliens, what with the controlled release of information from three letter agencies, and terrorism seems to be getting diminishing returns - while we&#39;ve seen a tightening of the noose in recent years, all the major jumps (like the suspension of habeas corpus and the creation of DHS) occured years ago.</p>
