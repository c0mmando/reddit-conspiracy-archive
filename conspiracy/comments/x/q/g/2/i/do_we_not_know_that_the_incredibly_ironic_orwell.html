       Just a simple Google image search reveals that there is no CCTV camera outside George Orwell's house (apartment, whatever). Having that picture in the right hand bar doesn't do this subreddit any service and even furthers the stereotype that we work off of confirmation bias and not evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's another reason for the use of the photoshopped image, feel free to share.

       Did a little more research. Thanks to

        this site

       , I was led to the original creator of this image's
       <a href="http://www.ullapix.com/Steve_Ullathorne_photography/Restyles_of_the_Dead_and_Famous.html#24">
        website

       . Turns out it was created as an art piece. We have some modified version in the sidebar, but I think all the evidence presented in this thread indicates that it too is not legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I actually read the original thread (should have done this first). Seems all this information was pretty much already presented. Now I'm just flat out wondering why it's being used by the subreddit. Mods have any answers?

       In a sense, yes. It is still an ironic statement, as the artist intended. But hopping on to r/conspiracy, you don't know it's a piece of art. You just see what is presented and are led to believe it is real. And that makes us look gullible, which is the opposite of skeptical, and skepticism is what I thought this place was all about.

       Ironic in a different, making fun of yourself unintentionally, sort of way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The picture that is used as emblematic proof of the Orwellian conspiracies afoot in this time is as contrived as most of the conspiracies discussed in this subreddit.

       It would explain why the image is so powerfully ironic.  Art.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why meme type photos aren't really my thing, its conditioning people to be stupid actually (IMHO). Ironically, again, the reduction of all expressions into one button "the like button" meme is the only meme that i feel deserves to be a meme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since a meme is a reflection of that exact same concept.

       Also, there exists only like two different image of the camera in front of the apartment. The one used in the sidebar is one of several different croppings of the same faked image. There is another image that shows a slightly different angle, but the camera is very clearly the exact same camera that was shopped into the other image. So though the angle on the house is different, the camera appears exactly the same.

       Thanks ,  If you are interested , the technique for ascertaining whether or not a jpg is fake, is called error level analysis.  No expert either but apparently sites such as
       <a href="http://29a.ch/sandbox/2012/imageerrorlevelanalysis/">
        these

       can help you out.

       to see when (the date) that the cameras were installed around London and compare them to the copyright dates on some of those images.

       I was going to do tineye, but didn't they close up shop recently for some reason? Anyway... I'll leave that for someone who's more familiar with photoshopping than I am.

       If you look closer at the image you linked, you'll notice that though the angle on the house is different, that's the exact same cropped-in image of a camera as in the sidebar. That's also a very lazily done shadow. The tree, which appears closer to the house doesn't cast a shadow that matches the angle of the camera's shadow, nor do the wires overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Also that boingboing article shows cameras near the house, but not a marker directly in front of the house like all these shopped images show.

       So, you're saying that the image on the right is a photoshopped version of the image I linked (which isn't photoshopped)?

       Doesn't that still add up to "there's a camera outside Orwell's window"?

       Ah. Okay. I also followed the link below the picture and read some of the comments.

       I retract my assertion that you are mistaken. You do appear to be correct. The map image (of where the cameras
       <strong>
        are
       </strong>
       located) also does not include this location (although it does include a LOT of locations in the neighborhood
       <em>
        around
       </em>
       that flat).

       Also, due to the frequency with which google earth continually roams and updates populated areas, I'll bet google earth could tell us something as well. But I don't have google earth because my ancient PC won't run it.

       It literally is an art piece by artist Steve Ullathorne. However, I feel the sidebar portrays it as an authentic photograph by captioning it "Incredibly Ironic." It is, sure, but only because it was contrived to be that way.
