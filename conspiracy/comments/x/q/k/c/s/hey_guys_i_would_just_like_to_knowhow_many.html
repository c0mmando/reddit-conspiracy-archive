    <div class="md"><p>See my other response in this thread, then after you read it I just have to reiterate the following:</p>

<p>The &quot;spirit science&quot; series is an absolute joke, it&#39;s currently the most popular new age &quot;recruitment&quot; tool for the fact that it&#39;s very well done.  I&#39;ve seen mostly all of them and I have to say I even enjoy watching it for the comedy aspect. I just don&#39;t believe a word they say. They are even misrepresenting a lot of estoric &quot;knowledge&quot; that the &quot;Mystery Babylon&quot; religions believe, it&#39;s just funny for the fact that they can&#39;t even get their own &quot;teachings&quot; right. They basically pick and choose what they want to keep in their foundation. This all comes back to what I stated earlier: &quot;the new age religion evolves with the needs of man&quot;, basically put they are promising you everything you could possibly ever want in the hopes that you will accept them.</p>

<p>In reality you will never never get anything they promise you</p>

<p>You should really check out william coopers mystery babylon series though, it is truly great, I regret not watching it sooner. I accept the fact that you can&#39;t promise you will either but I&#39;ll try my best to give those two links a look</p>

<p>King James establishment propaganda.</p>

<p>Many people (to use esoteric terms) &quot;become one with God&quot;. Jesus is not alone in that.</p>

<p>Jesus is, however, the proclaimed <strong>Son</strong> of God (&quot;My only begotten Son.&quot; according to scripture). He is not, however, God. Because (according to scripture) God existed prior to Jesus... Jesus joined with God (sits at the right hand of God, according to Revelation).</p>

<p>Paul&#39;s writings are heresy, but they suited the agenda of the corruption of the Church after the crucifixion of Peter (I kind of like some of Paul&#39;s chauvenistic writings, btw. Especially when I hear some woman in my trailer park screaming at her husband at the top of her lungs).</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>do you think that everyone will eventually reach the truth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. And here&#39;s why...</p>

<p>you said &quot;the truth&quot; as though referencing a single one truth above all other truths. This brings up Platonic Forms. The Form of Truth (i.e., &quot;the truth&quot;) can never be reached. Understanding what truth is, however, can be prioritized so that people innately <em>seek</em> truth (right now, the MSM prevents this - TPTB don&#39;t want anyone to know anything about the truths of their actions).</p>

<p>tl;dr: no, but yes. No, they will never reach &quot;the truth&quot;, but yes... I am hopeful that truth, in general, will become important... like in the top 2 or 3 or so things worthy of pursuit (truth, love, etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drunvalois a &quot;new ager&quot;, stay away from those types of people. It&#39;s another wing of Mystery Babylon.</p>

<p>The &quot;New Age Religion&quot; is the NWOs latest religion. Their goal is to develop a religion that &quot;evolves with the needs of man&quot;, and eventually unite the world under that one religion. They teach that you can become god through &quot;works&quot;, where as with Christianity your saved only by grace alone, so there is no need for works. You can spot any Mystery Babylonian religion when they teach that man can become &quot;god&quot; (note: this is not &quot;God&quot;, they acknowledge a master architect, but still teach you can become a &quot;god&quot;). Their god is lucifer, they worship knowledge which they refer to as the &quot;intellect&quot;, you are ranked as individual based on the esoteric knowledge. Please note that wisdom and knowledge are nothing alike, they worship knowledge and not wisdom. Christianity approves of wisdom over knowledge. Mystery Babylon creates inequality in every religion they create, and everything they touch. Mystery Babylon believes you can become &quot;perfect&quot;, where as in reality all of mankind is imperfect and only &quot;God&quot; is perfect&quot;. Regardless, Christianity teaches that all are equal in the eyes of God. Mystery Babylon loves deities and idols, Christianity does not.</p>

<p>Finally please note that new agers are usually nice people, but so are Mormons and many other religions, all you need to do is look at their roots and ideology. Mormonism is basically freemasonry for women and children. Freemasonry does not allow women or children to join and views anyone who is not &quot;white&quot; as inferior subhumans, yet more inequality. This is why black freemasons can never visit a white freemasonic temple but white freemasons may visit a black freemasonic temple.</p>

<p>Please consider watching William Coopers series on Mystery Babylon: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=william+cooper+mystery+babylon">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=william+cooper+mystery+babylon</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s 40~ hours long but it is the most accurate modern representation of Mystery Babylon and all the evil that surrounds it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should check out this persons twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/SkyMaitreya">https://twitter.com/SkyMaitreya</a> ,blog: <a href="http://www.skymaitreya.com/">http://www.skymaitreya.com/</a> ,and youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SkyMaitreya">https://www.youtube.com/user/SkyMaitreya</a> - you wouldn&#39;t know how far gone she is until she opens her mouth. This is basically the end game for anyone who is into the new age religion.</p>

<p>To sum her up, <em>she actually believes she is &quot;God&quot;</em>. She has even convinced multiple people into believing that she is &quot;God&quot;, or in this case the &quot;maitreya&quot;. The people she&#39;s convinced she&#39;s lived off of them rent free, and even made them worship her.</p>

<p>She&#39;s put her own little twist on the new age religion, basically every new ager has their own interpretation; they have no solid foundation, and no holy book, they believe everything is right, and that there is no good and evil.</p>

<p>She believes in reincarnation, and basically she believes she&#39;s is lilith, eve, mary magdalene, joan of arc, isis, and a bunch of other crazy shit. When she introduces herself she refers herself as the &quot;water bearer&quot; in her current life time. After that she makes it very clear that she is the &quot;whore of babylon&quot;.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a ton of really fucked up stuff she talks about and has done. She believes shes the god of prostitution so she sells her body to pay for her &quot;spirit quest&quot;. This is something all of those really into the new age religion do to &quot;find themselves&quot; and recruit others.</p>

<p>Oh yea, she even believes that she is going to give birth to the son of &quot;jesus christ&quot; when he returns. She even went as far to abort a baby when she got pregnant from some random guy she was being paid to sleep with because it wasn&#39;t &quot;jesus&#39; baby&quot; and she can only give birth to his children.</p>

<p>The new age religion is fucked up</p>
