    <div class="md"><p>We are on a luxury liner that is running out of fuel and provisions. It continues on its way until it can&#39;t. The people who know about the fuel don&#39;t know what is happening in the kitchens. The people who know about the food don&#39;t know what is happening in the engine room. They are all doing their jobs hoping the people in charge will solve the problems before they spiral out of control. The people in charge who know what is happening are not informing the passengers. The people who sense that the ship is slowing down and the meals aren&#39;t what they use to be can do nothing to change the situation. Eventually the ship is adrift. For now the parties continue so the masses do not notice the elites hoarding supplies in the lifeboats. </p>

<p>Prepare to abandon ship if and when you can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A solar flare could destroy our power grid, that is the only SHTF scenario that I would immediately be scared of. It would have a tremendous impact on everyone and there is no solution. Most of the people on earth would parish due to our reliance on electricity, food would run out within a few weeks and most people don&#39;t know how to purify water. Not to mention the panic, which would be the worst part. I would probably be annoyed to death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it all starts to fall apart it is too late.</p>

<p>I am of two minds:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It matters not where you are, what you do, what you stockpile, how many guns you have or how much gold. What matters is <strong>knowledge and ability</strong>. If you can fix diesel engines, cook, grow crops, drive stick and ride motorcycles and properly know how to operate firearms, you are of value to the ruling authorities should you run into them, furthermore you increase you own chances. Invest now in <strong>knowledge</strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>I honestly believe that living in a city is asking for trouble. If you can afford to find a place outside of the city, do it. Also, if you can find such a community, reach out to the local gardener/farmer types. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Finally. I want to just mention firearms again. A lot of lefty types (this is me) don&#39;t have experience with guns. In the event of a collapse, you don&#39;t just loot a corpse and become a marksman. There is a fuck of a lot of complexity to firearms and properly shooting them. Better to learn now than to shoot your eye out later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>your local range probably has beginner classes and the ability to fire many different weapons under supervision. I believe that ability and comfort with firearms is more important than actual ownership (unless you live in Detroit or similar). Also, if you just go to the local range, your kid(s) will not be in proximity to a firearm until you are comfortable yourself. </p>

<p>Seriously, your local range is waiting for you to call. I bet they have a &quot;single mothers handgun&quot; class. </p>

<p>It is worth it to think in terms of worst case scenario. So, ask yourself, if the trucks stopped coming with fresh food, how would your area hold up? Starve or persist? Assuming the worst, what military is left will attempt to hold lines and keep you and the local population localized. So, hemmed in, without food, what happens? </p>

<p>Figure out how to avoid that. Also, depending on how old your kids are, teach them important skills. If they are young, I would avoid talking about the doom stuff. Let them remain ignorant kids for a while, but teach them skills passively that might be handy later. Like gardening or wildlife identification. First aid, and so on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Step 1: learn to trap. This is something that only requires bait and knowledge about trap placement. With enough traps set one can live off of nearby resources.</p>

<p>Step 2: Build a reverse osmosis water filter. Look up instructions for this on survival forums, It&#39;s usually large rocks on top of medium rocks on top of small rocks, this will filter debris out of the water. Make sure there&#39;s access to a lake or a well.</p>

<p>Step 3: figure out how to build a fire without matches. This is best to boil water and make sure you don&#39;t get sick.</p>

<h1>Step 4: be away from society.</h1>

<p>A simple and vague list but It&#39;s a good start to figuring out what to do when Shit hits the fan.</p>
