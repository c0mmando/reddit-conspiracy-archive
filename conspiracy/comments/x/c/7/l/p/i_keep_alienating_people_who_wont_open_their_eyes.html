        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Given the gravity of our situation, I become (rightfully, I think) obsessed with understanding reality and I become furious with some of the injustices perpetrated on a regular basis.</p>

<p>How the hell does one have a bearable existence among the apathetic and the sheep, not to mention the collaborators? I can&#39;t help but become angry with people, who refuse to listen, and the fact that they often think that <em>I&#39;m</em> a pestilence, when in fact their actions or lack their of a contributing to our descend into neo-feudalism and tyrrany if not mass-murder and the very, very real possibility of the annihilation of civilization and quite possibly most of the biosphere with it.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the collaborators, those who defend the indefensible, the trolls and the people who seem to think that they can sweep under the carpet the fact, that they&#39;ve enabled and participated in the mass-slaughter of innocent civilians all over the world. How the hell does one deal with those in a constructive manner?</p>

<p>As the Buddha said: &quot;Holding on to anger with the intent of harming another, is like picking up a hot piece of coal with the intent of throwing it as the object of your anger&quot; (paraphrased).</p>

<p>Any thoughts on maintaining sanity and good relations with people, even those who may have some outlandish beliefs regarding reality?</p>

<p>How does everyone else make their every day life work knowing what they know?</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I do not advocate violence. I advocate the reinstitution of the rule of law and due process for those who are guilty of high treason, crimes against humanity and war crimes.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The word truth may have been unfortunately chosen, but let me explain what I mean:</p>

<p>I do not claim to know for certain the <em>truth</em> of the events of 9/11, 7/7, the Iraq war, how Bilderberg operates etc.. </p>

<p>The <em>truth</em> I&#39;m speaking of, is the fact that we can look at the data and conclude, that every ecosystem on earth is in decline, that every society, is in decline, that we are polluting the air and soil and water to the extent that we&#39;ll make ourselves dumb and ill. It does not matter, if I know exactly how much mercury is in the oceans or what it means. There are no truths in the sense, that we can never measure the whole of reality at once. There is not comprehensive understanding, ever, no omniscience. It&#39;s impossible. This does not mean, that we can know nothing!</p>

<p>When I speak of <em>truth</em>, what I mean, is that we can put all the trends together, we can look at all the data and we can say, that it is a truth, that if we bring about enough causes for the destruction of the systems (ecological, societal, natural) that support our survival, we will make our survival impossible, at least on the scale it is at today. That is the <em>truth</em> I&#39;m speaking of. </p>

<p>The next <em>truth</em>, is that we can look at reality, we can say something about the probability of meeting an untimely end through pulling the rug from under our existence. It&#39;s a <em>truth</em> that the data suggests, that we&#39;re moving towards the edge and every attempt at slowing down is being thwarted by the elite and their henchmen and the collective actions of us all.</p>

<p>The third <em>truth</em>, that I assumed would be an accepted premise, is that we and everyone we know are worth saving. </p>

<p>I hope that clarifies a bit. Reality is obviously extremely complicated.</p>

<p><strong>Do not let language and concepts betray you!</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Look for the hidden assumptions and axioms that underlie your beliefs!</strong></p>

<p>As Chris Hedges says: I refuse to speak in the language, that they give to us.</p>

<p>And to the paid trolls and collaborators: I&#39;ll try to hold some compassion for you, I think you know not what you do. Still, actions bring about results. Why not use some of the knowledge you have no doubt come across in your line of work and try to find some patterns and see if what you can find out about what&#39;s going on is <em>really</em> in your interest. In all likelyhood, we&#39;re in this together, all of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop trying to change people&#39;s minds. It&#39;s really obnoxious.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t sum up everything you&#39;ve read, all the videos you&#39;ve watched and everything you&#39;ve been /obsessing/ over for years in a soundbite or a single conversation.</p>

<p>If you want people to follow your thinking, lead by example. Don&#39;t cram your worldview down their throats. You quote bhudda, but this is bullshit if you don&#39;t take a step back, and let people come to you in their own time.</p>

<p>I used to be like you. It&#39;s /you/ who needs to wake up, friend. There&#39;s another stage to the &#39;truth&#39;, and that is the stage where you can calmly deal with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now there I disagree. People are convinced by other people. Keeping quiet is the same as giving up. American freedom, freedom for slaves, civil rights,  women&#39;s rights, etc, all these things were accomplished by people talking to other people.  The more of us discuss what we know is true, the more we convince others. Just think of...well,  Christians for a start. They go around trying to convince people every day. And they do convince some. We need to do the same. Our only flaw is that while we see the problems we don&#39;t see the solution. We need to work on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are convinced by behaviour not words. When Gandhi led people on the salt march. The British were forced to see a nation seeking the same freedom from tyranny they espoused. Forced to see themselves as defending the indefensible. When Martin Luther King led the march to work. White america was forced to see that black people were seeking and demanding a level of respect that all humans deem as self-evident. When women fought for the vote they showed that women can and will be non-passive in the fight for representation.</p>

<p>Change does not happen by convincing people intellectually. It comes from seeing other people not lying down and taking it anymore. It comes from creating situations where people are forced to take a position. Gay Marriage will happen (the battle is won) because people are not going to accept no for an answer.</p>

<p>There are two problems with the truth movement or whatever you want to call it:</p>

<p>1) It runs the risk of putting yourself as the one with privelleged information (this can be easily over stated).</p>

<p>2) It lacks a clear and simple call to disobedience.</p>

<p>The problem with conspiracies are they are by nature opaque. They often have numerous narratives. It is often the case that one is simply a cover for another more insideous truth. </p>

<p>Personally I would advocate keeping it simple and based on what we know. For example demolishing the Fed. There is no logical reason that the US has a system where it pays interest on new money. It is a clear and simple conspiracy that is far more important than people dressing up and performing rituals.</p>

<p>The other tougher nut is fighting to get rid of political parties and the FPTP system. There were no political parties at the time of the constitution and there presence particulalry in a FPTP system is disasterous for the people.</p>

<p>Uncovering abuses by the CIA, FBI etc. is to some extent to become dazzled by the symptoms not the cause of the problems which are actually quite simple:</p>

<p>1) Two Party System</p>

<p>2) Private Central Bank</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. When Tom Paine wrote Common Sense, when Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin, when Edward Bellamy wrote Looking Backward - 2000 to 1887, people were convinced with words. There is a time for words and a time for action. But the words come first. MLK first convinced a lot of people to resist and he convinced them with words. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I don&#39;t disagree. I still think people over play the role of words. Most people are not smoking a pipe and philosophising about the world. They are forced to confront new realities as people refuse to play along with previously accepted certainties. I suppose I might argue that some peoples words are so powerful they become a form of action but mainly words will stay within a small preserve untill they lead to action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point that there&#39;s no real call to disobedience, or action, is good. That may be a big source of my frustration too: I know all this shit going on and a lot of things wrong with the world, but I&#39;ve no idea what to do except deepen my pantry and grow legumes and stay out of debt.</p>

<p>There should be a clear call to to action, and perhaps OCW can chisel out their message some more: &quot;Do this here like this on wednesday, EVERYWHERE&quot;, constant disruption, and do it in a way, that the media has to cover (can someone hire a PR consultant?)</p>

<p>Regarding actions speaking more than words, yeah, well, both are needed, and I think it might actually be a bad thing, that we&#39;ve made it nearly unacceptable and in bad taste (in some places) to discuss politics when we&#39;re supposed to be having a good time. The democratic tradition and the workers movement where I&#39;m from was forged around community engagement, debate at local venues, people talking on the streets and bars, momentum building.</p>

<p>The discourse is important too, and Ghandi did talk.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note, that many Indians consider Ghandi a traitor and a collaborator who enabled the British to maintain a lot of economic control over india and existing powerstructures to remain, he might&#39;ve blunted the rise of socialism and did Roosevelt in the US.</p>

<p>Ok, so if we can&#39;t bring attention to some of the <em>truths</em> (uh oh, bad word) that are obvious and ignored, we should just try to lead by example and not explain to much, not write too much, not engage in debate with people who spread misinformation or falsehoods? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So to avoid being obnoxious, we should not debate, criticize and discuss things ? Could it not be the case, that people&#39;s aversion to reality is based in fear and cognitive dissonance?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not claiming to have the truth, what I&#39;m claiming is, that way before we get to a discussion about the substance of the matter at hand, social control usually stops people from listening.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re assuming too much, when you say I&#39;ve seen to many videos. Trust me.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an epistimological and conceptual dead end. When I say truth, I mean that which the evidence points towards, I do not hold beliefs I claim to be unfalsifiable. </p>

<p>Language betrays us again. I started out far, far from my standpoint and I go where the evidence takes me. I do not cherry pick, though I have found some sources to be notoriously unreliable.</p>

<p>Being alone with the truth means, in my view, that most people do not take the effort to even scratch at the surface of our, as Chomsky calls them, &quot;necessary illussions&quot;. Perhaps I should have asked: &quot;How to handle being one of the few people who ask hard questions, that have scary, unsettling answers a lot of the time&quot;.</p>

<p>I am ready to give up any belief I hold. And I do not like black and whites. I realize that negatives cannot be proven, and that there&#39;s a long stretch from what society and people in general deem &quot;impossible&quot; (really: &quot;in my view improbable&quot;) to what is actually physically impossible (or EXTREMELY improbable - like the spontaneous conversion of one element into another).</p>

<p>I suppose what I meant to say was that I&#39;m really fucking confused, but I can discern som trends and I can assign varying probablities to different scenarios with greater and greater certainty with more data available.</p>

<p><strong>But yeah, it&#39;s kinda funny that I asked how to deal with being alone with something I claim to have said I DO NOT possess.</strong></p>

<p>*Edit : And in all honesty, I would very much like it to be true, that we fight for truth and freedom, that we do good, but given the data available, I think our superimposition of various justifications and explanations are sickening. In all likelyhood, for instance, the death-toll of the Iraq conflict from 1990 till now is roughly 3 million people. There&#39;s a lot of noise around that fact, babbling about terrorists and freedom and demoracy and wmd&#39;s, but if we look at just the data, Iraq was destroyed by us for no good reason, resulting in massive suffering for millions. That&#39;s an objective analysis of the data available. </p>

<p>One of the beefs I have with the state of affairs, is that apparently, I have to be a statitician to say what I said above. To criticize the official story of 9/11 I have to be an explosives expert, an engineer and a pilot and probably more. What credentials do I need to propagate and feel justified in my belief in the &quot;official story&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been 11 years since 9/11 and not a single person in the world has provided actual proof that the official story is wrong. There have been several documentaries of people pointing out what they see as inconsistencies and sharing their opinions and views on the subject but not a single god damn person has presented a single ounce of concrete undeniable proof of any kind.</p>

<p>Speculating about what YOU think really happened on 9/11 on internet forums is not going to get you closer to the truth.</p>

<p>What would of been the motive behind 9/11? Money? According to conspiracy theorists the global elite already own the federal reserve, they control the currency. So the money motive doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>Maybe you should read this book. <a href="http://www.takeoverworld.info/Grand_Chessboard.pdf">The Grand Chessboard (1998) By Brzezinski the NSA to Carter</a> It will explain motive for 9/11. Which if you haven&#39;t figured out yet, you&#39;re kind of in the wrong sub-reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t been able to ever find a report of one piece of a (non-impossible, non-insane) claim of evidence to support the official theory. </p>

<p>More than that, I wonder why <em>every single bit</em> of the official story is retarded to the point of being foolish: couldn&#39;t they get even one tiny bit to make sense - they could have, but they didn&#39;t. Why? why so nutty? I mean, presuming - sorry assuming - that a jumbo was one of the things that hit the pentagon, why then make the FBI go apoletic hiding the clear video evidence to support this.  Why not actually buy tickets for some people with Islamic names on the flights, and then they - you - would have real film evidence of them boarding? Instead these &quot;hijackers&quot; got on the flights without tickets, the footage shown of their boarding was so obviously faked that it was withdrawn after a few days and it took nearly two weeks for some names to be added to the passenger lists?  Why so fucking useless: because it was Made In America ? (No, I don&#39;t think so and, well, low blow).  </p>

<p>You - the group you belong to -  has never had to present any evidence, of course, that&#39;s why many members of your group share your confidence, the religious response. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The other side.</p>

<p>There has never been an &quot;other side&quot;. Propaganda supporters complete with amazing, wonderful media repitition repeat a conspiracy theory, while all kinds of people say &#39;X is impossible&#39;, &#39;Y is not true&quot;. Some may suggest what probably happened - as you correctly say, assumptions - but there is only one group trumpeting an organised conspiracy theory completely free of evidence or truth: you (the collective you). </p>

<p>Answer these questions:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm, interesting: ignoring everything related to the sillyness of the offical conspiracy theory when, at the same time staking a claim that your currency is &quot;evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>Hmm, interesting: implying completely and clearly dishonestly that I said that no plane hit the pentagon - a favourite terrified final attempt of the no-truth-at-any-price crowd - when I say the direct opposite to what you imply that I am said. You are into &quot;evidence&quot; huh?</p>

<p>So, the first one is really, really simple</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Were all the eye witnesses who saw the plane hit the pentagon lying?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Ummm, no. In more detail, the eyewitness accounts that I myself have read of a plane crashing in an almost impossible manover into an almost abandoned and just - as in an hour, ie that morning - finished section of a completely undefended Pentagon 90 minutes into an aknowledged terrorist attack are</p>

<ul>
<li><p>23 x saw airliner but not the impact</p></li>
<li><p>52 x saw the impact of an airliner  </p></li>
<li><p>4 x saw plane, not an airliner</p>

<pre><code>commuter plane [ 3 witnesses ]

wreckage of small plane
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>62 x made very aware of some type of impact</p></li>
<li><p>21 x saw something else</p>

<pre><code>a second plane, like a C-130, above the impacting airliner [ 8 witnesses]

One account: a pilot of a C-130 that just happened to be in the closed-to-all-planes 
     area after every plane in the United States had been ordered to to land.

didn&#39;t crash into the building...hitting the ground...wings fly forward 
     [a pilot with a clear evevated viewpoint]

plane hit ground first [ 4 more witnesses ]

the plane disappeared with effectively no wreckage [ 4 witnesses ]

impact and then, a second later, a/the explosion [ 3 witnesses ]

two explosions seconds apart [ 2 witnesses ]

saw propane tanks exploding after the impact

&quot;convinced it was a missile. It came in so fast it sounded nothing like an airplane.&quot;

a second explosion some minutes after impact [ 4 witnesses ]

&quot;I could smell the cordite. Then I knew explosives had been set off 
        somewhere.&quot; [ 1 more equivalent account ]

&quot;&quot;Most people knew it was a bomb&quot;

no (real) impact explosion. 

air traffic controller claimed that a plane he monitored, like a fighter, 
        diving for the white house and then pulling out.

no destruction of wall on initial impact (with second airplane following)

complete absense of airplane metal inside the impact hole
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>with many identifications of an American Airlines plane ( I didn&#39;t count, may do in the future). At the same time the first report on NBC said there had been an explosion near the Pentagon heliport with no mention of a plane and the first ABC reports cited eyewitnesses who said a business jet had crashed into the Pentagon.  </p>

<p>You see, one side has knowledge and evidence, the other has moronic propaganda. </p>

<pre><code>                                       -----------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>Your second point is in more typical propaganda supporter style. Based on lack of knowledge and the assumption (&quot;assumption&quot;, where have I heard that word before?) that because you have no idea... well, there can&#39;t be anything that you don&#39;t know about.... when you are in the middle of saying you don&#39;t know: &quot;What happened .... if it didn&#39;t ....?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What happened to the real plane and everyone aboard it if it didn&#39;t crash into the pentagon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your assumptions (where have I heard that word before?) </p>

<ul>
<li>and everyone on it</li>
</ul>

<p>Your assumption</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;if it didn&#39;t crash into the pentagon&quot;  - your words. </li>
</ul>

<p>you conclude by dishonestly putting words into my mouth</p>

<ul>
<li>it if it didn&#39;t crash into the pentagon?</li>
</ul>

<p>You are the only person who has suggested no plane hit the pentagon, a typical propaganda supporters lie. </p>

<hr/>

<p>One side has knowledge and evidence, the other has moronic propaganda. </p>

<p>Because of that, it can be ridiculed by the TeeVee talking heads who are also following their respective controlled corporate media rules or get fired and ridiculed and blacklisted from all MSM job possibilities in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That there&#39;s ample evidence to suggest, that eventhough we do not know the details, powerful elements of our elites have perpetrated a silent Coup d&#39;état and are consistently doing things that have a high probability of initiating catastrophic failures collapses with in a range of support-structures, ecosystems, societal structures, natural systems. </p>

<p>We have no answer as to how to mitigate most of the detrimental effects of this behavior and every natural system is in decline, to the extent that we&#39;ll be entering a mass extinction.</p>

<p>This amounts to collective suicide, though only a few are committing it consciously. </p>

<p>The <em>truth</em> is, that we do not have to be certain of the above, we merely have to demonstrate that it&#39;s probable. </p>

<p>The <em>truth</em> doesn&#39;t have to mean, thay we&#39;re 100% certain, the <em>truth</em> is, that we only have to know, that the compounded effects of our collective behavior will over time, a relatively short time, lead to massive collapse and massive suffering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s being orchestrated, I&#39;m saying their behavior has certain undeniable effects, and elites are not necessarily being rational about this, that&#39;s one problem. Many tyrants have taken themselves and their empires down with them.</p>

<p>As for the evidence of the decline of the systems that support life and the exhaustion of natural ressources, I think the evidence is clear and easy to come by. I&#39;ll take time tomorrow to source some central claims and go into more detail.</p>

<p>In many cases though, the burden of proof should not lie with me. It&#39;s an absurdity that we can just stripmine and drill and frack and factory farm merrily along till one day we all wake up and switch to some new game-changing technology without a hitch while we bring into the world another few billion people in the coming decades.</p>

<p>If for instance you hold that we can burn all of the fossile fuels on earth without setting off cascading collapses of the systems that support life, that&#39;s an interesting claim, that should be looked at.</p>

<p>I claim, that it would be pretty weird if it did not have a major impact on environmental systems, to realease vast amounts of pent up carbon into the atmosphere. The earth is a  very complex system, and we cannot know what will happen, but we cannot afford to wait and see. We have to be careful, we are not a necessity. It&#39;s very much within our grasp to destroy ourselves in a multitude of ways. </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ll collect a bunch of documentation on the decline of natural systems, I was talking about and post it tomorrow.</p>

<p>In the mean-time, you probably know these, but Albert Bartlett does a meaningful lecture on exponential growth and the natural world: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-QA2rkpBSY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-QA2rkpBSY</a></p>

<p>And Chris Martenson does a pretty good job too, I&#39;d say, eventhough he&#39;s not natural scientist: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WBiTnBwSWc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WBiTnBwSWc</a></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t watch the videos above and accepted what they said because it sounded right, I&#39;ve looked at the substance and checked the sources and found some claims to be weak, others to be very strong. The general trend is clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see how my statement means that I&#39;m unwilling/able to change my views depending on the evidence. I think I said the opposite many times in the thread.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t doubting everything exactly what you need to motivate you to look at the evidence? That&#39;s what drives me. I don&#39;t believe something, because an authority says so and I certainly don&#39;t believe anything, just because a non-authority or Alex Jones or whoever says it. I want to poke at the substance of any explanation and see if it holds up. </p>

<p>I read the 9/11 commission&#39;s report, for instance, and it&#39;s doesn&#39;t hold up. Nor does a lot of the other ideas about 9/11, nukes in the towers for instance. However, when you add all the strange things that happened on 9/11: WTC7, free-fall speed symmetrical collapses, powdered concrete, molten metal, stalled investigations, impossible maneuvers, failing air-defenses etc, the scale starts tipping towards a different explanation, and the idea that a controlled demolition was carried out become more viable than the official explanation. I can&#39;t be sure about a every detail and before a comprehensive investigation, a lot of this is guess work, but that does not mean, that we cannot say some things with a high degree of certainty, for instance that it&#39;s very improbable that two planes caused three major steel-framed buildings to collapse in a very short time. And that throws a monkey wrench in the official explanation, calling it all into question.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s outrageous or far-fetched and I don&#39;t accept that it&#39;s the result of bad reasoning or bad science. I read a lot of debunkers, and they&#39;re definitely on to something in some cases, but I&#39;ve yet to hear a good explanation of WTC7&#39;s collapse or the fact that WTC1 and 2 collapsed so quickly and suddenly. All I&#39;ve been able to find is: &quot;It never happened before, so you cannot say that our story is wrong, therefore it&#39;s correct and any &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; is wrong&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sceptical of many conspiracy theories and I don&#39;t see patterns everywhere. I don&#39;t reject anything out of hand either, though I find it somewhat unlikely that we&#39;re ruled by shapeshifting reptilians or that the universe is populated by all sorts of creatures who apparently come here for more or less devious purposes.</p>

<p>If there is evidence to support a conspiracy and evidence that suggests another, perhaps more benign explanation, they must be weighed against each other. And we do not have to come up with answers to everything, nor do we have to understand everything to it&#39;s full depth. I feel quite ok in the grey area, there are no black and whites.</p>

<p>That does not mean, we cannot have <em>enough</em> evidence to say what happened beyond reasonable doubt, or that we cannot project with any certainty what given courses of actions will result in.</p>

<p>To see conspiracies everywhere is paranoid and useless, but to reject any talk of conspiracies is absurd. History is full of conspiracies among the powerful and less powerful alike. Look at some of the shenanigans that&#39;ve gone on in the financial sector and ask, would any of that be possible without some coordination?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I truly mean it, I&#39;m not very convinced of anything. Gravity I&#39;m pretty sure of, though I don&#39;t understand the mechanism (heh). </p>

<p>I do think there&#39;s good evidence to support the idea, that most of the people who hold most of the wealth and most of our politicians, are corrupt sociopaths who aren&#39;t thinking about the common good, justice and the survival of humankind, but just their own egoes and their own comfort (which they erroneously believe will be intact when the rest of us go down the shitter). History is a long tale of the few taking from the many, and the many bending over most of the time.</p>

<p>And I still can&#39;t fucking believe I got 5 downvotes (at least) in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for stating that &quot;my scepticism is less selective [than that of those who do not entertain conspiracy theories]&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither do I, but being a pariah is really tiresome. On the other hand, having people who (perhaps unwittingly) participate in atrocities criticize you for pointing out the inequities and brutality of powerstructures and the exploitation of most of the population of the world, tell you there&#39;s something wrong with <em>you</em> just further infuriates me. Somehow I picture a Senator Palpatine in a dark room somewhere, wrenching his hands, smiling that devious smile as he speaks the words: &quot;yes, good, let the anger grow in you, embrace the dark side&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The power structures of our society have made it so that the citizenry polices itself on matters of social awareness. Those that are too aware, too knowledgeable, tend to give off the appearance of a &#39;tin foil hat&#39; persona, even if they don&#39;t openly share that world view consistently.</p>

<p>Personally, I try to keep quiet most of the time because I&#39;m very alone in my thinking where I live. Even my significant other, who will tolerate my ranting when we are alone in the house, does not agree with me on most topics. She is not convinced that things are connected in the way that I am.</p>

<p>Yet years of research and reading history have taught me that the world is a stage, and nearly everything that we are sold as the official truth has an agenda, whether overt or hidden.</p>

<p>I think, however, that the powers that be are becoming more and more wreckless. There has never been more awareness of the evil that is perpetrated by the system that so many are still enslaved to. The question is this: when the time comes, will it be enough?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know the answer to that. In my gut, I feel like the majority are woefully unprepared to hear the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t come off too strongly. There are always like minded people around, just maybe not on the same level and probably feeling the same alienation as you. I have found that when I post relevant news articles and such (on social sites with people I know in real life), keep it short - people don&#39;t like to read, then you&#39;ll find the same few people liking it or commenting. These people are either aware of the truth or open to it. Start slowly, and people will listen. 
That being said, the majority of people will not listen to what you have to say simply because it is very inconvenient to know the things that this community seeks to know.
Also, don&#39;t blast the information all the time, it gets tiresome.
A good example is Ron Paul. This dude probably knows more than any of us on these matters but he&#39;s not going to throw out everything all at once, he speaks in elementary terms, omitting alot of the meat because people want to be spoon fed, at least at first.
Lastly, it has to be intriguing so don&#39;t say too much and let the people discover for themselves so that they can have a sense of ownership to the information involved.
Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first off, no matter how you say what you want to say, you are going to sound crazy. </p>

<p>So the first thing to do is to get informed, don&#39;t even say anything to anybody unless you are fully confident and well researched in your argument. I didn&#39;t really feel comfortable talking to other people until I had a discussion with a philosophy professor and held my own actually quite well. For me, the easiest way to understand what&#39;s going on is by breaking down our world into different categories (Finance/economics, history, domestic politics, foreign politics, social/cultural, propaganda etc.). It&#39;s like middle school and having to relearn a curriculum.</p>

<p>The second thing you need to do is cite all of your information when you speak to someone. Nobody has enough clout on their own to completely flip another person&#39;s world view without a little help. Some good people to bring up are Andrew Jackson, George Orwell, Thomas Jefferson, JFK, and so on. These are people much more reputable than you, no matter who you are. Don&#39;t cite Alex Jones or anybody in the conspiracy world. People will think you&#39;re a nut since they think Alex is a nut.</p>

<p>The third thing is to pick your battles. Don&#39;t try and persuade people who you know are bullheaded or hopelessly entrenched in their false reality. They will know in time. Instead, talk to the people who seem confused by the politics or frustrated at the government. These people have usually decided that something is wrong, and will be more receptive to these ideas. </p>

<p>Fourth, don&#39;t try and unload everything at once. Spend time actually conversing on a single topic, not just ranting at people. Asking questions and listening can make it seem like you care, when in reality you know this person is just repeating lies told to him/her. Ask the big questions too, like &quot;Did you know the Fed is a private corporation incorporated in Delaware?&quot;</p>

<p>Fifth, if people don&#39;t like it, oh well. It&#39;s not your job to save everybody in the world. In fact it&#39;s impossible. A lot of people aren&#39;t asking you to do this either. If people see you getting angry or frustrated for not believing you then you will definitely look like a psychopath. When people start to look uncomfortable or change the topic, just shut up about it. You can lead a horse to water... you know the rest.</p>

<p>Also, if you want to have &quot;good relations&quot; then you should just keep quiet about it. That&#39;s the easiest way. </p>

<p>Also people are not &quot;sleeping babies.&quot; They&#39;re hard-working, law-abiding citizens who have been cheated and lied to all of their life. Thousands, maybe millions have been killed through illegal wars, state-sponsored terrorism, and &quot;soft killing.&quot; The &quot;natural way of things&quot; is for these people to learn nothing and eventually die never knowing the truth.

    <div class="md"><p>What, exactly, is the alternative? Are you going to force people out of their &quot;sedation?&quot; You&#39;ve previously stated that you don&#39;t think you have a monopoly on truth, so why are you still going on about most people somehow being exempt from it?  </p>

That statement only holds true if you&#39;re taking the entire human race into account, and not holding a single entity accountable for all those deaths.

<p>To paint a very easy example; I&#39;m sure you agree that it&#39;s not the US&#39; job to be the world&#39;s police force-- well, by the same coin, it&#39;s not your job to &#39;fix&#39; everyone else into accepting your world view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but I kinda like to debate people and usually they don&#39;t have the arguments. Claiming to have the truth or not is besides the point, the question is what we can demonstrate. </p>

<p>For instance, it&#39;s uncontroversial that there&#39;s an international law, that the US kinda created, that forbids wars of aggression and with that law, we hanged the nazis. Well... then if we look at the law and the invasion of Iraq, we see that it constituted the warcrime aggression and should result in procecution and conviction, that is <em>under functioning rule of law</em>.</p>

<p>Since it is not, this becomes one piece of evidence for a statement like: &quot;the powerful nations are exempt from international law&quot;. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not a matter of you and me having two different opinions, it&#39;s not a question of whether blue or purple is pretty, it&#39;s objective reality.</p>

<p>And by the wanton slaughter of millions, I&#39;m of course talking about the assault on Iraq and Afghanistan. It&#39;s again uncontroversial, though the figures can be debated, that since 1990, the US and her allies have been responsible for at least 2 million excess deaths in Iraq. That&#39;s how we count in every other conflict, that&#39;s how we counted in Rwanda for instance. And if it were &quot;only&quot; a thousand bombed by the US for no good reason, it would still be wrong, it&#39;s murder, it&#39;s a crime, it must be prosecuted or there is no rule of law, no universality of law. Yes, it&#39;s my prerogative and the duty of every human to say: &quot;What the fuck! Don&#39;t do that, especially not with my money, unless you can demonstrate a REALLY fucking good reason&quot;... And we all know about the &quot;reasons&quot;.</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s the idea that you can equate the US &quot;policing&quot; [sic] the world with me trying to debate people rationally and getting mad. Really? You&#39;re putting global violence and a vast imperial, military prescene in the same category as a heated debate?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not my job to fix people&#39;s views, but how can anyone remain silent? I don&#39;t get it? There&#39;s no justification. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I better go over here and not try to fix people&#39;s world view, who am I to think that slavery is wrong or that women should vote or that it&#39;s wrong to commit atrocities. All opinions are ok, there is no real objective reality, just our different views of it&quot;.</p>

<p>COME ON!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s very sound advice, I&#39;ll try my hardest to take it. I wrote the post to begin with because I keep fucking things up with people, getting them upset and getting mad, that they seem to not care about 3 million dead iraqis, while if you say that 5 million and not 6 million jews died, you&#39;re looked at very funny.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like these people, people I know and like, have internalized most of what the media says, and therefore, replies with the conventional misinformation (and irrationality), whenever I try to apply reason to a discussion. And being pissed at the media for being scum, I may transfer that anger onto these people. Not a very good idea, unless I want to live in a cabin in a deep, dark forest somewhere.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m putting way to much energy into this and it&#39;s just, in my own self-analysis, a way of letting out steam, because I carry around a lot of anger about other shit, that I can&#39;t really get out.</p>

<p>Anyway... Thank you so much for the advice.</p>

<p>Edit: Sometimes I feel, and it&#39;s probably incorrect, that if everyone would just become as enraged about some of the really horrid stuff as I am, then things would have to change... Probably not the case. Probably can&#39;t do it anyway... Probably would carry a lot of negative side-effects... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just tired of talking about banalities when the world is burning. It&#39;s like discussing the decoration and making plans for tomorrow&#39;s dinner on the sinking Titanic.</p>

<p>I mean, I would&#39;ve gladly given my puny existence up to save some of the people whose untimely, gruesome deaths I&#39;m partially responsible for. I cannot help but feel a real responsibility for NOT being able to do and say enough to stop, for instance, the invasion in &#39;03. And the way it&#39;s ignored here and everywhere, in the US too, is sickening. These are real people, lots of them, torn to pieces, mutilated, burned, disfigured, poisoned, their livelyhoods taken from them, every imaginable horror of industrialized warfare unleashed upon hundreds of thousands of innocent people, and we have the audacity to blame them.</p>

<p>We want to forget, those most responsible want to forget the most, and therefore it&#39;s not acceptable at the table, but &quot;support the troops!&quot; is honky dory, cos all of my family are fucking arm-chair generals. Only my dad and I served, my nephew wants to go to Afghanistan. This IS fucking personal for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless they are philosophers then they will probably be offended by a philosophical debate. People don&#39;t like to have their beliefs challenged without invitation. Nor should you feel like it is you responsibility to change their minds. When Christians preach and someone converts it&#39;s because something inside of them already believed/wanted to believe. You should be doing the same thing, not changing peoples minds but looking for a common link to reach through to them. You should be looking for people more like you, not trying to turn people into you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve all felt those same feelings at some point in our journey, I know I have.  Personally, I have turned a corner recently in regards to that, because while I still share those same frustrations, I have managed to shift my perspective to be more inclusive and understanding of the lack of awareness.  It should be embraced for the sake of challenge no different than the pursuit of awareness. I have realized that this is our purpose, <strong>those of us interested in these subjects at this time,</strong> to help TELL the story so that we can shift into New Earth.  We are beings of light, incarnated here to spread understanding from our perspective in the intention of good. Those who still have the blinders on?  Forgive them.  They are victims not unlike ourselves.  I no longer try to <em>convince</em> people.  Instead I have learned to love life by accepting <strong>MY</strong> soul purpose on this earth - spreading light/information.  Learn the law of attraction.  Know it.  When you do, you might be able to enjoy life by manifesting the right people into your experience so you can achieve your inner most desires.  It&#39;s all about finding those who are receptive to the SEED of truth.  Plant it, tend to it, so it can then blossom into reality as time marches onward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But at some point, should we not be able to arrive at some understandings, even partial ones, that cause us to act? If we don&#39;t believe there&#39;s any possibility of reaching a state where we&#39;ve accumulated the necessary information in order to act, how do we ever change anything?</p>

<p>The apathy in the face of the indefensible, because we can always question the premises, is hard to handle. There is no way to be sure of anything.</p>

<p>I&#39;m mostly concerned with the fact that we have a monetary system that does certain things. Though I do not necessarily understand all the intricacies of it, I can easily see by empirical method that it&#39;s resulting in the concentration of wealth and ownership in the hands of the few and a scramble towards exhausting every natural ressource as fast as possible. </p>

<p>If we wait for absolute proof, it&#39;ll be too late. </p>

<p>The truth, I&#39;m talking about, is that reality doesn&#39;t give a shit about why we let someone torch the planet, but we&#39;ll sure as hell be subject to the effects of the collective impact we&#39;re having.</p>

<p>I maintain a facebook account which I have used to slowly educate approximately two dozen people. Most of the time I post humorous images and personal anecdotes. I intersperse those postings with news stories relating to the economy, the current wars, and our government&#39;s role in the erosion of our constittutional rights. I rarely post anything about 9-11, as the events of that day bring out the kind of emotions that shouldn&#39;t be tampered with.  </p>

<p>Last, in my day to day personal interactions with others, I find that listening gets you much better results than talking. Listen to people. You&#39;ll be surprised how many people have their reservations with our leaders, our government, and the future of mankind. That&#39;s when you nod your head in agreement and take the conversation a step further. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are all part of a processes that goes back past the big bang and will continue on into infinity. We are the universe come to life and the little games that humanity plays will be but distant stories of how different bits of the universe killed or enslaved or used other bits of the universe to make themselves feel better. My point being, its amazing that we can experience the forever NOW that is existence and perhaps there are deeper truths in the cosmos than what the &quot;elite&quot; are &quot;planning&quot; or doing on this tiny little planet. Humanity is a mess, but we are no more or less a mess than the rest of the universe and we&#39;ve also invented the ideas of love and peace and harmony. Let us focus our attention on the better parts of our humanity and let the future of the universe worry about itself.</p>

<p>As for enlightening other people, this is impossible. You would never have learned what you learned unless you were ready and wanted to learn, so don&#39;t expect to be able to forcefully make someone see the world the way you have grown to see it. Instead, realize that there are universal truths that perhaps mean more and are easier to get across than conspiracy and secret evil behind the scenes. Thought is just a chemical reaction in the brain, and its amazing enough that we can understand each other at all in the grand scheme of things, so be kind and plant a seed or two here and there and try to understand that you are no better or worse than those around you. We are all just trying to figure this shit out called existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>that every society, is in decline</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This complaint has been repeated at basically every time in history. A lot of is just that everything seemed better when you were young and naive. Some if it is the impossibility of pleasing all the people all the time - for example half the things I&#39;d list as recent societal accomplishments would be described as elements of moral decay by other people. Even the economic downturn of the last decade is a matter of perspective, since half the success stories in the 90s were just riding a bubble underpinned by shady dealings in real estate and insane exuberance for technology. </p>

<p>As for the wider question... have you considered that maybe you <em>aren&#39;t</em> the smartest guy in the room? I know I rarely am.  <em>Argument ad populum</em> is a fallacy, yes, but like most fallacies, it&#39;s based on correlation. It&#39;s reason enough to reconsider your beliefs dispassionately. If everybody else has access to the same sources as you and they don&#39;t freak out when you share the specific data that convinced you of your current positions, maybe they&#39;re not paid off or indolent or in denial. Maybe they simply disagree with your conclusions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I&#39;m rarely the smartest man in the room. I may not be the dumbest either. But I can tell the difference between people looking at the data and coming to a rational conclusion and people, regardless of intelligence, ignoring a lot of the evidence or putting way to much emphasis on the format and the sender. It does really appear, that many people, even very smart ones, refuse to believe or take seriously anything that doesn&#39;t appear on the news or anything that, if they really integrated it, would mean massive personal change would be an imperative.</p>

<p>I do like to listen to and read what smart people say about the things. That&#39;s why I started worrying about them: the inevitable collapse of an economy based on perpetual growth within a finite system, 
the impact we&#39;re having on our habitat, the fact that we&#39;ve no idea what we&#39;re gonna run our society on or how we&#39;ll support the population&#39;s basic needs in the future, the irresponsible behavior of elites throughout history and now and the injustices that are so prevalent everywhere.</p>

<p>I find that the (few) smart people who do look at those things are very alarmed too. Maybe they&#39;re too smart to point fingers, maybe they&#39;re smarter than me and know that no one has toes or fingers enough to point and that we&#39;re all part of the problem.</p>

<p>I just fear that many people, as I used to, have a capacity to close their eyes to the unbearable. I don&#39;t, anymore, don&#39;t know where it went, lost my sense of invulnerability and started seeing how we as a whole are wasting so much on unnecessary things and behaviors, while the most basic needs of people everywhere go unmet. How much of our &quot;economic&quot; activity is useless and doesn&#39;t produce anything. How much of our lives are wasted because we insist on an outlandish system of government, voting and trade.</p>

<p>I realize now that I came off pretty arrogant with my choice of words. I don&#39;t have all the answers, but it is very intuitive and obviously correct, that we cannot mine the world of everything we need for everything we do, turning it into garbage and pouring it in the sea, and then expect technology to save us. </p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll obliterate ourselves our end up in a new dark age. And I don&#39;t see us taking those very real risks any bit as serious, on a grand scale, as we do profit margins and dividends.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid we may be hooked on a lot of drugs as a society, and we&#39;re behaving like a raging herion-addict, thinking about that next fix as gangrene sets in and our last tooth is falling out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes living in an illuison makes you happier than facing the grim reality. A reality which a man alone cannot change. Some people choose the illusion and you should respect their choice.</p>

<p>If you want people to listen to you, you should start with small bits of information and only talk about topics about which your knowledge is not partly speculative, where everything you say can be verified by an internet-research without a doubt. If people are interested in learning the truth, they themselves will take the necessary steps.</p>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t force a discussion on people who are not interested in the topics you want to discuss. Bombarding people with information is often counterproductive. A much better approach is to invoke interest and curiosity in other people by humbly asking them questions about things they might have never pondered about before.</p>

But I tell them these things (basically everything you wrote and more) because they need to know the truth. This world is a fucked up place, were in complete turmoil, and its sad. I want people to open there eyes. If all of America opened there eyes, we could overthrow the government. There are alot more citizens then there are higher ups. But everyone is caught up in there own lives to see how things really are, and it makes me sick. It really upsets me..I hate everything we are as a society. MONEY, GREED, and POWER have destroyed us completely. If money was never invented then maybe we would be ok. Thats just my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I&#39;ve learned in my occult and esoteric studies is to only divulge information if/when asked.  If advise/critique (or what you believe to be truth) is given prior to their notice (asking), it will fall upon deaf ears and will only (in most cases) push them further away from the light.  Casting pearls before swine.  It&#39;s hard to patiently wait for one&#39;s path to bring them down the way of enlightenment and dissolving the official &quot;truth&quot;, especially if you see it causing harm and suffering.  All this is necessary for their own journey of understanding.  To take that away from them is to essentially give them the answers to the test of life.  How can they really evolve/adapt/learn if one is forcing them the questions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Medical student here (3rd year).   It&#39;s fucking hard, and you&#39;re going to often times in conversation have to consciously bite your tongue, let something go, or even worse, ignore the truth.  You have a responsibility to yourself to not alienate yourself, as eventually there will be a time when people open their eyes to this clusterfuck, and people like you need to be there for these people on the other side.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also in for another, ruder (almost) awakening in a couple years when you&#39;ve seen past the curtain for so damned long that it becomes as normal to you as living in blindness is to them.  A wise man once wrote &quot;be amongst men, not of them.&quot;  </p>

<p>And, sadly, the bottom line is that you can&#39;t save everyone.  Would I love to save every crack baby on the obgyn floor from going home to a cracked out mother if we didn&#39;t have enough to call services?  You bet your ass I would.   Would I like to sit down with every depressed person running through the offices I rotate in and explain to them (meticulously) that they&#39;re frustrated about minutia at best and poisonous lies at worst?  Oh, hells to the yeah.   The bottom line is I can&#39;t--they&#39;d all call me crazy.</p>

<p>You see, the way our society has been molded, we&#39;re all basically (we=conspiracy theorists) herded into one generic minority, complete with looneys, fuckers, trolls, and outright morons.  It doesn&#39;t matter what logic, reasoning, and science back our claims--as long as the word conspiracy is attached, it&#39;s going to be shot down.</p>

<p>That&#39;s by design, by the way.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that you need to stay strong.  Be happy.  Live a good life, and live in harmony with the Divine, and you will serve as an example.  Once they admire you, then you can teach them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the saddest moments in my life was when I realized my parents, both of whom are incredibly smart college professors, had absolutely zero interest in hearing me out. My dad entertains the occasional truth from me, but with a smile on his face that I&#39;ve learned means he is not processing a word of what he hears. My mom is in the &quot;well wouldn&#39;t we have heard of this on the news?&quot; camp. On the other hand, if you can find a friend that thinks similarly it helps. A lot. Theres this guy I go to college with, we had never been anything but distant friends until we both ended up drunk at a party talking about Bilderbergs. Now, while we don&#39;t see each other that often, we constantly bounce ideas off of each other and talk about the latest wacky shit we&#39;ve learned (from the NWO to tulpas to underwater aliens lol). </p>

<p>.
<strong>After reading more of this thread, I want to back up the &quot;lead by example&quot; suggestion.</strong> Find something that you can do in your community to improve your community. That can be almost anything. All of my ideas involve computer programming/making information easier to access, but it can seriously be ANYTHING positive. A community garden, volunteering, buy a bunch of brats and burgers and beer and grill for everyone in the neighborhood, help local businesses advertise or fix their store, simply be nice to people. If people see you as a positive force in the community, they are much more likely to want to hear what you have to say. I&#39;m not going to lie, I&#39;ve been doing this on a minor scale and it really helps your self confidence. People that don&#39;t even know me seem to find me easier to approach and talk to lately. People that have known me comment on the good changes I&#39;ve made in my life. Start by improving yourself and your immediate surroundings and the rest will follow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some personal observations/strategies:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>People are busy and/or lazy: they will wake up when they have to, not earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>The bulk of humanity are followers. If it weren&#39;t so, there would be chaos.</p></li>
<li><p>Are things getting better or worse in terms of human liberation? If they are getting worse, work on saving yourself rather than humanity. Try to amass resources and options. Try to keep your personal identity sanitized so you are a low-priority target of the state.</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re serious about changing the world think in terms of a hundred year plan (I think the Second Republic Project may be thinking along these lines: <a href="http://secondrepublicproject.com/our-mission/">http://secondrepublicproject.com/our-mission/</a>). That&#39;s how things get done. When attempting to enact a hundred year plan you will be less likely to waste your energy on frustration with individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Given what is needed to change the world, ask yourself if you really want to sacrifice your own life for the collective. You&#39;re going to die and, even in ideal circumstances, humanity itself is going to die assuming we don&#39;t colonize other planets. Earth has gone through many extinction events (with the bulk of species becoming extinct) and eventually the Sun will burn out.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything is cyclical. Empires/world orders mostly collapse through corruption/incompetence rather than resistance. It&#39;s unlikely that today&#39;s world order will be the last.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>You are confronted with a totally natural reaction.  </p>

<p>When you go stirring up what someone has always believed in, you will initially most always get this sort of response.  Paradoxally, it seems the more people are educated (r/science), the harder it is to convince them that their beliefs have been wrong all along. One needs to be <em>gentle, non-insistant</em>. Do not <strong>ever</strong> expect to change a crowd of people&#39;s opinion by blurting out and trying to impose your beliefs on them: you will most always get bad results, + you will just pass off as the crazy freak that&#39;s hung-up on &#39;conspiracies&#39;.</p>

<p>Most people (blindly) trust the world around them.  The government, the laws that protect them, the medias, last but not least, their religion.
I used to feel upset like you, I mean <strong>people did not get it</strong>, no matter how much a shit-load of facts I poured on them. </p>

<p>Then, with time I changed my approach. People need to feel THEY came to the conclusion by themselves. Some do not even WANT to change their beliefs and will hang on to the security of what they have always known to be the truth. <strong>You have to respect that</strong>,  or be prepared to lose friends.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I take it slowly. Lay down the facts, present the links, and ASK for an opinion. For example, in <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> I would probably try something like:
Anyone care to look at these videos and tell me if it is just hype?  People will look, some will figure it out right away, some others will have the &#39;seed of doubt&#39; planted in them. Some of those freshly seeded souls will not be convinced right away, <em>heck it may take months, even years</em> but the doubt is instilled in their conscience and when the issue presents itself or more facts are presented from a different medium at a later time, the balance will tilt.</p>

<p><strong>Convincing others is not so important</strong>, I tend to inform people of what I know and tell them to not believe my word on it, go look it up. Then, I try not to get emotional when their view differs from mine. Who am I to judge them as being of a more limited mindset? After all, I cannot claim to have the absolute truth on all those matters, just a bunch of theories backed by a couple of facts. With luck if enough people believe those facts, then you can hope for change. But like I said, this takes time, patience and a lot of tact.</p>

<p>On a related side-note, try not to get caught up in all this conspiracy-minded attitude.  Relax. If you are becoming paranoid over all this, it is having a negative impact on your life and in a sense &#39;they&#39; have won over you.  Conspiracies have always been a part of life, and will always be.  Focus on living your life to the fullest, and enjoy it while you can.  Happiness and inner peace, my friend is what we all should strive for, and this cannot be taxed or controlled by 3rd party elites of any kind.</p>

<p>Cheers to you and your loved ones, take care bro.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t a coincidence, those science types require evidence and reasoning based on logical principles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know the right answer to that question, but here&#39;s what I do. To my friends and family who do not agree with me about an issue, I just don&#39;t bring up the issue. If they ask for my opinion, my honest opinion is given; no lecture or speech to reaffirm my point is given unless specifically asked for. </p>

<p>In terms of alienating people because of believing different things, that&#39;s completely normal. If someone believes soccer is really fun and I don&#39;t believe it, we wont have that as a common interest. If there aren&#39;t enough things you have in common with someone, you wont be friends. I don&#39;t see this as exclusive to truth vs non truth. </p>

<p>hope that helps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just need to be smarter about it is all.  You can&#39;t be gun ho about it.  Example</p>

<p>Last night i went out with some friends i haven&#39;t hung out in awhile and we went to IHOP for some late night chicken and waffles and other breakfast grub.  As we are getting our cash out to pay, i pull out some ones and fold them so the all seeing pyramid is facing up and proceed to read it after i put it on the table (although i already knew what it said :)  ).  My friend notice and grabs his tip dollar and asks &quot;do you know what it says under the pyramid&quot;.  I look at it and the words at top.... &quot;I think nuevo ordero sverco means &quot;Serve New Order&quot;&quot;.  They go huh and ask if i knew why its on there (econ/finance major me, so they assume i would know).  I talk about how the the all seeing eye is a common seal and its found in a lot of places, yet no one knows why it is really chosen.  I kept it real &quot;casual&quot; until someone at the table finally got it and asked &quot;do you think its like a plot by some new world order conspiracy thingy&quot;.  I just smiled and said &quot; I have done some research, i don&#39;t know what to believe, but even if it is all false, its an interesting fictional storyline about our history&quot;.  We left but one of my friends asked me on the way out what would be a good start to look up.  I told them to look up denver international airport conspiracy for starters, because it is one of the few conspiracies that has a lot of factual evidence.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been tough for myself, growing up in a family that are willing to be ignorant and to some who have admitted to me that they are afraid to learn and read into the truths out there and often hear the following, &quot;<em>To be honest, I don&#39;t like to think about this kind of stuff...it scares me a bit</em>&quot; Which is a nice way of saying, please stop. It does at times feel, or at least at first, that I preached to them, like i spoke the gospel when I didn&#39;t fully understand some of the things I was saying, which is very <em>very</em> wrong. So I stopped, looked into the information I was reading and thoroughly researched it so I could determine what was pretty much the truth from the pile of garbage that the general public is exposed to, information that is purposefully put out there to put people off from looking deeper into the rabbit hole and seeing how their daily lives are run on a daily basis and to learn the truth. </p>

<p>It was a massive wake up call for me, and I can really testify to the usage of the phrase &#39;waking up&#39; even though it is widely used today because that&#39;s exactly how it felt and not only this, I felt like my whole world both intellectually and socially evolved and matured and I felt different. I was watching the world as if I was watching an ant farm, all the people around me oblivious to the true goings on and the true beauty of the world that they could see and experience if only they cared less about what happens next in their tv programme or what fashion trend they must adhere to to be part of the social norm. Which is what exactly scares people today in having an opinion, because they know if they do they would be ridiculed and put to test for their theories and opinions. To them and you who are like that I say FUCK THAT mindset. Seriously fuck it. What&#39;s the point in not having your own opinion and believing lies just because they air them on the news on TV. FUCK THAT. </p>

<p>The best thing I did was to talk to my dad and let everything out. Literally I let my brain pour out all the things I was reading into during the beginning. Keeping in mind my dad is pretty black and white when it comes to this stuff, very much &quot;if it ain&#39;t in front of me and I can&#39;t see it...it ain&#39;t real&quot; kinda guy. So I knew he&#39;d retort aggressively which he did. But that&#39;s okay, I was prepared for such a reaction. </p>

<p>The thing I&#39;m trying to figure out, or at least was, as much as the next person is religion. Specifically the Bible and to find out why it has so many contradictions. Well the very fact the humans wrote it, pretty much solved that one, apart from a few things. I have my own opinions to that which makes complete sense, I won&#39;t say it here because over time I have learnt not to go all guns blazing out in the open because sooner or later your opinion is going to get shot down by someone if not everyone. So if you are interested, pm and I&#39;ll share to whatever degree you wish me to. </p>

<p>TL;DR: Don&#39;t go guns blazing with all the info you have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an epistimological and conceptual dead end. When I say truth, I mean that which the evidence points towards, I do not hold beliefs I claim to be unfalsifiable. </p>

<p>Language betrays us again. I started out far, far from my standpoint and I go where the evidence takes me. I do not cherry pick, though I have found some sources to be notoriously unreliable.</p>

<p>Being alone with the truth means, in my view, that most people do not take the effort to even scratch at the surface of our, as Chomsky calls them, &quot;necessary illussions&quot;. Perhaps I should have asked: &quot;How to handle being one of the few people who ask hard questions, that have scary, unsettling answers a lot of the time&quot;.</p>

<p>I am ready to give up any belief I hold. And I do not like black and whites. I realize that negatives cannot be proven, and that there&#39;s a long stretch from what society and people in general deem &quot;impossible&quot; (really: &quot;in my view improbable&quot;) to what is actually physically impossible (or EXTREMELY improbable - like the spontaneous conversion of one element into another).</p>

<p>I suppose what I meant to say was that I&#39;m really fucking confused, but I can discern som trends and I can assign varying probablities to different scenarios with greater and greater certainty with more data available.</p>

<p><strong>But yeah, it&#39;s kinda funny that I asked how to deal with being alone with something I claim to have said I DO NOT possess.</strong></p>

<p>*Edit : And in all honesty, I would very much like it to be true, that we fight for truth and freedom, that we do good, but given the data available, I think our superimposition of various justifications and explanations are sickening. In all likelyhood, for instance, the death-toll of the Iraq conflict from 1990 till now is roughly 3 million people. There&#39;s a lot of noise around that fact, babbling about terrorists and freedom and demoracy and wmd&#39;s, but if we look at just the data, Iraq was destroyed by us for no good reason, resulting in massive suffering for millions. That&#39;s an objective analysis of the data available. </p>

<p>One of the beefs I have with the state of affairs, is that apparently, I have to be a statitician to say what I said above. To criticize the official story of 9/11 I have to be an explosives expert, an engineer and a pilot and probably more. What credentials do I need to propagate and feel justified in my belief in the &quot;official story&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see how my statement means that I&#39;m unwilling/able to change my views depending on the evidence. I think I said the opposite many times in the thread.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t doubting everything exactly what you need to motivate you to look at the evidence? That&#39;s what drives me. I don&#39;t believe something, because an authority says so and I certainly don&#39;t believe anything, just because a non-authority or Alex Jones or whoever says it. I want to poke at the substance of any explanation and see if it holds up. </p>

<p>I read the 9/11 commission&#39;s report, for instance, and it&#39;s doesn&#39;t hold up. Nor does a lot of the other ideas about 9/11, nukes in the towers for instance. However, when you add all the strange things that happened on 9/11: WTC7, free-fall speed symmetrical collapses, powdered concrete, molten metal, stalled investigations, impossible maneuvers, failing air-defenses etc, the scale starts tipping towards a different explanation, and the idea that a controlled demolition was carried out become more viable than the official explanation. I can&#39;t be sure about a every detail and before a comprehensive investigation, a lot of this is guess work, but that does not mean, that we cannot say some things with a high degree of certainty, for instance that it&#39;s very improbable that two planes caused three major steel-framed buildings to collapse in a very short time. And that throws a monkey wrench in the official explanation, calling it all into question.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s outrageous or far-fetched and I don&#39;t accept that it&#39;s the result of bad reasoning or bad science. I read a lot of debunkers, and they&#39;re definitely on to something in some cases, but I&#39;ve yet to hear a good explanation of WTC7&#39;s collapse or the fact that WTC1 and 2 collapsed so quickly and suddenly. All I&#39;ve been able to find is: &quot;It never happened before, so you cannot say that our story is wrong, therefore it&#39;s correct and any &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; is wrong&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sceptical of many conspiracy theories and I don&#39;t see patterns everywhere. I don&#39;t reject anything out of hand either, though I find it somewhat unlikely that we&#39;re ruled by shapeshifting reptilians or that the universe is populated by all sorts of creatures who apparently come here for more or less devious purposes.</p>

<p>If there is evidence to support a conspiracy and evidence that suggests another, perhaps more benign explanation, they must be weighed against each other. And we do not have to come up with answers to everything, nor do we have to understand everything to it&#39;s full depth. I feel quite ok in the grey area, there are no black and whites.</p>

<p>That does not mean, we cannot have <em>enough</em> evidence to say what happened beyond reasonable doubt, or that we cannot project with any certainty what given courses of actions will result in.</p>

<p>To see conspiracies everywhere is paranoid and useless, but to reject any talk of conspiracies is absurd. History is full of conspiracies among the powerful and less powerful alike. Look at some of the shenanigans that&#39;ve gone on in the financial sector and ask, would any of that be possible without some coordination?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but I kinda like to debate people and usually they don&#39;t have the arguments. Claiming to have the truth or not is besides the point, the question is what we can demonstrate. </p>

<p>For instance, it&#39;s uncontroversial that there&#39;s an international law, that the US kinda created, that forbids wars of aggression and with that law, we hanged the nazis. Well... then if we look at the law and the invasion of Iraq, we see that it constituted the warcrime aggression and should result in procecution and conviction, that is <em>under functioning rule of law</em>.</p>

<p>Since it is not, this becomes one piece of evidence for a statement like: &quot;the powerful nations are exempt from international law&quot;. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not a matter of you and me having two different opinions, it&#39;s not a question of whether blue or purple is pretty, it&#39;s objective reality.</p>

<p>And by the wanton slaughter of millions, I&#39;m of course talking about the assault on Iraq and Afghanistan. It&#39;s again uncontroversial, though the figures can be debated, that since 1990, the US and her allies have been responsible for at least 2 million excess deaths in Iraq. That&#39;s how we count in every other conflict, that&#39;s how we counted in Rwanda for instance. And if it were &quot;only&quot; a thousand bombed by the US for no good reason, it would still be wrong, it&#39;s murder, it&#39;s a crime, it must be prosecuted or there is no rule of law, no universality of law. Yes, it&#39;s my prerogative and the duty of every human to say: &quot;What the fuck! Don&#39;t do that, especially not with my money, unless you can demonstrate a REALLY fucking good reason&quot;... And we all know about the &quot;reasons&quot;.</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s the idea that you can equate the US &quot;policing&quot; [sic] the world with me trying to debate people rationally and getting mad. Really? You&#39;re putting global violence and a vast imperial, military prescene in the same category as a heated debate?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not my job to fix people&#39;s views, but how can anyone remain silent? I don&#39;t get it? There&#39;s no justification. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I better go over here and not try to fix people&#39;s world view, who am I to think that slavery is wrong or that women should vote or that it&#39;s wrong to commit atrocities. All opinions are ok, there is no real objective reality, just our different views of it&quot;.</p>
