       Last night i went out with some friends i haven't hung out in awhile and we went to IHOP for some late night chicken and waffles and other breakfast grub. As we are getting our cash out to pay, i pull out some ones and fold them so the all seeing pyramid is facing up and proceed to read it after i put it on the table (although i already knew what it said :) ). My friend notice and grabs his tip dollar and asks "do you know what it says under the pyramid". I look at it and the words at top.... "I think nuevo ordero sverco means "Serve New Order"". They go huh and ask if i knew why its on there (econ/finance major me, so they assume i would know). I talk about how the the all seeing eye is a common seal and its found in a lot of places, yet no one knows why it is really chosen. I kept it real "casual" until someone at the table finally got it and asked "do you think its like a plot by some new world order conspiracy thingy". I just smiled and said " I have done some research, i don't know what to believe, but even if it is all false, its an interesting fictional storyline about our history". We left but one of my friends asked me on the way out what would be a good start to look up. I told them to look up denver international airport conspiracy for starters, because it is one of the few conspiracies that has a lot of factual evidence.

       tl;dr
       <strong>
        You can't teach this to anyone. You need to allow people to "discover the truth" by themselves, or they will always think you have an agenda. You can help them by presenting vague topics or what not, but don't be blatant obvious.

       <strong>
        My advice for talking about things to people:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Never really "believe" what you're theorizing about. It is a theory for that reason. Consider it completely, but never consider it a fact.
       </li>
       <li>
        Relay, when discussing these topics to people, that you don't necessarily believe it to be truth, but logically it makes sense. Tell them that whether or not it's the case, it's still absolutely possible. And in some instances, seems the most reasonable when you consider it.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Point being, nobody is going to believe something that's theory as fact. Because it isn't. It's just an option. As long as you approach it this way, people tend to understand you're not crazy, and that you're really just kind of intelligent and think about abstract things. Try it. And to anybody who does kind of obsess in the sense that they believe everything as absolute fact (despite only logical theoretical evidence in most instances), it's ok to consider things, and not adhere to them and base your life around them. You need to leave your mind open to possibility. Consider and until its certain, only consider. Not trying to be redundant. Just seems some take it to a religious level, and that's not a good approach in my opinion. I don't know. In closing, a quote from Aristotle. One of my favorites. :)

       People tend to blow off all conspiracies as fairy tales for some reason.  But they need to realize, conspiracies are real and our history is littered with secret plots.  That is a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now some conspiracy theories might get a little outlandish and turn people off, but that is why they are still theories and have not yet made the transition to conspiracy fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil people like to conspire in secret;  it is the conspiracy theorist's job to find the facts about their secret plans.

       Do i feel the logic points this way? Yes. Are there examples of this in our history now known as facts? Yes. Are all of the conspiracy theories people come up with nowadays true, just because they make logical sense? No. This is my point. Consider but don't consider fact unless it is in fact, a fact. :) And if we're speaking on fact, "evil" itself is a theory. And whether or not people actually possess "it". But that's a whoooole nother topic... :P Like i said, just don't feel conspiracy theory should be a religion. Some people give off that uncomfortable religous-ey aura, though. Makes it hard to be taken seriously.

       I think his "fact" is that some conspiracy theories are very likely to be true.  Given historical precedent it's almost a guarantee that there is some conspiracy shit going on right now.

       Oh no. Not going there in this thread. I'm sure not only the OP would appreciate, but anybody who happens to read. I'm not attacking anybody's views on anything. Just saying with any topic there are people that go above and beyond, and take it to this almost "religious" area. As in, they dedicate their entire life's perspective on this one topic. That's all i'm going to say. I'm not touching that one on any level aside from that. I'm no fool. :)

       morals for dummies, it's a big yellow book with rules and regulations to clearly indicate what man should and should not do, moralistic guidelines for the weak minded masses to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, it is required for some, and a book of philosophy for others to contemplate in their own free time, to take and leave as they see fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing a rational human being can't come up with on their own. (because all religious texts where made by humans anyway)
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that, any idiot zealot can be disposed of, but an open minded religious person might have some sense to debate with. For this reason, conspiracy theorists are a religion. Because any idiot can be disposed of, but an open minded individual can be debated with. Conspiracies existed ever since man learned how to communicate, and history is only written by the victor. To understand history in it's entirety, one must delve into conspiracy, thus making it more of a process of belief and faith, miuch like religion. With no absolutes.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's something in that. Some people will only follow morals they think are from a divine source. Jesus taught we should feed the hungry, clothe the naked, care for the injured and ill, visit the sick and those in prison, and that the rich are damned and  even tried to inaugurate an "Acceptable Year of the Lord", taken to mean a Sabbatical or Jubilee Year in which slaves would be freed, debts forgiven and property redistributed, but those teaching are ignored. Those in power don't want people to follow them so churches rarely mention them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that is an old conspiracy. How to hide the teachings of the dominate religion from those that follow it. It started by keeping those teachings in a language people couldn't read. No wonder they burned the translator William Tyndale at the stake for translating the New Testament into English and publishing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, while translations are freely available, most religious leaders concentrate on the Jewish Bible or the hocus pocus parts of the New Testament and ignore what Jesus taught.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are the TV preachers paid by Israeli interests to preach that Christians must support Israel regardless of what a nasty little country they are? Certainly seems likely. Another conspiracy.

       great, i am to stagnate now indefinately, to drift latterally until death with useless knowledge and not a hope for personal growth? Only the possibility to give in to what i know as "evil" and possibly regress?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cool. Although it does get lonely up here. I don't really feel any different identifying my views in a hierarchy of thought though, seems trivial to me to develop an emotional attachment to the ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       I reckon non chalence to be key, as all situations in life being circumstantial and subject to multiple realities, left to analyze said situation regardless of our personal attachment to any situation. Life is but observation with a chance to act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acting at the onset of said situation becomes superfluous (heinz), while waiting and engaging it later could yield a different result than the prescribed paths. Judgement, and hence, righteousness and truth, come from within. As such, i can't take up any of the heinz arguments, as they are far to narrow in focus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meh. I'll save my tangent for another time. Thanks for that gem of a philosphy. It will certainly serve me well in identifying the ills and onsets of the world, as action is guided by inner truth. Stages of inner truth though, that's interesting.

       Religion is not what im referencing. I used the word as a way to express what I was trying to say, in a way that I thought would make it easy to understand my point. That is the only context religion had to what I said.

       Although I'm not sure why you can't accurately write what is in front of you on the dollar bill - it says 'Novus ordo seclorum' which means 'New Order for the Ages'.

       I say just drink water in front of him.  He's going to get thirsty eventually.  That's when you let him know why he's thirsty, and the just keep drinking water in front of him.  If he's smart, he's going to eventually start drinking.  If not, then let him die of thirst while you shrug your shoulders and keep drinking water right in front of him.

       the thing about researching conspiracies is that people don't really know you are doing it unless you tell them. Literally drinking water in front of someone is obvious and evident and they will want some if they are thirsty but when you are around people, getting them curious about the lies of the world is hard to do unless you somehow broach the subject.

       Agreed.  This is part of what I meant regarding drinking the water in front of the horse.

       It might have been a bit of an obscure metaphor I made, but when I was referring to the horse getting thirsty, I was meaning that the people will wish to know why "such and such" aspect of the world is "so fucked up"; why this place or that place is always in perpetual war; why this or that inequality get perpetuated with no punishment, etc, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point, you can simply, calmly explain to them the facts regarding some of the inequalities going on in this world, who controls what, what moneys are exchanged, etc, etc.  This is the metaphorical equivalent of showing the horse the water you're drinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the horse cries bullshit and says it's "spiked punch" you're drinking and not water, then 1) remind them that what you're giving them are actual facts and not conjecture (make sure, therefore, that they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       facts you offer and not personal opinion only), then 2) shrug, say okay, allow them to keep feeling consternated and all tied in knots trying to figure out why their life and world is so fucked up, and then simply walk away calmly, quietly sipping your water.

       Ideally, with someone who is open to learning and actually has a 'thirst' this is all fine and dandy. The problem is that most people live in a conditioned paradigm which they want to protect at all costs and will defend the lies they are fed. People have invested too much into the 'illusion' they call their lives and their very lives and jobs etc depend on them not waking up. You just can't wake someone up who is pretending to sleep- it is impossible. On the other hand there are those of us who are somehow pre-disposed to seeing through the bullshit and have a voracious appetite for questioning and researching what is really going on and not what we have been told is going on. This is quite traumatic and can send you into a tailspin once your eyes have really been opened up. It is very disillusioning to see through the veil and it comes with a price which most people just aren't willing to pay. They are too invested in their lie and they'll be damned if they let someone like you collapse their house of cards. My anger and frustration is not towards the evil doers and the psychopathic manipulators of our perceived reality but the average human that allows them to get away with it by lapping up all their bullshit and passing it off as truth and 'just the way it is'. Unfortunately i don't see anything changing as long as people are not inconvenienced to a point where they lose their creature comforts. The percentage of those awake will always be consistent but not big enough to make much of a difference. The machine indoctrinating the masses has endless resources and is too sophisticated to even be recognized as an elaborate mind control mechanism. When money controls the average man- truth just can't compete with that.

       Yes.  This is true.  It
       <em>
        does

       seem very rare, however, when you find individuals that are indeed open to learning and do actually "thirst" for this kind of truth.  Usually they'll simply immediately rail against you if you mention anything like this.

       Although I do see your point, I wouldn't entirely agree with this.  If they're
       <em>
        pretending
       </em>
       to sleep, then, in fact, you CAN wake them up.  It won't necessarily be easy, of course, but you can.  Now, "do you
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to go through all the b.s. you might have to in order to wake them up?" is the question you really have to ask yourself.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, I feel I see what you're saying, and generally agree enough with the sentiment, but I will say that I don't think it's always all
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       traumatic -
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       if you indeed are dealing with an individual that is pre-disposed to seeing through the bullshit.  If they are indeed predisposed, then they won't be all THAT traumatized when they find out their world is a lie...because - being the type that's predisposed to seeing through b.s. in the first place - they kind of had a feeling about it all along anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the same, the extent of the lie that exists on this planet
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       indeed at least initially unnerving.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Absolutely agreed.  This is the reason why I mentioned initially that if the horse who claims thirst freaks out at you, calls b.s. and accuses you of having not water but spiked punch you're drinking, then don't spend TOO much time trying to convince them.  If they freak out too much on you....then whatever.  Just walk away drinking your water and leave them to think about the information you gave them.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Absolutely.  This.  I'm pissed off at both of them...but yes.  You're right.  I absolutely agree with this.  TPTB would have pretty much
       <em>
        no

       power if the 99% weren't complicit and allowed them to continue to rule nefariously.

       And this is the reason why - while always being willing to talk with anyone who might actually WANT information from you - you have to ultimately be willing to just educate
       <em>
        YOURSELF
       </em>
       and nothing more.  Don't worry about anyone or everyone else.  Educate
       <em>
        yourself
       </em>
       , make sure you have your own ship in order, encourage others to do the same and help them if they are interested, but realize that you can't really convert anyone.  Shrug your shoulders at everyone else and just make sure you have your own shit together.

       It can for YOURSELF.  It can for you as an individual.  Again, just make sure you're handling
       <em>
        YOUR

       business.  Make sure you have your own stuff figured out.  Let the fire of truth shine within you and don't worry about whether anyone will understand or not.  If it is a true fire, then it will sooner or later attract others like moths.  Make sure you can save
       <em>
        yourself
       </em>
       though.

       can't disagree with anything you wrote. I wish people would realize their power as individuals. We are as a population merely made up of individuals and like you said, if each of us only takes care of our own awakening and stops reinforcing the lie then everything changes- it has to. They can't put everyone in jail for non-compliance. The PTB know this and are terrified of a mass awakening, hence the constant investment in brainwashing and false flags etc.

       It's funny because TPTB realize the people's power as individuals more than the people themselves do.

       That is the paradox.  We will ALL wake up, move forward, evolve, and overcome the evil in this world working against us if we all AS INDIVIDUALS work to secure our own personal well-being and education.  Don't ever let that prevent others from growing and developing as well, but it seems too many are too involved with making sure and trying to "help the world" when it is THEY THEMSELVES that they should really make sure are doing okay.

       Yep.  I absolutely 100% guarantee you that the police violence and brutality will come to a screeching halt when enough of the population simply stand up and demonstrate against them that the PD all the sudden realize that it's their own mothers, and fathers, and sons and daughters and immediate family that they would have to possibly pepper spray and hand cuff in the name of the 1%.  It would stop at that moment.

       Yes sir.  This is true.  That's why they continue fighting so hard to make sure the MSM is pumping out 100% disinformation and capitalist, money money money propaganda 24-7.  This is also why TPTB are moving VERY aggressively into the area of schools and education so that they can make sure and start the heavy brainwashing and indoctrination as early as possible.  This is why there are tons and tons of "mandated" and "necessary" vaccines that infants and toddlers are pumped up with "for their health" that have been shown to actually be BAD for them/us.  This is why our food, toothpaste, and soaps are laced with chemicals that are actually horrible for us and keep us weak, unintelligent, and uncritical.

       Ha...Good to see we agree with one another.  As you can see, I tend to respond to messages sent in a moment-by-moment/word-by-word manner instead of reading the entire content and
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       responding.  It allows me to say what's on my mind in the moment without getting distracted by the next thought or idea I read.

       And yet it should, for the raindrop and the ocean are one.  It when we are only the raindrop that TPTB have all the power.  They are afraid of the ocean's weight, and so they spend all their time making sure the ocean is convinced that it is nothing but a bunch of separate, impotent, and powerless little raindrops.  It does this by putting in all kinds of doctrines and differences in society that make each raindrop think that it is better or worse than each other individual raindrop, and
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       from everything else (the Rwandan hutus and tutsis is one of many good examples of this).  This keeps the many powerless and impotent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is when the raindrop realizes that it is the very ocean itself that it becomes truly powerful.  It is when we all come together as one and put aside all these artificial, inconsequential differences that we can rise up and move forward.

       Thanks for providing that link.

       Have not seen it.  Watching it now.  I have, however, been to various talks Mr. Peter Joseph has had with The Zeitgeist Movement itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a LOT of people who are haters of him and The Zeitgeist Movement.  I actually still haven't quite figured out WHY there's so much angst against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh well.  Whatever.  I think he has great intentions and I certainly wish him the best.

       People lose sight of the big picture and dismiss the whole premise of The Zeitgeist movement because they don't like the 'solution' aspect of it. It is easy to criticize and somehow it makes them feel superior while having done nothing themselves. Peter Joseph sees the global picture and you can sense his frustration towards mass ignorance and apathy. His passion and commitment to spreading awareness speaks for itself. There is nothing about his works or his message that compromise 'truth' or make him 'an agent' for the PTB...that kind of thinking and unjustified paranoia just discredits the global consciousness movement. Glad you enjoyed it.

       yeah i really enjoyed that one too. I often search him out to see if he has any new talks. He is an engaging speaker- charismatic and articulate. He is able to put into words what many us of think but don't have the skill to articulate.

       I have an idea. But it takes two. Say you are on break where you work. You and a friend with similar ideas. Discuss some easily provable conspiracy in front of others. Don't try to convince them. Just the discuss the various points where they can hear.

       I honestly wish we had a better spokes people for all of this conspiracy stuff.  I mean, even if Alex Jones was 100% accurate, who could take him seriously with the way he acts about it.  All that yelling and screaming and boisterous attitude are just a complete turn off.

       I think Joe Rogan &amp; Adam Kokesh are more newbie-friendly.  They come across as just a highly educated everyman, not a raving lunatic.  They are easier to relate to which I think makes em much better than Alex.
      </p>

       Immortal Tech is good for certain audiences, but overall I think Rogan is probably the best we got.

       I don't see anything wrong with that unless it's some kind of known fact that comedy clubs are places people go to get drunk and escape reality. Even if all this shit's not real, why do people have to react in such a way? The people who get all bent out of shape over denying it are probably just scared that it might be true or arrogantly ignoring it.

       You go to a comedy club.
You get tipsy in a comedy club.
You have the idea that it'll be a fun time to have in a comedy club.
Raving madman (Yes, normal people would say that about AJ) tells you all the bad things that are happening that you never even heard about, again, in a comedy club.
Anyone else getting my point?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no great mystery about it, guys. You must learn to pick and choose your audience. A comedy club isn't a good place for this. Unless you were on the billing as part of the show.
Was that the case? Was the marquee reading "Doug Stanhope w/Alex Jones the Conspiracy Theorist! Live! Sold out!"
Serious question here. no trollo.

       lol you typed this like we're surrounded by people and you need them to agree with you. I'm sure most people have at least heard about nwo. Obviously he was being heckled and apparently the guy in charge didn't care what he said. Did you even watch the whole thing? It's kind of lame and misleading that the video started where it was. People paid money to see him and instead they acted like jackasses so he used his remaining time to tear into them a little. So what?

I don't think anyone is actually reading any of this so you don't need to try and persuade your surrounding imaginary friends that you're point of view is the better one.

       No. You are wrong and here's why: Unless he is being billed as an act, then it has no place in a comedy club. He should at the very least know that these reactions are going to happen. I mean, there is at least a possibility.

       But I don't really care about a design chosen over 200 years ago. Time goes by. Things change. And while the masons were working for liberty at the time, that doesn't mean they are or aren't now.

       What I find much more disturbing is 911, the assassination of JFK and Paul Wellstone. I think once people realize the facts about those murders, they will realize that there is a group of very rich and powerful men working against the American people, even killing to get their way. I don't know how to get that information to people.

       But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other Sperm Whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out -- a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.

       You picked one of the most asinine superfluous conspiracies you could.  Econ Finance majors are exactly the people you want to wake up to the fraud of fractionally reserved private central banks.  If you think the American Dream was below them, give them money masters or monopoly men.  I Didn't say bust out your laptop at IHOP, they asked what they should search on the web, and instead of giving them something worth while you gave them the Denver Airport which won't mean shit to them without having already researched the elite and the occult and the shadow government/COG areas of research.  I'm sorry what I meant to say was that wasn't very bright, not that you aren't very bright, my bad.

       Do you find your finance/ecomm guys understand the fed in a similar way that we do because they took courses in accounting, finance, economics?
      </p>
      <p>
       I once read "age of turbulence" by Greenspan.  It's interesting to read his perspective on the fed and it's affairs.  It contains philosophies and reasoning that are probably prevalent in college textbooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of my recently graduated accountant friends seem to accept the fed without feelin much reason to object.  Leads me to wonder how college/uni courses position the FED to students.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, in my experience, those that are college educated in finance aren't always  knowledgeable of the whole fed issue.

       I can speak to that first hand. I graduated with  B.S. in Finance in 2008 from a top ten business school. The Fed was accepted without question; the moral and long term economic implications of its policies had no place for discussion. It would be tantamount to saying Jesus was actually a shapeshifting reptilian in a bible college classroom.

       what kind of rationality is that? Your correlation between paranoia and cannabis is to be associated circumstantially, person to person. Jumping to conclusions is just childish, and harmful to the wonderful drug that is cannabis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that if cannabis where legalized, we could create clothing, medicine, bio diesel, food, construction materials, and so much more with it and hemp? The research rights given to the first nation to trully accept cannabis as a valid natural resource would create a brain drain siphon to that country, yielding more prosperity and a better economy.
      </p>

       Never down cannabis. Paranoia is mostly genetic, accentuated by cannabis.

       Not paranoid, I am just pursuing my Masters in economics and finance and I do not being told "i am not bright".  My buddies already know how shitty the FED is.  I was trying to enlighten them on Illuminati and shit.  But keep on being hating the trees man.

       I want to downvote this 50 times because this is exactly the kind of thinking that is stopping us from making progress. I'm sorry, I know you are a person of good intention but this is NOT how to go about things. You have to let go of your fear of being ridiculed! Don't concern yourself with finding a proper way to avoid the hazzle, you have to embrace it. The best way to convince people is to tell them honestly and accurately what is going on in way that they can understand. You could have genuinely explained that yes, I have done research and there definitely is collusion on the highest level of finance and government with the aim of controlling society.

       I dedicated an entire article on this simple point that so many people seem to be missing. Please, read it and understand why I am so adament about this.

       The fact you have an entire article dedicated to this, makes me believe you do not talk to the type of people i talk to.  This was at IHOP after a night of clubbing with some finance guys and a few girls.  We were shitfaced.  No way was gonna start yelling into peoples face about conspiracy theories and marginalize myself.  I have tried that...and you know what, I lost a few good friends because of it cause they thought i was pushing an agenda on them.

       You are presenting this as a general strategy for convincing people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or was the advice only meant for situations in which you have been clubbing some finance guys and a few girls, shitfaced at IHOP?
      </p>
      <p>
       You should really read the article, I am not attacking you, but your post conceptualizes everything I was trying to explain in the article. Because so many people are so wrong about this, their gut feeling that this is the proper tactic is wrong and harmful. Our goal should not be to avoid hazzle, we are in a campaign for truth and every day people are hurt because of the conspiracies that remain unexposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you even admit it that your goal was not to convince them, but to get away with talking about it without being ridiculed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is those who ridicule you for your beliefs who are wrong and if you are behaving in accordance with proper ethics you should not worry about those who can not.
      </p>
      <p>
       And btw, what do you mean that you mention Denver Airport "because it is one of the few conspiracies that has a lot of factual evidence."
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really believe that?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what do you mean by: "The fact you have an entire article dedicated to this, makes me believe you do not talk to the type of people i talk to."
      </p>
      <p>
       What a strange comment. I talk to all sorts of people, what exactly do you mean? Because you were talking to finance guys? And does that mean that you only talk to finance guys? I simply can not find any trace of rational logic in that statement

       I bring stuff up in what would other wise be considered usual adult conversation topics. I don't present it as a conspiracy, I just let the others discuss and play off of what they say. Because in every major institution you can find corruption, which one way or another gets labeled as a conspiracy, unless you can express a coherent argument to show the corruption. I've been doing this with my English conversation class (I'm an ESL teacher). We've been discussion health, democracy, the news, the future, economics etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to move to "conspiracy land" without really making it sound like a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, when talking about health we started talking about big pharma and also cancer. It's easy to present facts to show the blatant corruption in what would other wise be dismissed as a... "crazy conspiracy about trying to kill people and withholding life saving treatments."

       Great post! It is all about letting them discover it themselves, and using a bit of mystery.

       I usually point out chemtrails as our tax dollars at work for geo-enigineering and weather manipulation; it's a much easier pill to swallow.

       the thing about researching conspiracies is that people don't really know you are doing it unless you tell them. Literally drinking water in front of someone is obvious and evident and they will want some if they are thirsty but when you are around people, getting them curious about the lies of the world is hard to do unless you somehow broach the subject.

       What part of "They already know about the FED" do you people not understand.  They know the FED is fucked up.  They had no idea about illuminati and shit.  Thats why i mentioned the all seeing eye.  I didn't realize how many assholes there are in

       I can speak to that first hand. I graduated with  B.S. in Finance in 2008 from a top ten business school. The Fed was accepted without question; the moral and long term economic implications of its policies had no place for discussion. It would be tantamount to saying Jesus was actually a shapeshifting reptilian in a bible college classroom.
