       got one right, another half right (as the dude in the first link worked for the oil sands, semi shill protecting his work, advocating on the behalf of shills because they atleast add discussion)
      </p>
      <p>
       i apologize when i go on the attack and i find myself to be wrong, and did so quite frequently today. Nor do i intend to continue with that attitude, as i didn't really like the experience of trolling so hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atleast i'm trying to dispell misinformation, which i still did even with the oil fracking guy who used an outdated statistic and misrepresented the facts. One and a half out of three ain't bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       atleast i admited to my mistakes.

       We participate in this online community to gauge the human reaction to events, to debate our opinions, to sway others from harmful philosophy's on life, and to get facts straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, anybody who is paid to sway public opinions, or to dilute the truth of the matter, is detracting from the human experience in the name of greed. Without the possibility of having free thought, the process is pointless, and harmfull to society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doing something about it is the first step to a better internet, a better world. And it takes all kinds, even shills to run this convergence of multiple realities we call life, but they have their own format for bringing about change, and should stick to it. It's called lobying. Lobying politicians is one thing, but lobying people into believing and supporting a position or a belief that is not inherantly the best for said people, is just evil. And i'll fight to the death for my beliefs, i may not have money or many possesions, but i have values and ethics in lieu of those frivolous and meaningless things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atleast, this way, at the end of my life, i'll have no guilt.

       why would i want to support a system that works off of the backs of the poor for the benefit of a few, a system which can't grant the american dream to everybody, only a constant of suffering? A system so corrupt that with a little bad luck, one can lose everything he has worked for, simply because of an inadequate rule of law?

       conspiracy has gotten nearly triple the viewers in the course of three years, this to me indicates a shift in the normal train of thought. With such an increase, we have also seen more and more of the old topics that would only fly here being reposted in politics, passing off in world news, and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
       This ain't no backwater board anymore. It's become vital to the process. It's only natural that the place where truth is hinted at would be selectively targetted, hence again, the topic we are posting in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current debate is about the watering down of quality, a ploy at misdirection. A way to turn the populace away from this place. Somebody is afraid of this place. I've seen really shitty posts here lately, as compared to last year when firms just started hiring the shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm certain this shit hole has plenty.

       Yeah. The real danger of Alex Jones is that he makes people who sincerely question the truth look like kooks because they'll be associated with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's so absurd though that only young people or those that are useless could really fall for his drivel. I mean when I was like 21 or something I didn't yet realize he was full of shit but a few years later and it's quite obvious.

       True, but does he not disclose when he speculates? From what I have heard from him this seems to be the case. Most of all of his articles seems fairly well sourced to me.

       Probably depends on who he's talking to.
      </p>
      <p>
       His stories are real and the plight is real. The rich are out for power and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then people ask "Why? Aren't they happy with what they got?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he goes "No, they want total control over us and probably to wipe us out"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you go "Why?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "So they can be exclusive on the planet"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you go "Why?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he says:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Because they're horrible people who live in a bubble and don't see beyond their world and have long since been able to grasp the concept of "other people"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Because there's basically 4 or 5 guys are the top who are overall trying to be the only one to hold the brass ring.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They're aliens/lizard people who want to control the earth for it's resources for their alien race.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Basically the conspiracy needs and end and when shit is this bad/crazy you need some big crazy reason why it's all happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a lot of Alex Jones articles are well sourced and true but when they start trying to figure out the elite's end game that's when you need to know you're listening to speculation.

       The best liars intermingle truth with their fiction. If he was completely full of shit everyone would figure it out. He has just enough facts and reputable interviewees to appear legit to the less critical thinkers or uninitiated but more than enough hyperbole and craziness to immediately discredit himself with the mainstream. I'd also point out it's what he is NOT saying that is important.. check out who he's married to and what he will never talk about. If he was legit he would talk about Zionism and Israeli/American politics.

       Oh yes, that which goes unsaid is often the most important. Also if you feel you are being herded toward a intellectual corral, well you probably are. He may be an agent. Hell I don't know. All I say is take what grains of truth he gives and see what fruits they bare.

       I dunno if he's an agent but it would not shock me. Maybe he found his niche selling fear, televangelist style, I'm sure he's not hurting financially. Whatever he is, he is less than sincere and I can't stand him or what he represents. That said, I still tune in when someone I respect is being interviewed. Just take AJ with a grain of salt. Rock salt.

       I am 21 now and realizing how crazy he is. Borrows too much from glen beck with the yelling, screaming and appeal to pathos. He has some decent writers on his site and brings up a lot of important government scandals but its just the presentation is so ridiculous. Trying to branch out and find better alternate news but no dice so far.

       you have ever listened to him(alex jones) its kind of funny how many things are the end result of an "psy op". Example, the movie shooting recently was done to 
Assist in passing the UN small arms ban
Put TSA in malls and other places
Shows how movies are used for MK U ltra hitmen triggers 
And on and on and on. 
While there are always tidbits of true info Alex Jones is a loose cannon and an actor who is good for a laugh. As a person who truely feels that there are hidden agendas i find Alex Jones a liability.

        hand experience, 2.hand experience, official documents, video recordings that have not been cgi'd. Not to forget the whistleblowers, I mean the stooges of conspiracy  mainstream are good to get sleeping peoples attention and sometimes they report on information stated above, but don't take cartoonish people to seriously they are hurting more than doing good.

       You have to look into stuff for yourself, read all the boring books published by world leaders of societies and foundations that are actively working for globalisation. usually they talk pretty straight forward about how they predict the future and the direction they will lead the heards. These days we are up for a new depression and I think we will get a new economic type of system.

       The only way that you are going to learn what the real truth looks like is to do the research yourself. There is no way that you are going to get it handed to you on a silver platter or even recognize it when you are seeing/hearing the actual truth if you don't find out for yourself what it is.

       I agree completely. I have been looking into things long before AJ came along. That's how I know much of what he says is dead on target, and that's why I can't understand why there is so much hatred for him. His shit is free and well sourced. I suppose there are many that just need a hand to hold onto.

       You are right to believe many of his claims. The sad thing is that he does not provide details for about half of his stories, he rambles on without getting to the point and will never personally expose people. He will always make it out to be a mysterious group of people that are ruling the whole world. Of course this is true, but it does not help to keep saying that without naming these people and the crimes they commit.

       A large number of you believe the shit that Alex Jones spews.  He's VERY popular.  You can't write it off as being only "disinfo agents" that post - that's just dishonest.  You don't get to have this community, and then claim that any member of it who seems crazier than you isn't genuine in their beliefs.  You've got some serious insanity in this community, own up to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People upvote guys like tttt0tttt and bumblingmumbling who actually believe that Jews control the entire world and aren't allowed to be criticized, despite the fact that they spend their entire day criticizing Jews.  They're
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       popular posters on this subreddit.  But they say crazy things.  Who are
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       to decide if they're 'shills' or nutbags?  Why is it that assumed that anyone who says something crazy must ACTUALLY be lying, rather than, you know, crazy?

       was pointing out that perspective in the photo was different and that noses flare. It was presented in an ungentlemanly way, but that does not change the fact that he was posting a refutation of a stupid theory, and not presenting one to discredit the community.

       Trolling != black ops disinfo.  There are many people on reddit that love to fuck with
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       because it's funny.  That doesn't mean that there's some government plan to discredit a subreddit of only 70K readers.

       They're not lying to you per se, they're just messing with you because you're so fun to fuck with.  They just want to get a reaction out of you to see you go on some half baked rant out lizard people or the NWO.  Because then we get these posts and people laugh, because you're so far down the rabbit hole you think the government is paying people to post on your shitty subreddit.

       This post is a perfect example of why people mess with

        /r/conspiracy

       .  It's like playing games with a mentally ill homeless person.  Fucked up, but funny.

       Alex Jones is working three fronts:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Shouting and screaming half-truths to keep people under educated in a shroud of fear, advocating physical resistance and giving the false idea of winning the battle against 'evil'.
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Selling gold. Ted Anderson sells gold in his show and owns gcn radio network. He is not helping people prepare for a market collapse because gold is not going to be worth anything after the economy plunges.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The thing he does best is he makes himself and others that believe in him look like a fool. He loses his cool all the time and acts like a lunatic especially when his information gets too close to the truth. He does a shitty job at backing his claims. All in all he makes it very hard for the people that believe him to talk to others about these very important topics without sounding like a 'conspiracy nut'.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I was fooled by him myself for a while until I realized that he was simply playing at my emotions without educating me about the real problem or what to do about it. He himself IS cointelpro, he IS project mockingbird, he IS part of the problem.

       Interesting, is there an alternative to his show? He usually has a decent daily news show that covers stuff nobody else does.

       Maybe a better question would be: "what do you want to know?"
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's simply "what's going on today" then decide "where". Locally? Nationwide? Wordly? Does it really apply to you? Do you need to know?
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I hardly watch or read the news. The stuff I really need to know will get to me when it needs to. There are a lot of topics that I research every day and every day is different. When I research a topic, I spend as much time on it as needed until there are no more questions left. If I can't find the answer to something, I will carry it around for a while (sometimes years) and eventually there will always be an answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       After doing your own research for a while you will get a nose for the truth and you won't need someone else to tell you what you need to know.

       See, that conspiracy in itself, sounds a lot like the OP's problem with r/conspiracy. It's much more likely that Alex Jones is just a paranoid schizophrenic, as many hard core conspiracy theorists are.

      <p>
       To say he is controlled opposition is fucking moronic, but hilarious to read as someone who laughs at conspiracy theorists.

       Very well put I think Alex Jones was brought in to distract people from the  heavy truth that William Cooper was laying down. First district and ultimately replace.  That's why Jones claims to have predicted 911, he didn't Bill * the original gangster* Cooper called that one.

       Exactly. If Alex Jones was even a threat to the establishment then he would have ended up dead like cooper. Which is why I question most of these mainstream conspiracy theorists that think they have all the truth. Oh and did you know that Bill Clinton once called Cooper one of the most dangerous radio casters in the US? ;)

       he acts funny when folks mention zionism. he is the high profile mouthpiece of the truth movement. it's too weird and his influence is too large for it to remain unconsidered. a lot of what he claims is well researched, and is even true at times, but a standard method of information management is to reveal almost all of the truth of an idea, enough to be observably worthy of trust, yet concealing or omitting or distorting a crucial fact. this effect, to me, seems most useful when occluding the ultimate head of a cryptocratic power structure, or a conspiracy that is becoming unraveled, a la mob history. IMO.

       The Bohemian Grove thing was pretty much setup from the beginning. He didn't get all the juicy details we needed to understand this "ritual" that these people were doing.

       <a href="http://www.spirituallysmart.com/bohemian_grove.html">
        Alex Jones pretty much broke the story of the Bohemian Grove and mentions the huge statue of the owl there but doesn't mention the statue of Saint John of Nepomuk who is the Official Patron Saint of the Bohemian Grove.

       True but these are a few things he keeps hammering on without getting into the details. Bilderberg this, bilderberg that. Listening to Alex will make you think they are 80% of the whole problem and own almost the whole world. Exposing Bohemian grove was nice but because of his reputation, almost nobody believes it. Do you really believe they would 'mock' human sacrifice? That's what they do at the county fair, you don't need a secret grove for that.

       I listen to Alex Jones for seven. freaking. years. before I started to notice that it was the things he was NOT saying that caught my attention. 
He lies. Alot. 
He's a major gate keeper for Israel on the 9/11 front. His mantra "9/11 is an inside job" distracts away from Israel and focuses solely on US government.
I've completely stopped listening to his radio show and I haven't been to his web site in close to three years now.

       is by far the ballsiest and most qualified of them all to tell what actually took place on 9/11 from a geopolitical standpoint (my interest). He has many writings on the subject as well as interviews.

       Why doesn't anybody just decide to figure it out once and for all, and conduct thorough independent surveillance on the guy? If those fuckers can do it, why can't we?
      </p>
      <p>
       SURELY there's someone in our movement that would fund for a small group of people to bug the hell out of his house, track every communication, and otherwise try and find some kind of definitive evidence that can blow up on the internet?

       talking about the lawyer having shares in the federal reserve, or "treetops," or the bank of isreal labeled as 6242% - is that a lot? i can't really follow whats going on in

       i honestly want to know if my attention is being misdirected by jones. most information claiming so, of the handful of sources i have found, is grasping at straws. (though admittedly this may be a piece should the puzzle exist)
      </p>

       does anybody have something at least a tiny bit more difficult to explain away? i honestly think i am judging this information without a sheeples normalcy bias perspective but is there something i'm missing? please help

       When someone intentionally omits the truth, they become suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a fact that the Israel, along with a cabal of Zionist and Neocon collaborators within the US, plotted and carried out the attacks on September 11th.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any amount of objective research regarding these claims proves this beyond a reasonable doubt.  Jones only serves to distract from this truth.

       Or get in touch with him personally to physically place a bug on him. Either way it will be risky and not something you want to do with a group of people you don't know.

       I wouldn't put it past the government to use it as a false flag. I agree that I hadn't heard the TSA specifically mentioned, but I think he was just using that off the cuff to refer to the government in a vague sense.

       In addition to your point: I don't downvote submissions in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       unless I think the submitter is insincere. There needs to be a place where suspicious but unproven (or at least unacknowledged) wrongdoing can be discussed. Even if strongly convincing evidence is not yet available. The cost of this is that some low quality submissions will linger, but that's okay.

       Right, and this is the perfect example.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government is making us look like crazy fucks by using complex disinformation techniques on a relatively obscure website on a small subreddit!
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, this post is making everyone looks like crazy fucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       A simpler explanation is that conspiracy theories generally attract crazy fucks because they require a high level of faith and a low level of proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government doesn't need to discredit conspiracy theorists, they do it to themselves.  This subreddit is proof of that.

       tbh I believe that 9/11 and 7/7 were inside jobs in order to gain momentum from the public that we needed to invade Afghanistan and Iraq, but I don't believe in "the illuminati" that everyone bashes on about, I believe that yes there are people in the background that control these kinds of things but "the illuminati" is just a retarded name given to them which makes people think we're crazy because of just that.

       That's the thing about conspiracies, they're not fact based but faith based.  So really it's all up to how much you want to believe.  You can believe I'm just a skeptic, or you can believe I'm some sort of reptoid neozionist scumbag.  It's not up to me, it's up to you.  How badly do you want to validate your worldview?  How badly do you want to believe?

       Easy there bud my point still applies.  Stooges are stooges and you obviously believe there's a conspiracy to dilute this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thing: conspiracies are all faith based, so in the end it's what you believe that shapes your reality, not facts.

      <p>
       Like I said previously, you can believe I'm just a skeptic, or you can believe I'm some sort of reptoid neozionist scumbag. It's not up to me, it's up to you. How badly do you want to validate your worldview?

      <p>
       Do you see how believing in stooges flooding a obscure sub and an off beat website is just as dumb as believing in aliens and reptoids?  It's all faith based, and in the end that's moronic.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       No, the only people who say that are rational human beings that understand the true nature of conspiracy theories: they're faith based, not fact based.

       Thus it's ironic that all sorts of "evidence" is produced which doesn't matter because it's more akin to a religion, not a science.

       There are a lot of legit crazy people on the internet, and they gravitate toward communities that are more accepting of alternative views. Every site has some. Don't be so quick to dismiss all of them as disinfo agents - I think there are at least as many that truly believe what they're saying.

       No, he was acknowledging some conspiracies about Dick Cheney or something, but he was doing his best to paint all others as easily debunked and stupid. He was pretending to come from the perspective of someone older and wiser who had given up conspiracy theorizing as if it was some phase people grow out of, like listening to boy bands or something.

       Did it ever occur to you that people that disagree with you might just have different opinions and probably aren't in the payroll of the US govt?  I've never understood the idea that because someone posts something that's contrary to your belief system it automatically makes them some sort of NWO stooge.
      </p>
      <p>
       A far more likely scenario is that they actually disagree with you.  You're not getting down votes because of some neo zionist conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posts like this further discredit a subset of the population that already has legitimacy issues.  If you want people to believe what you believe, dismissing everyone as "shills" is probably a bad tactic.

       This is, by the way, the single most common disagreement received when anyone starts talking about shills, and is basically a conjuring of the rational spirit, which also conveniently is often used to set up an additional opportunity to discredit or insult the larger 'group,' defined here as conspiracy theorists. Which I see you also took advantage of.

       Posts like this do no benefit for anyone by generalizing folks and their social experience levels. Using instances of socially inept 'conversations' to attack the broad field of conspiracy theories is crap.

       The implications of your statement was the belief that this sub has some sort of stooge conspiracy to repress legitimate opinions.  I can hardly say I agree, but in the end how badly do you want to believe?   Am I just a skeptic, or some sort of paid shill?  It's up to you, not me.  Anything I say will confirm your previously held beliefs.

       It's a usual intelligence agency technique: create different versions of a situation so that all could be equally plausible or make up some absurd nonsense that as you said, makes anything on the reddit look ridiculous by association.

       Fake conspiracy theorists all began with Mark Lane.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lane_(author)">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lane_(author)
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark Lane wrote
       <em>
        the very first book
       </em>
       questioning the JFK assassination.  He was a "leader" in advocating a JFK conspiracy for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Years later:  Lane was an attorney for James Earl Ray.  He spread disinformation throughout the House Special Committee on Assassinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then:  Lane took a key witness in the MLK assassination case to Jonestown (yes,
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       Jonestown), so that key witness was unable to testify before Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then:  Lane was paid $6000/month by Jim Jones &amp; the Peoples' Temple to accuse the CIA of attacking Jonestown, when in fact Jim Jones had circumstantial ties to the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then:  The Jonestown Massacre killed the key witness, interrupted the House Special Committee on Assassinations (one day after Atlanta FBI agents testified that the Atlanta FBI office celebrated MLK's assassination).  But Lane miraculously survived.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this day, Mark Lane is respected by many ignorant JFK assassination activists.  And he continues to spread disinformation.

       There's money in selling the outrageous, why do you think Alex Jones has been able to have the career he has or the National Inquirer still exists? It's two fronts:
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones sells fear, his sponsors (mainly gold-sellers, army surplus, and survival gear) benefit financially from the fearful. The more fear he can pedal the better for his bottom line.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, people like those behind Sorcha Faal or the National Inquirer sell the outrageous as entertainment, they make sensational claims involving all sorts of dis/mis-information to grab the readers attention and get them to buy their books/magazines.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of all that you have the old conspiracy theorists/skeptic mantra of "question everything" people attracted to this kind of stuff want to believe there's more happening that what seems apparent, thus the outrageous is given equal voice as the possible or plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short it shouldn't surprise anyone that enjoys this kind of stuff(me included) that there are people who willfully act as megaphones for the Jones' and Faals of the world in hope that the sensational bullshit they push has some basis in reality.

       There has been a lot of fake conspiracies to generate internet traffic revenue lately, especially with the batman shooting..... But there are those who want to distract you from finding the truth of things by creating false conspiracies to trick you and make you waste your time.

       Honestly a lot of what gets posted on here make it look crazy. Anything that has to do with reptilian aliens and shit like that is so far from say, 9/11 conspiracies or blatent false info on the wars that are going on. I feel like there should be another subreddit for off the wall alien/2012/zombies it whatever other crazy shit gets posted.

        /r/conspiracy

       . I can post pretty much any crazy nonsense, link it to a few batshit insane pages / blogs, and it's considered legitimate and goes unquestioned. I could post that the Earth is flat over here and get upvotes.

       You have far too much faith in human intelligence. Reddit has ~50M unique users on any given day. 10% of them have accounts. 10% of them post. I have no problem believing that a few dozen people out of a half-million are legitimately racist idiots.

       There are specific reasons, like low intelligence, that make it more likely that the "neo nazis" are phake thread poisoner than the genuine article. Shouting "nigger!" in an anti-racist thread is suspect behavior.

       My personal thought on conspiracy theory has always been that it can not be proven or disproved. Disproved = false, proven = fact and all other is conspiracy theory.

       I find arguing religion pointless myself but love talking conspiracy theory. One thing I brought up with coworkers is the wiki leaks scandal when it started. Though the evidence released is quite damning for many in power can you prove one way or the other that it was not done to create laws to control internet content?

       My only OP link/post on here was intentionally outlandish (I thought).  So I'll out myself on here that I am not a conspiracy believer. It is pretty sad, in your guys' worldview it appears that there are two types of people, those who agree with you and then there is the CoIntelPro.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which, by the way, from the way you guys describe it, would be a horribly boring job that apparently thousands of people are being paid to do.  But for suggesting that there is a chance, possibly, maybe are other reasonably minded people who question the validity of your claims I will be labeled as a disinfo agent (because I have constributed so much false information).

       I wouldn't say all of them a "paid to do" by blacklisting conspiracy theorists (though if there is something to hide, I'm sure there has been some sort of thing like that) but honestly it's probably people trolling, that just adds, so realistically you wouldn't need to pay anyone.

       I bother posting because I believe in trying to reveal how irrational the logic of a lot of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is.  It often lacks a scientific method.  It often lacks a nuance for the degrees of certainty in its truth claims.  I chose my handle because I believe a preponderance of the communities on the internet have now become isolated absolutist communities.  The extent to which people stay and choose to be isolated will determine the level of despair, discontent, and friction within my country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care to make people look like idiots.  I want to engage people where I think they are misled.  The Western world thrived on a competition of ideas.  Within institutions and academies, ideas could be reasoned, challenged, and studied.  Proponents of alternate realities/ viewpoints used to not be villified or demonized.  Now you have designed formal epistemological categories for classes of people (Sliders/disinfo agents/politburo whatevers) that make you not have to acknowledge or engage competing truth claims.  I.e. if someone denies that they are in one of these categories it proves that they are in the category.  The only appropriate self-categorization for someone who disagrees with you apparently is apathy or a resigned nihilism.  Which is ironic, because many of the conspiracy arguments is that all of the problems exist because there are so many disinterested, apathetic people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that we (America mostly) have devolved as a community that cannot engage with people who hold competing views.

       Yes, they are. I mean besides the obvious insular nature of Judaic culture over millennia of quiet persecution, to the point where recessive traits are a serious problem and the Ashkenazis are studied for their longevity, the sort of white nationalist shitheads who constantly go on about "the Jews" sure as fuck also mean it in a racial sense. The Hebrews or Israelites or Leviites or whatever else you'd like to call them to distinguish the concept from religious Judaica are as genetically and physiologically distinct as any other race.

       A semite is a member of a semitic ethnicity, i.e. one associated with a semitic language. It includes most languages and related ethnic groups along the Red Sea and eastern Mediterranean. The fact that the word is adopted from Hebrew is kind of a hint.

       You can't seriously believe there are only five ethnicities for seven billion people. Where do the steppes peoples fit in? How do you pigeonhole light-skinned North Africans? What about native Americans and Inuits? What about Australian aboriginals? What about the Mayans, the Inca, and the Aztecs? Claiming there's no such thing as Hebrews is even more stubbornly ignorant than refusing to acknowledge that "Jews" is not a synonym for "Zionists."

       You can, at which point you'd be Jewish (religiously). You can also be born to an Ashkenazi family and convert to Christianity, at which point you'd still be Jewish (ethnically). The word simply does not have the clear-cut and unambiguous meaning you're pretending it has. I don't doubt the idiots you're defending take advantage of this ambiguity in their constant denial of how blatantly bigoted they are.

       diselphiend is one of them.  He claims to make distinctions, but his posts have made it clear that all Jews - religious or not - are JEWS, and worthy of hate due to being part of a grand conspiracy from birth.  He's just as much an ignorant hatemonger as bumblingmumbling, and to top it off, he's much less coherent.

       When you said "Indians," I thought you meant people from the subcontinent of India. I was giving you the benefit of the doubt in light of how obviously distinct they are from "Asians" as in the Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans. I figured you were forgetful, but smart enough not to lump Gandhi and Mao into the same ethnicity.

       Then I guess bumblingmumbling is only insufferably sub-racist.

      <p>
       This is the dumbest argument I've had in months. You might as well claim cats aren't a real family of animals because there are only five kingdoms of life. "Sub-races" are still distinct ethnic groups, whatever you insist on calling them, and the racist motherfuckers who blame them for the downfall of mankind aren't nearly so picky about vocabulary.

       Race is a social construct. Meaning that not only is the concept of "race" something that we (as a society) created, but it has changed over time.  Citing passports and employment forms as proof of race's existence is circular, and in the United States it is always framed as self-identification, with an understanding it's a construct.    "Jew" as you would say, could easily be a race, all it takes is an agreement by enough people.  Take a look at the role of race in Brazilian society.  When Anthropologists talk about "race", they are either describing the social effects that the concept of race has, or because the actual operational word, population, proves inadequate.

       Dieselphiend, ladies and gentlemen, arguing that racists must have a good reason for their hatred. No smoke without fire, right? It would be ridiculous to believe that they're simply a bunch of small-minded pricks who inherited ancient prejudices, since nobody has ever been bigoted against other minorities, and therefore the simple fact of their bigotry is its own justification.

       antisemitism (which is not the opposite of semitism btw but has had 'hatred of jews' attached to it from the very beginning of the term) has three main pillars: in chronological order of appearance antiminority/ethnicity, antijudaism and finally pseudoscientic biologistic racism. it's not just a subset of racism, even though you'll encounter that aspect, too, from time to time.

       the bolsheviks had an overproportional portion of jews because of the overproportional portion of jews in intellectual circles. communism is no jewish endeavour because the jews in the movement didn't act in their 'function' as ethnic jews but as educated individuals with an attitude who wanted to change the world for the better (which quickly turned into a power struggle with catastrophic consequences). i've yet to see any proof that the jews in the bolshevik movement acted/conspired together as jews to further their own agenda.

       and what genocide of the palestinians are you talking about? if israel wanted to eradicate the palestinians the are doing an exceptionally bad job.

       , awful as it reads, puts things a little in perspective. even the percentage of malnourished children in the west bank and in gaza is lower or on par with neighboring countries. so much for israel starving the palestinians.

       And what about so-called Jews - those of Jewish ancestry - who AREN'T adherents to the Jewish religion?  Where do they fit into your narrative?  Are all people of Jewish descent assumed to be of the Jewish religion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Purges don't ask philosophical questions.  Hatemongers like you don't go from house to house asking if the family inside are simply descended from Jews, or if they're practicing.  Hitler's death squads didn't ask "Do you support Zionism"? before hauling "Jews" off to the gas chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
       You claim not to be talking about Jews as an ethnicity, but that's all you do.  You're a liar, plain and simple, and you spew hate towards an ethnic group, then pretend you're only talking about RELIGIOUS Jews, or Zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm neither.  I don't support Israel, and I don't practice Judaism, yet somehow, I'm always lumped in with "THE JEWS".  If that's not proof that you people are just trying to pass your racism off as righteous anger over a creed (Zionism or Judaism), I don't know what is.

       You can't have it both ways.  Either you need to stop talking about ethnic Jews and referring to them as Zionists, or you need to admit that you're
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       referring to all people of Jewish descent, regardless of religious affiliation, when you tell people that "the Jews" are responsible for all the evil in the world.

       Every single claim you made about Judaism applies to Christianity and Islam, you've just chosen to ignore it because - wait for it - you're a prejudiced bigot.  You sit here and pretend that Islam and Christianity haven't started wars, or caused people to be mistreated, or kept women in a place of subjugation for millennia, or institutionally abused Children on a much larger scale than Judaism, but you're just WRONG.  These religions have had far more numerous crimes committed in their names in the last thousand years, and to say otherwise is a complete revision of history.

Almost every holiday isn't a celebration of the people God killed for us, but of the fact that people have been TRYING to wipe us off the face of the Earth for THOUSANDS OF YEARS, and yet, here we are, still alive, even if most of us are atheists these days.

       He's projecting his own repulsive attitude onto an entire group of people. There's so much hate inside him, it has to be directed at something. There has to be a reason for why he feels so empty and angry, it can't just be that he's defective in some fundamental way (the assertion that he makes about Jewish people).

       No, YOU are dieselphiend, and YOU are a hateful bigot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm done with this.  Here's the part that you've never understood: the world is made up of individuals.  People are not simply defined as the group you choose to represent them; they can't all be fit in neat little boxes like "Jew" or "Non-Jew".  Whatever Quakers have or haven't done, your argument wasn't "Quakers are the best religion", it was "Jews are the worst, because they're the only ones who've done [huge list of things that Christianity and Islam have been guilty of]".  Stop talking about your ancestors.  You don't get to take credit for them, and you don't have to apologize for them, any more than I have to apologize for mine, or take credit for mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       You didn't try to prove to me that YOU'RE not guilty of the things Jews are guilty of, you tried to prove to me that NO ONE ELSE is guilty of those things.  I responded with irrefutable examples that completely shattered your narrative, so you changed your argument,  rather than admitting that you were wrong.  That's dishonest enough that this will be my last response to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's happening in the HERE and NOW is that you are preaching hate, and engaging in persecution.  I don't give a shit if that's not something "Quakers" do, it's something YOU are doing, and nothing in the world can undo that fact.  If Quakers don't preach hate, and YOU are preaching hate, then either YOU are not a Quaker, or Quakers CAN be hateful.  Those are the options - take your pick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also: you seem to think that the problems of Christianity and Islam lie in the distant past.  I believe I made it quite clear that this is NOT the case.  Militant Islamists are blowing themselves up
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       .  They're taking child-wives
       <em>
        now.
       </em>
       Catholic priests are engaging in (and covering up for) Pedophilia
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       .  Protestant Christians are harassing (and sometimes assaulting) homosexuals
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       .  These religions - and I know that ultraorthodox Jews are every bit as bad, today - are engaging in these evils
       <em>
        in the modern world.
       </em>
       Stop pretending that I'm talking about thousands of years ago - I'm not.  I made it very clear that your entire speech was nothing but bias, repeatedly turning a blind eye to
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, the fact that you attribute "The holocaust of Russian political dissidents" to Jews or Judaism is ludicrous; it can be attributed to Josef Stalin, and he was
       <em>
        certainly
       </em>
       no Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I expect from your reply: The same shit that's been in every other reply of yours - hate, historical revisionism, and excuses for why you're NOT a prejudiced asshole, while at the same time saying incredibly prejudiced things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't be replying to you again on this topic.  We may meet again, in some thread in the future, where I see you spreading misinformation without a care in the world as to whether or not some tidbit that fits your narrative is true, and I'll call you on it then.  But here, tonight, you attempted to argue that history had played out a certain way, and when I demonstrated that you were completely and utterly wrong, you changed the subject and went on the defensive.  I don't debate people who can't accept when they've said something false.  Goodnight.

       Have you been to r/niggers or r/whiterights?  They blame Hispanics and blacks just as often as Jews, just in different ways; Jews are described as evil Masterminds, while blacks are described as sub-human beasts.  White Supremacists do
       <em>
        not

       solely focus on Jews; antisemites solely focus on Jews.

       Yes, in the

       no. semite is a term for the speakers of semitic languages, jews and many others included. the term 'anti-semitic' was coined to describe the hatred of jews and was quickly adapted by antisemites to describe themselves (wilhelm marr etc).

       Yeah, totally. A lot of stooges pretending to be conspiracy theorists here, for sure. They try and tell us that 9/11 was a conspiracy, that jews and or reptillians run the world and that JFK's driver shot him. Damn idiots, stop ruining the movement.

       Exactly. If Alex Jones was even a threat to the establishment then he would have ended up dead like cooper. Which is why I question most of these mainstream conspiracy theorists that think they have all the truth. Oh and did you know that Bill Clinton once called Cooper one of the most dangerous radio casters in the US? ;)

       You are right to believe many of his claims. The sad thing is that he does not provide details for about half of his stories, he rambles on without getting to the point and will never personally expose people. He will always make it out to be a mysterious group of people that are ruling the whole world. Of course this is true, but it does not help to keep saying that without naming these people and the crimes they commit.

       This is, by the way, the single most common disagreement received when anyone starts talking about shills, and is basically a conjuring of the rational spirit, which also conveniently is often used to set up an additional opportunity to discredit or insult the larger 'group,' defined here as conspiracy theorists. Which I see you also took advantage of.

       He's projecting his own repulsive attitude onto an entire group of people. There's so much hate inside him, it has to be directed at something. There has to be a reason for why he feels so empty and angry, it can't just be that he's defective in some fundamental way (the assertion that he makes about Jewish people).

       got one right, another half right (as the dude in the first link worked for the oil sands, semi shill protecting his work, advocating on the behalf of shills because they atleast add discussion)
      </p>
      <p>
       i apologize when i go on the attack and i find myself to be wrong, and did so quite frequently today. Nor do i intend to continue with that attitude, as i didn't really like the experience of trolling so hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atleast i'm trying to dispell misinformation, which i still did even with the oil fracking guy who used an outdated statistic and misrepresented the facts. One and a half out of three ain't bad.

       conspiracy has gotten nearly triple the viewers in the course of three years, this to me indicates a shift in the normal train of thought. With such an increase, we have also seen more and more of the old topics that would only fly here being reposted in politics, passing off in world news, and the like.

       This ain't no backwater board anymore. It's become vital to the process. It's only natural that the place where truth is hinted at would be selectively targetted, hence again, the topic we are posting in.

       The current debate is about the watering down of quality, a ploy at misdirection. A way to turn the populace away from this place. Somebody is afraid of this place. I've seen really shitty posts here lately, as compared to last year when firms just started hiring the shills.

       I'm certain this shit hole has plenty.
