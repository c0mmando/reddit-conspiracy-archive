    <div class="md"><p>maybe that is the point.  in order to limit choices of consumption.  Then people will rely on things like Netflix to watch movies and sit at home instead of going out. Or go to Wal-Mart or one of the other big box stores instead of going to the mall which a lot of times have mom&amp;pop stores peppered around inside.  A lot of big chain stores have left our local mall and its a lot of people just selling knick-knacks and homemade jewelry now.  </p>

<p>Back in the early days of movies the industry was based in New York and the WASPy types who ran the show wouldn&#39;t let Jews join in their reindeer games.  So a lot of them were like, &quot;fuck this, we&#39;re goin to Cali.&quot;  And then Hollywood was born.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>I <em>want</em> to believe whatever verified evidence describes.</p>

<p>If I were to swerve off the road and die, people who started to dig into my life would find a lot of <em>creepy</em> connections and <em>too convenient</em> family ties.  But that doesn&#39;t mean anything odd happened, I just swerved off the road.</p>

<p>Connections don&#39;t mean anything.  Do family members of DARPA employees have a higher incident of family-related brainwashings?  I&#39;d want to see a precedent for this before jumping into that being a possibility.</p>

<p>Any timing would have been &quot;too convenient.&quot;  You could line this event up with any date in the last 5 years and I&#39;d show you just how convenient that time is.  There&#39;s <em>always</em> a gun control bill in the running.  There&#39;s <em>always</em> another event in the news that can be distracted from.  But in this case, it&#39;s right before the Olympics, which will steal a lot of this story&#39;s thunder.  Crappy planning?</p>

<p>And the multiple shooters thing...  If you&#39;re planning to stage an attack, and you want to sell a specific narrative, why do you plan to botch the one defining aspect of the shooting?  What about these primitive attacks required the expertise of a second guy to pull off?</p>

<li><p>The LIBOR Robert Holmes is in fact the shooter&#39;s father. I&#39;ve seen evidence that he&#39;s a programmer for Fair Issac, but nothing linking him to being a key player.</p></li>
<li><p>Is that same man actually scheduled to testify before senate?  I can only find YouTube videos and conspiracy blogs stating this. Where is the schedule they&#39;re getting this from?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The aurora shooting sounds alot like the Norway shooting. A man can go insane I agree but the man will kill himself almost always. Because such an act is one of last resort, a fare well card to the fucked up world we are.</p>

<p>A person who shoots up the place and stays calm and controlled the whole time and not resisting arrest is not normal. An insane man would have fought the police untill his death.</p>

<p>The norway shooter did his thing in cold blood and surrendered himself with a smirk on his face. (note that speculation of a second shooter was also circulating at the time of that story) These cases are not normal in the least. And to equate them with &quot;normal&quot; cases of insane shootings is not correct. A detective would surely see the difference.</p>

<p>Then there are the bombs both the norway shooter and the aurora guy had acces to. The media would like you to believe that every person can become a bomb expert by simply browsing the internet. People who don&#39;t question the news story goble this up like sweet cream. People are not bomb experts and the equipment used in both cases was of high caliber both guns and bombs.</p>

<p>It does not make sense at all.</p>

<p>Would you shoot up a theater in a fit of madness only to surrender yourself to spend life in prison? Why would anyone do that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give me a number for how many government employees have. This reminds me of when climate-change deniers cite the &quot;31.000 scientists are against global warming. Then when you look into it, it&#39;s a phony petition; the Oregon Petition.</p>

<p>&quot;Experts&quot; being involved in the 911 truth movement doesn&#39;t make it more true. For example: Niels Harrit is an expert, and his thoroughly discredited theories are still propagated in that community. As is the case with him, when you enter a supposedly scientific field with an agenda, your research is gonna reflect your bias. And it gets more complicated than that, because often-times, &quot;experts&quot; cited by proponents of a fringe theory will often have very dubious credentials, for example experts who say that evolution is false are likely to have them, Kent Hovind for example having a degree in Christian Theology from an unaccredited baptist school. Stuff like that.</p>

<p>Now, the steel-melting thing is easy: You are right that it doesn&#39;t burn hot enough to melt steel, but the wide consensus among experts is that it doesn&#39;t need to melt, because steel loses its structural integrity, about 50% lost at 593 c.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t know people have started down-voting you. I just checked this subreddit once in a while and came upon this thread.</p>

<p>I was gonna write about Niels Harrit&#39;s inability to get his results published in anything but a non-peer-reviewed journal (which is now gone), but then I read the line &quot;They prove shape charges were used during the demo&quot;, and it occurred to me that you&#39;ve got a very lose grasp of the concept of proof if a picture can prove something to you.  Case in point: <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/thermite.htm">http://www.debunking911.com/thermite.htm</a>
No doubt you&#39;ve seen this before. It&#39;s a picture cited as evidence of steel melted by thermate. Turns out, it was just a floodlamp. In light of this, I&#39;m skeptical about Kurt&#39;s images proving anything.</p>

<p>You can keep pulling out experts, and they&#39;ll still be a minority no matter how big a group of cranks they organize. Same goes when the Creationists do it, or the climate denialists for that matter.</p>

<p>As for my shame, the material goods I can buy with the amount of Shekels the NWO pays me can easily wash that away. I could try to convince you that I don&#39;t have one, but then again, being a paid shill, that is exactly what I&#39;d want you to think, right? Basically I&#39;m in a position where there&#39;s nothing I can say to you that can prove anything I say, not out of lack of any lack of merit of my arguments, but because, like just the 911 experts, you made up your mind already. But at least I tried.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what actual scientific research looks like, submitted for peer-review, as opposed to what Niels Harrit did to get publicity for his unsubstantiated claims. So there, Niels Harrit&#39;s &quot;findings&quot; debunked, thoroughly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fun thing about theories like these is that you can never prove or disprove them.</p>

<p>There are terrorist attacks that can be directly linked to government:</p>

<p>9/11, the first WTC bombing, the OKC bombing, the Russian apartment bombings, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Bologna_massacre">the 1980 Bologna massacre,</a>, the Lavon affair, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/11/22/idUSLM220169">the Kosovo bombing</a>.</p>

<p>These are cases where military grade explosives are found, FBI informants turn out to be part of the terrorist network, &quot;exercises&quot; were held at the same moment (giving an excuse to move emergency services to where they will be needed, and allowing your operatives to claim they are part of an exercise). If you have a few of such factors, you can be pretty sure government was involved.</p>

<p>Then there are the cases that are probably a government set up:</p>

<p>The Bali bombings, the London bombings, the Madrid bombings, the &quot;underwear bomber&quot;.</p>

<p>You have some evidence, and with the pattern you see, it&#39;s hard not to conclude this must be more of the same.</p>

<p>Then when you notice a pattern, you start seeing it everywhere, and you consider events to be false flag attacks, with the only evidence being &quot;well, they&#39;ve done it before&quot;.</p>

<p>Others will agree with you, because they have noticed the same pattern, and hence you rile each other up and find government fingerprints everywhere. Thanks to positive encouragement from others, you begin to believe you can predict terrorist attacks.</p>

<p>Eventually, you end up completely paranoid. Theoretically, the government is capable of making it rain above your house, just to keep you from going outside. They can give you cancer, make you mentally ill, and do whatever else they feel like.</p>

<p>To preserve your own sanity however, it&#39;s best to go for the simplest explanation that fits all the evidence: Sex starved nut-case carries out a massacre.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly, except this money was NOT for school or educational costs. it was a stipend for research students who had no time to work a real job because they spend 50 hours a week in a lab doing research. the money was used solely for cost of living. payments of $2200 a month is more than enough to fund an arsenal like he did. i dont get why people are having such a tough time accepting that where he got the money has nothing to do with this. just because you never got government aid to pay for your living expenses and a &quot;free ride&quot; through grad school, doesnt mean that those grants dont exist for others like james. he gamed the system for his own advantage. he took the money and used it for his plan. he is still gaming the system now he is in court, and im sure has figured out every possible scenario in this situation, because its obvious how intelligent he is from just the premeditation alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>youre an idiot. this is not college we are talking about, this is a research facility where the &quot;students&quot; participate in ongoing scientific research and do not have time to work a regular job. these are not regular grants or student loans. these are provided so that the &quot;student&quot; is able to fully emerse themselves in the research whilst not having to worry about other costs of living. if you have ever been to aurora, its a shit hole. cost of living there is relatively cheap. he lived in a slummy neighborhood and i know from personal experience, the cost of rent in a place like that. even if it was twice the average price of rent for that area, he still would have had at least 1200 a month left to save, or spend on weapons. this is not a huge stretch of the imagination, you obviously know nothing about the united states research institutes like the one holmes attended. just because its part of  the university of colorado, it has nothing to do with their other main campuses. there are probably no more than 50 students at one time in the facility and it is highly specialised and highly competitive.</p>

<p>Unless you are a lead investigator on the case, have access to his financials or are a close friend you wouldnt know how much he had saved, where or how he spent it, or if the government was his only source of income. If you were actually in a position to know any of this info you would be silenced by the court so you couldn&#39;t jeopardize the case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>people who have been &quot;silenced by the court&quot; have already spoken out. hence the need for motion D-11 by the defence in order to gain access to the discovery involved with the leak of information on the holmes case. the motion seeks to find the source of the leak as well as evidence that is currently being witheld from the defence. </p>

<p>that aside, you are missing the point here. the money is not the issue. he could have had credit cards, private student loans or just pulled off a robbery a month or two before. he could have been selling drugs or selling used panties on ebay. who the fuck cares? the money he got, however he got it went towards the purchase of weapons, ammunition and explosives for this assault. in your mind, what difference does it make that the money came from a possible alternative source than the NIH stipend he was receiving?</p>

<p>im only arguing this point because i am following this case closely. i am not trying to prove a conspiracy or any kind of government psy-ops. im simply here trying to make light of some serious inconstancies in  the media, as well as in the information released to the media by the courts. im not trying to prove hes innocent or that hes guilty. its quite obvious he is guilty. all that i am seeking is an explanation to his state of mind, his behaviour and his actions before and after the massacre. it is clear to anyone that there is a lot to this case, and that it will most likely be many months before anyone has a clear picture. the only purpose in my being here on this conspiracy theory subreddit is to gain alternate information and theories on the possible motivations and agendas that James holmes might have had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s great you&#39;re concerned about James Holmes and what made him do it but any info regarding that is in evidence. Any info you are getting about d-11&#39;s, the silencing on information is just speculation. Any truthful/factual/ or documentation info that isn&#39;t already public info already won&#39;t be disclosed until after the case because of the risk of jeopardizing the case.

    <div class="md"><p>yes, this is all true, although i did just post motion d11 for you, because well, im going to back up the shit im talking. i agree with what you say, it is true that most if not all info will be suppressed, but as said in the motion i posted, there has already been info leaked to the press and other sources who have gone on to make it public, and they are trying to suppress it for the reasons you stated. of course like any other US citzen he has the right to due process and a fair and impartial trial, however there is such a massive demand for info on this case that it will spill out to the media no matter how hard they try and control it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the grants were solely for living expenses, his tuition was covered by other funding for educational costs. the 26000 was released monthly in 2200 dollar payments. from that, it is easy to see how he could have afforded this, especially if he had credit cards, or multiple cards he racked up charges on. its easy for someone in his position to get a credit card with a high limit. what is it you think is going on that makes it so hard to believe he could have funded this himself using grant money? even if he just took out good old fashioned student loans, he still could have had many other ways to get &quot;free&quot; money.</p>

<p>edit: you obviously didnt read the articles i linked, or just cant read. this has already been proven as the source of all of his money. he had no job, was not on welfare and had SEVERAL grants for tuition, school expenses, living expenses and money for anything else he could have needed, including an arsenal of weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>both his mother and father have shown next to no interest in even being associated with the man. they have denied any kind of relationship with him, the only piece of info we know is that while in california he could not find work and his mother &quot;urged&quot; him to move to colorado to find work, but instead he enrolled in school. i think you are severely misunderstanding the fact that the research degree program he was involved with is not normal &quot;school&quot;. its a full time research position where there are only 6 students working together at any one time. it is highly specialised and highly competative, thus in order to get the best and brightest minds into these programs, the government fully pays for everything needed in order to live comfortably. the research being done at these schools is the type that goes towards major scientific discoveries and breakthroughs. if the government did not offer support financially for those in the program, many people would be excluded simply because they cant afford it, when they may be of much higher intellect than those who could afford it. </p>

<p>from all the sources that have spoken about it, james had no relationship with his parents after leaving california, and certainly did not receive support. the forensic evidence has already been found and it proves that he had no other sources of income other than the grants he received from the government. </p>

<p>i have access to the court proceedings and have read the information disclosed directly by the courts. the information i am posting is FACT. i am not doing anything other than regurgetating what has already been reported throughout the media, as well as quotes from the NIH itself, where they break down to the penny exactly how much money was given to holmes. most peoples salaries are not as high as the amount of money given to holmes to pay for his very cheap cost of living. you are denying all facts here just to make an irrelevant point about holmes&#39; source of income.</p>

<p>even if it did come from his family, what the fuck difference does that make? his dad sure as hell didnt send him 20 grand and say &quot;make sure to get the best weapons possibly jimmy!&quot;. the money is not the issue here. whether it came from mom, dad or the government, it went to the arsenal all the same. the money is not a factor in his motivation or in the execution of this crime. </p>

<p>Furthermore, if this attack were planned by some &quot;other entity,&quot; what would be the purpose in outfitting him in more gear than he could afford?  To protect <em>him</em>?  To protect the guy they allegedly brainwashed and sent in there?</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories always rely on the concept of the &quot;bumbling genius.&quot;  Smart enough to brainwash a kid, have him buy guns and ammo over the years (or fake the occurrences of that happening), stage a shooting, and completely lead the investigation by the nose without a <em>single</em> leak of this massive operation.... but too stupid for any one of the planners to say &quot;hey, this kid doesn&#39;t make a lot of money, shouldn&#39;t we like strap a trashcan lid to his chest instead?&quot;</p>

<p>Have any of you actually considered that the opposite is true? What IF this was a giant conspiracy between the NRA, gun manufacturers AND ammunition manufacturers? Nothing sells guns and ammo better than the THREAT of them being taken away. You&#39;ll not the significant uptick in background checks for firearms in the past weeks following the shooting. I&#39;m paraphrasing of course.

    <div class="md"><p>absolutely, its not suspicious at all, it just discloses that the defence has acknowledged that information is being leaked. james holmes did not disclose to police that he had sent a package. that was pure media speculation in this case. the issue with the package is that it contained explicit dialogue between Holmes and Dr. Fenton, which is privy to any patients right to privacy, especially in this case. the fact that either it was misreported that he disclosed the location, or there is some funny business over how it got there, why it sat around, and why it was unknown to Dr. Fenton that such a package had even been sent, considering the ongoing dialogue and treatment between the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>poor &amp; crazy gunman bought USD10&#39;s of thousands of dollars of military gear with no money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The total cost of his gear has been estimated at under $5000, even in this very subreddit.  I spent that much on a laptop when I was his age, and I didn&#39;t have a stipend.  Where are you getting the 10s of thousands total from?</p>

<p>Furthermore, if this attack were planned by some &quot;other entity,&quot; what would be the purpose in outfitting him in more gear than he could afford?  To protect <em>him</em>?  To protect the guy they allegedly brainwashed and sent in there?</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories always rely on the concept of the &quot;bumbling genius.&quot;  Smart enough to brainwash a kid, have him buy guns and ammo over the years (or fake the occurrences of that happening), stage a shooting, and completely lead the investigation by the nose without a <em>single</em> leak of this massive operation.... but too stupid for any one of the planners to say &quot;hey, this kid doesn&#39;t make a lot of money, shouldn&#39;t we like strap a trashcan lid to his chest instead?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not to mention that an action like this is far from &#39;normal&#39;. You don&#39;t get far from &#39;normal&#39; without a story of how you got there. Holmes&#39; story doesn&#39;t stand up very well. If he was so angry or insane, why would he turn himself in and then play stupid? To not think it&#39;s a possibility that he was influenced by something or someone in some way is just as crazy as assuming he was just batshit insane for no reason at all. He did work with DARPA and near military hospitals with his studies...</p>
