       What happens if the whole thing goes off without a hitch? I'll you guys admit defeat in the conspiracy that has been so ever present on here? Or will you say since you talked so much about it, they had to cancel? I'm not trying to be an ass or anything just curious. Cause saying the later is basically a self fulfilling prophecy, which leaves no room for the theory to be wrong. Which, by definition is not a theory because a theory will always leave its self open to be altered of needed. Thoughts?

       Yes without a hitch.  Then we will all be lauded conspirarrtards.  Yet the other conspiracy theorist that stationed 13,500 commando Marines, roof top missiles, built 11 miles of electrified security walls, well they'll be heros because the

       Considering the full strength of the Royal Marines is around 7,810 personnel. And the number of them that are commando trained is much less, this sentence is highly inaccurate.

       Yes, it is. But they're not Royal Marine very commandos. He's using the words marine Commandos to somehow make it sound more sinister and dangerous, as though we have highly trained killers stalking the streets of London. This is false, he's exaggerating to make a point. The vast majority of army personal deployed in London are support troops. From the logistics corp or the engineers or they're administration personnel. We don't have elite Infantry regiments patrolling the streets of London, armed to teeth waiting to execute people with no tickets. They're performing the same role as the civillian contractors who failed to deliver would be. They're checking ticket stubs and making sure people queue up in the right places etc etc.

       Yes, you're right. However you said that 13,500 Royal Marine Commandos were being deployed, in an effort to make it somehow sound more sinister and dangerous. That's false because there isn't 13,500 Royal Marines, let alone Marine Commandos. The majority of those being deployed are reservists or members of the support regiments. Not the line infantry battalions. Regardless, there's nothing sinister about the military being there anyway. The civillian contractors we hired to provide security failed to deliver, and the government is raping the police force so we had to provide security from somewhere. It makes sense to use the army because they're easy to mobilise and deploy, and its cheaper than hiring and training new security teams. Stop blowing things out of proportion.

       I don't even take issue with all the armchair quarterbacking and picking through events with 20/20 hindsight. Whatever, that's going to happen. Just downvote the ridiculous and move on. What I DO take issue with is when they say things like "The Olympic opening ceremony is tomorrow. What do you think is going to happen, and how does it relate to the aurora, co shootings?" This shit just makes my brain grind to a halt and ask 'What in the actual fuck are you talking about?'. It's spitballing to the N'th degree, and it's wrong. If something's fishy then by all means, tear it apart and find the connections.

       First of all no one said something will 100% happen. We all pointed out to the tell-tale signs and reports and news, like the Rockefeller's future scenarios report from 2010, the slight hints in movies, cartoons, card games, TV series, the slight hints in newspapers, the security theater and how they were scared Al-Ciaeda will attack with their airforce and thus they had to put anti-air missiles on people's rooftops, then the leak with the journalists who exposed the "lack" of security and how he was told something big will happen at the END of the Olympics, recently we've had Israel come out and say they fear Iran will attack the Olympics.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all tell-tale signs that they were/are/ planning to stage a false flag operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is still a chance they will carry out some false flag operation, even a smaller one like a smaller shooting, or smaller bomb, doesn't mean they will go with mega death, but yes talking about it and making sure they know we know who is responsible does back them off.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know if a false flag operation is fully exposed, its over for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And 9/11 was actually great, not in the sense that people died and stuff, that was obviously tragic, but it did wake up millions of people slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before 9/11 there were hundreds of people in the whole world exposing false flag, the NWO, etc... within few years of 9/11 hundreds of thousands and now tens of millions of people are aware and awake.
      </p>
      <p>
       So staging false flag is a lot harder for them and they know it will wake even more people up and then its game over for them.

       I gotta disagree with you there, they are likely jut confirmation bias. 'False flag' has been extrememly overused this year and even last year, it is the r/conspiracy meme.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as someone else pointed out, there are people in this sub who will connect things that have no connection because people look at conspiracies as an enjoyable pastime instead of just the hidden politics of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       There aren't many topics dealing with geopolitics in this sub, which is disappointing, because it is the motivation behind passed false flags (USS Liberty, the planned but not executed "Cuban" terrorist attacks, and potentially 9/11)

       Ok at first I though it was just a typo so I blew it off but you seem to really think it is tale-tale. Its TELL-tale or telltale. Never tale-tale. Sorry, but that was driving me nuts.

       You really don't have to get snappy. maybe there were signs, it is obviously easy to tell after the fact. But using symbolism as a way to predict future international events is subject to a degree of uncertainty that renders it useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will have noticed that 9/11 was included on my list, there were signs that something was going to happen, but that doesn't include symbolism. analyzing the relations between political entities and the tensions included, something was bound to precipitate. But of course that's easy to say now.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is that connecting things in arbitrary ways will get you nowhere. The false flag fan club was wrong, again. What a surprise. Because their arguments made no sense in the first place, not only on a political level, but the logic behind their thinking was just plain wrong.

       Who is saying its based on symbolism? Did you even read what I wrote?
      </p>
      <p>
       I said TV series, movies, card games, video games, newspapers, reports, the security facade with tens of thousands of military and anti aircraft rockets, its made to look as if there is a big threat, one we know is nothing more than Al-Ciaeda, but the average person thinks Osama Bin Laden the CIA agent that probably died 6 years ago as all reports indicate is the big satan and Al-Qaeda hides under every table, in that context they can use a false flag to reaffirm the public's irrational fear of terrorism. Then there was Israel saying Iran may attack the Olympic games, obviously creating cover stories ahead of time, if there was to be an event the narrative would be set.
      </p>
      <p>
       So
       <strong>
        ALL THAT
       </strong>
       combined + the end goal of these people being to create their one world government + we know they are capable and willing to do massive staged events + history = possible false flag operation in London and no one is saying its going to happen 100% and yes talking about it may have reverted it, if it was in the plans and it likely was.

       Those aren't credible sources to predict the future from. They have at most symbolism. The other sources you refer to are fine if you stop inferring things from them and then expecting something to happen i.e.  a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember those predictions about Israel sinking an obsolete US carrier? They had those reports where the carrier was scheduled to be decomissioned, and it was being deployed to the Persian Gulf. It didn't happen. While the reports may have been true, the inferred false flag didn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what you interpret as signs may be wrong or they may be just confirming your predisposition to the motives that drive "TPTB" (in your words "the end goal of these people being to create their one world government")
      </p>
      <p>
       My point still stands, stop with the false flag predictions, they are immature, unprofessional, and just make you look stupid.

       What's gonna happen is the same thing that happened with the UN summit, after it's gone and and over no one is going to make posts about it.  Just let it disappear; this sub-reddit is very good as "post-dicting" but not very good at predicting.  We can go back and look at the info and say "of course that's why it happened."  But no matter how many times people have "succeeded" in doing this, no one can predict one viable event before it happens.

       International geopolitics. I can't believe that while they have a fortified 'green zone' replete with gunships and air missiles, that there isn't some very serious business going on. At the very least it is an excuse to throw public money at the usual suspects: land monopolists, construction, military, secret police.

       <p>
        In 2012, the pandemic that the world had been 
anticipating for years finally hit. Unlike 2009’s 
H1N1, this new influenza strain—originating 
from wild geese—was extremely virulent and 
deadly. Even the most pandemic-prepared 
nations were quickly overwhelmed when the 
virus streaked around the world, infecting nearly 
20 percent of the global population and killing 
8 million in just seven months, the majority of

        Devastating shocks like September 11, the 
Southeast Asian tsunami of 2004, and the 
2010 Haiti earthquake had certainly primed 
the world for sudden disasters. But no one 
was prepared for a world in which large-scale 
catastrophes would occur with such breathtaking 
frequency. The years 2010 to 2020 were dubbed 
the “doom decade” for good reason: the 2012 
Olympic bombing, which killed 13,000, was 
followed closely by an earthquake in Indonesia 
killing 40,000, a tsunami that almost wiped 
out Nicaragua, and the onset of the West China 
Famine, caused by a once-in-a-millennium 
drought linked to climate change.

       Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called "The Pledge". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second act is called "The Turn". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call "The Prestige"."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the prestige.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not need 13,000 military soldiers stationed in one small tiny centralized location that prevents rapid mobilization and deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
       By concentrating all of your troops into a location where leaving and mobilizing is a logistics nightmare you INTENTIONALLY leave other softer targets wide open and ripe for attack.

       We will be wrong. That is all. We have seen in the past how the Olympics can be used as cover for news that TPTB does not want to be covered like the Georgian war. It isn't really up to the level of a "theory", it is just a guess bout what might happen based on past experience.

       False flag attacks are deterred all the time. Something could happen at any time. They could care less when I think at this point...just as long as their agenda is pushed to the extreme.

       You have to understand that there are reasons for the speculation, that we have genuine concern over the possibility of something drastic may take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the main issue here other, than our 'concern', is that people who observe others that speculate and conspire assume we would feel bad if nothing did take place and therefore admit defeat-as If we were plotting to do harm during the Olympics...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        No
       </strong>
       . This is not how it is (Well maybe for a psychopath). I think I speak for everyone who shares the same concerns as I do when I say I really hope that nothing happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure if you read down you will hear the same thing. False flags are real, and they have been used in the past. So why not now? I won't continue to speculate because the 99% who are in this forum already know the answer.

       I don't hope we are right so I can feel good about it. I hope it is just a conspiracy theory and we just need to re-calibrate our tin-foil hats to be more in tune with everything so we aren't labelled as Chicken Littles even further. 
What conspiracy theorist hopes he/she is right about a violent and catastrophic end to many, many lives?
Are there really people that
       <em>

       Honestly I'm not waiting for some big even at the Olympics. If it happens, it happens. There really isn't any solid back phone to the theory. Though what I am 100% sure will happen in the next 90 days is "iran" (and I use that term loosely) attacking the strait of Hormuz, and shutting off massive amounts of oil to the world. Making has skyrocket in the USA. Then I expect a mass staged massacre of Syrian people, to allow real foreign intervention. Also the gun treaty. If this thing isn't passed by Tuesday, you can bet you ball sack that this treaty is going to be lingering around over our heads until they pass an obscure vaguely worded version of it, just like they're doing with Internet censorship. Hun control and Internet cencorship are things that are going to happen. We can keep slapping away bills but eventually they will sneak one in under our noses, like they done with many highly unconstitutional bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Olympics will just be the icing on the cake if something does go down. But be sure of this my friends:
