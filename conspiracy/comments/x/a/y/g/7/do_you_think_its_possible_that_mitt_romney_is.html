    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s a party dominated by people such as Bachmann and her tea party counterparts right now - so what else would you expect?</p>

<p>You think the Koch brothers spent all their money on the tea party just so Obama could get elected again? That&#39;s why they run attack ads too, right?</p>

<p>I guess you didn&#39;t watch the debates where people cheered on the ignorance displayed by Bachmann &amp; co. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s not a conspiracy - it seems to be what a lot of Americans actually want. </p>

<p>-DNC Strategist.</p>

<p>Mitt Romney is a Hollywood gag.. British news were saying his adventure in London resembled a Chevy Chase Lampoon movie. My biggest fear is he somehow does get elected.. at least Obama is predictable. I was waiting for Romney to sucker punch Cameron by mistake, trying to open a bag of crisps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who gives a damn what kind of person Romney is? All politicians break their promises and lie, so why wouldn&#39;t they have a deceptive personality when talking to the American people? The more important issue is the policy. And both of their policies suck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely.  Something I&#39;ve suspected since the primaries ended.  If you&#39;ll notice, all the mainstream candidates in the republican primaries (with a couple exceptions) had crazier and crazier stances on all kinds of issues.  They were all put in place to make Romney seem reasonable by comparison - as well as test the waters on where the boundaries of public opinion on various issues are.  Romney has been put in place to make Obama seem like the obvious choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you missed the part where the primary voters applauded the silly stances of those candidates. And also - when they voted a bunch of them in during 2010. </p>

<p>You can thank the Tea Party for the current situation the GOP is in (so yeah, thank the Kochs).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The obvious goal to elect Barry O became transparent the moment Sarah Palin came into the picture. Having a geriatric, sickly man like McCain backed by such an imbecile gave swing voters no choice but to go Barry. Now the GOP pulls out another idiot clown in Romney whom only the Republican base will really vote for. Barry is secured again.</p>

<p>It makes sense. On the one hand, Barack proves a great villain to many Americans and in turn keeps internacine tensions high. On the other hand, he&#39;s an eloquent enough speaker to keep many entrenched as fans despite his record making absolutely no correlation to a majority of the planks that won him votes.</p>

<p>Divide and conquer. That&#39;s how the Rothchild&#39;s have ruled the world for years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kerry&#39;s military record didn&#39;t seem like a liability to me, compared with Bush&#39;s, especially in a time of war.</p>

<p>He might have seemed a bit high falutin&#39; to the independent voters, but fer fucksakes he actually served in a combat position. The swiftboat project was mind blowing. A vet who earned combat medals in Vietnam was viewed by the Republican patriot loving, war warmongering base as an America hating coward in comparison to a scion who stayed stateside. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possible?</p>

<p>Mitt Romney displays many - if not all - psychopathic traits.</p>

<p>His handlers can&#39;t be that daft.</p>

<p>Romney&#39;s role is identical to McCain&#39;s, Kerry&#39;s and Gore&#39;s.</p>

<p>Note that Gore stepped out of line by challenging the recount. And then he abruptly stopped the recount (gee, I wonder why he would be so quick to stop his own recount that looked like it would yield results . . .). They learned to only hire retards and buddies. Gore = uncontrolled. Kerry = buddy. McCain = buddy. Romney = retard [which is what a psychopath is].</p>
