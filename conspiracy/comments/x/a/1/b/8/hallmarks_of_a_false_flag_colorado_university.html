       interesting read there. its a bit on the crazy side, i still dont think this is some psy ops. its not that complex. conspiracy or not, one could easily be found who would be more than willing to carry this out, without mind altering substances involved. however, one thing that is quite interesting here is the comic strip. it is a coincidence that the shooter in the batman comic also had red hair and obviously was inspired by batman legend. i think that this may be quite important if indeed James Holmes is as interested or obsessed with batman as we are being told he is. thank you for posting this. any info is good info at this point, as there is just not enough to make sense of this yet.

       Okay.  Hold on.  This one whooshed over my head a little bit, I have to admit.  Wasn't Holmes attempting to be The Joker?  However, the way you reference things above, there was apparently some other dude in the Batman comic that
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       The Joker but who had red hair and shot up a theater?  Am I reading what you typed right?

      <p>
       Maybe I'm not.  Help me out a bit. :)

       ok ill address both your points, because you do indeed make good arguments. this whole thing is a matter of opinion right now, and most of whats being thrown around as "conspiracy theories" is highly speculative. so, on that note, i am going to use my experience with mental illness (i am mentally ill :) ) and also my experiences out in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       with regard to my quote about the abundant, willing patsy's out there, i really do feel this is true. lets disregard personal lives and lifestyle prior to the incident. there are plenty of people who would willingly give up their "life" to do something shocking and dangerous like James did. imagine being offered a certain amount of money in order to completely leave your life behind and have the opportunity to start a new identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       im getting quite "out there" with this one, but hear me out. lets say James was approached with a similar offer. all he had to do was execute the raid, hit as many targets as possible, then intentionally get arrested. we now know that he had been practice shooting almost daily in the last month at least. police, FBI and ATF have already followed his tracks from gun shop to shooting range and even to a town 100 miles away where he and a friend allegedly stayed overnight in between practicing at a local free firing range, open to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       so, knowing this it is easy to assume he was at least familiar with the weapons. if you think about the proximity he was to most of the shooting victims and people that got hit, it wouldnt have been that difficult for a person who had some practice shooting with their weapons. people are saying that he couldnt have shot that many people accurately unless he was SWAT trained... i dont agree. i think part of it was luck, also that it was relatively close range and he used 3 different weapons, reloading multiple times. there is still too much we dont know about the crime scene to make guesses at the details, although its already clear a lot of things dont add up the way weve been told they do. so despite all the details after the shooting, his job was to be arrested without incident. it was important that he survive. this is further proved by the body armour and protection he wore. he even prevented himself from being in excessive pain if anything were to happen since he took 100mg of Hydrocodone, an opiate pain killer, prior to the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       he took a great deal of care not to resist, not to get into confrontation with police at any point. someone who was hell-bent on killing as many people of possible would have followed the crowd, continued to fire and eventually fire on police before killing himself or being killed. everything that James Holmes did was an indication of his underlying intention to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       that part alone says a lot about what his motivations could be. maybe he has an agenda of some kind? those are additional things that i think are important to explore. either way, he was arrested without incident. he is currently "playing the insane card" as we have heard from the very knowledgable jail guards. that aside, is it that hard to believe that with a case of this kind of magnitude, with this much public outcry behind it, could actually be a ruse of some kind in order to rally support for... well, anything really. it could potentially become arguments for many issues in the USA. continuing on with this plan, James sits on trial for the crime, is sentenced to death, and as with most executions, we never actually see it...
      </p>
      <p>
       im not going to go on from there because its just going into crazy land after that point. im only really posing a theory this out there because i think there is a legitimate cause for concern with the evidence being shown to us and the medias reporting of certain facts. its clear to me that things "dont add up".
      </p>
      <p>
       about the joker thing... hes not trying to be the joker. i think that whatever came out about the character was probably due to possible psychosis. i say possible because nothings been proved, but i do believe that is what was happening at the time. the significance of the comic strip is the existence of a character with orange hair who kills people during a movie. whether or not James Holmes is "obsessed with batman and its characters" like the media have portrayed him to be changes the relevance of the comic strip.

       Really?  Wow.  I mean I know, of course, that there are many crazy people out there in the world.  I'm not naive about that.  However, it just seems weird to me to think that there are a lot of people that would be willing to "give up their life" in the process of doing something like this.

       But wait a minute.  What you just described right here has NOTHING to do with what the Aurora dude did.  I don't see how this scenario has anything to do with what was done there, as the dude got
       <em>
        caught
       </em>
       .

      <p>
       What kind of "new life" exactly are you believing Mr. Shooter was/is being offered?  And how much good exactly is WHATEVER amount of money he could have been offered when he's in jail either for LIFE or in death row?  There seems absolutely NO motivation in this scenario for almost ANYONE to go through with the shooting.  There's literally
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       reward for it under these circumstances.

       i guess i should have mentioned the most important part... he never actually serves time or gets the death penalty. we are told he was executed or that hes locked up forever in the federal supermax, when really they just walked him right out the other side and off into his new life.
      </p>
      <p>
       im only posing these crazy theories to try to explain something that doesnt make any sense. maybe this is not what happened and im just BS'ing, but id rather imagine every possible scenario before concluding that everything we are being told about this is fact.

       When I found out his pops was about to testify against LIBOR, setting the son up with the Aurora shootings all the sudden made a LOT more sense to me.

       I think that it's not a bad idea to consider as many options as possible, however, so I don't disagree with your approach.

       fair enough! we are all really just speculating at this point. my actual belief is that he is a paranoid schizophrenic and that he comitted this crime under his own steam, with only his knowledge. i think that most likely he has some kind of agenda, or something to prove, however in the end hes still guilty and most likely will get the death penalty.

       I get why there is all thoses crazy theories but, excuse me, if it
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       is a conspiracy , then
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       did they do it ? I mean, what's the goal ?
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't add anything in favor of the anti terrorism security and patriot act laws. Quite the contrary in fact, it would prove those are useless 'cause any insane fool able to buy guns, kevlar and train for a month can kill a lot regardless, all the while TSA is patting everybodies' underpants twice a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for the drill, the guy could have looked for the next one and waited for it, for maximum confusion/escape chances. I mean, it's not that hard to get the dates of the next emergency drill for local universities/school, you just need to look at information boards most of the time.

       There could be various reasons I'm/we're not aware of, but one obvious reason has to do with simply adding fuel to the "anti-gun" litigation that exists and has been trying to pass for a while now.  It seems that this incident alone has already allowed for heavy consideration to be given to banning at least certain types of semi automatic rifles from the public.  I'd say that is at least part of the end game in mind regarding unfortunate events like this one.

        It wouldn't add anything in favor of the anti terrorism security and patriot act laws. Quite the contrary in fact, it would prove those are useless 'cause any insane fool able to buy guns, kevlar and train for a month can kill a lot regardless

       No, no.  Quite the contrary actually.  What has to be understood is that occasions like what happened in Aurora don't undermine and invalidate the anti terrorism security legislation that exists, but, instead, politicians will say it actually

       the need for even MORE of it.  You don't see that?  It's scenarios like this one that will allow politicians to say "and THIS is why we need even MORE gun control and anti terrorism legislation.  What we've done up to this point obviously hasn't been enough, so we need to simply up the intensity of the patriot act laws."

       As far as your comment on the drill, I have to admit I didn't really follow what you were saying.
