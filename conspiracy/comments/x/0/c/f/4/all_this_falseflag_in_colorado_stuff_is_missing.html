       Many people round these parts are trying to label the cinema shooting as a Government op, I want to argue this isn't necessary. Can we try the labels 'intimate conspiracy', for planned events, such as 9/11, and 'systematic conspiracy', for dark events which happen due to intentional failings in society?
      </p>
      <p>
       The recent link to information about how every Swiss (mostly males, I think) have an automatic rifle squirreled away somewhere, you know, just in case. The Swiss have a habit of not shooting each other up, they're trained in how to use their weapons &amp; don't seem to be that fucked up. In fact, from my several visits there, I'd say there's a calmness there, which is alien even to the rest of Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people are born fuckups, some are made and it's up to society as a whole in how to deal with them. A quality &amp; well funded education system is a great place to start with helping people find their feet &amp; deal with their multitude of issues. It's like Huxley said in Island (and I paraphrase), that psychopaths simply need personalised attention, for them to come through their handicap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now take an education system which you guys have over in the States, where if you're state educated &amp; you don't fit into this narrow personality spectrum, you sink or swim on your own. Education there is all about making good little drones &amp; doesn't have the time, will or the resources to deal with people who're 'different'.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we really know about Mr McShooty-Bastard (double barreled killer, double-barreled name, geddit?!?!?) is that he was really fucked up, there's something about killing loads of people which is pretty incompatible with leading a balanced, fulfilling life. He was either born that way &amp; not given the help he needed, or we, as a society, helped make him that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here's the conspiracy - 'they', the aristocracy, know this is how it works, they aren't in the business of making happy, contented individuals, they just aren't very profitable or controllable, goddarnit. Events like this are a natural part of how our society work, they don't need to be planned, they don't need to be helped along. The fact that they profit from such events is, in my opinion, not up for debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing is, that if this is the case, it's an example where the conspiracy is both deeper &amp; easier to deal with, which is a very rare occurrence. If you feel angry, seek help, aim for love for yourself &amp; others. Don't let them break you, you're too beautiful for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;dr It's a load more sinister than planned ops &amp; false flags, but escape is possible.

       I agree with you, right up to your last sentence. Freedom has disappeared. What has been revealed over the last year has proven that. Our entire financial market is rigged, everyone that is suppose to be maintaining our system is instead laundering drug money and funding international terrorism. They then turn around and use that activity to deny our freedom and advance the control grid, making their fraud that much easier. The guns are the last hurdle. If the greater public realizes what has been done to them there will be blood in the streets, the gated streets. The

       Ah, you wanna talk about gun control. I don't really care to discuss that. If you don't have a gun by now, you shouldn't get one out of fear. However, If you'd like to read the topic of this post or the link I provided, you'll see we've branched out to include more encompassing concerns than gun laws.

       Indeed - this thread is beyond the topic you are talking about. Mainly because your focus is myopic paranoia - which I'm pointing out is pretty silly, especially in the context put on by the threadstarter.

       is a scientific study, completed in September 2011, showing The Network Of Global Corporate Control (that's science talk for Fascism). You'll find that your life is very much effected by this study. Let me quote the abstract for you, to get us started. Then you can continue to call me names.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We present the ﬁrst investigation of the
architecture of the international ownership network, along with the computation of the control
held by each global player. We ﬁnd that transnational corporations form a giant bow-tie structure and that a large portion of control ﬂows to a small tightly-knit core of ﬁnancial institutions.
This core can be seen as an economic “super-entity” that raises new important issues both for
researchers and policy makers

       What is a Super-entity hdd? You might be asking. The super-entity is a network of corporations that number exactly 147. These 147 corporations receive 40% of all the wealth in the world, and control 80% of the world's wealth in total.

       Indeed - which is why it's ridiculous for you to worry about him staging false flag attacks to take your guns.

       For some reason you think I don't believe in conspiracy theories - but then I guess you didn't investigate my posting history.

       I still don't think the government is coming to take your guns.

        This super-entity you keep talking about, isn't it possible that such a thing might have been created by the self organizing nature of complex systems? It doesn't have to be a conspiracy, does it?

      <p>
       I'm glad you asked that. The results of the study show that, globally, top holders are at least in the position to exert considerable control, either formally (e.g., voting in shareholder and board meetings) or via informal negotiations.

       <p>
        Informal negotiations? What are those?

       Again, good question, and that brings us back to LIBOR. Perhaps you've heard about it?

       Most of the complex web that maintains the status quo is self-sustaining. I totally agree with that. Journalists know that if they mention conspiracies, masonic power, banking dynasties they will kill their career. Not through some avert process necessarily but they will just seem to be lack a certain gravitas needed for promotion. The same goes for teachers, scientists, and other professionals the status quo is simply maintained by creating an emotional pressure to not talking about certain things in certain ways. That said we are living in strange times when I am in r/worldnews or
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       I have to check that I am not actually in r/conspiracy. When you are reading every day about conspiracies that have been acknowledged in the banks and in the pharmaceutical industry in the msm then you realise that these topics are briefly mainstream ones. It will be interesting to see if the window is large enough to actually force some change.

       I agree that this is one possible explanation for how things turned out. If the shooter truly is just a crazy nut job, then yes, it was our society that failed to notice and get him the help he needed. We tend to over diagnose things like ADD and ADHD, and under diagnose the really nasty mental illnesses. It's also difficult to catch some of those bad ones, since they can pop up in your late 20s (like Schizophrenia), but I have a hard time believing that this guy was just mentally ill and managed to slip through the cracks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible, certainly. I don't think it's very likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is true, I think, that our society is designed in such a way that people do go crazy and lose their minds because of the amount of stress and the difficulty of living in the modern world (the amount of things you have to worry about/keep up with). I'm not sure that this is necessarily intentional, but it is a byproduct of our need to push the envelope as far as technology is concerned before we even worry about where we are mentally.

       I do think our society is designed to demoralize and dehumanize us to the point that we only care about ourselves and those closest to us. Community is a thing of the past, despite the ease of creating a community in this day and age.

       From anyone who's studied history, there is no such thing as a populace free of weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just free of obvious weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the populace wan'ts to rise up, having guns, or not having guns, won't make any difference.  It'll deter in the beginning, but it won't stop it, or even slow it down once it starts.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are incredibly ingenious at killing each other, the hardest part is getting them to want to.  But the government is doing a pretty good job of heading down that path by turning their backs on the people who put them in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I see a voting revolution happening before a gunfire one does.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a real attempt at change within the system failed, THEN, you'd have your revolution.  But until then, it's our own damn dumb fault.

       Don't underestimate psychopathy.  Some people are born without the ability to empathize or feel guilt.  I sympathize with the niceness of your message, but I had to challenge the Huxley quote, because I don't think there's any therapy that can "cure" psychopathy.

       Really mate, there is no underestimation here, I'm very aware of the realities of what makes a psychopath. It's not so much about 'cure', as that would imply the gift of empathy, it's more along the lines of working with people, so they can learn the skills to survive, prosper &amp; generally not be a dickhead.
       <em>
        That
       </em>
       is more than possible, with a hell of a lot of individualised attention, over a very long time period.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find people who talk about living with psychopathy or whatever on Reddit, I've a friend who's incapable of empathy, but, you know, he deals with it. He's weird, but a strangely good guy to have around.

       Can any amount of therapy make a blind man see?
      </p>
      <p>
       My belief is that psychopathy is
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       ingrained into certain people.  Maybe I am way more cautious about this kind of thing, but my own brush with psychopathic people made me fear for my life.  They can be so dangerous.

       Again, pretty much totally agree, a psychopath is a genuinely terrifying thing to encounter &amp; yes, the disorder runs deep. This, to me shows the scale of the job needed, not the impossibility. It seems like a combination of high levels of therapy &amp; finding a place where they can enjoy themselves without harming others, is the key.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first &amp; most important steps would be baring people with such disorders from any real form of power, but I can't exactly see that one happening. I'm sure we're on the same page to see psychopathy as an integral support mechanism for our society.

       How do you deal with psychopaths? Do you have any defense mechanisms?

       Right now, I deal with them by identifying them ASAP and avoiding them.  It's not much of a solution, but it does keep me out of harm's way.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for barring psychopaths from positions of power, I think that's a great idea.  Unfortunately, there are already many psychopaths in positions of great power, and neutralizing them would be difficult.  I don't have a good strategy against them, but I'm almost positive violent force would be necessary.  It sucks, I know, but I don't have anything better.

        This super-entity you keep talking about, isn't it possible that such a thing might have been created by the self organizing nature of complex systems? It doesn't have to be a conspiracy, does it?

       I'm glad you asked that. The results of the study show that, globally, top holders are at least in the position to exert considerable control, either formally (e.g., voting in shareholder and board meetings) or via informal negotiations.

        Informal negotiations? What are those?
