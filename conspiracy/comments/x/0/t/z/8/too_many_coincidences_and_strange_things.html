       Me too. I was attacked violently yesterday for pointing out the facts and saying its 100% false flag operation, when I had all the facts researched and came to the conclusion it can only be staged as all the facts pointed to it and a bunch of idiots and/or pentagon propagandists attacked me as delusional and paranoid. Just like they attacked people who instantly after 9/11 knew it was a false and went public flag, they attacked them to try and discredit them and cause in-fighting between the conspiracy theorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       One actually had a 6 day old account that got over 70+ up-votes, even though my article was popular and obviously the majority of people had done the research themselves and agreed it was a false flag operation. Another other one was a British citizen with history of depression because of physical appearance and knee jerk reactions to pretty much everything, just obvious uninformed European liberal type.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my post. I explained in it what will be gained by this shooting and how it shifts the focus from other things that are happening and how all facts pointed to it being staged.

       What point is that? That I'm instantly insulted on my normal post without any arguments on kkurbs part, at which point I'm going to return the favor and insult him back?

       It proves that kkurbs is a fucking stupid idiot and piece of trash, who goes on insulting people, presenting no points or facts on his own, just going around insulting people, simple as that.

       I would like to add the story of TDKR.  I won't spoil it for those that haven't seen it but it's about a part of Gotham that gets isolated from the police and how the people start rioting and turning into animals.  Showing how we can't even last a week without the state.  After this horrible shooting in Aurora we will see the state asked to do more to protect us, meaning more laws that take away our rights.

       Same here, now the big discussion point will be whether citizens should be allowed to buy firearms, and even on the front page of a newspaper in my city (I live in Australia), the headline was along the lines of 'celebrities rally for gun control'.

       CNN was just discussing some strangeness when interviewing the school official that's responsible for the school Holmes went to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Him dropping out of his school is important. It's highly unprecedented and the school didn't perform the interviews that it normally does when a student drops out. in his cat he didn't drop out, he quit, which makes it even more suspicious. The school official that the media interviewed got "highly defensive" (that's CNN's quote, not mine) when asked about why he wasn't processed upon quitting the program as an A student and even more defensive when asked about giving that information to the victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's strange to me and should be looked at more closely. WHO is this official, and does he have an ties to "powers that be" who could benefit from a cover-up?

       I was in a safety drill like the one at that hospital. Things like that are commonplace. Considering the location of the shooting I'm not surprised there are symbolic and coincidental connections to other events. I'm not sure exactly what it's supposed to imply though other than that we have a pretty death obsessed culture.

        after
       </em>
       the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP - please read that training drill article you linked to. The real event happened at like 12:30am on Friday. And this hospital training, in which they incorporated the day's events, occurred during the day that same Friday. There's nothing spooky about that.

       and they decided to do
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       drill on the spur of the moment? it was not planned in advanced? the fact that it happened on the same day but later in the day means that the planning time of the two events were not mutually exclusive, they coincided.

       Those types of drills are planned weeks, months, and (if they're very large) years in advance. Can't throw something like that together in a day.

       exactly my point. saying that the drill's similarities to the actual events can be dismissed because the drill happened during the same day, but hours after the shootings, is disingenuous at best.

       You could be right. I've personally only been involved in trainings at mental health facilities - and they were conducted multiple times per month, and could easily have the details of their curriculum shifted in order to accommodate different details.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, this training sounds more substantial: 150 people (at once?), pretty detailed simulations (perhaps), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to guess that a "crisis in a theatre" simulation is a pretty common theme in emergency worker trainings.

       dont really but into conspiracy theories anymore, but the boy does look drugged, but thats probably coz he is, i mean he shot up a movie theatre so is probably on anti-psychotics, bit scary tho i have to admit, keeping him compliant and all that.

       i tend to agree, if the person is so psychotic they cant function off medication then clearly they arent culpalble for their actions. This guy seemed to be functioning well enough to stockpile weapons and ammo in the weeks before the incident so seems lie he knew what he was doing so if he has now been medicated (i read he refused medication and isnt cooperating with the police) to be kept compliant something is very amiss. I tend to side with others that say his behaviour is probably down to sleep deprivation and/or a psychotic break then some sort of zombie pill.

       i disagree.  the use of seroquel (an anti-psychotic) is used in jails and prisons with frequency.  the main side effect is sleepiness.  after shooting 71 people at random, i'm sure the jail's doctors administered some sort of anti-psychotic.  they make any one sleepy.

       The guy also thinks he is The Joker. Worst part is it seems he is trying to imitate the psyche of Heath Ledgers Joker too by being insane. He booby trapped his apartment and if you look at the messages the Joker gives in TDK, this kid seems like he is trying to live out some sick fantasy. You only shoot up a theatre if you want insanity and chaos. He full on knew what he was doing beforehand, even if he did it in a crazy state of mind or not.

       Question: there has been speculation over no witness or surviving victim actually seeing the guy's face during the attack due to the helmet/gasmask.  Is there evidence of this?
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm finding odd is the insistence of media and some authorities not to use the name of the guy. Such a difference over all the
       <em>
        bad men
       </em>
       and boogeymen attacking all over the world, whose faces are instantly publicized and their names blared. Guess has to do to the fact the guy is white, and that also has stopped all media from uttering the T word...

       There have been many people interviewed that were there. If you say nobody saw him then you clearly have not been following the story. He bought a ticket and sat near the front of the theater. 10 minutes in, he was witnessed picking up his phone and walking out the emergency exit as if he had a call. Even the guy that watched him said he thought that was really weird. Holmes was parked outside the exit door. He propped the door enough to not be visible but allow him back in. He geared up and walked back inside. Several people saw him undoubtedly.

       Nobody was able to identify who the shooter was, besides the police.  The theater was full of chemical agent, the shooter had complete facial and body concealment, it was in a DARKENED MOVIE THEATER and the movie goers were fleeing in in a state of pandemonium.  Imagine the effect on their vision from the muzzle blasts, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are NO witnesses who were able to identify the shooter; only the individual who opened the door.  Assuming Holmes is the shooter at this point in time is a leap of judgement, perhaps greater than mine, as I am not accusing any specific individual of a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am stating known facts:  Holmes opened the exit door and exited the theater, afterwards an individual entered said door and initiated the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are proposing conjecture:  Holmes opened the door and exited the theater (this part is accurate, according to witness statements), he then went to his vehicle and changed into full riot gear (this part is conjecture), before reentering the theater and initiating the attack (this is also conjecture).
      </p>

       Cheers.

       You're right then. It is conjecture. And the officer that arrested him with his shit on is also full of conjecture. I guess since all you have to do is wear a mask, you can say someone stole your car, planted your fingerprints on everything, and say you didn't know you could walk out of the movie theater emergency exit to take a call, then you could get away with everything. Someone could put a mask on and shoot up your house and if you lived and I was arrested with the guns in my hand outside your house, I could walk because YOU didn't see my face during the incident.
Good to know.

       You should really get your facts straight before you allow yourself to become indignant and start fabricating irrelevant stories; it makes you appear asinine.

       The shooting occurred the first day of Ramadan and right after high-ranking Syrian officials have been killed.  Could be retaliation from Hezbollah or Syria.  The government would then make a crazy lone gunman cover-story. The government may also leave odd bits and ends for conspiracy theorists to build theories on, filling the Internet with wild theories.  This would completely drown, with media complicity, any message that may link the attack to a foreign entity.

       Did anyone bother to make that Roll Call public PRIOR to the shooting? To me it seemed to pop up all over the net the day after the shooting. Surely someone would have released it before the event ("Hey look at this this, maybe they are going to install TSA in theatres.." type of thing).

       Question: How does an unemployed medical student afford $20,000 in weapons gear?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you start to look at the really big picture here, the obvious question arises: How does an unemployed medical student afford all the complex weapons gear, bomb-making gear, "flammable" booby trap devices, ammunition, multiple magazines, bullet-proof vest, groin protection, ballistic helmet, SWAT uniform and all the rest of it?

       Student loans, credit cards, parents money, etc.  This has been covered.

       Plus the fact that there's no indication he had $20k worth of gear.  His "armor" was a few hundred dollars worth of gear, let's say it's a thousand, those shin guards can be expensive; 2-3k for the guns; another 1k for ammo and his extended mags.  Now, I don't know how much the gas canisters are, but I doubt they're 15k.

       I believe he was a phd student at the medical school but regardless, the federal government guarantees money for tuition and room/board up to a universities cost of attendance. This COA number is inflated a bit so students have wiggle room and the schools, and many banks, offer loans on top the COA. I think COA ranges from 60-75k per year at most programs. So, in short, likely the Feds supplied all that cash. Not knowingly but I find some dark humor in that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm not sure what the phd structure is like but for health students (dentists, docs, etc,) that is how the layout works. My non health phd friends get 30k or so from the school and free tuition if I recall.

       Sort of. it's all based on cost of attendance and undergrad is Cheaper. They even pay less than half the interest grad students do. But this isnt the place to debate higher education costs

       It is if you're claim is that he's getting $10k extra which he can afford to just blow on fancy armor and stuff... Though I don't currently know any grad students, the few I have known had to be on a fairly tight budget and my peers as undergrads at a nearby University certainly don't get anywhere close to an extra $10k over the summer.

       There's no way Lil Wayne's video is anything more than coincidence. He shot more people than 12, and if 10 more of them had died, nobody would be even making the connection. He was shooting into a huge crowd, how do you think he would be able to do that still keep the number to 12? Not relevant, neither is the comic reference.

       Read what I said. How could he have shot 70 people and only killed 12 of them? He isn't a trained soldier (which would make it only slightly more plausible) so he's not some wicked sharpshooter. People were running and moving anyways, it was pure chance only 12 of the people that got shot died. Everyone that got hit and lived is lucky they aren't amongst the dead because it could easily have gone another way.

       If anybody believes in the Illuminati, new world order or anything close or similar to that there has been many examples how they have a hand in everything including the music industry and media. Lil wayne, jay z, and kanye west have all had weird music videos seeming to have multiple and odd secret messages or references. Now my personal opinion is I have no idea what to believe. However, if you look into some simple symbolism and or signs of old societies and underlining groups throughout history they are all embedded in main stream media. Could it all just be one huge coincidence of course but it does raise questions. Also the two victims in military intelligence raises a huge red flag for me, having a father whom is in terrorist intelligence I know he knows a lot of stuff... A LOT!. therefore acquiring information from previous history if someone knows something of great importance that they shouldn't more or likely they will be taken out. A group or single person could do this and has been done in history. But I don't believe this to be the case because the shooter of the theater had a semi-automatic rifle which jammed during the shooting, any trained personal could easily fix a jam with in a couple seconds and return to firing. Sorry for rambling just providing some info to maybe raise more questions and theories. Playing the devils advocate if you will.

       So you're suggesting that Jay-Z , Lil Wayne, and Kanye have some Illuminati connections and are giving us subtle hints that the shit is real? As if some ultra secret, shadow government-esque organization (if it were even real) would let that kind of thing take place?

       I don't imagine they even need any, considering all of their "music" is made by someone else. They're just paper dolls who sometimes shout obscenities at microphones.

       Yes, its still a diamond. Just cuz you found a picture of him looking through it doesn't make it not a diamond. People use that effect with smoke rings and all kinds of stuff because it makes for a cool picture. Jay-z is not part of a fucking conspiracy.

       I'd love to discuss the conspiracy of JayZ being Illuminati.

       I've asked this before, no one's given me a rational response. If you believe JayZ is a Illuminatis or puppet of, what exactly is he brain washing us to do or not do?

       Just cause i don't agree doesn't mean i don't respect your answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd agree with 2 out of 3 of these. He doesn't make selling crack cool, i think he tells his tales of it in an artful way, but the history of media is full of examples of interesting or stylized things that normal people wouldn't dream of doing. For example, it's cool how they rob banks in Point Break and Inside Man, but i wouldn't do it. People would sell drugs and rob banks with or without hip hop, and plenty did before the genre came around inthe late 70's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the number of ppl who sold crack because Jayz told them to is around the same number that killed their wife or mother because Eminem told them to.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the list of those pushing the religion of money and materialism goes way beyond Jay Z. Very few in media aren't guilty of pushing those things, and most do it a lot more subtly than Jay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where's the line though? Bragging and boasting is a common thing in hip hop, as is bragging about money and material things. What separates the diamond his fans throw up from the the Nike swoosh or any other Brand? It's branding, not illuminati.

       You're getting close buddy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the Bible. Start with Psalm 2:2:
      </p>
      <p>
       The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed (Jesus Christ), saying,
Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.
      </p>
      <p>
       They worship Lucifer. The devil. Yes, he's real. Yes, God is real. Yes, the devil reall HAS tricked the entire world.  I won't get too deep into this because it's so deep it's scary, but start looking for the signs and you WILL see them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The humans that you see are merely puppets to the devil and his fallen angels. Everything in this world is related to God.  The "illuminati/new world order" conspiracy is just the physical manifestation of a supernatural war going on in the heavens.  They are bringing this all about so the anti-christ can rule over the world instead of Christ in his 1000 year range.
      </p>
      <p>
       The devil has the ENTIRE world tricked.  Even conspiracy theorists that start cluing into this stuff are deceived, because they think it's "The bankers" or "the Jews".  Well, it is the jews, but not the REAL jews, it's THESE jews:
      </p>
      <p>
       Revelation 2:9
I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and
       <strong>
        I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing "we the people" can do can stop any of this. Christ and God are going to, you just need to make sure you're on the winning team when judgement day comes.

       There's been a lot of mention on this thread about the 12 victims, and the 12 skeletons in the lil Wayne vid. But to me that seems unrelated, if only because you can't predict how many would have died. Many more could have succombed to blood loss, or died from shock, some of those who were killed just might have survived their wounds if circumstances had been just a bit different. To me there's no way anyone could "predict" 12 deaths in such a scenario, even if well planned out.

       I think he was sent to kill certain people in that theater by a government or shadow government organiztion. He was sent to also kill others to make it look insane and random. The movie connection, the explosive rigs, dropping out of the grad program, dying his hair red, getting denied to the gun club because of weird messages, all carefully staged to make him look unhinged so later the blame could be placed on him. Think Manchurian Candidate theory. He was recruited for this through his connection to the government. Weren't there military related people in that theater who died? Anyone been looking into that? Plus that reporter who nearly died in that shooting in Canada. I don't think he could really afford all that stuff himself and I think someone was helping him get it, and I think someone is telling him exactly what to do now. They wanted the people connected to the military and the reporter DEAD, for whatever reason, probably because they knew too much or were getting in the way somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Illuminati and the lil Wayne video that shit is creepy. Don't really know what to make of it besides maybe it was meant as a coded warning or message to someone involved in the shooting. Maybe it was a message to Holmes to go through with it, the details of the visuals in the video a code of instructions. But then the whole Illuminati thing...I always feel like people against or interested in the Illuminati tend to be deeply religious, or at least that's what I've been seeing a lot of, and they loose me in the dogma. The government needing to kill certain people for whatever reason sounds more plausible and less complicated to me, and if anything I think this video may have been a part of it as a coded message to Holmes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have another theory, or agree with one, that perhaps Holmes isn't the shooter, but a patsy, and someone else did the actual shooting to ensure the targets were killed. One opposing point to that theory that comes to mind is perhaps limited visibility from the dark and from the smoke bombs. But maybe nightvision was used. Now I'm just reachin.

       I'm pretty sure that comic books have covered every imaginable scenario and then some. One could say that comic books predicted an alien invasion where humans are harvested for their meat if it ever were to happen.

       Here's another coincidence that some are overlooking: the guy was also a kook in a high-pressure academic program while taking heavy pharmaceutical drugs.

       Have they released that Holmes is medicated?  I hadn't seen yet, but honestly I have had about enough of the reports.  It's all the same rehashed bs, but I am curious about his medical information if it has been released.

       They make some good points here about them not being able to give him meds, and yes, they DO want to monitor his state to see what if anything is going on, but it doesn't mean he wasn't.

       I have heard in several places that Holmes was on Vicodin and admitted it to police.  The
       <a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/31290793/detail.html">
        source
       </a>
       is the ABC news affiliate in Denver.  They do not name their source and the statement is kind of glossed over.  It could be true, although without identifying the source it's just hearsay.  Unfortunately, with the records sealed we will most likely never find out about his drug panel.

       <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/life_of_depraved_sex_VX83ThuIVAk8Fl62xYJyMI/1">
        The NY Post
       </a>
       has an alleged witness to Holmes' pot smoking.  The witness is Lance Bradshaw, 25 and he says, "I’d see him smoking weed behind the apartment."  At least the person is identified and it seems legit.  It would be interesting to get more details though.  The link is to page 2, which is where the reference is, but if you want to read the whole article you'll have to go to page 1.

        The Chicago Suntimes
       </a>
       claims only that Homes' was "found in possession of Vicodin."  This article is weird, it's basically 3 factoids about the case and then it goes into some other crap below without much segue.  However, one of the factoids unrelated to the drug claim was interesting, "Fact: Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates, who is a friend of Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, previously worked in the intelligence division of the New York City Police Department."

       Most of what I've read is that he was on "100 mg of Vicodin".
      </p>
      <p>
       Standard dose is 5mg hydrocodone/500mg acetaminophen. So he'd have to have taken 20 of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What gets me about his initital encounter with the cops is that he was forthcoming with info. He tells them he's on Vicodin? He tells them about the explosives in his apartment? Then, later, he is refusing to be cooperative? ABS News now reports him spitting at guards, and using the plastic bags placed over his hands to save the gun powder residue evidence as "puppets." Story here:

       Pot wouldn't suprise me. I don't think it's very relevant unless he is truly mentally ill. Drug abuse could exacerbate his symptoms.

       Yes the vicodin claim comes from the Denver channel 7 article and is not verifiable so I don't know.  I agree it's weird that he just hung out and waited for the cops to show up and essentially confessed.  Then in jail the cops have to wear spit guards because he is constantly spitting at them and other people and shit, something is fishy here.  I don't know what it is but it's not sitting right.   What the police/ FBI are claiming is just not adding up and now the case is sealed sooooo... I guess all we have is suspicions and gossip to go off of.

       Also, there was a report that an inmate (conveniently) released today was the one who claims to have witnesses Holmes spitting and acting violently towards guards.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same news report went right on to contradict itself by saying that Holmes was being kept away from other inmates. Oops.

       Thats interesting. The huge theatre complex in my city has 2 of those doors in every section, and they definitely dont have alarms. (i walked out of them to "steal" the imax 3d glasses one time ... )

       The problem is that most theaters have doors at the front to allow for quicker exits for customers after the movie and aren't in fact emergency exits (and thus not covered with alarms). He'll have no case there.

       So in 1984 Frank Miller plotted out a theater shooting scene with the CIA? Will you now edit your post and include the fact that the comic scene in question was written in 1984?

       Not at all. I do NOT discount the possibility, but it is irresponsible for people to put out disinfo just because they think it's ironic or coincidental. That's just fucking stupid.
BTW you should also learn to read before you get on your high horse. I didn't say anything about what this was and was not.

       I was critical with the OP. That's what I did. You put nothing on me. If more of you people were critical you wouldn't be such laughing stocks...in case the down vote befall me, yes many of you are laughed at by everyday people. Shocking I know, but that's what you get when you want to be pseudo intellectuals.

       We don't have to be critical of each other because we are not delusional to the false utopia of control that is ever pushing forward in the world.  I don't care if sheep laugh at me, for they are nothing more than sheep.  We are here to speak freely, to mention our ideas, to connect with others of similar ideologies.  Not to be harassed by internet white knights who feel they have to step into the wilderness and expect to tame it.  Everyone lives a delusion, whether it's the person being controlled, the person controlling, or even the observer who happens to notice what's really going on.  You are watching numerous people jump into a volcano and calling it nothing more than people jumping.  You fail to acknowledge the volcano all.  As we sit and point and say "Hey, those people are jumping into volcanoes!  I don't think I want to do that," you waste your time and ours by going "You're wrong, they are jumping and there is nothing more to it!"

       Wow. A volcano. The OP posted bullshit. I called bullshit. It's really that simple. 
I'm sure whatever you're talking about might make a lot of sense to you, I'm not saying it doesn't but I'm going to keep this simple. The OP did not post a "theory" based on any types of facts. The OP posted disinfo. 
Maybe this sub should be renamed r\conspiracy_ideaithoughtofwhileplaying360
I'm sure you're right about your volcano thing, but you aren't correct about what I am saying until you accept that fact that making up lies shouldn't be defended.

       He didn't make anything up you fucking prick.  He simply stated a list of information, and drew no conclusions from it.  All the while saying that they were coincidences.  You drew your own conclusions from it and called him a liar, that seems like your own problem.

       No cunt, read above. I told him that the comic came out in 1984 and he posted that information without checking. I gave you dick brained idiots a litteral example of how the OP was making up facts. Then after point this out to him he said "whatever". Suck a dick moron.

       Usually we're not critical each other because most people don't come here and deliberately provide us disinfo, like you did, being a fucking "cunt" that you are claiming others to be.  You're starting a god damned fight by being dishonest and calling other people idiots.  What makes you "right" and why the fuck would you even care if you were so "right?"

       Why do you think that insulting people is okay? Do you really think people are going to take you seriously when you're acting like an asshat half of the time?
      </p>
      <p>
       Grow up. You want us to be critical, which is exactly what we are doing by accepting all possibilities rather than the one fed to us. Meanwhile, you are insulting people for not believing what you say as if we're scientologists and you are Tom Cruise.
      </p>

I know all I'll ever need to know about Monarch Programming, mind control, Alistair Crowley, 666,777, Liber number you people make shit up. It's all out there on the internet. Anyone can Google. You're not intelligent because you can sit through a fucking YouTube video. 
If you are capable of critical thought you have yet to even suggest it. 
I'll make this simple;
The OP (still following me?) made shit up(that's the important part). Now I know that those five words are troubling you because I am corse so let me try something different with you...get comfy...are you hungry? Want a warmer blanket? Okay. The OP...remember him?

       You're not going to understand anything I'm saying until you're not worried about being "right". I understand how that seems hypocritical but it's not, its rather a matter of semantics. 
I was insulting to people because I felt like it. I also understand how that makes me appear to be an asshole or what have you and that is also correct, but since I'm not worried about making friends it amounts to little.
The context of what I was saying is true regardless of behavior. The OP was making shit up and people were accepting it as truth. I can't understand how that is acceptable. 
Who cares about my bedside manner? Why be so preoccupied with opinions? There was a fact and that was ignored. 
I'll shoot you a pm if you're seriously interested in learning about those things I mentioned.

       Also, the OP threw the 1984 point into his surmation after I suggested he do so with no research on his part. The comic came out in 1986. Maybe you're doing yourself a disservice by assuming that people here, including the OP is capable of independent thought.

       LMAO. Seriously you people are hilarious. IDK what you're talking about with the VC link. Try to be somewhat specific when you're communication. I know that you'll have to deal with being incorrect all the time but it'll eventually help.
If you're referencing when the issues were published, I dont need a link for that. I own them and can read them perfectly fine. 
Im sorry that the details about the OP making shit up without verification is cumbersome to you, but some of those "details" that you seem to disdain sometimes help people solving crimes. Good thing you're not worried about confusing thing like details or the truth. Making shit up and blaming some unseen force works much better.

       The VC link, is the link you clicked on, a few posts below.  No need to be disingenuous.  If you have a copy of this Batman comic, would you mind posting a picture of you holding it with a timestamp?

       The rest of your comment appears to be an angry diatribe, unrelated to the topic we are discussing, and is full of the conjecture that you have such disdain for.

       The fact is, I accused you of prejudging the majority of redditors here, you denied it, and then confirmed it in the very next comment.  I fear the longer this conversation carries out, the more disturbed you will become.

       Time stamp? Look up the publishing date. What is wrong with you people? It's simple fucking deduction. It's Occam's Razor . This asshole was posting disinfo. Even if it was a conspiracy theory sub as opposed to a conspiracy sub, it wouldn't excuse lies. At that "theory" would denote a scientific process. Guessing and blatantly making up shit to whip hysteria is not science no matter how much it would make you feel better.

       I know the date the book was published.

      <p>
       You claimed you owned the issue of the Batman comic in question, as opposed to clicking on the link I reposted and feigning intellectual superiority.
      </p>
      <p>
       I called you on your claim, as little lies like that tend to expose liars for what they are, more often than big ones.  Rather than comply, you chose to act ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I now am no longer interested in a timestamp, nor continuing this pathetic, one sided debate.  Consider it a favor, as the more you post, the more irrational and fallacious your responses become.  Clinging to minute, meaningless issues as you are, is a hallmark of an argument from a position of bad faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no interest in debating someone that has made themselves known to be a liar, especially involving a detail so insignificant.

I'm not a liar because you're too lazy to read comments. I'll cut and paste it since that's what dip shits like you seem understand...

So in 1984 Frank Miller plotted out a theater shooting scene with the CIA? Will you now edit your post and include the fact that the comic scene in question was written in 1984?

But, you'd drawn out everything else they were supposed to think. Why stop now? The unfortunate part is that with people like you just wildly making up connections it makes other's who might take time and pride in their research look like fucking idiots. You're irresponsible.

       I'm not arguing with you about the date on the comic book, as the idea of this book being related to the shooting in anyway is a novelty at best.

       LMAO. You call me self righteous and then guess. What a joker. No pun...maybe a little. 
I'm not stupid enough to assume anything. I asked questions and proved myself correct. The OP was irresponsible and I pointed it out. 
You can defend speculation if you'd like but I don't play guessing games. That's for asshole.

       Wasnt he a neuro science major or something?  Psycology major breeds crazy.  But there is a little lack of closure until he speaks, so i guess you still have a littl room to present a conspiracy case.  Im not sensing any push for reform springing from this so i cant see the reasoning behind it.  But two or three more of these in short time would put a strong push towards the security state.

       Now you guys are reaching far. If he was some sort of trained agent or intelligence drone or whatever you're professing, you're telling me that with hundreds of ammunition at his disposal he was able to only kill 12 people? The kill count is the strongest arrow pointing to a an amateur, a stupid immature kid with no idea what he's doing.

       You're forgetting he injured a lot more than just 12 people, this was one of the largest if not the largest mass shooting in the US in quite awhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a military person in the theater who supposedly called into 911 and said that the shooter was probably military. The audio from different 911 calls also supposedly shows short bursts of gunfire.  I don't know what the answer is, but there are absolutely inconsistencies with this story, add to that the possibility of an accomplice and you've got a potential for conspiracy.   Does that mean it is?  No.  Maybe he's just on anti-depressants and is yet another example of how feeding people pharmaceuticals like they are frickin' candy leads to trouble.

       Someone please honestly connect this Lil Wayne music video to the shootings!!!!

       I don't like Lil Wayne, but he's made several songs where he takes a pretty hard stance against the elite ( See "Georgia Bush").

       Haha, yea right. He is owned by a corporation. He is a product. He is a mouth piece for the corporation. He doesn't write his own songs nor does he choose what imagery goes into his music videos.

       I'll let Grant Morrison answer this one: “The most pernicious image of all is the anarchist-hero figure. A creation of commodity culture, he allows us to buy into an inauthentic simulation of revolutionary praxis. The hero encourages passive spectating and revolt becomes another product to be consumed.” The Invisibles

       have you seen the video? I am skeptical too, but it's creepy as all fuck. Not only are there skeletons in a movie theater, there is sacrificial/occult symbolism all throughout, and there are even exploding gas canisters as Wayne walks through the dark night. Many people linked Lil Wayne to the evil PTB long ago, and this is by far their best argument (imo). Frankly, I am growing increasingly terrified of the blood-stained elite.. which is probably exactly what they want: to control people via fear and an illusion of all-reaching power. 2012 my friends, this shit aint a fairy tale.

       I'm kind of with you on this stuff.  Are they so cocky that they purposefully leave clues like this just to laugh at us?  Or do they leave "obvious" but practically worthless connections like this just to make conspiracy theorists seem extra crazy?  Or maybe it's just that not everything that makes the news is their doing.

       I imagine it could be any or a combination of three things:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         -mockery
        </p>

       <li>
        <p>
         -ritual (I'd imagine occultism takes symbolism/ritual very seriously)

       <li>

         -hide in plain sight

       it's really not that bizarre that the elite would communicate its vision through mainstream media. and shit, I thought Lil Wayne seemed inhuman and demonic long before all these conspiracy theories....

       You need to look more into Luciferianism. These aspects are a part of the religion. The more information they give to the public at large as they exploit them, the more power is given and consumed (they believe). Sounds crazy, but so are many positive religious people who think the opposite.

       The original "Scary Movie" had a scene where movie goers gang up on a person for talking to much, while "Shakespeare in love" was playing. Clues to this incident are everywhere man, Illuminati and bigfoot always create foreshadowing events to desensitize people to the atrocities they plan on committing.
      </p>
      <p>
       That scene was a spoof of "Scream 2" which was directed by Wes Craven, who has been sighted at Bilderberg group meetings

       Folks, you need to get serious about GOD.  This is not "illuminati vs the people".  This is the Devil, his demons and fallen angels, vs God, and you need to pick a side. Stop being a slave to the devil, and get righteous and right with Jesus QUICK because time is going to run out.

       WELL, I hope everyone takes my post seriously, and realizes that our fight is against SPIRITUAL evil, not HUMAN evil. yes humans are doing these things on earth, but they are being influenced and guided by the demonic.

       We're plenty evil all by ourselves w/o demonic overlords guiding it.  And if Jesus or God were involved then they too would be in control of the demons b/c they are omnipotent.  So your statement is a paradox in and of itself.  Lets stop praying for some Father in the sky to save us and lets start saving ourselves.

       I was totally on board until you brought religion into it.  There's not a shred of evidence that God has anything to do with anything on this planet.  His teachings, supposedly continuous, are fairly contradictory, and I find many of them detestable and immoral.  And they're supposed to have come from a "loving and forgiving" God.  Fuck that shit.  He's like the abusive father who says "its because I love you" but really he's just a fucked up abusive parent.  I don't want to live under his rules even if he is a real entity.

       I stand corrected. Still, an arraignment is fairly important given that a guilty/not guilty plea is made.

       I could be wrong but I think the arraignment is next Monday.

       It is if you're claim is that he's getting $10k extra which he can afford to just blow on fancy armor and stuff... Though I don't currently know any grad students, the few I have known had to be on a fairly tight budget and my peers as undergrads at a nearby University certainly don't get anywhere close to an extra $10k over the summer.

       Just cause i don't agree doesn't mean i don't respect your answer.

       I'd agree with 2 out of 3 of these. He doesn't make selling crack cool, i think he tells his tales of it in an artful way, but the history of media is full of examples of interesting or stylized things that normal people wouldn't dream of doing. For example, it's cool how they rob banks in Point Break and Inside Man, but i wouldn't do it. People would sell drugs and rob banks with or without hip hop, and plenty did before the genre came around inthe late 70's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the number of ppl who sold crack because Jayz told them to is around the same number that killed their wife or mother because Eminem told them to.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the list of those pushing the religion of money and materialism goes way beyond Jay Z. Very few in media aren't guilty of pushing those things, and most do it a lot more subtly than Jay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where's the line though? Bragging and boasting is a common thing in hip hop, as is bragging about money and material things. What separates the diamond his fans throw up from the the Nike swoosh or any other Brand? It's branding, not illuminati.

       Time stamp? Look up the publishing date. What is wrong with you people? It's simple fucking deduction. It's Occam's Razor . This asshole was posting disinfo. Even if it was a conspiracy theory sub as opposed to a conspiracy sub, it wouldn't excuse lies. At that "theory" would denote a scientific process. Guessing and blatantly making up shit to whip hysteria is not science no matter how much it would make you feel better.

       exactly my point. saying that the drill's similarities to the actual events can be dismissed because the drill happened during the same day, but hours after the shootings, is disingenuous at best.
