<p>The Denver Rescue Mission provided a turkey dinner for approximately 350 people. Officials are reporting widespread food poisoning after some people became violently ill.

<p>and other strange things, 3 days before the shooting, Lil Wayne releases a music video for his song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_yVRZMFbLc">My Homies Still</a> which shows a theater with skeletons in it along with lyrics and symbolism that points to the shooting.</p>

<p>Also Dark Knight comics from 1986 had people shooting up a theater and also the trailer for Gangster Squad came on before the film started and it showed people shooting up a theater.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too. I was attacked violently yesterday for pointing out the facts and saying its 100% false flag operation, when I had all the facts researched and came to the conclusion it can only be staged as all the facts pointed to it and a bunch of idiots and/or pentagon propagandists attacked me as delusional and paranoid. Just like they attacked people who instantly after 9/11 knew it was a false and went public flag, they attacked them to try and discredit them and cause in-fighting between the conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>One actually had a 6 day old account that got over 70+ up-votes, even though my article was popular and obviously the majority of people had done the research themselves and agreed it was a false flag operation. Another other one was a British citizen with history of depression because of physical appearance and knee jerk reactions to pretty much everything, just obvious uninformed European liberal type. </p>

<p>Here is my post. I explained in it what will be gained by this shooting and how it shifts the focus from other things that are happening and how all facts pointed to it being staged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CNN was just discussing some strangeness when interviewing the school official that&#39;s responsible for the school Holmes went to. </p>

<p>Him dropping out of his school is important. It&#39;s highly unprecedented and the school didn&#39;t perform the interviews that it normally does when a student drops out. in his cat he didn&#39;t drop out, he quit, which makes it even more suspicious. The school official that the media interviewed got &quot;highly defensive&quot; (that&#39;s CNN&#39;s quote, not mine) when asked about why he wasn&#39;t processed upon quitting the program as an A student and even more defensive when asked about giving that information to the victims.</p>

<p>That&#39;s strange to me and should be looked at more closely. WHO is this official, and does he have an ties to &quot;powers that be&quot; who could benefit from a cover-up?</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to guess that a &quot;crisis in a theatre&quot; simulation is a pretty common theme in emergency worker trainings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i tend to agree, if the person is so psychotic they cant function off medication then clearly they arent culpalble for their actions. This guy seemed to be functioning well enough to stockpile weapons and ammo in the weeks before the incident so seems lie he knew what he was doing so if he has now been medicated (i read he refused medication and isnt cooperating with the police) to be kept compliant something is very amiss. I tend to side with others that say his behaviour is probably down to sleep deprivation and/or a psychotic break then some sort of zombie pill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even read me comment?</p>

<p>Nobody was able to identify who the shooter was, besides the police.  The theater was full of chemical agent, the shooter had complete facial and body concealment, it was in a DARKENED MOVIE THEATER and the movie goers were fleeing in in a state of pandemonium.  Imagine the effect on their vision from the muzzle blasts, as well.</p>

<p>There are NO witnesses who were able to identify the shooter; only the individual who opened the door.  Assuming Holmes is the shooter at this point in time is a leap of judgement, perhaps greater than mine, as I am not accusing any specific individual of a crime.</p>

<p>I am stating known facts:  Holmes opened the exit door and exited the theater, afterwards an individual entered said door and initiated the attack.</p>

<p>You are proposing conjecture:  Holmes opened the door and exited the theater (this part is accurate, according to witness statements), he then went to his vehicle and changed into full riot gear (this part is conjecture), before reentering the theater and initiating the attack (this is also conjecture).  </p>

I guess since all you have to do is wear a mask, you can say someone stole your car, planted your fingerprints on everything, and say you didn&#39;t know you could walk out of the movie theater emergency exit to take a call, then you could get away with everything. Someone could put a mask on and shoot up your house and if you lived and I was arrested with the guns in my hand outside your house, I could walk because YOU didn&#39;t see my face during the incident.

The government would then make a crazy lone gunman cover-story. The government may also leave odd bits and ends for conspiracy theorists to build theories on, filling the Internet with wild theories.  This would completely drown, with media complicity, any message that may link the attack to a foreign entity.  </p>

<p>Question: How does an unemployed medical student afford $20,000 in weapons gear?</p>

<p>If you start to look at the really big picture here, the obvious question arises: How does an unemployed medical student afford all the complex weapons gear, bomb-making gear, &quot;flammable&quot; booby trap devices, ammunition, multiple magazines, bullet-proof vest, groin protection, ballistic helmet, SWAT uniform and all the rest of it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe he was a phd student at the medical school but regardless, the federal government guarantees money for tuition and room/board up to a universities cost of attendance. This COA number is inflated a bit so students have wiggle room and the schools, and many banks, offer loans on top the COA. I think COA ranges from 60-75k per year at most programs. So, in short, likely the Feds supplied all that cash. Not knowingly but I find some dark humor in that.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m not sure what the phd structure is like but for health students (dentists, docs, etc,) that is how the layout works. My non health phd friends get 30k or so from the school and free tuition if I recall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read what I said. How could he have shot 70 people and only killed 12 of them? He isn&#39;t a trained soldier (which would make it only slightly more plausible) so he&#39;s not some wicked sharpshooter. People were running and moving anyways, it was pure chance only 12 of the people that got shot died. Everyone that got hit and lived is lucky they aren&#39;t amongst the dead because it could easily have gone another way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anybody believes in the Illuminati, new world order or anything close or similar to that there has been many examples how they have a hand in everything including the music industry and media. Lil wayne, jay z, and kanye west have all had weird music videos seeming to have multiple and odd secret messages or references. Now my personal opinion is I have no idea what to believe. However, if you look into some simple symbolism and or signs of old societies and underlining groups throughout history they are all embedded in main stream media. Could it all just be one huge coincidence of course but it does raise questions. Also the two victims in military intelligence raises a huge red flag for me, having a father whom is in terrorist intelligence I know he knows a lot of stuff... A LOT!. therefore acquiring information from previous history if someone knows something of great importance that they shouldn&#39;t more or likely they will be taken out. A group or single person could do this and has been done in history. But I don&#39;t believe this to be the case because the shooter of the theater had a semi-automatic rifle which jammed during the shooting, any trained personal could easily fix a jam with in a couple seconds and return to firing. Sorry for rambling just providing some info to maybe raise more questions and theories. Playing the devils advocate if you will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just cause i don&#39;t agree doesn&#39;t mean i don&#39;t respect your answer.</p>

<p>I&#39;d agree with 2 out of 3 of these. He doesn&#39;t make selling crack cool, i think he tells his tales of it in an artful way, but the history of media is full of examples of interesting or stylized things that normal people wouldn&#39;t dream of doing. For example, it&#39;s cool how they rob banks in Point Break and Inside Man, but i wouldn&#39;t do it. People would sell drugs and rob banks with or without hip hop, and plenty did before the genre came around inthe late 70&#39;s. </p>

<p>I think the number of ppl who sold crack because Jayz told them to is around the same number that killed their wife or mother because Eminem told them to.</p>

<p>And the list of those pushing the religion of money and materialism goes way beyond Jay Z. Very few in media aren&#39;t guilty of pushing those things, and most do it a lot more subtly than Jay. </p>

<p>Where&#39;s the line though? Bragging and boasting is a common thing in hip hop, as is bragging about money and material things. What separates the diamond his fans throw up from the the Nike swoosh or any other Brand? It&#39;s branding, not illuminati. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re getting close buddy.</p>

<p>Read the Bible. Start with Psalm 2:2:</p>

<p>The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed (Jesus Christ), saying,
Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.</p>

<p>They worship Lucifer. The devil. Yes, he&#39;s real. Yes, God is real. Yes, the devil reall HAS tricked the entire world.  I won&#39;t get too deep into this because it&#39;s so deep it&#39;s scary, but start looking for the signs and you WILL see them.</p>

<p>The humans that you see are merely puppets to the devil and his fallen angels. Everything in this world is related to God.  The &quot;illuminati/new world order&quot; conspiracy is just the physical manifestation of a supernatural war going on in the heavens.  They are bringing this all about so the anti-christ can rule over the world instead of Christ in his 1000 year range.</p>

<p>The devil has the ENTIRE world tricked.  Even conspiracy theorists that start cluing into this stuff are deceived, because they think it&#39;s &quot;The bankers&quot; or &quot;the Jews&quot;.  Well, it is the jews, but not the REAL jews, it&#39;s THESE jews:</p>

<p>Revelation 2:9
I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and <strong>I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</strong></p>

<p>Nothing &quot;we the people&quot; can do can stop any of this. Christ and God are going to, you just need to make sure you&#39;re on the winning team when judgement day comes.</p>

But to me that seems unrelated, if only because you can&#39;t predict how many would have died. Many more could have succombed to blood loss, or died from shock, some of those who were killed just might have survived their wounds if circumstances had been just a bit different. To me there&#39;s no way anyone could &quot;predict&quot; 12 deaths in such a scenario, even if well planned out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he was sent to kill certain people in that theater by a government or shadow government organiztion. He was sent to also kill others to make it look insane and random. The movie connection, the explosive rigs, dropping out of the grad program, dying his hair red, getting denied to the gun club because of weird messages, all carefully staged to make him look unhinged so later the blame could be placed on him. Think Manchurian Candidate theory. He was recruited for this through his connection to the government. Weren&#39;t there military related people in that theater who died? Anyone been looking into that? Plus that reporter who nearly died in that shooting in Canada. I don&#39;t think he could really afford all that stuff himself and I think someone was helping him get it, and I think someone is telling him exactly what to do now. They wanted the people connected to the military and the reporter DEAD, for whatever reason, probably because they knew too much or were getting in the way somehow.</p>

<p>As for the Illuminati and the lil Wayne video that shit is creepy. Don&#39;t really know what to make of it besides maybe it was meant as a coded warning or message to someone involved in the shooting. Maybe it was a message to Holmes to go through with it, the details of the visuals in the video a code of instructions. But then the whole Illuminati thing...I always feel like people against or interested in the Illuminati tend to be deeply religious, or at least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been seeing a lot of, and they loose me in the dogma. The government needing to kill certain people for whatever reason sounds more plausible and less complicated to me, and if anything I think this video may have been a part of it as a coded message to Holmes.</p>

<p>I have another theory, or agree with one, that perhaps Holmes isn&#39;t the shooter, but a patsy, and someone else did the actual shooting to ensure the targets were killed. One opposing point to that theory that comes to mind is perhaps limited visibility from the dark and from the smoke bombs. But maybe nightvision was used. Now I&#39;m just reachin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard in several places that Holmes was on Vicodin and admitted it to police.  The <a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/31290793/detail.html">source</a> is the ABC news affiliate in Denver.  They do not name their source and the statement is kind of glossed over.  It could be true, although without identifying the source it&#39;s just hearsay.  Unfortunately, with the records sealed we will most likely never find out about his drug panel.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/life_of_depraved_sex_VX83ThuIVAk8Fl62xYJyMI/1">The NY Post</a> has an alleged witness to Holmes&#39; pot smoking.  The witness is Lance Bradshaw, 25 and he says, &quot;I’d see him smoking weed behind the apartment.&quot;  At least the person is identified and it seems legit.  It would be interesting to get more details though.  The link is to page 2, which is where the reference is, but if you want to read the whole article you&#39;ll have to go to page 1. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/sneed/13953335-452/aurora-gunman-james-eagan-holmes-was-found-with-vicodin-when-arrested.html">The Chicago Suntimes</a> claims only that Homes&#39; was &quot;found in possession of Vicodin.&quot;  This article is weird, it&#39;s basically 3 factoids about the case and then it goes into some other crap below without much segue.  However, one of the factoids unrelated to the drug claim was interesting, &quot;Fact: Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates, who is a friend of Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, previously worked in the intelligence division of the New York City Police Department.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of what I&#39;ve read is that he was on &quot;100 mg of Vicodin&quot;. </p>

<p>Standard dose is 5mg hydrocodone/500mg acetaminophen. So he&#39;d have to have taken 20 of them. </p>

<p>What gets me about his initital encounter with the cops is that he was forthcoming with info. He tells them he&#39;s on Vicodin? He tells them about the explosives in his apartment? Then, later, he is refusing to be cooperative? ABS News now reports him spitting at guards, and using the plastic bags placed over his hands to save the gun powder residue evidence as &quot;puppets.&quot; Story here: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/james-holmes-spitting-correction-officers-forcing-spit-guard/story?id=16844456">http://abcnews.go.com/US/james-holmes-spitting-correction-officers-forcing-spit-guard/story?id=16844456</a></p>

<p>Pot wouldn&#39;t suprise me. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very relevant unless he is truly mentally ill. Drug abuse could exacerbate his symptoms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the vicodin claim comes from the Denver channel 7 article and is not verifiable so I don&#39;t know.  I agree it&#39;s weird that he just hung out and waited for the cops to show up and essentially confessed.  Then in jail the cops have to wear spit guards because he is constantly spitting at them and other people and shit, something is fishy here.  I don&#39;t know what it is but it&#39;s not sitting right.   What the police/ FBI are claiming is just not adding up and now the case is sealed sooooo... I guess all we have is suspicions and gossip to go off of.  </p>

Now I know that those five words are troubling you because I am corse so let me try something different with you...get comfy...are you hungry? Want a warmer blanket? Okay. The OP...remember him? He is a bwaddy who makwes up widdle wies. Is that easier for you to understand?</p>

<p>So wait, who&#39;s stupid again??? You ramble on for a paragraph talking in baby language when you bring nothing to the table and can&#39;t even properly name simple concepts. You are purely insinuating that you know things and others do not, when you obviously know nothing more than how to insult others as a defence mechanism for your ego.</p>

I was insulting to people because I felt like it. I also understand how that makes me appear to be an asshole or what have you and that is also correct, but since I&#39;m not worried about making friends it amounts to little.
The context of what I was saying is true regardless of behavior. The OP was making shit up and people were accepting it as truth. I can&#39;t understand how that is acceptable. 
Who cares about my bedside manner? Why be so preoccupied with opinions? There was a fact and that was ignored.

If you&#39;re referencing when the issues were published, I dont need a link for that. I own them and can read them perfectly fine. 
Im sorry that the details about the OP making shit up without verification is cumbersome to you, but some of those &quot;details&quot; that you seem to disdain sometimes help people solving crimes. Good thing you&#39;re not worried about confusing thing like details or the truth. Making shit up and blaming some unseen force works much better.</p>

<p>I know the date the book was published. </p>

<p>You claimed you owned the issue of the Batman comic in question, as opposed to clicking on the link I reposted and feigning intellectual superiority.</p>

<p>I called you on your claim, as little lies like that tend to expose liars for what they are, more often than big ones.  Rather than comply, you chose to act ignorant.</p>

<p>I now am no longer interested in a timestamp, nor continuing this pathetic, one sided debate.  Consider it a favor, as the more you post, the more irrational and fallacious your responses become.  Clinging to minute, meaningless issues as you are, is a hallmark of an argument from a position of bad faith.</p>

<p>I have no interest in debating someone that has made themselves known to be a liar, especially involving a detail so insignificant.</p>

So in 1984 Frank Miller plotted out a theater shooting scene with the CIA? Will you now edit your post and include the fact that the comic scene in question was written in 1984?

But, you&#39;d drawn out everything else they were supposed to think. Why stop now? The unfortunate part is that with people like you just wildly making up connections it makes other&#39;s who might take time and pride in their research look like fucking idiots. You&#39;re irresponsible.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re forgetting he injured a lot more than just 12 people, this was one of the largest if not the largest mass shooting in the US in quite awhile.  </p>

<p>There was a military person in the theater who supposedly called into 911 and said that the shooter was probably military. The audio from different 911 calls also supposedly shows short bursts of gunfire.  I don&#39;t know what the answer is, but there are absolutely inconsistencies with this story, add to that the possibility of an accomplice and you&#39;ve got a potential for conspiracy.   Does that mean it is?  No.  Maybe he&#39;s just on anti-depressants and is yet another example of how feeding people pharmaceuticals like they are frickin&#39; candy leads to trouble.  </p>

Not only are there skeletons in a movie theater, there is sacrificial/occult symbolism all throughout, and there are even exploding gas canisters as Wayne walks through the dark night. Many people linked Lil Wayne to the evil PTB long ago, and this is by far their best argument (imo). Frankly, I am growing increasingly terrified of the blood-stained elite.. which is probably exactly what they want: to control people via fear and an illusion of all-reaching power. 2012 my friends, this shit aint a fairy tale. </p>

The more information they give to the public at large as they exploit them, the more power is given and consumed (they believe). Sounds crazy, but so are many positive religious people who think the opposite.</p>

<p>Oh.... hmmm  seems you made that connection.</p>

<p>WELL, I hope everyone takes my post seriously, and realizes that our fight is against SPIRITUAL evil, not HUMAN evil. yes humans are doing these things on earth, but they are being influenced and guided by the demonic.</p>

<p>Ephesians 6:12 - For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</p>

<p>I&#39;d agree with 2 out of 3 of these. He doesn&#39;t make selling crack cool, i think he tells his tales of it in an artful way, but the history of media is full of examples of interesting or stylized things that normal people wouldn&#39;t dream of doing. For example, it&#39;s cool how they rob banks in Point Break and Inside Man, but i wouldn&#39;t do it. People would sell drugs and rob banks with or without hip hop, and plenty did before the genre came around inthe late 70&#39;s. </p>

<p>I think the number of ppl who sold crack because Jayz told them to is around the same number that killed their wife or mother because Eminem told them to.</p>

<p>And the list of those pushing the religion of money and materialism goes way beyond Jay Z. Very few in media aren&#39;t guilty of pushing those things, and most do it a lot more subtly than Jay. </p>

<p>Where&#39;s the line though? Bragging and boasting is a common thing in hip hop, as is bragging about money and material things. What separates the diamond his fans throw up from the the Nike swoosh or any other Brand? It&#39;s branding, not illuminati. </p>
