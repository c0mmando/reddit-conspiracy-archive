       so two people from a nearby air force base go to see the dark knight, and you think there's something up? did you think this through at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       how many people do you think are involved with those programs on that base? more importantly, do you know what else is on that base?

       it's probably just a coincidence.  it's nearly impossible to get a good shot at a certain person by random.  anyone who has shot a gun knows this.  it's not like hollywood. compound that by the fact he wore a gas mask (limited sight) and a dark theater.

         It's way easier for "the government" or whoever you are accusing, to kill 2 military people on their base or in some other less public and media-frenzied event. The public is now all riled up and emotionally charged looking for investigations and holding the event under a microscope. The 2 guys could have easily been quietly taken out during an on-base "accident" or some "drunk driving" incident.

       When you are standing in front of a theater with the screen behind you, everybody in the theater is actually lit up pretty well.  You're also assuming the guy didn't have any sort of night vision stuff, which they could be keeping secret (after all, case has been sealed).

       Do you know for a fact the servicemen were in a different theater?

       I also forgot to mention that he instantly threw smoke grenades once he re-entered the theater. How would he see through the smoke? Let's say he was able to see the first guy and take him out. How would he be able to find the second guy after everyone starts running and diving on the floor? This is still under your assumption that the 2 guys were in the same theater as the shooter.

       sorry but had to jump in here and support you, brjohnson789 is just absolutely out of touch on this one, or has lost it, but his arguments are weaker than wet toilet paper.  This guy deserves no more attention and this thread deserves to be shot down, these arguments are weak at best and distracting.

       Jeez I forgot he had already been in the theater.  So you're going to claim that after sitting in the theater for 1/2 hour or whatever it was, plus the pre-views, he would not have the time or ability to pick out specific people to shoot?  Just because the movie is called the Dark Knight Rises or whatever doesn't mean the theater is pitch black the entire time.

       Even people who've just played Hitman know that this is the most convoluted, failure-prone assassination plan ever devised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait and hope victims go to see movie... yet brainwash/recruit killer months ahead of time and engage in months of planning to attack theater. Somehow monitor multiple targets to be sure they're coming to the theater that night. Enter movie theater then come back in armed to the teeth like a marine instead of a ninja. Toss tear gas and attempt to kill targets in a smoke filled, dark theater with people inbetween you and your targets screaming, running and otherwise blocking your targets.Kill lots of people in the most spectacular way possible to draw international attention. Lastly, have the assassin wait around and surrender to authorities because that always helps cover things up. Oh and the high publicity will likely land your assassin in solitary and ensure a huge police presence during transfers, preventing any chance at a Jack Ruby-style mop up operation (which is for killing patsies, not actual assassins, anyway).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds like a flawless assassination plan to me.....

       Yes, I did think this through.  1/6 of those killed were in military intelligence, and 1/4 were in the military.  I can guarantee 1/6 of the people in the audience were not in military intelligence; 1/6 people living in that area are not in military intelligence.  That plus the other strange

       i'll explain it. so many people are employed doing the thing you find so suspicious that at any given time, any public event in that town is going to have military personnel who work in an intelligence related field. there are major military intelligence units stationed there. like i said about the alaskan fishermen, if you went to rural missouri and walked into a movie theater, you'd find a higher than normal percentage of farmers. if you walked into a movie theater in miami, you'd find a higher than normal percentage of cubans. if you went into a movie theater in washington dc, you'd find a higher than normal percentage of government workers.

       Oooh I love the insult game!
      </p>
      <p>
       Poulation of Aurora Co: 332,354
      </p>
      <p>
       Active and reserve population of Buckley air force base: 2,854
      </p>
      <p>
       I will be generous and I will halve the Aurora pop since not all people could get in to the movie. And I will double the army population. So in a random population you have a  3.4% chance of picking a military person. Its been a while since I have done stats but I believe with this population then there is only a 15.57% chance of 2 of 12 random people being military. This is because you would multiply that 3.4% times 12 to get the first person, a 41% chance then 1/12 random picks would be military. But you have to do it again since there were 2, and you only get 11 chances now (37.8%), and you have to multiply both odds against eachother since they both have to happen. 41.2% x 37.8% = 15.6% chance of this happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is with being generous with the populations (and just assuming Aurora isn't surrounded by other towns). Any problems with my math there genius?

       I'm sorry but "military intelligence" is a very, very broad scope. Most people have this term confused as it being personnel with high security clearance and a nose into government secrets. The truth is that they deal with the preparation and planning of future military operations based on given facts or assumptions made by the government. There is nothing special about a reservist and someone who had only been a service member for a year. This is creative but a far stretch.

       Well I guess some of us aren't so discerning when it comes to what's special.  When you frame it as just a reservist and a 1 year vet by itself, that does not sound special.  But when you include other facts like they both had jobs involving 'cyber' something then that should set off at least an alarm somewhere.  That plus the drill and the case is now sealed, if that doesn't trigger at least one alarm somewhere then there's no hope.  I'm not saying there is definitely something going on, but these are some coincidences and they start to add up.

       Well I know that the military is very deceptive in job titles. For instance, I am an Avionic Electrical Systems Maintainer. What does that entail? I solder wires together. That is it. There are plenty of job titles like "crypto-cyber analytical specialist." Trust me, the guys that actually are working behind the scenes, have no rank, job description or affiliation with the Department of Defense.

       Even if these guys aren't real big 'assets' or whatever working behind the scenes, things are so compartmentalized in the army and especially intelligence that they may not have not known they were working on something sensitive.  Or they may have seen something the shouldn't have, even though they had no idea what it meant.

       But why take them out in such a manner as this?  If that was the case, you would think it would be at a level with way less media attention.  It doesn't make sense to me, but then again, a lot of what the military does doesn't make sense to me.

       All you are doing is saying things are "weird."  Weird how?  What does it mean?  Go ahead, you're the conspiracy theorist, give us some ideas on why the military/government would be involved?  It's obviously not because two guys from a local military base wanted to see a super popular movie.

       I'm gonna go ahead and assume masterdebater88's a shill. Watch the video of him in the courtroom, the guy's obviously been drugged. Odd that there was a drill for this like with the london subway bombings.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why would the government be involved with someone losing their shit and randomly killing people with "legally bought" guns? Couldn't POSSIBLY have anything to do with the upcoming UN resolutions aimed at disarming the populace. Noooooooooo. Thinking such things makes you a conspiracy nut drawing lines between two OBVIOUSLY unrelated points.

       Lol, thanks!  I feel so special.  All this time I've thought I was a fairly well-informed graduate student in history, but I'm really an online counter-intelligence shill.  You really are an ignorant fuck if you just assume anyone who disagrees with you is being paid to do so.  I'm actually fairly open to some conspiracy theories - JFK and 9/11 being my two favorites.

       One's? Are you suggesting I am being personally targeted? Are you fucking looney toons or something? Professional trolls. What is it... The Jewish anti-defamation league? Wish I still had the URL. Where they flame, shoot down, flood, and so on anything against Israel or a pro-Israeli viewpoint. It openly exists. Not saying they have anything to do with me, it's just an example. For the sake of argument, we'll say I'm Jewish. Cointelpro, as well. Why are you so bent on making things seem so far fetched? What purpose are you trying to accomplish? What's your point? Anything to do with the shooting? Remember? That's what this thread is talking about. Not you jackasses running around personally attacking people.

       I'll suggest you're lacking reading comprehension today. :-) Hit the "context" button before replying next time. I wrote that MuttHisFace believes that people are being paid to disagree with him and this means he needs to feel important by believing he knows truth that no one else does and that people care enough about his knowledge to make a career out of discrediting him. You replied that that was "a bit of a reach... even for a petty insult". I then wrote "As opposed to believing someone earns a salary to discredit one's ... posts...." In context, I'm obviously referring to MuttHisFace and find it amusing that you consider my comment a stretch but nothing he wrote as a stretch. Somehow you think I'm talking about you instead - most likely because you replied 16 hours later without checking the context first. So no, I'm not looney toons.
      </p>
      <p>
       However.... you then go on to suggest that you
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       being personally hounded and there's a Jewish conspiracy at work and I'm a professional troll, so... sadly that sounds a lot like MuttHisFace. :-(

       You're going to tell me with a straight face that it's
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       far fetched for someone to plot an assassination by mind-controlling someone, planning for months to target a theater that you have no idea the victims will go to or not (especially at the same time), proceed to fill the theater with smoke and fire into the darkness with lots of people running between you and your targets, make the covert assassination so high-profile that it gets international coverage, then have the assassin wait around and surrender (not a good idea when trying to pull off a conspiracy)? That's
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       far-fetched in your mind? You're suggesting that's at
       <em>
        least
       </em>
       as likely as a guy goes nuts and two people who happen to work at a military base practically next to the theater who have no known connection otherwise or any indication they'd be the target of anyone just happen to be two of the victims?

       You have no idea what reading comprehension is, apparently. I asked you if you were suggesting I was being personally attacked, said I was not being hounded by Jews and then you... Took that in the exact opposite way. You're not looney toons, you're just illiterate. Assassination? Fuck that noise. Shooting up a theater days before the UN small arms treaty is reason enough to pull this shit off to have "legitimate" "reason" to confiscate weapons so that government has a monopoly of power. Now are you really going to tell me that government wanting full and total power is far fetched?

       But you're to the point where you're having to rely on twisting things literally backwards because you're devoid of any logical or valid argument and I'm not wasting anymore time on you. Take the last word. I know you need it.

       There are no doubts about it guy, there are 100% government employees on the internet trying to mold people's opinions.

       But your link, doesn't really prove that. So please stop posting JUST that link, calling people shills and saying they have no argument.

       What you don't really get is that these "rules" could also be applied to conspiracy theorists as well; I don't get why you would trust this.

       Seriously. Read masterdebater88's comment history. The epitome of a shill.

      <p>
       I never mentioned anyone's arguments. I'm not calling everyone a shill. Read my comment history, I rarely call people out. Almost entirely limited to this thread because homeboy is doing such a shitty job. But hey, if I come across it again, I'll getcha the link for the, for lack of actual title, "Confessions of a Shill." where they break down their job as a hired shill. Not a government employee, just a guy doing a job. Breaks down how they were trained, what they did, how they did it.

I did look through their submission history (not comments) and noticed a LOT of posting to /opiates, /twoxchromosomes, /drugs, and a few others that leads me to believe that whomever this is really isn't a shill.. not that I'm an expert on the issue, but still...

       I actually just wanted more fleshing out of these ideas.  I'm a very open-minded individual, although I'm apparently also just a shill for disinformation.  The only real motivation y'all are discussing seems to be about the UN small-arms treaty, which I don't know much about.

       Yeah, it's a giant coincidence that two servicemembers, stationed at an air force base a few miles away, would take time on a Friday night to see the premier of a new Batman movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       The training exercise - didn't know about that.  Can't speak to it, but I wonder if they have them weekly, monthly, or bi weekly - I guess the frequency of training exercises and their scenarios should be known to make a sound conclusion with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the sealing of the case is probably a good idea to give the guy a fair trial.  Maybe he was mind controlled.  Maybe he is crazy.  But the more the public, his potential peer jury, knows about what's happening, the less they can make an impartial judgment on the case.  Unless I'm missing what the sealing of the case actually entails..
      </p>
      <p>
       If something like this goes to a 'commission' then shit's getting super weird.  But after or during the trial the details will come out I'm sure.

       12 people dead is surely sad.  In the scheme of things, as that natural news article presents, our servicemen and defense contractors do analogues to these kinds of things fairly regularly and come back as heros.

       Thank god you arent jumping to conclusions and following the mindless heard on this one.  Also liked how you elegantly pointed out all the actual factual evidence ie there is literally an AFB right beside the Movie Theater, 2 miles to be exact, god forbid any active duty military personnel would want to go catch a flick on a friday night, let alone the most anticipated movie opening of the summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Training Exercises being conducted, i am in no position to go over the daily working of the nearby base and how many drills, exercises or preparedness situations they run on an a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis but im guessing there are quit a few, and probably enough to keep of military personnel prepared and ready "for any" situation they come across.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many people are jumping on this Mind Controlled Conspiracy bandwagon without even debating or going over how things could be not a conspiracy on this one or just possibly, wait for it.... people are crazy.  I pointed out about 20 some odd cases in the last 10 years of random shooters going nuts and killing 5-20 people on shooting rampages, a lot looked at that and realized oh, maybe there are just fucked up people in this world, which was good to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, finally, saw a funny quote on the front linked to a facebook post from someones dad, it said something to the effect of "back in our day we used to do drugs and kill our selves".  A lot has changed since then, and a lot of these shootings now a days are people realizing they can get their 15 minutes of fame, and still end their life (either by jail or by firing squad) .  Sad, sick and twisted.  Still think this is no conspiracy and tired of reading all about it all over r/conspiracy.  These kids nowadays are so fucked up and out of touch with the real world its just hopeless for some of these kids.

       if you're trying to argue a point, it would help if you don't put words in other people's mouths.  I never claimed its a giant coincidence; I do think it is a coincidence though.  That plus the other facts coming out about the guy and situation make me wonder if all there is to the story is just some guy going crazy.

       Wait, I'm a shill because something that brjohnson said contradicted himself and doesn't make sense?  umm, ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading through your comment history it seems like you dedicate a large portion of your time to accusing people of being shills, On just the first page of your comment history the word shill shows up 9 times.  You seem to be more pre-occupied with accusing people of being shills than you are with countering the content of their post.
      </p>
      <p>
       And not that karma means anything, but in 11 months you only have 30 comment karma?  Let me guess, all the shills are downvoting you, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe you're the shill.  Maybe you're the one who's interested in disinformation.  What you do is called argumentum ad hominem and it's not a valid technique for countering view points you don't agree with.  So you're the shill, shill.

       The first page is from today, on this thread. Anyone who's been on reddit for any amount of time would know that. Especially since I've said a bunch of stuff on this one thread and, oh god! Today's conversation took up the whole page! That means EVERYTHING! And apparently reddit has a comment cap? Damn.... 3 or 4 conversations at once will do ya in.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not concerned with karma as it's fucking pointless, and I rarely post links. Mostly just discussions but if you read past today's thread list... you'd know that.
      </p>

       Why am I interested in disinformation? Why would I care about the world around me? Only a conspiracy whack job or shill would care, obviously, of course!

       I find your comment history very interesting.  You go weeks and months at a time without commenting, and sometimes when you comment it's about absolutely mundane topics of no significance, almost like your trying to build legitimacy into your account, then you burn what little karma you have by jumping into these kind of conspiracy threads where you start bashing users and calling names (while providing no actual content yourself), then you go dormant for large spans of time again.  And you have followed this pattern since you created this account 11 months ago.

       I find this account highly suspect.

       I'm sorry I don't use reddit the same way you do. i mostly read and keep my mouth shut. You'd be shocked at all comments I almost make. Mostly due to everyone jumping down everyone's throat on these boards. Did you see the comment thread (of mine) arguing some meaningless photography thing that devolved into the other guy not shutting up until I praised him as the biggest asshole on the thread and gave him the last word? Discouraged me from making comments. If people, especially when they're wrong, devolve in that way.... I'd rather just read and discuss with people in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Karma is pointless. I love meeting redditors who used to care about karma and responding to everyone obsessively and then took a step back and realized they were basically wasting their life with this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for providing content... sheeeeeit. Most of the content I find is FROM REDDIT and I don't care to repost things over and over. When I do post, as you've obviously seen, it's usually in the form of a question or prose that's on my mind and I get a wild hair up my ass to see if anyone else has had similar thoughts. Doesn't happen often.
      </p>
      <p>
       And last but not least, I'm not concerned with commenting often to keep up appearances. I already declared karma pointless. It's like getting awards in Farmville or on XBOX. It's fucking meaningless yet you've seen people get all up in arms over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you find it suspect of... what... being a bore?

       Your account is just old enough to appear legitimate and you make benign comments just enough to gain a positive karma rating thus removing your negative karma posting limitations, then you burn that karma in threads like this, then you go dormant, then you repeat the cycle.  Without a doubt, what you have accused me of is precisely what you are, a shill, and for some reason you thought you could get away with it in

       What the hell are you talking about? Negative karma limitations? Karma actually DOES something? I've never had my karma go up or down before these 5 points I have that I don't even know where they came from. And i still don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all your talk about accounts appearing to be legit... you're sounding like you're just misdirecting. So apparently... I wasn't that far off. "Point a finger at me?! Aha! I point one back at you like you have to prove yourself before I prove myself! Mwuahaha!" Idiot.

       I'll say it again: as Patrick Harpur notes, paranoia is a form of narcissism because the person decides they're important enough for the universe to take notice of them. Do you really feel this stupid thread on a website filled with LOLCats and philosophical dinosaurs is important enough that a cabal of illegal, murderous agents have assigned multiple people to constantly patrol it and post negative comments about incredibly nefarious plans hatched in above-Top Secret secrecy but deciphered and revealed by an occasional 20-something stoner on Reddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Man, I used to be obsessed with certain conspiracy theories but I never accused anyone of being "a shill". Maybe that's why I was able to cure myself and stop being an incredibly obnoxious person to those who had to deal with me (when you start to keep six pages of typed notes next to your phone so that you can pounce on anyone who makes a comment that goes against your conspiracy-du-jour and begin debating with them, you start to realize you have a problem).
      </p>
      <p>
       Repeat this little mantra, Mutt, as often as you can - it may not save your life, but it'll help make a lot of other people's less miserable. It will make you a lot less miserable as well. Here we go:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Is this the
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       likely explanation - or the
       <em>
        least
       </em>
       likely explanation?" Once you focus on that you begin realize where the burden of proof may lie (no matter how much Alex Jones, Jeff Rense,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       or AboveTopSecret.com feel otherwise). And from that point on will begin your road to recovery, and you'll eventually stop feeling that you, and you alone, have unlocked the secrets that the "sheeple" have failed to see and stop using conspiracy theories to feel empowered or in control of an often chaotic and nonsensical world. Then from a position of rationality, you'll be able to do a "post mortem" and explore this nugget: why did I
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to believe this or that conspiracy theory? With birtherism the answer is sadly obvious, but it can take some time with others to see what about you liked the idea of theory X enough to accept it without good reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what insults you hurl at me in response, I honestly wrote this at 1AM (and revealing more about myself than I wanted to here) with the idea of helping you if you really believe that people are being paid to disagree with you. I hope it does help you be able to start putting things in perspective. Oh and if you call me a shill, I'll tell you about the time 20+ years ago I played a small part in unraveling a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       conspiracy with CIA spies, shredded documents, and standing in the rain to hand-deliver a manilla envelope with stolen documents to a radical reporter on a day that Jimmy Carter was in the same spot and the area was crawling with Secret Service agents and police. :-) Shill? They've probably got a file on me....

       The only "conspiracy" I believe in is that there are people with this mindset:
Gaining, Maintaining and Expanding power, wealth and influence and is the best, most worthy and possibly sexiest thing you can do with your time on Earth. Look at... "the Church", as a good example of people going all out for what I just said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones is controlled opposition, spreading the news that those who make the news want him to, just like Fox/CNN/Etc. There was an interview with the guy he basically replaced, can't remember his name (i've never even thought of keeping pages of witty responses) where Alex got called out for flatly making shit up. Icke is retarded/into theosophy. I've seen Rense but I never go there. Abovetopsecret is entertaining, at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I claim to have an understanding of that most people give me weird looks for is a sense of reincarnation. But it's not over a span of multiple people, just recollection of attempting this life over and over and over again. And this Infinity theory I have where any and everything is not only possible but happens somewhere in the... everything/time/where. Maybe not this world this time but in a concurrent universe with a different set of circumstances, absolutely. Are we in that world? Usually not but it's comforting to know it exists. I think it's just a perverted m-theory with multiverse/worlds conglomeration mixed with quantum/metaphysics mixed with philosophical/religious studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is something the most logical explanation? Can a jet bring down a building by hitting it at the top? Could there be sick fucks who get off to getting what they want no matter the cost to other people? Do these questions all have the same answer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies I could reasonably see happening:
Onassis and Johnson worked for the same people, WWI wasn't really started by Panslavic bullshit, The Reichstag was a false-flag pretext for WWII funded on both sides by the same banking cartels, 9/11 was just another pretext, Paul is dead, MK Ultra was or still is a research project that may or may not have succeeded, Mystery Schools still exist, and groups of people with similar goals (and lack of scruples) who have plans for this world and how they want to inhabit it and what the rules should be exist as well. And they won't let me in on their plans, though this could be said for any business, large or small. It's not my business, it's their business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now saddle up your high horse and ride off into the sunset. This is all a circle jerk because if any of it is real, I can't do shit about it anyway. Ever hear of Finger of God technology? Y'know, chemical lasers on a satellite? I got nothin'.

I've been a Zinn fan for years, I'm a firm believer in the JFK conspiracy, and I'm very doubtful about the 9/11 story.

       What makes you think I own a tinfoil hat? You are the self described conspiracy theorist with your "doubts." So what college do you go to then, where your professors care more about giving you the truth and a real education instead of giving you the same bullshit wash handed to everyone else as "history" just to put food on their table? This has to be an amazing school to do more than simply tow the status quo.

       Is the base nearby? That's not weird at all. I live near Camp Pendleton and if there were a shooting in a movie theater here I'd be shocked if a large number of the victims weren't marines.

       From another reply:
      </p>
      <p>
       Poulation of Aurora Co: 332,354
      </p>
      <p>
       Active and reserve population of Buckley air force base: 2,854
      </p>
      <p>
       I will be generous and I will halve the Aurora pop since not all people could get in to the movie. And I will double the army population. So in a random population you have a 3.4% chance of picking a military person. Its been a while since I have done stats but I believe with this population then there is only a 15.57% chance of 2 of 12 random people being military. This is because you would multiply that 3.4% times 12 to get the first person, a 41% chance then 1/12 random picks would be military. But you have to do it again since there were 2, and you only get 11 chances now (37.8%), and you have to multiply both odds against eachother since they both have to happen. 41.2% x 37.8% = 15.6% chance of this happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is with being generous with the populations (and just assuming Aurora isn't surrounded by other towns).

      <p>
       Well I guess some of us aren't so discerning when it comes to what's special.  When you frame it as just a reservist and a 1 year vet by itself, that does not sound special.  But when you include other facts like they both had jobs involving 'cyber' something then that should set off at least an alarm somewhere.  That plus the drill and the case is now sealed, if that doesn't trigger at least one alarm somewhere then there's no hope.  I'm not saying there is definitely something going on, but these are some coincidences and they start to add up.

       if you're trying to argue a point, it would help if you don't put words in other people's mouths.  I never claimed its a giant coincidence; I do think it is a coincidence though.  That plus the other facts coming out about the guy and situation make me wonder if all there is to the story is just some guy going crazy.

       Thank god you arent jumping to conclusions and following the mindless heard on this one.  Also liked how you elegantly pointed out all the actual factual evidence ie there is literally an AFB right beside the Movie Theater, 2 miles to be exact, god forbid any active duty military personnel would want to go catch a flick on a friday night, let alone the most anticipated movie opening of the summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Training Exercises being conducted, i am in no position to go over the daily working of the nearby base and how many drills, exercises or preparedness situations they run on an a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis but im guessing there are quit a few, and probably enough to keep of military personnel prepared and ready "for any" situation they come across.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many people are jumping on this Mind Controlled Conspiracy bandwagon without even debating or going over how things could be not a conspiracy on this one or just possibly, wait for it.... people are crazy.  I pointed out about 20 some odd cases in the last 10 years of random shooters going nuts and killing 5-20 people on shooting rampages, a lot looked at that and realized oh, maybe there are just fucked up people in this world, which was good to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, finally, saw a funny quote on the front linked to a facebook post from someones dad, it said something to the effect of "back in our day we used to do drugs and kill our selves".  A lot has changed since then, and a lot of these shootings now a days are people realizing they can get their 15 minutes of fame, and still end their life (either by jail or by firing squad) .  Sad, sick and twisted.  Still think this is no conspiracy and tired of reading all about it all over r/conspiracy.  These kids nowadays are so fucked up and out of touch with the real world its just hopeless for some of these kids.

       I never mentioned anyone's arguments. I'm not calling everyone a shill. Read my comment history, I rarely call people out. Almost entirely limited to this thread because homeboy is doing such a shitty job. But hey, if I come across it again, I'll getcha the link for the, for lack of actual title, "Confessions of a Shill." where they break down their job as a hired shill. Not a government employee, just a guy doing a job. Breaks down how they were trained, what they did, how they did it.

       I find your comment history very interesting.  You go weeks and months at a time without commenting, and sometimes when you comment it's about absolutely mundane topics of no significance, almost like your trying to build legitimacy into your account, then you burn what little karma you have by jumping into these kind of conspiracy threads where you start bashing users and calling names (while providing no actual content yourself), then you go dormant for large spans of time again.  And you have followed this pattern since you created this account 11 months ago.
      </p>

       I find this account highly suspect.

       Fuck you.  I've been brainwashed once in my life and I make up my own mind about shit now.  I've been a Zinn fan for years, I'm a firm believer in the JFK conspiracy, and I'm very doubtful about the 9/11 story.  You have absolutely no idea about what courses I take, what I study, or who my professors are.  Go put on a tin-foil hat and make some more generalizations.
