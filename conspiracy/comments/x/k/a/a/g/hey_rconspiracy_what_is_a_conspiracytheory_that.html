       Our ancestors caused the death and destruction of hundreds of unique cultures and directly &amp; indirectly killed ~100 million people. We forced the relocation of the Cherokee, we made treaties about land ownership with people who couldn't even comprehend owning land and then violated the treaties, we intentionally and unintentionally spread diseases, we sent generations of their children to boarding schools even in the 1900's to destroy their culture, we took land from them by declaring they were "incompetent," we sterilized hundreds of Native American women as late as the 1970's (Family Planning Act), and we destroyed the first North American Democracy (Iroquois).

       Isn't all of this taught as part of the standard public education?  What kind of history textbook omits the smallpox pandemic and the Trail of Tears?  Buying Long Island for a sack of beads, and bribing/threatening tribal leaders to help fuck over their own people?  Look into the early history of the ConocoPhillips corporation for some especially fucked up shit.

       1:  Manhattan was purchased for well of 3,000 pounds sterling in guns and supplies.  Please don't perpetuate myths of the ignorant native.

       2:  Tribes were always at war.  To some tribes the white man was just adding an extra advantage. Read into how cortes captured Mexico with just 3,000 men.  Most of his help came from local natives.

       You realize that is complete BS right?  Native American tribes fully understood the concept of ownership. What they didn't get was concept of owning land after you die, as in having land in an "estate".  And by "not get it" I mean they just thought it was stupid.

       Edit: I wasn't perpetuating natives were backwards by any means. You're drawing inaccurate assumptions based on what I said. They philosophically had a different view of land ownership that was more based on "land use" than land ownership. Because of this, the idea of owning land wasn't even a possible idea according to their world view. You can't really own something that isn't yours; how could you own "mother Earth?" The concept of land ownership to them would be similar to air ownership to us. It has nothing to do with incompetence or incapability, it is about world-view. It's kind of like how a Westerner can't comprehend caste systems/social hierarchies in Hinduism or karma &amp; rebirth in Buddhism. For instance, many Great Lakes Region Indians believed that humans were created to harmoniously co-exist with spirits/animals in this world which provided the resources to us. The earth was just as much ours as it was the animals. Humans could take resources from the earth (animals/plants) as long as all of the plant/animal matters were used wastelessly. However, it was necessary to show gratitude to the spirits of these lifeforms after taking their life. If you could "own land," you would in turn "own" the land that these other lifeforms have equal claims to, and that's not possible.

       This is still true. There are many jobs I want to apply for that require a 4 year degree just to apply for them. It doesn't mean you'll be better than someone without a degree, but companies want the shiny paper as much now as they ever have.

       I think we landed on the moon, multiple times as we are told, however, we were not told the whole story as to why we went and some footage was indeed faked. IMO at least.

       I don't have any links off the top of my head, or time to compile some sources for you (if there are any, it's useually a very two sided issue: either they went, or it was faked), but there were a total of 6 landings on the moon and 12 people who did various things while there over the course of 41 months. I am sure that the amount of resources spent on something of this magnitude was not just to show off and one-up the Russians. I think they staged some of the footage because they were busy looking for/doing something that we have never been privy too. That's pretty much all I got, but then again, if I had a smoking gun it wouldn't be much of a conspiracy theory eh?

       sounds good :). If you find anything link it here please. I'd be interested to see what others might think along these lines. I mean, I've heard the rumours of a base on the dark side of the moon and others who say the moon is artificial, but nothing conclusive that's for sure.

       It's quite an intriguing theory, and Stanley Kubrick was quite the clever sonofabitch.

       I totally believe the Eyes Wide Shut conspiracy angle, btw.  Everyone says the movie is about sex, guilt, love--not to me.  That film had a strong, consistent subtheme of
       <em>
        class,

       with a heavy pointed finger to the Illuminati and their ritual sex whatever the fuck magik satanic evil thing they got goin' on there (re: Sandusky FBI?!)

       I still remember the first time I saw Eyes Wide Shut. I was kind of just getting into conspiracy stuff and had always been a fan of Kubrick, but never got around to see it and really had no clue what it was about.

       Blew my fucking mind. It's by far the creepiest movie I've ever seen. And anyone who thinks it's not about the Illuminati is daft. Great film.

       Why can't it be both?  If I were running the operation, I definitely would have a contingency plan (film the landing for a backup).  The entire operation was a PR stunt so it would make sense to invest in the
       <em>
        actual public relations perspective
       </em>
       considering it would only be a fraction of the real cost.  Maybe what we saw was a mix of filmed + real?

       If only he put that amount of time and effort into debunking the officially endorsed 9/11 conspiracy theory.

       The world would end, because he'd have a "debunking" list longer than any of the others on that page - if you know anything about that day beyond what you've read on FoxNews or CNN, then you know that's true.

      </p>
      <p>
       So you are saying none of the conspiracy theorist put enough time into debunking the endorsed 9/11 theory? Because afaik the world is not endning. Well, thats not the skeptics fault, thats your fault my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I have read and watched many many hours of conspiracy theories when I believed it. Then I watched and read hours and hours of skeptics proving those theories wrong. With science and evidence.

       "he" is in relation to "the james randi website" and "his" group.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what you're thinking. As far as you go, you're a joke to me, because you won't even use the term "conspiracy theory" accurately in a sentence - instead opting to 'believe in' the popular culture version of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       "the endorsed 9/11 theory" IS A CONSPIRACY THEORY. THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT JESUS CHRIST, ALLAH, KRISHNA, OR WHOEVER - it's a small group of wealthy, dominant men who are representing even more wealthy, dominant men who are a smaller club because they do not need to stand for elections(
       <em>
        as they fund the campaigns of and as such Select those who will be Elected
       </em>
       ) - when they officially endorse a conspiracy theory,
       <em>
        it's still a conspiracy theory
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of like the official explanation regarding the Gulf of Tonkin incident ..it was a conspiracy theory - officially endorsed for decades - given to the masses via the mainstream media and higher levels of government - which ended up being used to kill hundreds of thousands of people, and tens of thousands of Americans in Vietnam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what - turned out it
       <em>
        never even happened
       </em>
       . That's an "officially endorsed" conspiracy theory that everyone "believed in" that turned out to be completely false and silly, and it was entirely proven wrong later.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, you know, like every other generation - everyone seems to think that theirs is different, their government is different than every other government in human history, people today are different than people of every other time in history as far as conspiring together for mutual gain in circumstances which must be concealed from the public - that that could never happen today(kind of like THAT generation believed about their world and THEIR government) - and it's the most absurd, childish thing I've ever seen in my life.

       We already have "shown you something" - things that are admitted and not disputable, instead you choose to ignore those things

        which paint a large picture
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        provide context for

       <em>
        frame issues that follow in the same light, in the same society, using the same mechanisms, to the same result within the same society
       </em>
       - and focus in on this little pixel of it going "well if, you can't prove a particular 9/11 conspiracy theory then maybe I would
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       " ..you're small-minded, I'm not. That's why I'm talking about "this and that", and you're refusing to touch it and instead type a meaningless nothing of a post as though you've somehow taken the wind out of my sails(lol).

       You are accusing someone(who?) of murdering 3000+ people. Cops, firemen, women, children, people working at pentagon. The people on the planes, the people in the towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is pretty reasonable to demand proof of this very serious accusation. Just because someone did something earlier, doesn't really have anything to do with 9/11.

      <p>
       Conspiracies happen, no doubt, but I do not believe this is one of them. Unless you can prove it. Show me the solid evidence of whatever you believed happened on 9/11. Shit, I don't know what you think happened. For all I know you could believe a cruise-missile hit the Pentagon..

       No, I'm not accusing anyone, that's what you're not getting. If someone gives you a theory which asserts and claims to explain a conspiracy, and the proof provided is insufficient, flawed, or obviously does not explain the event, then that is all that is necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's what you yourself are doing with every other conspiracy theory you come across - just not the government's - because somehow, those people and those institutions(which I have shown you with "this and that"[as in, provable, factual historical events and non-events which led to major societal changes, corporate profits, and tens or hundreds of thousands of deaths] are entirely untrustworthy - and who have shown THEMSELVES to be entirely untrustworthy, like Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Bush Jr, and the rest of those titled corporate mafiosos) have the godlike power to get you to just look the other way on something that had a major effect on a major society.
      </p>
      <p>
       3,000 people dead, murdered - cops, firemen, women, child,  3 large buildings, 2 airplanes, and people working at the pentagon. Luckily, all the department heads were on the precise opposite side of the building, and the single section that was hit had recently finished renovations making it the ONLY side of the pentagon built to withstand blasts, contain missile explosions structurally, etc. - all that was taken out was the side of the building where records were kept - a single day after the Secretary of Defense went on the mainstream news and announced that there were trillions missing ..unaccounted for.. from the pentagon's budget - Rumsfeld admitted to $2.3 trillion missing on September 10, 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to be missing a pretty big point. Someone who doesn't believe what the government tells them about 9/11 doesn't need to suppose, present, and prove any alternative theory, detailing the who/where/when/how/why - all that is necessary is knowing that the officially offered conspiracy theory stands just as shakily as the rest of them, and cannot stand up to rigorous investigation even by laymen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy theory presented by the government as fact simply does not match or explain the evidence and actual facts of that day - if you have looked into conspiracy theories as much as you claim you have, then you know this is true regardless of whether or not you've found any others you "believe in". I can't make it any bolder, plainer, or larger.

       Bullshit. You are accusing someone of lying in the NIST report, of warning the 'department heads', and the 'corporate mafiosos' of making people look the other way. You are accusing them of murder and you need to prove it. The burden of proof is on you.

      <p>
       No, you misunderstand(as you seem to constantly do), in a very schizophrenic, confused, angry way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't accuse anyone. I made a statement of fact - that the highest brass in the building, at the pentagon, their offices were on the opposite side of the building, furthest from where the explosions and impact happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't say "george bush conducted 9/11 from his ranch in texas" - if I had, the burden of proof would be on me. You're an idiot, in that you don't seem to understand that once a theory is disproved(OR WHEN IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL HOLES IN IT, AS THE OFFICIAL STORY DOES - if you don't know this, then you have not looked into it at all anywhere but the Popular Mechanics website), then that is all that is necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need to give you the name of the particular contributor of the NIST report who "lied", I don't need to give you a time, date, list of conspirators, and room # of where it was planned out in - that's completely irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof rests with the people supposing the theory - that is the government - their theory has substantial holes in it, and if you do not know this, then you have not looked at the subject matter honestly or thoroughly - to the point where if it were presented in court by anyone else as a defense or alternative explanation for a crime they were accused of being complicit in(you know,
       <em>
        anyone or any institution/corporation who didn't have a monopoly on the use of force and violence
       </em>
       ) they would be convicted ten times over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof was on them, they didn't prove their case. I don't need to provide an explanation of what happened. You're the one being ridiculous, because this is exactly what you do with every other conspiracy theory - just not the one given to you by the government.

       No, no - I'm not refusing to show you the holes - I'm saying that if you don't already know and agree there are giant holes, then you have not even taken the initiative to study the subject on your own, and as such, you're like a helpless child who happens to be in an adult's body - and you aren't someone I want to sit around and teach.

       So the jews did it eh?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Figuring out exactly how 9/11 was done is the work of crime investigators or conspiracy hobbyists who will endlessly go on discussing and debating every minuscule and intricate detail of the event to no avail. It doesn't take a structural engineer to tell you that two 110 story buildings and a 47 story steel skyscraper plummeting to the ground at nearly free-fall speed requires the assistance of explosives. All you need is two eyes that can see and a brain that thinks to come to that sound conclusion. This is why it is of my opinion that more emphasis should be placed on the "who" instead of the "how". It should be obvious to anyone that discovering who did 9/11 is infinitely more important than discovering how they did it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Second sentence of your link is complete bullshit. 'Lets not spend time actually proving any conspiracy, lets start hurling accusations at the jews, yay!'
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'almost free fall' thing is one of the easiest things to disprove. The debree fell much faster than the tower itself, watch any video.

       Did you just tell me I have a skewed/zionist vision of reality? Okay bro. Your first link is so full of anti semitic crap and blatant lies. And I have a skewed vision of reality?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1979, twenty-one years before September 11, 2001, Isser Harel predicted with uncanny accuracy the events of 9-11 to Michael D. Evans, an American supporter of Zionist extremists of the Jabotinsky sort.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So 9/11 was actually planned before 1979.. Right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, I looked into those reports. Pretty interesting. But they don't actually prove anything.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         There was no witness statement that claimed the 5 men started taking pictures and/or filming before the attack happened. All witnesses only noticed the men after the plane had struck the first tower. 1 witness claimed he saw the van in the parking lot at 8.00 am. (p.34)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The 5 men did appear to be happy and smiling on the pictures they took within minutes after the plane hit the first tower. No video camera or video was found. (p.35)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They could be working for Israeli intelligence and using Urban Moving  systems as a cover. No proof though.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       All in all this doesn't prove anything. Even if they are Mossad/Israeli intelligence, the reports do not prove they had any foreknowledge. 
As far as I know this is what the men said on the talkshow, where you claim they said they were 'anticipating an attack':
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The fact of the matter is we are coming from a country that experiences terror daily. Our purpose was to document the event."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You can't tell anything about foreknowledge from that sentence. They documented the event like everyone else with a camera did on that day.

       I hate to break it to you, but last time I checked his offspring biggest acomplishments were
       <a href="http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=80591">

       </a>
       . It was also remarkable that one of the most prominent figures there (not Mark) spent time in a mental asylum and used to stalk people. But maybe that was before your time. You started with sarcasm by pointing out there could be some unbiased facts in that forum so please do not expect a serious conversation. ;)

       There is an Illuminati conspiracy against religion. And against you, and me, and everyone who is not one of them. People use all kinds of methods to control others on large scales and small, including religion. Plenty of people like to get their own way, right? Well, those folks are masters at getting their own way - and they also prefer that you do not believe they even exist.

       I once believe that 19 men armed with boxcutters directed by a man on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world using a satellite phone and a laptop directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily-defended airspace in the world, overpowering the passengers and the military combat-trained pilots on 4 commercial aircraft before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by a single fighter interceptor.

       You say that but then you're expecting us to believe that you, by pressing down plastic squares with letters on them thousands of miles away from myself, make these letters to be some how transmitted using weak lightning running down cables and other crazy stuff and reassemble themselves in a readable form in front of my eyes here.

       What you and I have just used is called an "argument from incredulity". They are both invalid.

       Why would it be impossible for it to do so?  For your scenario to work, you must show that under no circumstances could it have happened within the context of the official events.   All I need to show that it is plausible is to show that any debris from the aircraft was recovered from ground zero intact.

       A plane crashed into. a. fucking. building. And made it collapse because of the "intense heat" and raging fires.

       You expect me to believe that a passport made out of fucking PAPER survived that, and then someone happened to pick it up for fucking jollies?

       <p>
        In your world, when a plane crashed into a building causing collapse, absolutely everything in the building is incinerated... Things do survive in fires; paper and other material is blown out of buildings.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Have you happened to have actually watched the videos of the planes entering the buildings on the morning of 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       They disintegrate in seconds. No other wreckage like the passports survived. Not even the BLACK BOXES were found(which is nearly unheard of in modern flight history), but somehow, 2 little paper/plastic passports belonging to two middle eastern males happened to glide down unharmed, perfectly in tact providing evidence to an otherwise almost unsupportable story.. while the rest of ..everything.. was engulfed in IMMEDIATE explosions and jet fuel fires that you believe burned so hot that they caused something else which is likewise unheard of in the history of modern skyscrapers ..total structural failure of not 2, but 3 buildings - not 2, but 3 FOOTPRINT COLLAPSES due to fire ..when there were only 2 planes.. 3 buildings fell straight down into their own footprint(unheard of, can't happen the way we're told it did, sorry, seriously - use your fucking brain, physics was not suspended that morning, so the only other option is that the officially sponsored conspiracy theory is full of holes and mistruths to explain the biggest catalyzing event in modern history since Pearl Harbor).
      </p>
      <p>
       In your world, you live in a fantasy. A very nice fantasy, where you think you're very informed, probably love John Stewart and Steven Colbert(okay I love him too), think you'd surely know it if something so bad had happened - and certainly, someone in congress would come out and tell you(
       <em>
        forgetting for your lifetime the fact that more than half of the officials appointed by the government to sit on the 9/11 Commission called it a coverup, as you probably have not read the books published by ANY OF THEM
       </em>
       some using those words verbatim - WHO THE FUCK ELSE WOULD YOU BE LOOKING FOR TO TELL YOU THAT IF NOT THE 9/11 COMMISSIONERS THEMSELVES?).. and if they don't, well then, everyone who doesn't have faith in YOUR shaky, sketchy conspiracy theory(the Bush administration's explanation for the events on 9/11) is just as crazy as those dictator-loving outrageous conspiracy theorists who tried to tell you that weapons of mass destruction in Iraq were propaganda and lies before we invaded and sent hundreds of thousands of kids(our kids ..straight out of the high school libraries and lunch rooms where there were military recruiters) into a wholly unnecessary meatgrinder out in the desert somewhere to kill and die, with an idiot like Bush hanging "Mission Accomplished" banners 2 years into a decade long war. We're just as bad as they who tried to warn you back then, when every major media network was broadcasting the "WMD" story(while everyone in the intelligence community knew that the term "terrorist" was just an excuse for imperialism, but went along with it because hey, somebody's got to do it - somebody has got to be the world superpower, and if not us, then who?), when every high member of government was telling you to believe a lie, which someone, somewhere along the lines, had to know was a lie(do you REALLY think that the leaders of the most advanced, dominant, and aggressive nation on planet Earth are so ill-informed?).
      </p>
      <p>
       You are extremely confused about the world, but you think that you're not. You believe absurdities, but think them very realistic and proper - you find the most unrealistic things to be appropriate explanations for events that change entire societies, because, well, seeing it any other way means re-evaluating your entire worldview, and that means losing whatever mental security you have left in the integrity of your leaders and your ruling class(and there most certainly IS a 'ruling class', and Obama is not part of it, he's just an employee).
      </p>
      <p>
       You're wrong, and you're the one living in a fantasy world built on outrageous conspiracy theories, lies, obviously debunkable agenda-ridden propaganda, and the
       <em>
        desire to believe and keep on believing
       </em>
       . You just don't recognize it, because your conspiracy theories are the ones given to you on FoxNews or CNN, or by some member of the regime ruling the US(I don't mean Bush or Obama, I mean the big boys behind them - you know, the ones with all the money - the 1% who control 98% of the country's wealth - and have for decades and decades ..yeah, bud, they wouldn't do anything to perpetually maintain power, and they would never conspire to kill or harm anyone to remain or further their current positions).
      </p>
      <p>
       Please grow up and face the world you're actually living in, because it's not the one you see on TV.

       I don't think people understand the question. Most of you are providing examples where you once believed the "official story" but later believed the "conspiracy story".
      </p>
      <p>
       Have any of you believed in a conspiracy theory and later backed off from said theory.

       Hmm... I see your point. I may have misinterpreted. Although, I'll explain how I read the OPs post.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        how many of us have been certain of something, maybe we told our friends, and then embarrassingly found out we couldn't be further from the actual truth?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because the OP said, "maybe we told our friends, and then embarrassingly ...", I interpreted that as the sharing of something other than an "official explanation"; thus why someone would be embarrassed after sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be embarrassed sharing information that was being widely disseminated but I would/could be embarrassed sharing what many would consider " a crazy, tin-foil hat claim" and later not believing it myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that provided a little clarity.

       I once believed that the most elite members of the Republican party get together and scheme to try and get us a smaller government, lower taxes, less regulation and more individual freedom.
      </p>

       I was about 12-18 years old when I believed this crazy stuff. Once I started really studying the daddy bush administration I realized how naive I had been.

       My god, a answer! I think you might be one of 2. I'm a very light conspiracy theorist compared to this place. I'm not even sure it was allowed to happen, I think incompetence is more likely then malice. Of course they squeezed the event for all it's worth after the fact. Which is were I think the conspiring comes into play. It's a shame I find it so difficult to find conspiracy talk that doesn't cross the line into ludicrous. In fact it would be a clever way to spread seeds of doubt that some plausible conspiracy's probably didn't happen. Now that's a conspiracy I can get behind. But once again, more likely that people want to see what they want to see.

       You see, discussing these kind of conspiracies that would make this place respectable. Not whether James Holmes was brainwashed by the CIA with scopolamine patches in order to ban guns in America.

       I'm with you there. No use in arguing about the hypothetical details when the
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       that a real unfettered investigation has yet to be done remains.

       I get that, but I can't let go of building 7. The only way 7 could have been accepted would be for 1 &amp; 2 to collapse. If it wasn't controlled in some way I feel like that would have been difficult to predict in a uncontrolled demo. I personally don't preach 9/11, but I do think there is enough evidence to support a real investigation with no one off limits.

       I agree on Building 7, it really looks like a controlled demo and it wasn't hit by a plane.  Towers 1 &amp; 2 resemble a top-down demolition, but they were hit by giant fuckin planes... so I'm willing to accept that
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       that's just what happens when a building gets hit really hard by something really big like that.  We don't really have many other examples to look at for comparison.  But #7, a building on fire that just pancakes into its own footprint without being struck... yeah.  I've heard that the base of the building was kinda uneven due to some subway or some shit that runs under it... but I'd think that it would fall to that side if that played a part.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a new investigation would be great... but it's one of those things that no matter the outcome, it still wouldn't be settled.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it came to a similar conclusion as the 9/11 report, it would be labeled a whitewash.  If it came closer to the truther claims, a big segment of the population would still stand by the initial report, I think.

       That is the beautiful thing about actual conspiracy theories. There is no possible way to prove them right or wrong. They are vague enough to sound good with speculative evidence and hearsay with just enough fact to make it scary. Conspiracies are a matter of faith and personal opinion. That is why I love hearing them so much. It is interesting to me how people, depending on their personal bent on society see the world and the incidents that take place in it. But above all and most importantly they are a way for people to try to figure out truth in a way that makes sense to them. That is the way I see it anyway.

       That the US is run either by Democrats out to get rid of the Republicans, or Republicans out to get rid of Democrats. Turns out most of them - both parties - have been bought, so while I was arguing against the bad guys on the other side of the political spectrum I was just wasting time.

       One thing though that still strikes me as funny is that you can get people from the far left to do for free what those on the right must be highly paid to do.

       I remember being heartbroken when Dean Kamen's flying scooter, turned out to be the silly Segway. :-( I think I need to go make a complaint bear quickmeme.

       For a while (about six months) after reading 'Chariots of the Gods' I believed in what is now called the "Ancient aliens" idea.

      <p>
       In my defence, I was about eight years old, so it seemed plausible that someone who published a book wouldn't be allowed to do so if it was actually just a load of nonsense they'd concocted.

       thank you. the quotes sounded so genuine I didn't really think twice about it. I'm very new to the "truth movement" and the whole "awake" concept... one thing that I realized very quickly is that many people exploit conspiracy theories for money and website hits. It really does the search for truth a grave disservice.

        TL;DR thanks for the advice. I will try to verify that my sources are legitimate.

       The US government-endorsed conspiracy theory regarding 9/11. Makes no sense(unless you people seriously believe the bullshit that 'oh the
       <em>
        free world
       </em>
       and most advanced, dominant, aggressive, wealthy nation on planet Earth is just run'd by a bunch of poor nincompoops! dey just don't know wat they're doing! they r just poor politicians and dey just can't do anyting right! aw dey just can't get along! looks like we're just in a back and forth game between 2 parties that is unending and has gone on forever, hehehe' ..you're living in a dream world, a fantasy that you have not thought through using the most important sense of all - reason), too much contradicting evidence, explains nothing, benefits all the right agendas - but hey, we all know the people who have been at the higher levels of the US government and major corporations would never do anything to hurt American citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fucking derp.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real answer to your question is "not a single one", because "conspiracy theories" are not a matter of belief, if that's what they are for you, if you've "believed in" a conspiracy theory, or somehow trusted in one that required your faith to "believe", then you're doing it wrong - the worldview that dictates "
       <em>
        believing
       </em>
       conspiracy theories is silly there are none" is a matter of belief, and it's almost so insolently childish as to be ridiculous ..if only it weren't so widely held.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no need to buy into any theory, the only need is to recognize that the officially presented theories make no sense in light of this thing called "evidence", like the JFK assassination, and that taking them on faith, taking them on patriotism, or "well they wouldn't lie to me and surely if it wasn't true then someone would tell me"(someone has told you, they're called 'conspiracy
       <em>
        theorist
       </em>
       ') is the most ridiculous thing you could possibly do. The only thing that is required to be a wackjob "conspiracy theorist" is to believe in a conspiracy theory that doesn't match the actual available evidence ..so basically anyone who believed or broadcasted that Iraq had WMDS, anyone who believes the official theory regarding 9/11, anyone who believed the official story behind the Gulf of Tonkin incident which was used to involve America in the Vietnam War, anyone who believes the official theory regarding the JFK assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you STOP believing, that's when you realize "oh wait, I don't really need to pick and believe in or have faith in one particular theory, that's irrelevant, what is relevant is that the officially-endorsed conspiracy theory does not match the evidence available surrounding the event or the subject at hand" - that's what is important - because it means you're USING YOUR OWN MIND.

       Well said even though I can admit to needing some direction when it comes to some events. Sometimes I would have never known for possible conspiracy theories if it wasn't for others pointing them out. It is then I begin to filter. This section of your post resonated well with me...

       I'm with you there. No use in arguing about the hypothetical details when the
       <em>
        fact
