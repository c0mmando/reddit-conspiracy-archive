       It's scary if you think about it. Presumably, if there is a false flag attack during the closing ceremony, she already knows it's about to happen. No emotion, no remorse.

       Excellent point. These were also some of my concerns. This popped up on my wall on FB, I was wondering if you are thinking along the same lines of this symbolism, or is this over the top paranoia? As things continue to go downhill, I feel like it is becoming harder and harder to tell the difference between the two.

       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Flame#The_modern_era">
         Flame from the ancient games was reintroduced during the 1928 Games. An employee of the Electric Utility of Amsterdam lit the first Olympic flame in the Marathon Tower of the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam.[6] The modern convention of moving the Olympic Flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue began in 1936. Carl Diem devised the idea of the torch relay for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin that was organized by the Nazis under the guidance of Joseph Goebbels. Krupp armaments company produced the torches in wood and metal, inspired by an olive leaf. The Olympic Flame was lit by a concave mirror in Olympia, Greece and transported over 3,187 kilometres by 3,331 runners in twelve days and eleven nights from Greece to Berlin. Leni Riefenstahl later staged the torch relay for the 1938 film Olympia. The film was part of the Nazi propaganda machine’s attempt to add myth and mystique to Adolf Hitler’s regime. Hitler saw the link with the ancient Games as the perfect way to illustrate his belief that classical Greece was an Aryan forerunner of the modern German Reich.

       While the Opening Ceremony is being watched by the international community, we here in the US are treated to one of the most precipitous propaganda storms I've witnessed in over a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just tune into CNN and enjoy the circus.
      </p>
      <p>
       From The US' newest, largest conventional bomb "to be used in a war with Iran", to the potential for Iran to attack US warships (stock footage of torpedo boats included), Syrian conflict about to come to a head (talk of a "final clash" and state sponsored massacre being imminent), Israel this, Jewish voters that, Clifornia Nuke Plant "next Fukushima"), overacting Aurora shooting "witnesses", multiple humanitarian "crisis" in Africa and on and on.  They have a captive audience, waiting to catch a glimpse of the ceremonies between doses of propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something is about to happen and I don't think it has anything to do with the Olympics.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  The new 30,000lb "Massive Ordinance Penetrator" is specifically designed to destroy the type of bunkers housing Iran's nuclear program.  After this staged massacre in Syria and the ensuing intervention, the door is wide open.  Meanwhile, look what they've got you watching.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT2: It has begun.
       </strong>

       Their website and the past two hours of CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, it is just "murder porn and conditioning" with Anderson Cooper.  Give it a few hours, they always repeat the stories, multiple times through out the day.

       Curiously, the barrage ended immediately after the opening ceremonies finished.

       Free rich black people existed in the 1800s in the UK, granted they were very few and far between and the majority were poor but then that was the situation for all. Not unlike today.

       At the time of the roman invasion and afterwards, wealthy black people lived in Britain.

       <p>
        One of the richest inhabitants of fourth century Roman York, buried in a stone sarcophagus with luxury imports including jewellery made of elephant ivory, a mirror and a blue glass perfume jar, was a woman of black African ancestry, a re-examination of her skeleton has shown.

       For anyone interested.  There is a Toronto radio host that does a show every Olympics talking about all the Illuminati aspects of the opening ceremonies.   You can stream the show live.  I am pretty sure the stream works in other countries as well.  I will leave a link to the radio stations website.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a "Listen Live" icon you can click to get to the on air show.  Show starts at 8 PM Est time on Saturday nights (11PM during hockey season as it is the station that broadcasts Leaf games).   I haven't listened to his show in a while, but it is a pretty good listen if you are into that sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       His name by the way is Gary "The Spaceman" Bell (no relation to Art Bell) and the show is called " A view from space".
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.640toronto.com/">
        Here is the link to the site.

       I've got the whole thing recorded in HD on my PVR. I can't seem to find anything around the 40-50 minute mark on my Canadian feed.

       It is a little odd that the all-seeing eye is plastered all over these olympics, combined with a tribute to the sun disguised as a tribute to the victims of terrorist attacks. Also of note was that during the whole sun danve, they had a looped heartbeat in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit-
Around the 57 minute mark(roughly 54 minutes after the opening bell) there is a good distance shot of them. They reallllly do look like something resembling ancient Egypt. They've even got separate cap stones on the very top with a bright light inside.

       Hey, got an HD version from a torrent and I looked around and I saw only a few things;
1) There was a point where Voldemorts shrouded white head was directly infront of one of the lights, and it looked like a floating white blob which may be the eye you saw.
2) There are single yellow lights at the 'capstone', they don't look like eyes to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I missed it, but I'm sure i'll be watching this thing again so if I catch anything I'll throw it on here.

       Did nobody catch at the beginning, where they said the theme for Danny Boyle's presentation was the poem "Jerusalem"? The SAME poem that Rik Clay referenced in his research(before he was murdered)? I flipped shit when I heard that, and saw
       <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/rik_clay_2012.html#London_Olympics_2012_:_Zion_(The_New_Jerusalem)__">
        "England's green and pleasent land"

       For the lazy:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Are we to believe that the London 2012 Olympics are going to facilitate the implementation of Zion - the 'New Jerusalem'? To recite William Blake's poem 'Jerusalem':
      </p>
      <p>
       And did those feet in ancient time 
Walk upon England's mountains green? 
And was the holy Lamb of God 
On England's pleasant pastures seen?
      </p>
      <p>
       And did the Countenance Divine 
Shine forth upon our clouded hills? 
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among these dark Satanic mills?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bring me my bow of burning gold: 
Bring me my arrows of desire: 
Bring me my spear: O clouds unfold! 
Bring me my chariot of fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will not cease from mental fight, 
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand 
Till we have built Jerusalem 
In England's green and pleasant land.
      </p>
      <p>
       An 18th century writer, artist and esotericist, William Blake had connections with 
Freemasonry. Was this early work a declaration of the esoteric agenda, for all to see? After all he was 'involved'. "

       I definitely saw a video cut-away during the opening part that clearly depicted the olympic torch bowl in front of the flag of Greece making it look like it was on fire. And to mention the fact that they didn't show the 1972 Israeli deaths and instead showed British deaths? Yikes.

       I'm thinking it'll be at the closing ceremony. This was posted earlier here, I think he may be onto something.

       I can't see them passing up on that date though, which in some other threads have shown to be quite significant (Aug 12). The only reason I could see them not doing it at the closing ceremony is so they could infect the people with some kind of bioweapon and it would spread as they all flew home. However, the large army, Surface to Air missile launchers on apartment buildings,  and 11 mile 6 meter high electrified fence surrounding the stadium lead me to believe that not a whole lot of people are going to be  getting off that island after the closing ceremony...

       Less than 10 minutes in an Tom Brokaw has already gone into the security threat, speaking of the structure of the city as dangerous area. He also mentioned something about "intel being their best weapon". It seems like CBS wants its viewers to know about a threat from the get go.

       I watched it, but I focused on the fun and entertainment. I'm sure there must have been some symbolism in it, but I didn't see anything, thought didn't look for it either.

       It's an extremely
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Bet_You_Look_Good_on_the_Dancefloor">
        popular song
       </a>
       from a well-known (and very Britsh!) band, so not really that surprising. I'm guessing that 1984 was originally used in the song as it rhymes with dancefloor, and doesn't imply anything else.

       One of my all-time favorites. Written in the early 20th century, by Orwell. It was more or less his ideas of how the world would be in 1984. I wouldn't say he was too far off.

       I think there was some humility. The Industrial Revolution section was not, I think, supposed to be an entirely positive view. They tore up the beautiful landscape for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the NHS is genuinely one of the most brilliant things that the UK has ever done. It has had a rough time in recent history, especially from both internal and external politicians. I know a huge number of people were buoyed up by that section.

       stuff with occult symbolism is actually interesting to watch. this has virtually no symbolism (so far) and is boring. i can't believe that people paid to watch this. i'd want to be paid.

       Honestly... the ominous all-circling pyramidal background on the stadium and in most ads, the tweaking of English history as the dandies, the top-hat crowd manipulate the masses to create the wealth of the country, the terrorizing of children in a mimicry of mental programming?

       do you live in england? the children being terrified by their literature is an accepted part of growing up. yes, it's bad, but in this context there's nothing sinster. danny boyle clearly thought, whether right or wrong, it's a part of english youth.
      </p>
      <p>
       the pyramidal background is part of the stadium and was nothing new to the ceremony.
      </p>
      <p>
       people in top hats controlling the masses is, again, part of recent english history. celebrating it wasn't a good thing but there's not much to be celebrated in england apart from the NHS... which they did. a lot of people still think that the rich earned their money and boyle is probably one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       i like how people on this subreddit are supposed to be 'open to all ideas' but when someone suggests that something perhaps ISN'T a conspiracy, they get shot down. i'd love to believe that the ceremony was some sort of ritual but i really don't think it was.

       I don't live in England, and scary stories are a staple of 'kiddie bedtime tales' here also, but the way it was portrayed seemed off. Is
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of english children literature about nighttime terrors?

       That's why I'm here, to sample all kind of ideas and make up my mind based on their analysis. Of course one is always biased one way or another so the triangle that startles some may be just a cigar to someone else... As for the whole ceremony, I find enough details that if you follow this kind of occult lore
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       be significative. I'd like to believe the whole show was just a prank on the Tories and other parts of the Govt. by Mr. Boyle, what with the emphasis on the NHS, and you can see on the news several of those stiff gentleman decrying the ceremony as 'multicultural, leftist rubbish'.

       i am very familiar with hypnosis and this was a mass hypnosis. the script was perfectly executed on point. the new world order is in its final phase. all bases were covered. everyone will be going to sleep after a good 2 hour hypnosis. sleep on world. i haven't watched tv in months and this is just crazy. i think it is too late for people to wake up. something huge is going down.

       some of my notes...all objectively speaking of course. these are all very subtle hypnosis techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
       notes:
      </p>
      <p>
       turned on the tv after not watching tv for 6 months except for basketball in season..the media brainwashing is insane. it is very scary to see the tv programming after not seeing it for so long. it was a perfect hypnosis. i mean perfect. all the way from the start of the opening "motivational" and "inspiring" parts, the quick scene, next to next, going through the city on an airplane very quickly. inducing a trance like state. all the the quick, hard beating, loud drums, memorizing beat..then on to the slow, dreamy music, mentioning dreams. mentioning going to sleep. the plot of the ceremony...all the hardship feelings. the reporters and their comments most of all. all negativity and all about individualism, comparing and contrasting, putting down and putting up. prejudice left and right. next thing to the next.... they were talking perfectly to hypnotize the subject with what information the wanted to . this is crazy, it is so blatantly obvious. the commercials. war, military, feel good, be proud, improve yourself, work hard, community. wow.............mind is blown i didn't know it was this bad. mass media brainwashing/hypnotism..
      </p>
      <p>
       Commentator back tracked to mention the dreaming of the prior section to induce the dream/trance state. then the next section continues, the technology era with all the phones and social networking.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Just a forshadowing of things to come” –stated by the commentator
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a depressing tone to the whole ceremony with the commentary.
