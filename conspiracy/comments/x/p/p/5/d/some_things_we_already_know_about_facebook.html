<p>2) They refuse to remove stuff from their servers, even if you delete them from your profile, retaining everything forever.</p>

<p>3) They track everything you do while logged in, including your non-facebook surfing (if you don&#39;t delete your tracking cookies, they continue to track you even after you&#39;ve logged out).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i do not have a facebook. cancelled that shit. so i can&#39;t see content where you have to log onto facebook to view. </p>

<p>Overall, I would love to not have to log in to see content. THe problem is that we do not know what facebook is using this information for or why they are keeping such detailed records. The fear is that employers, government, insurance companies, and others who have power over us will use said information against us in one way or another. Congress has no idea how the internet works and continues to write horrible bills &quot;to protect the children.&quot; We have other places to post content where anyone can see it without having to log on. so why are we still using facebook links? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m old :-P I&#39;m 30. I haven&#39;t had cable since 2005; torrent all my shows so I don&#39;t see ads. I use to work in e-commerce and am pretty familiar with how a lot of the actual tracking stuff works too.</p>

<p>Adobe bought a company called Omniture and they used it in combination with this technology called Test and Target to track people across domains (which is why people without Ad Block or a privacy guard see so many targeted ads and the frequency increases as they visit the same products). The checkout cart page I worked on had 15 tracking pixels! Many ad companies track from click to purchase; so if you leave, but come back later and make a purchase, and have the same cookie, they charge the higher rate for that ad.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really sick how much effort is put into it.</p>

<p>Anyway, so much is being tracked these days. I&#39;m careful with passwords (different passwords for every site using an algorithm; no central storage) and other aspects of my digital security/identity. Working in information security helps in knowing what to do. But as far as everything else, privacy is a myth at this point.</p>

<p>It&#39;d be one thing if all of your browsing habits were just public. I&#39;d actually be more okay with that. But the fact that both private companies and the government horde this data mining for themselves is messed up, but somewhat unavoidable. </p>

<p>My thesis research was actually in CAPTCHA and I had a professor who asked me, during my defense, how there seems to be a constant struggle between spammers trying to defeat spam blocks and security companies preventing robots and spam. He asked where I thought the progression would go with this. </p>

<p>I suppose I should be more diligent in preventing tracking, but so long as I don&#39;t see ads trying to convince me to feel inadequate and buy shit, I&#39;ll settle for that. Anything truly private I do, I do over SSL/SSH. Tracking is a reality, yes a scary one, but really an inevitable one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m well aware of what reddit is doing (rotting from the inside out). But, it&#39;s not quite the same thing. reddit doesn&#39;t continue tracking you after you&#39;ve logged out. It doesn&#39;t have contracts to sell your private info to governments/corporations - in fact, the anonymous design of reddit makes that kind of impossible.... they&#39;d need to associate your reddit account with you in some way... like maybe, I dunno, your ...</p>

<p>If we are honest we are being tracked all over, whatever we do via Isp&#39;s right?  Unless we take extra measures to remain anonymous in which case there are probably extra resources available to interested parties see what you might be up to.</p>

<p>Perhaps he can be asked to resubmit to imgur. this has the  added benefit of interested parties being able to see how many people view the image too.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Interesting that you should suggest that. Ya see...</p>

<p>I brought this to the attention of the mods a week ago. The mods contacted him and asked him to stop linking to facebook (uploading to imgur being the obvious alternative). And, they added rule 7 to the sidebar.</p>

<p>They got no response and the facebook links keep coming.</p>

<p>So... if we&#39;re going to speculate with &quot;perhaps this&quot; and &quot;perhaps that&quot;... perhaps this is a bot on autopilot submitting crap from his facebook account automatically. Perhaps, instead of giving this honeypot the benefit of the doubt as being a &quot;fellow member&quot;, we should be looking a little deeper.</p>

<p>No. Because I&#39;m not tracking all of his internet activity and broadcasting that for all the world to see. Just this one particularly troublesome activity... and it wasn&#39;t from tracking him, it was from having repeatedly reported his shitty facebook links.</p>

<p>dickgirl porn? I didn&#39;t realize anyone was actually into that shit. I just assumed it was sprinkled throughout the net to see if there was any interest.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;re a sicko. Do you ever worry about getting busted for something trivial and having all of this come out in court? Or are super self-confident that your prurient interests will be popular in prison?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>tl;dr: Everyone who plays Skyrim is into dickgirl porn. I read it on reddit.</p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; can use your internet activity against you in trumped up court charges. Had a joint on you and got busted for pot? No biggie, right?

    <div class="md"><p>Right. I&#39;m the one who noticed that. Correct. Just like I&#39;m the one who noticed this.</p>

<p>Just FYI, I <strong>do</strong> take (some) precautions against being tracked, although my PC isn&#39;t very robust (it&#39;s ancient, in fact, in computer years). But, the things I can&#39;t install to protect me, I can emulate manually.</p>

<p>I want to ditch tracking cookies? Restart my browser (which clears EVERYTHING [except my bookmarks], and starts fresh.</p>

<p>I want to change IPs? Reboot my PC <strong>and</strong> my DSL modem (which abandons a current, unexpired lease, forcing my ISP to give me a new IP).</p>

<p>So, again, yes... I am the one who noticed the google-analytics thing. And, yes... I&#39;m the one who noticed the SOLIDSNAKE1000 honeypot.</p>
