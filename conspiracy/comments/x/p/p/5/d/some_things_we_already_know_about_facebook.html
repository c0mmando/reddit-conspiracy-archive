       I will let others provide links for these, but the articles about them have all come through this subreddit multiple times.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) They are one of the (if not THE) most invasive internet services on the planet (a close second, in my opinion, only to Google).
      </p>
      <p>
       2) They refuse to remove stuff from their servers, even if you delete them from your profile, retaining everything forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) They track everything you do while logged in, including your non-facebook surfing (if you don't delete your tracking cookies, they continue to track you even after you've logged out).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, now I want you to look at

       i do not have a facebook. cancelled that shit. so i can't see content where you have to log onto facebook to view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, I would love to not have to log in to see content. THe problem is that we do not know what facebook is using this information for or why they are keeping such detailed records. The fear is that employers, government, insurance companies, and others who have power over us will use said information against us in one way or another. Congress has no idea how the internet works and continues to write horrible bills "to protect the children." We have other places to post content where anyone can see it without having to log on. so why are we still using facebook links?

       I'm old :-P I'm 30. I haven't had cable since 2005; torrent all my shows so I don't see ads. I use to work in e-commerce and am pretty familiar with how a lot of the actual tracking stuff works too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adobe bought a company called Omniture and they used it in combination with this technology called Test and Target to track people across domains (which is why people without Ad Block or a privacy guard see so many targeted ads and the frequency increases as they visit the same products). The checkout cart page I worked on had 15 tracking pixels! Many ad companies track from click to purchase; so if you leave, but come back later and make a purchase, and have the same cookie, they charge the higher rate for that ad.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really sick how much effort is put into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, so much is being tracked these days. I'm careful with passwords (different passwords for every site using an algorithm; no central storage) and other aspects of my digital security/identity. Working in information security helps in knowing what to do. But as far as everything else, privacy is a myth at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be one thing if all of your browsing habits were just public. I'd actually be more okay with that. But the fact that both private companies and the government horde this data mining for themselves is messed up, but somewhat unavoidable.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thesis research was actually in CAPTCHA and I had a professor who asked me, during my defense, how there seems to be a constant struggle between spammers trying to defeat spam blocks and security companies preventing robots and spam. He asked where I thought the progression would go with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose I should be more diligent in preventing tracking, but so long as I don't see ads trying to convince me to feel inadequate and buy shit, I'll settle for that. Anything truly private I do, I do over SSL/SSH. Tracking is a reality, yes a scary one, but really an inevitable one.

       I'm well aware of what reddit is doing (rotting from the inside out). But, it's not quite the same thing. reddit doesn't continue tracking you after you've logged out. It doesn't have contracts to sell your private info to governments/corporations - in fact, the anonymous design of reddit makes that kind of impossible.... they'd need to associate your reddit account with you in some way... like maybe, I dunno, your ...

       reddit has no way of connecting the info to your personal identity (which

       I don't think it's a facebook bot trying to measure people's interests...it's probably just some moron who doesn't know any better....but you'd think he'd get the clue after all the downvotes right? Could just be a (badly written) spam bot trying to get karma on an account too.

       I don't think it's a bot. But I used to work SEO for a small company when times were really tight. I can tell you that someone has a clear directive to link things to facebook. IE, this guys email address ends in @facebook.com, or he's a contractor. No doubts.

       If we are honest we are being tracked all over, whatever we do via Isp's right?  Unless we take extra measures to remain anonymous in which case there are probably extra resources available to interested parties see what you might be up to.

       My question for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is he submitting these facebook links (to images with no substantial content) to r/conspiracy
       <strong>
        ONLY
       </strong>
       ? He's not submitting them to any other subreddits.
      </p>

       It doesn't matter what he submits anywhere else. He's honeypotting r/conspiracy.

       Or he is finding links on facebook and thinks
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       should see them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps he can be asked to resubmit to imgur. this has the  added benefit of interested parties being able to see how many people view the image too.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may have a point here but perhaps we should allow the benefit of the doubt before we accuse fellow  members who are trying to contribute.

       Interesting that you should suggest that. Ya see...
      </p>
      <p>
       I brought this to the attention of the mods a week ago. The mods contacted him and asked him to stop linking to facebook (uploading to imgur being the obvious alternative). And, they added rule 7 to the sidebar.
      </p>
      <p>
       They got no response and the facebook links keep coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... if we're going to speculate with "perhaps this" and "perhaps that"... perhaps this is a bot on autopilot submitting crap from his facebook account automatically. Perhaps, instead of giving this honeypot the benefit of the doubt as being a "fellow member", we should be looking a little deeper.

       Something I heard mentioned in another thread here though is that imgur cannot be reached via tor. If true that perhaps is a reason to be suspicious of imgur itself. I'm not running it myself so I haven't checked it out.

       Don't write new stuff in Perl. Perl is Whaleguts. PHP is the new Perl. PHP === Whaleguts.

       Use Python or Ruby. If you want a compiled language, Java, Scala, C# (Sharp Develop + Mono are free) or something of that nature.

       Ruby is certainly the new fad, I'll grant you that. But most people I know who say "user ruby, not perl" say it because they learned ruby, not perl.

       Pointing a finger at one person and saying "look what he's doing over there" in a public forum where that person can come and defend himself is a lot different than pointing potentially 900 million fingers at people behind their backs.

       No. Because I'm not tracking all of his internet activity and broadcasting that for all the world to see. Just this one particularly troublesome activity... and it wasn't from tracking him, it was from having repeatedly reported his shitty facebook links.

       dickgirl porn? I didn't realize anyone was actually into that shit. I just assumed it was sprinkled throughout the net to see if there was any interest.

      <p>
       So, you're a sicko. Do you ever worry about getting busted for something trivial and having all of this come out in court? Or are super self-confident that your prurient interests will be popular in prison?

       Since when is it illegal to masturbate to pornography? Just because me and my bros watch football and give each other blowjobs during halftime doesn't mean I am some fucking faggot. We do not have sex or anything dude. We just get some brewskies, some hot wings and chips, watch the football game, suck each others dicks talk sports and shit.

       We never allow our balls to touch another guys balls. 2012 and not sucking off your bros? I shiggymydiggies. PLEASE tell me you do not not do this Reddit.

       "They" can use your internet activity against you in trumped up court charges. Had a joint on you and got busted for pot? No biggie, right? But what about all that pornsurfing they've tracked? What about your participation in conspiracy websites? It's all evidence against you, if they choose to make it such.

       Right. I'm the one who noticed that. Correct. Just like I'm the one who noticed this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just FYI, I
       <strong>
        do
       </strong>
       take (some) precautions against being tracked, although my PC isn't very robust (it's ancient, in fact, in computer years). But, the things I can't install to protect me, I can emulate manually.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to ditch tracking cookies? Restart my browser (which clears EVERYTHING [except my bookmarks], and starts fresh.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to change IPs? Reboot my PC
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       my DSL modem (which abandons a current, unexpired lease, forcing my ISP to give me a new IP).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, again, yes... I am the one who noticed the google-analytics thing. And, yes... I'm the one who noticed the SOLIDSNAKE1000 honeypot.

       You are talking across what I said. I would suggest that your job is comparatively unimportant compared to the presidency, executives of the BBC or NYT, an acting soldier (probably starting from the lowest ranks but certainly any where near the top), CIA officials, police chiefs. The other reason perhaps is you aren't radical enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       You proposed that internet history is benign and asked what 'they' could. I answered directly without controversy. They could do all those things with that information, and have done previously. If you didn't follow that link in the UK BBC appointments were vetted to filter out communist and other political dissidents. MI5/6 (the semi and completely clandestine operations of who knows) vet government appointees to this day. Do you not see how these secret services would have an interest in such things at least hypothetically? Yes is the obvious answer, but in practice we know the US and UK are implementing measures towards total surveillance and do act on such information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pointing at the aurora shooter is irrelevant when I specifically talked about interacting with power (unless the shooting was not common psychosis). State apparatus protects itself, random shootings happen against the populous so have low priority.

       Something I heard mentioned in another thread here though is that imgur cannot be reached via tor. If true that perhaps is a reason to be suspicious of imgur itself. I'm not running it myself so I haven't checked it out.

       You are talking across what I said. I would suggest that your job is comparatively unimportant compared to the presidency, executives of the BBC or NYT, an acting soldier (probably starting from the lowest ranks but certainly any where near the top), CIA officials, police chiefs. The other reason perhaps is you aren't radical enough.

       You proposed that internet history is benign and asked what 'they' could. I answered directly without controversy. They could do all those things with that information, and have done previously. If you didn't follow that link in the UK BBC appointments were vetted to filter out communist and other political dissidents. MI5/6 (the semi and completely clandestine operations of who knows) vet government appointees to this day. Do you not see how these secret services would have an interest in such things at least hypothetically? Yes is the obvious answer, but in practice we know the US and UK are implementing measures towards total surveillance and do act on such information.

       Pointing at the aurora shooter is irrelevant when I specifically talked about interacting with power (unless the shooting was not common psychosis). State apparatus protects itself, random shootings happen against the populous so have low priority.
