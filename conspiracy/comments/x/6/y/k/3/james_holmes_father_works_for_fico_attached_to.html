<p>According to his LinkedIn profile, James Holmes’s father, Dr. Robert Holmes, who received a PhD in Statistics in 1981 from the University of California at Berkeley, worked for San Diego-based HNC Software, Inc. from 2000 to 2002. HNC, known as a “neural network” company, and DARPA, beginning in 1998, have worked on developing “cortronic neural networks,” which would allow machines to interpret aural and visual stimuli to think like humans.</p>

<p>The cortronic concept was developed by HNC Software’s chief scientist and co-founder, Robert Hecht-Nielsen. HNC merged with the Minneapolis-based Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO), a computer analysis and decision-making company. Robert Holmes continues to work at FICO.</p>

<p>Robert Holmes brief bio at linked in states the following: “My educational background is in Mathematics and Statistics. My experience over the last 10 years at HNC and FICO has been in developing predictive models for financial services; credit &amp; fraud risk models, first and third party application fraud models and internet/online banking fraud models.”</p>

<p>Robert Holmes has developed computer algorithms that demonstrate predictive models for financial services; credit and fraud risk models, first and third party application fraud models and internet/online banking fraud models. He is one of several scientists who patented a predictive model system used to detect telecommunications fraud.</p>

<p><strong>Check this out:</strong></p>

<p>According to his linkedin profile:</p>

<p>&quot;Management Experience: I am currently managing a team building <strong>Falcon Fraud Manager Credit</strong> card fraud models. I have also managed teams in the Telco and Identity Theft fraud areas.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Now check this out right off the FICO website:</strong></p>

<p>The new release of <strong>FICO Falcon Fraud Manager 6</strong> is the most accurate and comprehensive solution for detecting payment card fraud, reducing losses by up to 50%. No other system detects as much fraud with as little impact on customers and low operational costs</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to find information that Robert Holmes was going to testify at the LIBOR trial, this is still speculation, but a man of his position might be a key witness in a trail such as this. </p>

<p>(Write up with some out there ideas, but some good points)[<a href="http://getreadyportland.com/app/the-storm-is-coming/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-storm-is-coming">http://getreadyportland.com/app/the-storm-is-coming/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-storm-is-coming</a>]</p>

<p><del>SYS Technologies NYSE Amex: SYS, also known simply as SYS, provides information technology products though services and wireless communications systems for the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security and various industrial customers.[1] For large industrial customers in the telecommunications, utilities, construction, chemical, and biomedical industries, its products and services are used to manage remote assets.[1][3] SYS also provides financial and management services, primarily to U.S. government customers.[1] Since the company was founded it has been based in or around San Diego, California.[2]&quot;

<p><del>according to these filings, Holmes owned 138,194 shares of SYS. Sys was bought for stock in kratos at a rate of 1.26 shares SYS/KTOS. The market value at the time of the transaction for kratos was about 19$ /share. This would me he had stock with a value of 138194 * 1.24 * 19 = $3,255,850. This just seems odd because he is being described as having come from a middle class background, but most people in the middle class I know don&#39;t own 3million in stock in a single company.</del></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is or will be that way because almost every person out there will say the same thing. Not because it is true or even because its the only option. It will be that way because we say and do nothing. Then we compound the problem by &quot;giving up&quot; and saying nothing ever comes of acting on these issues. People new to the bullshit/system &quot;think&quot; this is the only option and carry on saying that.  Few people stand up to say &quot;Hey!  We&#39;re being fucked with, let&#39;s ACTUALLY do something!&quot;. </p>

<p>What kind of person are you?  Defeatist comments come naturally to you or are you just apathetic?  Is your comment the end result you&#39;re looking for?</p>

<p>What could you change to see some actual &quot;change&quot;?  Maybe its what you say and how you say it?  </p>

<p>Think about what you say. You determine your reality and people DO hear and sway one way or another depending on others views (right or wrong).  If everyone understood that I think we&#39;d be in a totally different place.  </p>

<p>I would say that HNC, known as a “neural network” company, and DARPA beginning in 1998, have worked on developing “cortronic neural networks,” which would allow machines to interpret aural and visual stimuli to think like humans is more of an interesting angle to investigate here.  </p>

Thankfully, Woodward &amp; Bernstein had no use for people like you.  Unfortunately, we had no conspiracy theorists working at the Washington Post or NYTimes in 2001-2002, so instead we got both papers promoting WMD lies &amp; missing the scoop on Enron &amp; Tyco &amp; Worldcom&#39;s criminal conspiracies.
