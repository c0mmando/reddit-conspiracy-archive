       Maybe Holmes was acting out as a result of frustration built up over the initial incident. Or maybe we are

       I tend to disagree, if there really was an armed bank robber in the area I would want him caught. If they have to take a few people out of their cars at gunpoint to accomplish it then so be it, it's not like they just opened fire on anyone or even arrested anyone illegally.

       Because I would let the police slightly inconvenience me if it meant catching a wanted felon? They have the right to detain people within the area during situations like this, as long as they aren't mistreating anyone or anything like that I have no problem with them doing their JOB.

       Why does it matter if someone robbed a bank if no one was injured? Not something I ever plan on doing but who cares, that bank robber is likely to spend more time in jail then the wall street and government crooks ever will.

       There is a difference from just going around and pointing guns at people to  pointing guns at people who you think could possibly be armed and just robbed a bank. Again as long as they didn't just start throwing out people's rights or start executing people the officers were just doing their jobs as they've been trained to do. When you make a felony stop the officers will always have their guns drawn and pointed on you until they can verify that you are not a threat.

       Kinda failing to see the coincidence, other than that both things occurred
       <strong>
        in
       </strong>
       Aurora, there's really nothing else relating them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The text in the picture is funny still though, seeing as it says "finger inching towards the trigger" when both cops are both showing proper trigger safety with their fingers straight out. Just pointing out the text on the image, not trying to re-hash that entire thread, simply just pointing out the exact text not matching the exact image.
      </p>

       Time must be going so slow, I really felt like that thread was longer than a month ago. Jeez.

       Or, are you commenting on me saying I think saying "fingers inching towards the trigger" is funny because it's clear that they're not

       in the picture, not making any comment at all about the nature of the photo, or the story behind it. I didn't say I think it's funny that they are pointing guns at a kid, or that they're pulling every random person out of their car to try and catch a robber. I said "saying finger inches towards the trigger" isn't correct in that picture, which makes just that text funny, to me.

       Just a quick little notice that regardless of what you may or may not believe from an anonymous user on the Internet, those cops are NOT using their guns correctly.  It is standard and mandatory procedure to only point the gun at a target when firing is implied.  The gun always points to the ground until the shot is to be taken.

       Maybe Holmes was friends with an officer, and some how got access to the stations armory where he acquired all of the gear. So, the police began a massive search for a "bank robber" instead of confessing to their own slip up. Weeks later, Holmes has spent weeks studying his arsenal and perhaps was trained by his friend who knew Holmes was planning something, but didn't want to interfere because he was concerned for his family's safety. Then, the friend was able to give Holmes information on building explosives from what he learned in Iraq. Holmes didn't confess to the police that his apartment was rigged...the police already knew.

       Some things about that seem probable like him somehow gaining access To an armory and getting his weapons from there, the police may have noticed this and as to not alarm the people they said they were looking for a bank robber, one of james's roomates may have tipped off the police as well, which was why they arrived so quickly.

       The FBI is involved now.  The FBI generally doesn't like local police, so it's only a matter of time before this is exposed if those weapons were from a police arsenal.  Those things have serial numbers, and even if the numbers are removed, they're cataloged in a central database.  The cops wouldn't have been able to replace the missing weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "it was spaghetti, like something you'd see in Iraq" is probably just because they both learned the methods from the internet, and they were both sloppy.  Spaghetti usually means poorly made, like the IEDs in Iraq are.  There's not really a "spaghetti" method that is taught.
