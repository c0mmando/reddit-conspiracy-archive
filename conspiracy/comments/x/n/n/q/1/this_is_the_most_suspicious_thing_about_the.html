        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Three days after the shooting, Police Chief Dan Oates tells Kate Snow</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/aurora-police-chief-oates-interview_n_1695896.html">&quot;We will convict him. Yes.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s why it&#39;s so bothersome.</p>

<p>About 15 years ago, I worked in law enforcement (technology, systems analyst). On a few occasions, I was involved in evidence collection and processing. And, ... as a responsible former special deputy (no badge, just a business card signed by the boss), THAT IS ALL I&#39;M ALLOWED TO TELL YOU.</p>

<p>Our agency was diligent and vigilant about dealing with news agencies. They&#39;d call us and say: We heard about (or saw) your agency &quot;blah blah blah&quot;, is there anything you can tell us? </p>

<p>And our agency always responded: No. There&#39;s nothing we can tell you at this time.</p>

<p>Dan Oates is an embarrassment to responsible law enforcement and has tainted this investigation with his public statements.</p>

<p>1) Declaring publicly (within 72 hours of the event) that there was only one shooter. -- I got news for ya. 72 hours isn&#39;t enough time to do a proper investigation to even <em>determine</em> that information.</p>

<p>and...</p>

<p>2) Unless he has a Judge in his pocket, there&#39;s no way he can be making that kind of statement about getting a conviction.</p>

<p>Dan Oates is a traitor to his badge.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT: Friends (and others). While I&#39;m still quite interested in and disconcerted by this incident, I just want to say thanks. I&#39;ve been here almost 3 years under an assortment of usernames, and this is the first time I&#39;ve ever gotten to #1 on the hot page.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT2: Participating in this subreddit is often a no-win situation. If you don&#39;t defend your position, you&#39;re ridiculed. If you do, you&#39;re ridiculed <em>and</em> badgered incessantly. I did my best to defend my position, but... I&#39;ve not slept in 36 hours (and am going to bed after this edit) and I lost my cool in one thread below (about the courts of all things). So, my closing statement here is: Take everything with a grain of salt. I&#39;m no more qualified to assess this situation than anyone else who has commented hereunder (unless they decide to show some credentials). I posted my <strong>opinion</strong> (it&#39;s just an opinion - and opinions are like assholes: everybody has one) and did my best to defend it to those who questioned it. Now, I&#39;m going to try to sleep (even though I&#39;m at that stage of sleep deprivation where sleep doesn&#39;t come easily). Peace.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT3: Wikipedia vindicated me for losing my cool (comment placed in context below).</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT4: Someone PM&#39;d me that there&#39;s a subreddit dedicated to the Aurora Case</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AuroraCase/">http://www.reddit.com/r/AuroraCase/</a></p>

<p>However, I glanced through it, and it appears to be focused on a presumption of guilt, so I&#39;m fairly certain I&#39;ll never glance at it again.</p>

<p>I agree with you that he should not be mentioning details. However, maybe his statement was his way of showing resolve and determination. His whole community - friends, family, coworkers - has been <em>torn apart</em> by this senseless tragedy. Maybe he decided to throw PC out the window for a minute and try to give the grieving families some closure.</p>

<p>While this doesn&#39;t excuse him, I don&#39;t think we should throw stones. I know I sure as hell wouldn&#39;t want to be in his shoes right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why do you consider this suspicious?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exhibit A: Dismissing all other suspects out of hand.</p>

<p>Subsequent evidence after these negligent statements</p>

<p>Exhibit B: Numerous eye-witness accounts claiming there were [at least] 2.</p>

<p>Exhibit C: News helicopter footage clearly shows a gas mask and other evidence all the way down at the end of the parking lot, when his car was parked right there at the emergency exit.</p>

<p>Exhibit D: a trail of arterial bleeding leading <strong>toward</strong> the theater from half way down the parking lot... when, again,... his car was found right there at the E-exit.</p>

<p>And, of course, let&#39;s not forget</p>

<p>Exhibit E: The radio dispatch showed NUMEROUS suspects (no less than 3 different descriptions mentioned in the logs).</p>

<p>But &quot;they got their man, case closed&quot;.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;d hate to be in his shoes right now, too, after making such ludicrous public statements. He&#39;s either got a lot of pressure on him to hang this one guy from a high tree for all to see, or their department is comprised of dolts.</p>

<p>Perhaps I have not followed the story as closely as I could have but is it definitely two shooters seen?  I saw perhaps one report of two but many explanations that some heard shot through the wall of the theatres and thought the shots came from within not next door.</p>

<p>I really shouldn&#39;t be wasting my time on reddit when I need to be looking for a job, but maaaaaan is it hot here (3rd or 4th day in a row of 110F+).</p>

<p>Additionally, I&#39;m not really sure why I even find this case so fascinating. My area of interest has always been the international banksters. </p>

<p>Furthermore, if it turns out this really is about gun control, well... (shhhh.. don&#39;t tell anyone) I couldn&#39;t care less about that aspect of it. I don&#39;t own a gun and likely never will. I&#39;m a pacifist (physically). I find a sharp mind and wit to be the best weapons for the internet (considering I live alone, that&#39;s pretty much the only place I interact with anyone). </p>

<p>But, I <em>am</em> anti-corruption... especially in local/regional law enforcement and criminal justice... due to personal experience.</p>

<p>Hmmm... maybe I just stumbled onto it in my musings here.</p>

<p>Holmes dad is working on a &quot;pre-crime&quot; system for the NYPD. Maybe that&#39;s what&#39;s troubling me, deep down. Because I know that many crimes are crimes of the moment (or day). Inspiration hits someone in desperation and they do something they later regret. Add this to the whole epidemic of methlabs nationwide (which the DAs are simply turning loose again via plea bargans - &quot;we&#39;ll let you go this time, if you&#39;ll rat on 3 people&quot; - and they inevitably do, because meth-heads don&#39;t think properly... the drug makes them believe that no matter what they say or do, they&#39;re doing the right/smart/genius thing - it really distorts the ego). So, this notion of &quot;pre-crime&quot; seems highly unreliable and subjective</p>

<p>Oh, well... time to let the ball bounce for a few days and see what happens.</p>

<p>Also, (footnote) remember a while back when the same PD (Aurora) detained 2 dozen people because &quot;there might be a robber in the area&quot;? Seems inconsistent with dismissing all other suspects in the Batman case.</p>

<p>I need sleep. G&#39;night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying &quot;go forth and type for my amusement&quot; or anything. I&#39;m only saying that you&#39;re a pretty clear thinker is all. If you type more I&#39;ll read. If you don&#39;t I won&#39;t. My only point was that you&#39;re not screaming into the wilds with no one listening. Find a rock and speak. Sooner or later some asshole [myself] will plop down and listen. The more coherent you are the listeners you get. I know, by reading the comments section, that I&#39;m not the only one to have sat down.</p>

<p>I also agree about the bankers. I&#39;m highly interested in that sphere. And yet I find this case to be interesting. It smells of something. I don&#39;t even know what. But it just ain&#39;t right.</p>

<p>As for your position on the use of weapons Sun Tzu would agree. The best general doesn&#39;t need to engage.</p>

<p>The pre-crime thing is also intersting, however, my understanding of the mechanism is that you sit in a chair. So the pre-crime aspect is limited to maybe that morning or that day. And even then it seems completely unreliable. I&#39;d give a positive every time, but that&#39;s because I have chronic anxiety. Sooner or later some lawyer will catch on to this.</p>

<p>Then again - who knows. I&#39;m later for an appointment.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>I hope you get some sleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t use random terms interchangeably in a context like this. The &quot;legal system&quot; is irrelevant here. Courts are not part of the legal system, they are part of the judicial branch.</p>

<p>The <strong>legislative</strong> branch writes laws. </p>

<p>The <strong>executive</strong> branch (police) enforces laws. They gather evidence against people that they believe <em>may have committed a crime</em> then pass it off to the <strong>judicial</strong> branch.</p>

<p>The <strong>judicial</strong> branch interprets and applies the law to the case. A state/city/federal district attorney is part of this branch and they attempt to convict criminals.</p>

<p>Since police officers are part of the executive branch they have zero authority in the courts. A police officer has no say in a person&#39;s conviction, they just investigate and pass evidence off to the judicial system. </p>

<p>At no point of judicial proceedings (a trial) is a police officer in any authoritative position to do anything to a plaintiff.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_court">Officer of the court</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The generic term officer of the court (not to be confused with court officers) applies to all those who, in some degree in function of their professional or similar qualifications, have a legal part—and hence legal and deontological obligations—in the complex functioning of <strong>the judicial system as a whole</strong>, in order to forge justice out of the application of the law and the simultaneous pursuit of the legitimate interests of all parties and the general good of society. [emphasis mine]</p>

<p>They can be divided into the following functional groups; <strong>in most case various synonyms and parallels exist as well as a variety of operational variations</strong>, depending on the jurisdiction and the changes in relevant legislation: [emphasis mine - because marshal, sheriff, and constable, below, would be synonymous with &quot;police officer&quot;] [remainder abridged]</p>

<p>You said &quot;official of the court&quot; which is closer to &quot;Officers of the court&quot; than &quot;court officers&quot;.</p>

<p>So... there you have it.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT: Also (while digging) I was reminded that &quot;the court&quot; is an arena for adversarial arbitration, but I won&#39;t dive off into that because I don&#39;t know if it would clarify or muddy this already muddled discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus dude. Are you a child? Trolling? Maybe just dense?</p>

<p>I dodged nothing. I explained how bailiffs have no influence on the actual judicial process. They enforce the law of the court and that is it. They are officers and their jurisdiction happens to be the court. That does not make them judicial officers of the court. Do you ever see bailiffs reading motions or cross examining witnesses? No.</p>

<p>Bailiffs aren&#39;t out arresting James Holmes at the movie theatre, police officers are. Police officers working in the same capacity as Oates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually think this guy was an actual loon &amp; heres why.</p>

<p>I found this when reading the Dark Knight returns a few weeks ago, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/j4H2R.jpg">LOOK!</a>  (No doubt it will now be reposted every 5 minutes for the next day or 5, sorry chaps!) I actually thought someone else would have came across this by now. Its too similar to be purely coincidence, also of note is the crazy reddish hair. (media kept saying joker hair despite the fact the joker has never had red hair to the best of my knowledge)</p>

<p>The Dark Knight rises was heavily based on this comic, I think the guy may have just been a common house hold variety loon, but whos to say, another distration tactic nowadays to could simply be for the cops to lie &amp; act suspicious when theres no reason to, we know they lie pretty much all the time so it wouldnt be hard for them to make the truth look like a lie, they&#39;d only have to start talking!?</p>

<p>I dont know, I just find the page from the comic to be very strange indeed, was it an accidental prediction? Was it his or someone elses inspiration for the attack? Or is completely unrelated? Who knows, but Id say there are too many similarities to completely ignore it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, that has more than a decades worth of investigation.  regardless of what I think happened on 9/11, we&#39;ve had lots of time to think it through and examine evidence.</p>

<p>contrast that with the several weeks since aurora, where the investigation (or coverup) is still in progress.  I think its simply too soon to make claims because nobody has access to facts right now, certainly not a bunch of redditors.</p>

<p>all we have is speculation, most of it wild.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you. I guess there is a duality to our different points here so i&#39;ll explain mine better.</p>

<p>From my shoes, and a lot of others as well, it  seems that these high profile events are staged scripted and spun to  serve a purpose or agenda.</p>

<p>Without getting  too involved with the specifics, 9/11 just being a glaringly obvious example we cite, alternative media readers and reporters see the motives behind big money and believe most of what  the government investigates and reports on is smoke and mirrors. </p>

<p>So from  our point of view, the only real instrument that can effectively make light of such an event is the contribution of thousands of individual investigators. Sure the facts are not clear, and they most likely never will. And of course, we are met with resistance from those who rather just stick to the narrative of the mainstream while they slander and mock anybody who questions it.</p>

A 2nd shooter that was reported by a <em>minority of eyewitnesses</em> who were <em>under distress</em> during this event?

<p>Why were bullets only fired from one person, according to most witnesses?</p>

<p>Open your eyes. Open your mind. Just don&#39;t let it get soo open that your brains fall out. That is what skepticism is about. A true skeptic is open to the possibility of <em>anything</em> being a conspiracy, you just have to be able to <em>prove</em> it. Speculation, out of context quotes and no evidence do not prove a conspiracy, just the same as stacking 1000&#39;s of claims based on blatantly false science do not make a truth (9/11 conspiracy <em>hypothesis</em> (theories actually have evidence that can stand up to a little scrutiny)).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re saying &quot;all those witnesses saw another guy&quot;, that sounds like a lot of people saw a second guy.  Where is that credibly documented?</p>

<p>I know of one witness who thought he saw a smoke grenade come from the other side of the room, though nobody actually saw a second person throw a smoke grenade that I know of.  Apparently many did see the shooter throw one or more himself.</p>

<p>Another witness thought they saw the shooter waive or gesture at someone, though again to my knowledge that person wasn&#39;t actually seen.</p>

<p>I know of a set of pictures that seem to show an extraneous gas mask on the sidewalk outside the theater.  It&#39;s something, but certainly not an eyewitness account of an accomplice.</p>

<p>I read somewhere that the police dispatcher initially referred to 2+ shooters, but I didn&#39;t listen to the recordings myself and I&#39;m not sure what was said, with how much certainty, or why.  Incorrect information going over police radios in the very early minutes of a mass shooting seems entirely likely, considering the source of their information is highly distressed people on adrenaline kicks who are trying not to be killed.</p>

<p>What other evidence of an accomplice is there?  Please don&#39;t get angry at me if I missed something, I don&#39;t know everything.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what that is.  They usually interrogate suspects, not witnesses, and they have rooms at the department for it, but I&#39;ve never heard of an &quot;interrogation vehicle&quot;.  How is it distinguished from an ordinary squad car, or a transport wagon or something else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating.  I think there&#39;s enough inconsistencies that it&#39;s certainly worth keeping in mind until after the trials are done and the gag orders are lifted, and the police should be routinely questioned about their work regardless of their credibility and integrity.</p>

<p>However I don&#39;t find it remarkable that the police are already ruling things in and out at this point, when they have access to most if not all of the available evidence and a lot of resources to analyze that evidence with, while the public is left with only a basic idea of what happened and random, fuzzy and often dubious details.</p>

<p>At this point, a single suspect hypothesis with a few mistaken accounts of an accomplice out of 100+ witnesses still seems to be the simplest explanation to me.  It&#39;s not my conclusion or anything, just more of an expectation.  We will know more in the months and years to come to be sure.</p>

<p>Based on how everything is lied to us at all levels, I have no issues believing this is a lie too. They want us  afraid of lone wolfs.  Just look at the two pictures of the suspect from school and after the shooting. Two totally different people! What about the second shooter? How did this kid get all the equipment? How could  such a smart  kid with a bright future do such thing? Why was he so blatenly drugged during the only court video taping we&#39;re allowed to see? What about his whistle blowing dad? And of course the point you bring up... More questions than answers means we are being deep throated lies on TV again. If you people out  there fail to see that 2 + 2 is not = 4, go hang out on the front page and comment about cats and bieber,where critical thinking is not cool.</p>

<p>It turned out that he had <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/08/lone_shooters_a.html">full body ballistic armor</a>. </p>

<p>Anyone who had a concealed carry weapon wouldn&#39;t have been able to take him down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, the strongest ballistic armor you can get is Class IV.  Class IV armor will stop a .338 Lapua Magnum or .44 magnum round but be effectively useless afterwards.  The plates shatter and the body still absorbs the full force, usually knocking the target over.  Usually, class IV armor is a heavy kevlar weave with ceramic plates pocketed.  Class IV armor is only purchasable by law enforcement and military operations, though the vest and plates can be bought separately.  The armor is also extremely cumbersome and difficult to use without proper training/highly restrictive.</p>

<p>The body armor James Holmes used was never specified, but if it was simple riot gear as all signs seem to point, it wasn&#39;t even Class I.  Riot gear that covers the areas of the body that thoroughly are usually made of a plastic compound that can&#39;t stop a bullet.  If James Holmes was using any sort of kevlar, he was likely using a Class II(due to mobility).  Class II body armor can take maximum a .357 magnum round or a .223(whereas a Class III will stop .40 S&amp;W, .357 SIG, 7.62x39 and some similar calibers - maybe one or two FMJ .45 ACP rounds; Class I will stop .22, 9mm, and .38 special).  </p>

<p>Now why is all this info important?  My father is in a biker club that I hang out with on the weekends sometimes.  Every one of those guys has their concealed carry permits.  A couple have 9mm&#39;s, .40s&amp;w, .357 magnum(one guy uses a SIG), but the majority of them carry .45 ACP.  A shot to the face would have killed him, the gas mask has no ballistic prevention capabilities.  A standard ballistics helmet can take one round of a small caliber(9mm)before shattering, and the head will have absorbed the full force of the bullet leading to unconsciousness.  A .45 ACP, .40s&amp;w, or even .357 mag would have pierced straight through the helmet(provided they were FMJ).  Several shots on his body would have taken him down in moments, and the rounds would have eventually pierced through the vest, shot exposed joints, any number of possibilities.</p>

<p>Not saying that I don&#39;t think this was completely set up, just pointing out some things for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should read over the NIJ&#39;s body armor classifications just so you are a little more clear. Levels I through IIIa are all designed to stop blunt, lower velocity handgun rounds. Soft level IIIa armor will stop .44 mag or a standard slug with little enough blunt force to ensure survival. Levels III and IV are achieved with plates of ceramic, polyethylene, or metal. Metal plates have the most durability, but they cause large amounts of spalling and are heavy as hell. Ceramic plates will often fail to stop even mild steel core ammo such as m855 and are temperature sensitive. Ceramic plates do shatter somewhat, but most are rated for multiple hits of m80 (the level III defining threat) or .30-06 m2ap (level iv). And you can buy all of this shit on eBay. None of it is restricted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His parents didn&#39;t call the police. The police called his mother and repeatedly asked questions to clarify whether or not the suspect was her son. She said &quot;yes, you have the right <strong>person</strong>&quot; (not guy) and later explained her statement to mean that they had contacted the right &quot;Mrs. Holmes&quot;, not that they had arrested the right person. And this, dear courtney1213, is precisely why you cannot trust what the media tells you. They distorted her statement into something that would convince you that even his parents believed him to be guilty. Which is NOT the case.</p>

<p>Hearsay. What do you know about the case other than what you&#39;ve heard in the media?</p>

<p>The chief of police in Aurora was also head of security for Giuliani in NYC on 9/11. That means he was in building 7 along with the CIA. This is a blatant CIA psyop designed to draw attention away from LIBOR and the riots in Anaheim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enough is enough. You people are such bullshit. This guy went psychotic in a movie theater ending a lot of lives including children, and all you damn frothing conspiracy theorists can think is that it was somehow a &quot;cointelpropsyopsinsidejob&quot;.</p>

<p>Got news for you: Some people just want to watch the world burn.</p>

<p>Not everything that happens which shocks the public is a conspiracy. Not everything has a super awesome, secret and entertaining conspiracy behind it. Not everything can nor should be made into a long documentary full of bullshit claims and false science for you to watch and be <em>entertained by</em>. Shit happens.</p>

<p>Ask questions when serious shit happens, fine. Thats totally cool and its also the right thing to do. But don&#39;t sit there and come up with a wild conspiracy theory based on a few moot points. Its bullshit, and it only hurts people and confuses others.</p>

<p>And what will happen? Probably nothing (other than a conviction of the killer, of course). I wouldn&#39;t count on this vicious event being used to enact any &quot;gun control laws&quot;. Go ahead and cry foul. Cry foul right now. Make your prediction about gun control laws. Then in six months, or two years or whatever amount of time from now it takes for you to realize that you were wrong, you can come and admit it.</p>

<p>Maybe then you&#39;ll actually be open minded.</p>

<p>Most frustrating conspiracy ever.</p>

<p>I dodged nothing. I explained how bailiffs have no influence on the actual judicial process. They enforce the law of the court and that is it. They are officers and their jurisdiction happens to be the court. That does not make them judicial officers of the court. Do you ever see bailiffs reading motions or cross examining witnesses? No.</p>

<p>Bailiffs aren&#39;t out arresting James Holmes at the movie theatre, police officers are. Police officers working in the same capacity as Oates. </p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t mentioned what role police officers serve in the trial process. Here&#39;s a hint: two posters above you responded correctly while you sat around mixing up basic legal definitions and telling me &quot;you lost go away.&quot;</p>

<p>I usually love to engage in intelligent conversation and teach what I know. I love to learn new things when I happen to be wrong. That being said, this will be my last response because the only way I can possibly &quot;lose&quot; here is by wasting more time on this nonsensical circular talk.</p>

<p>Based on how everything is lied to us at all levels, I have no issues believing this is a lie too. They want us  afraid of lone wolfs.  Just look at the two pictures of the suspect from school and after the shooting. Two totally different people! What about the second shooter? How did this kid get all the equipment? How could  such a smart  kid with a bright future do such thing? Why was he so blatenly drugged during the only court video taping we&#39;re allowed to see? What about his whistle blowing dad? And of course the point you bring up... More questions than answers means we are being deep throated lies on TV again.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re saying &quot;all those witnesses saw another guy&quot;, that sounds like a lot of people saw a second guy.  Where is that credibly documented?</p>

<p>I know of one witness who thought he saw a smoke grenade come from the other side of the room, though nobody actually saw a second person throw a smoke grenade that I know of.  Apparently many did see the shooter throw one or more himself.</p>

<p>Another witness thought they saw the shooter waive or gesture at someone, though again to my knowledge that person wasn&#39;t actually seen.</p>

<p>I know of a set of pictures that seem to show an extraneous gas mask on the sidewalk outside the theater.  It&#39;s something, but certainly not an eyewitness account of an accomplice.</p>

<p>I read somewhere that the police dispatcher initially referred to 2+ shooters, but I didn&#39;t listen to the recordings myself and I&#39;m not sure what was said, with how much certainty, or why.  Incorrect information going over police radios in the very early minutes of a mass shooting seems entirely likely, considering the source of their information is highly distressed people on adrenaline kicks who are trying not to be killed.</p>

<p>What other evidence of an accomplice is there?  Please don&#39;t get angry at me if I missed something, I don&#39;t know everything.</p>
