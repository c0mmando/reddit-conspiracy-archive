       Context: This man was 36 year US Army vet that was involved in just about every military operation in the last four decades. A former Delta Force operator, he was also in charge of designing the Para-Military arm of the CIA. One of these articles just popped up on my news feed on FB, so I thought I would pass it along and share the story with all of you fine people. Of course, we must always consider the source when discussing ultra-inflammatory topics such as this, but I must say, it is a major concern. I've always a feeling that if something catastrophic did happen, the food supply would be the biggest issue and people located in the big cities would clearly suffer the most. I feel like I should be more prepared than I am currently. Anyone agree? Disagree? Any other additional thoughts on this? If so, please sound off because I am all ears.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, who has some sure fire ways to get started with these types of preparations?
      </p>
      <p>
       Paranoia or legitimate concerns?

       Bugging out is not an option for me. Therefore bug in is my only option. Stockpile food, water, have a way to filter gathered water to prepare it for drinking, stockpile firearms and ammunition. Let no one remove you

       Roger. Copy that. I hear you loud and clear and will take this into consideration. I was thinking something along these lines as a contingency plan: M4 style AR + Glock with plenty of rounds. Non perishable foods like MRE's and canned goods, (and as you have mentioned), water and/or equipment to gather and filter water. Maybe some other odds and ends like batteries, a good spot light, survival knife and fishing equipment. I would basically acquire the goods more or less in that order. Would you agree with that? Any other revisions to list or other suggestions? (Appreciate the input)

       This too, but it has to happen before...   It will be difficult after, places like NH, most of it, is already self sufficient. I am almost certain those people could conform to lanterns and crazy summer heat without AC, fairly easily.  Books, books will keep you occupied and educated.  Buy now, and read now or later.

       I think you are both right. It never has to be one way or the other, we start sounding like politicians then people, not good. I think every human should take the responsibility of looking after their health and safety and not just blindly hope that someone will fix everything for them. This seems to be the prevalent thinking in America and having lived in NYC for the last ten years I'm happy that I spent enough time on farms growing up. It taught me the value of life and about the circle of life, these skills I will pass on to my neighbors in the event of some shit coming at us. That being said, I like knives, big fuck off shinny ones and woo-betide anyone who does not come in peace. It's all about balance lads, balance and sticking up for yourself and the ones you love.

       Whatever happens in the next few years, preparation and knowledge never hurt anyone. "Pardon? Oh yes, I'd love another beer, thanks luv."

       Great quote. Agreed, we all try to talk sense to our neighbors. But they will not listen, this is why i feel the need to have firearms. I have everything else too, there are by my count, 3 chicken coops on my street and i buy my eggs from a girl in sales at work.That having been said, there are so many who will not see the forest for the trees, and regardless of  my preparations, the government will probably still come and try and take our guns when the super dome happens again.

       Fucking jealous of those chickens mate! There is a Halal butcher 2 blocks away from us and I know that if it goes pear-shaped, one of the first places I'll go to trade for a couple. Yea, the guns thing worries me too, just gotta hope they are far too busy with other shit to worry about us.....

       We seem headed that way. I believe we'll reach a time when government gets so bad (incompetent, and beholden to special interests) that things will fall apart. The rulers will then use military force on American soil against Americans (under the excuse of suppressing unlawful rebellion against the government). Key protesters will be taken to camps. Cities will be locked down. Rural residents probably will be forced either to cities or camps, drones used to spot them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forced labor will be the only way to pay for the coat of the military.
