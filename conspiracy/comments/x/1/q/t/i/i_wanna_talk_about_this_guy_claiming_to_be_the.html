       Then there is the trail of blood, leading out past the car. The gas mask found at the wrong spot, farther than his car. I think there was a second shooter, and that Holmes was a patsy. Someone they drugged /mind controlled / brain washed into helping with the plot. I think there was another shooter, trained, hardened, and secret.

       No, I haven't watched any of those. To be honest, That sounds like a plausible thing. I wouldn't put too much faith into it though. I feel like it's very naked gun.

       On the other hand, if that were legit, I don't think Ventura would be around much longer if he were releasing actual secrets. Maybe the branding of conspiracy helps to dilute and cover, but you know how they are about control.

       Is it possible that James Holmes was set up? Think about this:
James Holmes goes out Tuesday night drinking and someone doses him. They do it early Wed morning so they have time in his apartment to set up those elaborate traps (how would James have known how to construct those anyway?)
They keep him drugged and off the radar till Thursday night when they go to the theater. They make sure to park in that spot, right next to the exit of the theater.
The assailant goes in, fakes the phone call, comes out, goes to the car where James is still drugged, gets the gear on, goes in and attacks the innocent civilians.
Then the assailant comes out the exit door, leans against it while dropping the gun and removing almost all of his gear with the exception of the mask.
He runs past the car dropping the gear next to it in a heap, opens the door with James inside, tosses the guns into the car, the shotgun has been there all along, and goes straight down the length of the building toward the corner, toward the camera, drops his mask directly under the camera, and heads off to the nearby street where a car is waiting (cruising slowly) to pick him up.
Holmes is reported to have been “meek” when arrested. This might also explain why he wasn’t shot by police… he was incapacitated, incoherent, or generally not a threat.
Holmes, who is being held under suicide watch in solitary confinement, remained in his murderous “Joker” persona after his arrival, a jailhouse worker told the Daily News.“He thinks he’s acting in a movie,” a prison employee told the Daily News.

       ok, ok, let me rephrase this, this is not how the media works, people might remember to a certain extent, but they remember about as far as the media tells them what to think.  The next story line, the next celebrity gossip, the next jobs disappointment, the next financial scandal, the next corrupt politician, the next sports moment, im not sure you even know how the media works, maybe you should study MSM tactics and understand that first, i dont have all night to teach you the basics of media manipulation and succeeding as a media empire.  But ill finish by saying, this story will stop selling ads in a few days, let me educate you some more real quick before i leave, tv works because of advertisements once again incase you didnt understand the first time, this story will get stagnate and wont entertain in a couple more days.  Most people who watch MSM and get their influence from MSM, will be fed the next story line that will sell the most advertisements, hence the olympics will be front and center and more important to the bottom line of MSM in 4 days.

       He must have reloaded the AR-15. The reason the media is claiming he stopped firing it was because the 100 round drum jammed, but in the photos of it outside the theater, it has a what looks like a 30 round magazine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I agree - an experience shooter would have killed more. Seemed to me that he was firing without aiming.

       Yes, but they are cheap construction and notorious for jamming. AR-15s can have very quick magazine changes with a little practice, plus the weight of the drum limits mobility and accuracy of the firearm.

       Such an interesting list, I had to switch to my computer to comment, So $10,000 worth of gear? yeah VERY suspicious. I didn't hear he was denied from the gun range, and can't fathom why ( they don't even check your ID depending on where you go) could you tell me more about that? I'm with you, what student is going to know how to build explosives? especially such sophisticated ones? NONE that's who. Ever tried to make explosives? unless you're lucky or good, you're likely to blow your hand off If you are just reading it online. or at least alert the neighbors with the weird smells, and small test charge explosions coming from your place. very interesting.
