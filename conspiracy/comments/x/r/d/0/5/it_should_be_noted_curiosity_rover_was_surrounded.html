        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>According to conspiracy books NASA will always take the time to &quot;screen out&quot; any potential &quot;unwanted artifacts&quot; before public release.   I probably don&#39;t even believe a word of <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/luna/luna_darkmission.htm">Dark Mission and Hoagland</a>, etc, but the prediction that NASA will censor data is confirmed for the 12th time. </p>

<p>With all this hype, all we got was a postcard-sized image and they tell us no more pics for another 10 hours until mars spins around again (according to plan).  Mission accomplished NASA, mission-fucking-accomplished.  </p>

<p>Ever heard of webcam?  Yeah, that streams the simplest type of data into a 640x480 video file.  I thought that&#39;s what we were getting to end this whole theory once and for all.  That&#39;s ALL you had to do, NASA.  You failed, Hoagland gets to sell more books.</p>

<p>If history has proven anything, is that secrets remain both externally and internally intact, and that the USA excels in them. There is nothing misguided in the potential of this theory, even if it&#39;s paranoid.  Take a look at the internal security success story of the Manhattan project.  Even most people deep inside military intelligence <em>had no idea</em> of what was going on.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re an idiot. if you watched the entire landing, you would know that there were no &quot;communications issues&quot; as the heart beat signal to Curiosity remained strong throughout the procedure (it even dipped down as the cruise stage was separated and flew between the rover and earth).</p>

<p>This has been the most transparant landing to date. You should have watched the landing.  The first images came up on the mission control screens within MINUTES of the confirmed touchdown. You would have watched them confirm connection with the Mars Odyssey satellite... confirm that connection had been established but no data sent... and then finally confirm that data was coming down and they were waiting for thumbnails. You would have seen this in real time. Like I said, this was the most transparant landing to date and had no step for the &quot;screening out of unwanted artifacts&quot;. </p>

<p>As for the higher resolution... you dont just land and jackup your camera roost immediately after landing... you have to make sure its safe to do that and that everything made the 200 million mile trip safely and that takes time. all I can say is wait to see what happens next. This thing is about to chug out more pixels of glorious detail than the world has ever seen. </p>

<p>There are conspiracies in the world... this, however, is not one of them. Its one of the more amazing things mankind has ever accomplished.. and your brain is working against your ability to appreciate it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>its pretty clear we aren&#39;t screening out images... you&#39;re getting them pretty much the same time as all of the team members are getting it.  I mean the public got images of the fucking parachute deployed and landing within 12 hours of touchdown. that is unprecedented. i don&#39;t see how they had time for a &quot;sifting committee&quot; there. </p>

<p>regardless.... this is hopeless.  too fucking paranoid to see the truth right in front of you. or maybe just too fucking stupid.  i give up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol im not mad &quot;bro&quot;... i have no idea what Hoaglan is... i&#39;m sure he has well reasoned theories.  It&#39;s clear because if you watched the landing you watched the first images come up just about 4 minutes after the touch down signal was received. NASA&#39;s history doesn&#39;t show that either. Maybe the early early missions did.. but that was in a time where there was hardly a real time communication network. All the recent missions... from the ones to mars... to the Huygens probe on Titan... to the Deep Impact mission... all of them have churned out the relevant images within HOURS of receiving them from the space craft... so i dunno what crack you are smoking but here in the real world... thats simply not the case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yea well see... there are real conspiracies... like Libor... pharmaceutical company &quot;science&quot;... and then there is simple stupidity....  and this book (which apparently dedicates 200 pages to the investigation of an ancient &quot;water crystal&quot; alien species on the moon?!) seems like an exercise in stupidity... i know quite a few NASA guys and i can tell you... if there was even one inkling of suspicion there was life on that body... everyone one of them would be madly madly involved in checking it out... these people are true pioneers of knowledge... they want to understand their reality... and they devise amazing technological wonders to do that. </p>

<p>And I didn&#39;t say the people on this board smoke crack... you&#39;re in some sort of fantasy group of people... I came on this board... and said you SPECIFICALLY smoke crack... a lot of the people on this board are pretty rational and see the difference between REAL conspiracies... and garbage.</p>

You know quite a few a NASA guys, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d divulge <strong>the most important secrets</strong> because it&#39;s not like the military are involved in NASA in anyway.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s called a conspiracy theory.  Conspiracies aren&#39;t always the ones <strong>you think are believable</strong>.

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re getting at there, or what you mean by &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;external&quot; secrets being &quot;intact&quot;.  Also, I&#39;m not sure what Nazi concentration camps or the Manhattan project has to do with the Curiosity rover?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most Nazis (let alone allies) had no idea that there were concentration camps.  Most people in the US military had idea something like a Manhattan project could even exist. These were massive conspiracies ran from the very top to bottom, and proved to be successful, top to bottom.  The US is the BEST at secrets, as demonstrated by the Cold War.  Since then, intelligence clout has only increased.  The US is proven, capable, and willing to keep secrets so I don&#39;t see why this is such a history lesson for you.  The only thing you&#39;ve demonstrated that you know nothing... about anything.  You just wanted to come and shit on my thread for what reason?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I see the point you are making now. Yes the government is very very skilled at keeping secrets. I mean, they do after all, have a security clearance labelled &quot;TOP SECRET&quot;...  They were very secretive in these times too. They kept a lot of information from the public, and acted in despicable and downright evil ways.  Shameful even.  MK Ultra, Operation Paperclip, Gulf of Tonkin, Special Virus Cancer Program (which has led to the current farce that is HIV/AIDS)...  simply evil. And there is ample, legitimate worrisome evidence to support these conspiracies. </p>

<p>There is, however, not ample evidence to support anything other than the face value for the Mars Rover missions. There is only evidence that these missions are real and that the thousands of men and women that worked on them have succeeded in doing something mankind has never done before. And its simply amazing and should fill every human being with awe... not paranoia and fear. </p>

<p>So I didn&#39;t really come here to shit on your thread... I came on here to maybe try to help you see where you went astray... but your and my arrogance is a bit much and i just digressed into calling you a dumb ass. Oh well Im human, you are too. good luck, i hope you find your path. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could also be a case of NASA throwing a temper tantrum over its budget.  &quot;Oh, you won&#39;t increase our budget?  Ok, then we don&#39;t have enough money to put a decent camera on the lander, then.&quot;
My point is that it wouldnt be prohibitively expensive to do it, but NASA used it as an &#39;opportunity&#39; (see what I did there?) to kick Washington in the shins a bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>to what results specifically are you referring?  using a nonspecific term like &quot;the results&quot; makes it very hard to &quot;absorb the meaning&quot;. in conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I see the point you are making now. Yes the government is very very skilled at keeping secrets. I mean, they do after all, have a security clearance labelled &quot;TOP SECRET&quot;...  They were very secretive in these times too. They kept a lot of information from the public, and acted in despicable and downright evil ways.  Shameful even.  MK Ultra, Operation Paperclip, Gulf of Tonkin, Special Virus Cancer Program (which has led to the current farce that is HIV/AIDS)...  simply evil. And there is ample, legitimate worrisome evidence to support these conspiracies. </p>

<p>There is, however, not ample evidence to support anything other than the face value for the Mars Rover missions. There is only evidence that these missions are real and that the thousands of men and women that worked on them have succeeded in doing something mankind has never done before. And its simply amazing and should fill every human being with awe... not paranoia and fear. </p>

<p>So I didn&#39;t really come here to shit on your thread... I came on here to maybe try to help you see where you went astray... but your and my arrogance is a bit much and i just digressed into calling you a dumb ass. Oh well Im human, you are too. good luck, i hope you find your path. </p>
