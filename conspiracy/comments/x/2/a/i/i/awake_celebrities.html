        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was wondering, how many &quot;awake&quot; celebrities or artists do you know of? The only one I really know of is the frontman of metal band Megadeth. Dave Mustaine&#39;s lyrics have always been about politics, but recently have advocated concepts like FEMA camps, RFID chips, the New World Order, Mind control, and various other events. Here is the lyrics to their most recent album entitled &quot;Endgame&quot;</p>

<p>Endgame lyrics</p>

<p>Attention! Attention!
All citizens are ordered to report to their District detention centers!
Do not return to your homes;
Do not contact anyone!
Do not use any cellular or GPS devices!
Surrender all weapons at once!
Attention! This way to the camps!</p>

<p>I woke up in a black FEMA box
Darkness was all around me, in my coffin
My dreams are all nightmares anymore
And this is what I dream every night</p>

<p>The Leader of the New World Order, the President of the United States
Has declared anyone now residing inside the US of A
Without the RFID chip, you&#39;re just an illegal alien
An enemy combatant of America, welcome to the New World Order</p>

<p>This is the end of the road; 
this is the end of the line
This is the end of your life; 
this is the...</p>

<p>A society in a society, 
inside the fence life as you know it stops
They got their rules of conduct and we got ours
Be quick or be dead, you crumble up and die, 
the clock is
Ticking so slowly and so much can happen in an hour</p>

<p>I learned my lessons the hard way, 
every scar I earned
I had to bleed, inside the day yard
A system of controlled movement, 
like a giant ant farm
Any time is long time, 
now you&#39;re not in charge of your time anymore</p>

<p>The Ex-President signed a secret bill that can
Land a legal US Citizen in jail and the
Patriot act stripped away our constitutional rights
They say a Concentration camp just popped up, yeah, right!</p>

<p>Refuse the chip? Ha! Get persecuted and beat by the
Tyranny of Mind control, for the mark of the beast
All rights removed, you&#39;re punished, captured, and enslaved
Believe me when I say, this is the endgame!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of oldschool and underground rappers are <em>awake</em>. Just to name a few: </p>

<ul>
<li>KRS ONE</li>
<li>Immortal Technique</li>
<li>Hopsin (Total newcommer to me)</li>
<li>Jedi Mind Tricks</li>
<li>NAS (or at least he was awake at a time)</li>
<li>K&#39;Naan</li>
</ul>

<p>There must be much more. 50 Cent might even be on that list, from as far I know he is a pretty successful businessman and knows how the world works. While I don&#39;t like rap that much (regardless of being black), I can&#39;t deny that even rappers like lil wayne, kanye and jayz are somewhat educating the masses about Illuminati, masons and the NWO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have to say Joe Rogan &amp; Billy Corrigan both seem to be awake.  I would also like to say that I think John Lennon almost assuredly was. I also think Bruce Lee may have been as well, at least in how our bodies and minds can be pushed, and how he saw the world (&quot;Be water my friend&quot;). </p>

<p>It kinda goes to the theory that some have, that instead of one &quot;Messiah&quot;, God, or the universe, or fate, or whatever term you choose, sends &quot;Messiahs&quot; periodically to help nudge humanity on.  People who just seem to have a little more wisdom, a little more humanity, usually meeting messy fates, and who&#39;s full affect isn&#39;t really felt until after their death.  Sorry about rambling and run on sentences.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humility">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humility</a></p>

<p><em>The term &quot;humility&quot; comes from the Latin word humilitas, a noun related to the adjective humilis, which may be translated as &quot;humble&quot;, but also as &quot;grounded&quot;, &quot;from the earth&quot;, or &quot;low&quot;, since it derives in turns from humus (earth).

<p>Lupe Fiasco</p>

<p>Excerpt from some one of his songs:</p>

<p>&quot;I really think the war on terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip
9/11 building 7 did they really pull it
Uhh, And a bunch of other cover ups
Your childs future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts then, wait here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that&#39;s on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the uppercrust
You get it then they move it so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV all you see’s a bunch of “what the fucks”
Dude is dating so and so blabbering bout such and such
And that ain&#39;t Jersey Shore, homie that&#39;s the news
And these the same people that supposed to be telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza strip was getting bombed, Obama didn’t say shit
That&#39;s why I ain&#39;t vote for him, next one either
I’ma part of the problem, my problem is I’m peaceful
And I believe in the people.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have any source for B.o.B&#39;s song not being about drugs?</p>

<p>I&#39;m truthfully curious here; because strange clouds could just mean crystal meth..</p>

<p>Half the lyrics in the song are <strong>clearly</strong> about drugs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.directlyrics.com/bob-strange-clouds-lyrics.html">http://www.directlyrics.com/bob-strange-clouds-lyrics.html</a></p>

<p>Have you ever actually seen the lyrics to this?</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re referring to simply the album name (which wouldn&#39;t make sense) but if you are I&#39;d like to hear that theory as well.</p>

<p>I like the Lupe excerpt though - he&#39;s off at times in interviews, but he certainly is &#39;awake&#39; by whatever definition people want to put on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not exactly with that particular song, the overall Album mentions &quot;Strange clouds&quot; in several songs its in those songs he implies he is not human but living a digital world, he also is not going to come out and say what it means when he has cameo artist on a track, he will defiantly say it in songs here he is solo.</p>

<p>another song where he clearly describes a conspiracy is <a href="http://idolator.com/5795142/b-o-b-dr-aden-video">http://idolator.com/5795142/b-o-b-dr-aden-video</a></p>

The first time I paid attention to the lyrics from &quot;wanna be startin&#39; something&quot; I got chills, mostly cause this is a classic that generations have been listening to for years, but I don&#39;t think many of us stop to listen to what he has to say.

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://youtu.be/MX-Ox0MsNBE">Bad Religion - Suffer</a></p>

<p>Album came out in 1988 and is still sadly very relevant.</p>

<p>Mainstream music is controlled by the major record companies.</p>

<p>Bad Religion is part of the punk movement and they were independent until their record label Epitaph signed up to the major labels.</p>

<p>The punk scene in the 80&#39;s was fairly anti-mainstream, anti corporate.</p>

<p>The major labels saw the punk scene as a growing threat so they subverted it by signing some popular bands like Nirvana &amp; Green Day and killed the anti-corporate message.</p>

<p>They did the same thing with metal and hip hop too. Any popular &#39;street&#39; genre is marketable and easily bought up, repackaged, and commercialized.</p>

<p>Early rap was socially conscious but got taken over, had the message changed, and then used to exploit the genre and black people en mass by pushing the gangsta image and a whole bunch of bad stereotypes that young people grew up accepting as truthisms.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what MTV says, a pimp isn&#39;t a good role model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think celebrities are a pretty bad cohort to think of being &quot;awake&quot; as most of them work in the Hollywood/Zionist system. But probably the best example of an &quot;awake&quot; celebrity would be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHpsiSSNapQ">Dave Chappelle</a>.</p>

<p>Some people think Russell Brand is &quot;awake&quot;, although im never sure when he&#39;s serious. </p>

<p>In the music industry, id say Rage Against the Machine were pretty vocal about their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_views_and_activism_of_Rage_Against_the_Machine#Iraq_War.2C_Fox_News.2C_and_the_.22assassination.22_comments_controversy">views</a>.</p>

<p>Also, check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowkey">Lowkey</a> , he is really vocal about his views and is very anti-zionist, his 2nd album <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack_to_the_Struggle">is pretty good</a> and mainly focuses on Israel, terrorism and the Obama administration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting that you mention Russel Brand because I believe his Ex-Wife, Katie Perry, was very much into conspiracy.  Everyone talks about E.T. as a song with serious occult and new age overtones, but her other songs &quot;Wide Awake&quot;, &quot;Firework&quot;, and especially &quot;Pearl&quot; have serious connections to individuals&#39; greater powers in the force of tyranny and almost are all about the suppression of (sacred) femininity (specifically feminine energy).  </p>

<p>The Pearl speaks a lot to how the world has been duped into masculine ways of doing things, blocking out creativity and self-expression that could otherwise be used as a force far greater than anything that is currently allowed by TPTB. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kabbalah is the mystical pillar of Judaism although like all non-literal traditions it is not confined to a religion. In Christianity it is Cabala in Islamic tradition it is Quabbala.</p>

<p>The basic premise like all mystical approaches like Sufism and Gnosticism is that we are microcosms of the universe and of the divine. Holographic components of a holographic universe. The route to awakening is within us and everything around us is divine. Therefore there is no need of religious institutions.</p>

<p>Kabbalah provides concrete algorythms for raising consciousness up and down the levels. One key point being is that each level is holy. It does not put the material as evil. </p>

<p>The material is one plane of exitence (Malkuth). In order to progress the aim is to bring the different planes from physical to pure light into a complete integration. In otherwords raise the material to the spiritual and the spiritual to the material. </p>

<p>For example washing the floor or eating an apple can become a form of prayer.</p>

<p>The Tree of life is a map of the holographic universe. It represents the body, the universe, and everything else. You can apply it to how to run a school or how to approach a science question.</p>

<p>So Kabbalah is the tradition, being estoteric (open source) no one owns how it is to be used. The tree of life is the fundamental map. Rather than a book that encourages literal interpretation and therefore stuck in bi-polar views it is a multi-dimensional tool that requires you to fill in the gaps using your conscious and unconscious, your will and your submission, your strength and your weakness, knowlege and innocence.</p>
