        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">50</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../user/exopolitiko.html">exopolitiko</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been following the claims of mass arrests being made by Wilcock and Fulford and the rest. I must say, this LIBOR scandal is the first real-world event that has made me feel that there could actually be reality to this mass arrest thing. </p>

<p>It never made sense that white hat insiders would show their cards by telling everyone following alternative news that they were about to make a move against the Cabal, but perhaps there were never going to be arrests first, it was just a way of communicating that the Department of Justice was about to crack the LIBOR scandal wide open.</p>

<p>Recent analysis done by a team of scientists using a supercomputer in Switzerland has revealed that a small group of investment banks ultimately control 80% of the money there is to be earned in the world through a web of interconnected trans-national companies. Where before there was speculation or intuition, now there is mathematical proof that these rate manipulators are in control of everything -- the clothes you wear, the food you eat . . . everything comes from them, and now there is proof. It&#39;s truly the stuff of nightmares if you haven&#39;t already had this realization, but it&#39;s important to acknowledge.</p>

<p>I recommend each and every one of you read this article by David Wilcock. This article does a great job of laying out the narrative so far and why the uncovering of LIBOR manipulation is such an encouraging event toward the ultimate goal of freeing humanity from the control matrix we currently inhabit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on this scandal and the rest that has happened we a citizens of the free United States have a right and duty to walk away from ALL debt this year. As the LIBOR scandal continues to get attention worldwide our collective non payment will break the system.
The corrupt banks and the cabal will have no answers.
What can they do at this point? Go to court to sue us to get their money obtained by blatant fraud?

    <div class="md"><p>yes, it is.</p>

<p>it may have kept your rates lower, but it stole from pensions and cities.</p>

<p>keep in mind that bankers get richer at a rate much higher than you. so the longer they can convince you that the system is legitimate (like by depressing precious metal prices), they can scoop up all the real resources like land. even if you get richer off it, they get richer way way way faster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pensions and cities do collect payments and interest based in labor, but they also borrow money and settle derivatives on the other end, and make payments to others based on libor.</p>

<p>Also, why misreport libor if maintaining a false stability in the overall system were the primary concern?  Misreporting damages the credibility of the overall system to bolster individual banks in the short term.</p>

<p>If the point is lower metals prices, why not simply misreport lower metals prices?  Not sure what your point  is there.  It seems odd you would cite a fairly complicated market pricing relationship to help prove that markets are not legitimate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because if they reported real rates, the whole thing would collapse. plus they&#39;re greedy. it&#39;s the same reason they&#39;re doing QE ad infinitum. it&#39;s between a crash now, and a worse crash later but they get to make off with the loot in the meantime. is it really that surprising?</p>

<p>and you can&#39;t just &quot;misreport&quot; metal prices. you have to actually sell them at that low rate. the point is to prevent flight from the dollar. so jp morgan is losing a ton of money right now selling silver for less than it&#39;s worth.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>what do you mean by &quot;the whole thing?&quot;
do you mean the scheme to bolster individual firm&#39;s reputation?   Yes, of course their scheme would fail if they did not engage in it, how is that relevant?</p>

<p>Or did you mean some broader financial system?  Because not only have rates been higher in the past without collapse, now that the fraud is uncovered, rates have no choice but to converge on real rates.  Are you suggesting a crash directly related to libor rates is imminent?  I would like to know more, as i sense a great financial opportunity&gt;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and you can&#39;t just &quot;misreport&quot; metal prices. you have to actually sell them at that low rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that&#39;s my point.  On the one hand you&#39;re suggesting a conspiracy to manipulate rates in a roundabout way to affect metals prices, while on the other, you insist that not only do they not have the power manipulate metals prices, but also that in this particular industry the market is working correctly and without fraud.</p>

<p>you&#39;re proposing a relationship between libor, metals prices, and the value of the dollar.  that&#39;s fine.  Now that the manipulation has been exposed, your logic would dictate that there should be a flight from the dollar.</p>

<p>Where is it?</p>

<p>so, your theory is unfalsifiable?  The failure of the single predictive portion of your theory is due to how awesomely connected the conspiracy is?</p>

<p>okelydokely.  I&#39;m trying really hard to have an open mind, but so far you&#39;ve provided a theory no more convincing and much more elaborate than &quot;guys wanted to make themselves look better&quot; and absolutely no predictive value whatsoever.</p>

<p>this does not jive with your statements.  libor is reported rates, not actual rates.  this is an exception.  in your own arguments, you seem to accept that market rates are accurate and not open to fraud.</p>

<p>So what other non-market rates are you talking about, these ones that, had they not been fraudulent, would have brought down the world economy?</p>

<p>i dunno, you were the one insisting that my suggesting it would be easier to directly set fraudulent metals prices rather than the convoluted path of manipulating them through LIBOR, was wrong because you can&#39;t fix metals prices.</p>

<p>so give me some examples and walk me through the process.  You&#39;ve obviously thought about this.  let&#39;s see it if makes sense.</p>

<p>again, i&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re trying to say.  My opinion is that your theory needs deeper exploration and analysis, which you apparently refuse to indulge.  it&#39;s inevitable that if your opinions is worthless, so is mine...</p>

<p>ok i&#39;m not suggesting that LIBOR and metals are related in any way other than they both allow the parasites a few more months to accumulate and hopefully bribe their way out of accountability.</p>

<p>again, your point was that it is not a conspiracy. i am saying it is for reasons A, B, and C. i linked an article that describes many ways that wealth is extracted. if you can&#39;t find it let me know and i&#39;ll link it again. it&#39;s not long, and comes with sources.</p>

<p>i agree that deeper exploration and analysis is always a good thing. </p>

<p>nevermind, i&#39;ll just link it again.</p>

<p>well then i messed up my communication.  i have no reason to state that outright.  i can only critique your stated reasons.</p>

<p>So, back to libor.  I am still unclear how a marginally lower libor actually helps perpetuate a larger fraudulent system, stability or otherwise.  if there is a conspiracy, an artificially lower libor seems to be working at cross-purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>capitalism is insidious like that. to paraphrase adam smith, all you need are a bunch of greedy people, and the invisible hand does the work. </p>

<p>that is, this conspiracy is like a school of piranhas. they don&#39;t need to have meetings and plot schemes, they all just share motives and opportunities. </p>

<p>there is no one saying &quot;let&#39;s rig LIBOR to protect the system&quot;, they just say &quot;hey will you help me rig this one thing to help me personally&quot;. the effect however is the same as if they all had a big meeting. the big players do all the bribing and the little guys make the problems so rampant that no one can get caught. check out the link i posted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So now i&#39;m confused.  All signs point to rigging libor being bad for the system.</p>

<p>Your explanation is now that through individual acts that seeks to harm the system, the system is actually helped? </p>

<p>That makes no sense at all.  And i&#39;m not going to check out the link.  i hate it when people link articles or youtube videos to support a logical framework rather than for fact-checking.  If your understanding of your own argument is so poor you cannot explain it simply in your own words, maybe you should take a closer look, is what i always say.</p>

<p>either i&#39;m terrible at communication or you&#39;re terrible at reading comprehension.  I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt.  You can use outside sources to prove a fact.  You should not need it to explicate your own logical framework.  To ask you to stick to your own words is not inconsistent with wanting to analyze your ideas.  Frankly, it&#39;s better, who knows if my interpretation of other people&#39;s words is the same as yours?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>don&#39;t be silly, i have at least a rudimentary understanding of how these swaps work.  ordinary people aren&#39;t engaging in interest rate swaps.   this is moving value from one bank to another.  it does nothing to support the idea that libor actually helped the system overall.  I stand by my statement that lower libor rates did not create more value for the system, but less.</p>

<p>it&#39;s not arbitrary just because you don&#39;t like it.  It&#39;s entirely reasonable and serves a purpose, which i mentioned, unless you can argue otherwise.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t care or I&#39;m not curious.  I&#39;m not letting you off the hook for making a logical argument simply by pointing to an article--which, by the way, it turns out is irrelevant to your argument.  Asking you to do your own work is not the same thing as being closed-minded.  Frankly, i&#39;m still open to the idea that there was a conspiracy to manipulate libor for greater purposes than bolstering individual firms.  It&#39;s simply that after all this time, you&#39;ve failed to provide any evidence, including the above.  But i&#39;m patient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah ok, I mustve missed something.  Lets start over.</p>

<p>Libor fraud happened.  Official story is that it was to support individual firm reputation.  Add to that the possibility to making a profit via transfers between banks.</p>

<p>This much we agree on. </p>

<p>Your suggest further that libor manipulation was is actually part of a larger conspiracy to move money from regular people into the financial system and ultimately to those that control the banks.</p>

<p>My understanding of how libor works and was manipulated suggest the opposite was true, it actually created less value for banks over the medium and short run.</p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>capitalism is sorta like a pyramid scheme. the motive (individual greed) and rules (anything goes due to bribes) are the only thing set out in advance. the oligarchs know what will happen if given the right circumstances, so all they need to do is create those circumstances with bribes and infiltration and so forth. then, the inherent incentives of capitalism create booms and busts. in each boom people with real resources invest those real resources in this pyramid scheme. when the bust happens, the banks scoop up all the real resources like houses. fixing the libor is an action that they knew would occur if given the right circumstances. so to the people actually committing the crime, the conspiracy doesn&#39;t go any higher than their co-conspirator peers and the motive is simple greed. but to the oligarchs who paid the bribes, financed the campaigns, and picked the regulators, fixing libor down and keeping metal prices down and all these other things that look like simple isolated cases of greed are actually part of a long game in which systematically real resources are mixed with bullshit, then bought by the banks at bullshit prices. </p>

<p>a good example of this happened during the napoleonic war. the rothschild family in england told everyone that napoleon had won the battle of waterloo. the market crashed and they were able to consolidate their power by buying up their competitors at fire sale prices. then when people found out that napoleon lost, the resources went back to their actual value. something similar is happening with the housing crisis. </p>

<p>to reiterate, rate fixing is just one part of a well-documented pattern of creating and prolonging fake booms so as to clean up when the bust hits. this is the extraction phase of that cycle, so the longer they can keep the current regime together (not rioting, seceding, etc.) the more austerity measures they can impose, and the more real resources they can extract in exchange for their fraudulent paperwork.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I understand: libor fixing, insofar as it happened within a capitalist system, was therefore necessarily part of a larger conspiracy because capitalism itself is a conspiracy, regardless of whether it proximately furthered the goals of he conspiracy, it ultimately does so because of the greater structure in which it was perpetuated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>capitalism is more like the framework that will necessarily sprout monopolies and trusts. the conspiracy is comprised of a number of players who would be the trotsky killing stalinists if they were born in another time and place- psychopaths.</p>

<p>so lloyd blankfein and larry summers and all these people much higher up are where the actual conspiracy occurs. that&#39;s where they decide who to bribe and who to pick as regulators. they know that if the bribes are in place, libor will fix itself, bad mortgages will be made, ratings agencies can be bought and made to entice investors to buy crap, all based on the incentives and lack of disincentives that they provide. all these things are necessary to create the boom, and reap the bust. republicans deregulate, democrats impose the bipartisan stimulus/austerity measures, over and over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I think the LIBOR scandal along with <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com//news/europe/2012/07/2012722145418435676.html">the recent news of the $32 trillion held by the financial elite in untaxable offshore bank accounts</a> (that could have generated $280 billion in tax revenue) are signs that there seems to be a battle going on behind the scenes here. There&#39;s no way these stories would have shown up in the mainstream media otherwise, unless the elite were losing their grip.</p>

<p>Edit: The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/24/audit-the-fed-bill-on-tra_n_1698062.html">bill to audit the Federal Reserve</a> is up for vote tomorrow (July 25th). If this passes, and it looks like just might, then we will see much more truth come out about what has really been going on behind closed doors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, not a bad point, but I don&#39;t think anyone has been talking about this for longer than a year or less. Fulford has been talking about the lawsuit and how the Cabal is &quot;losing&quot; for years, but the mass arrest meme is relatively new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh? Wilcock was recorded (as far as I remember back, maybe even farther back as I admit I haven&#39;t really been keeping track of anything Wilcock/Fulford have said prior to then) saying there would be mass arrests in 2009.. And I remember then a thread about how he had already previously been predicting it.</p>

<p>So anything he said beforehand is just discarded since he has &quot;evidence&quot; that shit is about to hit the fan?</p>

<p>Did you switch Reddit accounts or something? As I don&#39;t recognize your username at all and you&#39;re saying that &quot;You&#39;re referring to x&quot; unless you&#39;re trying to say that you&#39;re referring to the beginning of your post, with the end of your post? </p>

<p>Keep in mind they always label their predictions with &quot;Soon&quot; to just clarify they can&#39;t be wrong. This is how they keep people interested, as opposed to Drake who&#39;s just immediately wrong the second that time passes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just really hard for me to defend someone like Wilcock/Fulford and guys like Icke given their track record.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhh... chill out?</p>

<p>I&#39;m a shill for questioning someone? That&#39;s a new definition of shill to me.</p>

<p>Wilcock has been making &#39;Soon&#39; predictions for three years, so I am just curious why all of that is just swept under the rug since there&#39;s now &quot;evidence&quot; (I put it in quotes, the same as the person I&#39;m replying to does)</p>

<p>Regardless, you really need to take a breather.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> isn&#39;t synonymous with believing anything put in front of your face, if anything, it&#39;s the opposite. </p>

<p>Being a conspiracy theorist is searching for the truth, not just the truth how it sounds best to you.</p>
