       Rampant paranoid speculation isn't enough proof?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the logic is there.  The elites have all the political power, and wealth, so obviously they'd rather use free energy than relying on the convenience of current energy grids.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like it would be more expensive to develop, maintain, and hide these "free energy" plants than it would be to just use the existing systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit:
       </strong>
       And to put it another way, if the elites already control the world like a puppet, aren't existing power sources already free for them?

       for the sake of this post lets assume also that free/zero-point energy is easier to manage, much smaller units. Like pocket size, batteries that last too long are bad for business - clearly..
      </p>
      <p>
       That gives it another light. The oil industry has trillions of dollars to lose should such tech be available - thus motive to do whatever they can to suppress it. As do battery manufacturers, etc.

       It doesn't work that way. And the reason it doesn't work that way is because there's always more money to be made from exploiting a new technology than suppressing it.

       And the second there is a lick of evidence to show this is true, I'll happily agree.  In the mean time it's just people sitting around fantasizing about how evil the elite are.

       Tesla built 2 towers, one in Colorado and the other in New York. 
These were free energy machines. Pick up almost any book about Tesla 
and they have pictures,partial plans, &amp; decriptions of these towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once his investors got wind of what he was working on they pulled the financing and tore the towers down. The plans for the towers are most likely still around but hidden somewhere so I would say the technology
exists but is being suppressed. I doubt it has been developed for a chosen few because by its nature it would be free for anyone who happened to be nearby.

       I don't know, it's just a little convenient to say of course they do, because it makes sense... Free energy in the conventional sense would be for energy what the internet was for communication. I just find it hard to believe they'd be able to hide it

       Anyone who has spent even a minimal amount of time researching alternative energy devices will be able to tell you of the high correlation between being an inventor of a revolutionary energy creating device and being silenced, bought out or dying in a freak accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US Government can seize any patent if it produces energy too efficiently based on the interests of "National Security". Now why would they have legislation like that in place?
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to reflect on things from an objective point of view, and as always, follow the money. Tesla could make energy for free 100 years ago. What are the chances no one else has done it since?

       HAARP is not the same thing as free energy. HAARP is composed of many microwave dishes that beam energy into the ionosphere. All recognized scientific techniques and instruments - no mysterious "free" energy there.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it seems unlikely that the elites could discovery the science behind "free" energy and not have other scientists replicate the work - the elite have undoubtedly hampered free/cheap energy tech. (eg: electric car, Pons-Fleischmann)

       HAARP Requires billions of watts of energy. If this is coming from satellites then there needs to be some huge energy source powering them. If it's coming from earth then there's gotta be a way to hide the huge energy changes in the grid. Or perhaps they're all just running off the grid on something else? Either way this thread is really provoking 2 questions.

       I remember there being a large natural gas deposit up there but the size of the resource and it's remoteness make it prohibitive to use the gas for a city or anything (think super long pipeline).  So they built haarp right by it so they could use the energy from the natural gas and test out their science experiment.

According to Ukrainian TV, the base is now defunct and handed over to the Ministry of Emergencies. The rusting iron superstructures of the station are being considered for dismantling over the fears of their accidental collapse which would cause a microearthquake damaging the radioactive storage in the area.
Located two kilometers from the surface area of Chernobyl-2 is a large underground complex that was used for anti-missile defense, space surveillance and communication, and research.[47] Military units were stationed there

        The experimental procedure was intended to run as follows:
The reactor was to be running at a low power level, between 700 MW and 800 MW.
The steam-turbine generator was to be run up to full speed.
When these conditions were achieved, the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off.
Turbine generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically.
After the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage, the turbine generator would be allowed to freewheel down.

       Russian Woodpecker and haarp are both big antennas.

       Russian Woodpecker has nuclear power plant for energy (we are talking about free energy?).

       From your link:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are several HF transmitters located throughout the world which conduct research similar to that proposed by HAARP. However, no facility, located either in the U.S. or elsewhere, has the transmitting capability needed to address the broad range of research goals which HAARP proposes to study. The most capable HF transmitters currently operating are located in Russia and Norway and have effective radiated powers (ERP) of roughly one billion watts (1 gigawatt). One gigawatt of ERP represents an important threshold power level, allowing significant radio wave generation and analysis of key ionospheric phenomena. The HAARP facility is designed to have an ERP above one gigawatt. This would elevate the United States to owning and operating the world's most capable ionospheric research instrument.

       Not likely. I mean its not like they control all the scientists or that only they have scientists that can create unlimited energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think its possible to create unlimited energy, I think its possible to find/create huge long lasting energy, you know like nuclear fusion and stuff, but I think we are at least 30-40 years from that.

       Free-energy is a commonly used phrase to describe unlimited energy.

      <p>
       Many physicists believe a unified field theory contains the key to unlocking unlimited energy from "empty" space.

       i don't think they have one i think they probably have a few cures to a few diseases. probably have way more nukes and nuke shelters than we are lead to believe but everything i know says there is no free energy maybe they perfected Thorium technology which i firmly believe they are deliberately keeping from the masses so we have to buy there expensive fossil fuels.

       There is too a way to get free energy, and this was discovered in the early 1900's. The man that discovered this is named Nikola Tesla. He also happens to be the one that designed the first blueprints for a facility like HAARP. however once his idea for free, unlimited energy started getting out, Tesla was shut down. I think by the government elite, because free energy means less control over the sheeple. So I'm sure they use "free energy" for themselves instead.

       As far as I know there's no "law" saying we can't gather large amounts of free energy. "Unlimited" is a stretch, I see the problem there. However, Tesla had blueprints built for the device that would harness this energy, if I remember correctly it used the earth itself as basis for collecting the energy. He claimed he could gather SO much energy, he could literally steer the earth as if it were a huge space ship. However these blueprints mysteriously disappeared and Tesla went bankrupt while Edison stole a vast majority of his inventions.

       Free energy is almost certainly in use, but you won't find it in some Bilderberger's mansion in Switzerland to keep the lights burning and the 100" TV switched on.  More likely it's being used in secret weapons projects, clandestine laboratories and research programs - might even be used as some kind of vehicular fuel source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, "free energy"?  Are you talking about some kind of Tesla type thing or something more conventional like solar power or hydroelectric systems?

       Current in a superconducting wire still encounters some, minimal resistance.  It still causes the release of a very small amount of heat (the second law is an iron law of the universe).  In order for this heat to not bring the wire back above the critical temperature the wire has to be constantly cooled.  There is no free energy there, no violation of entropy.
