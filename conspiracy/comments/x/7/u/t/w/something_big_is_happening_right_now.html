       I was on 4chan when threads started exploding all over about UN vote to ban guns in the United states.  The resolution stalled in the senate right before the Aurora shooting happened and now that its up for vote again it is likely to pass which will means most or all semi-auto weapons will be confiscated.  apparently when anon found out about it the website was freezed (no posts can be made and all gun ban threads have been deleted)
      </p>
      <p>
       i also see zero coverage of the bill in any media outlet except infowars and a little blurb in RT
      </p>
      <p>
       is the bill being voted on now or in the next day or two?

       I like a good conspiracy as much as the next guy but how could a UN vote on anything overturn the second amendment.  There are only three ways I can think of to get rid of the second amendment.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The united states of American ceases to exist.
       </li>
       <li>
        We repeal the second amendment.
       </li>
       <li>
        The supreme court of the United States dramatically changes the why they interpret the meaning of the second amendment.

       They don't care, don't you understand? TSA sexually molesting people at the airports isn't constitutional, warantless searches aren't constitutional, spying and wiretapping aren't constitutional, obamacare isn't constitutional, banning assault and bigger weapons isn't constitutional, having to follow regulations isn't constitutional, they just do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one will protect you, not the courts, not the congress, not the supreme court, all these unconstitutional bills are being carried out.

       You've heard of the
       <em>
        boiling
       </em>
       <em>
        frog
       </em>
       anecdote, no doubt? The premise is that if a frog is placed in boiling water, it will jump out, but if it is placed in cold water that is slowly heated, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. It's a fitting analogy to your comment.

       Just because I believe we have rights doesn't mean I am ignorant as to what is going on around me. I know things are changing and rights are being taken away in the name of "safety", but that has been going on ever since our country has been founded. Until something cataclysmic happens I will continue to hold onto the belief that our government is looking out for our best interests as an entire nation. That being said I am still skeptical of things that have been done and are being done across the country and the world. Which is why I'm here to begin with.

       We no longer have enough reason to be even hopeful that this country and the powers that be will work in our best interest.  We don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naivety is stupid, but even hope at this point that somehow we as a citizenry don't have to do much of anything and somehow all the wrongs that are happening will somehow right themselves is 100%
       <em>
        not viable
       </em>
       any longer either.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're at the point where we don't have to sit and wait for the shit to hit the fan.  The shit has already
       <em>
        begun
       </em>
       hitting the fan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is that it's going to get a lot worse.  You have to ask yourself where will we be as a citizenry when it does finally get even worse?

       Im sorry, if you have really done research there is no way you can claim the government has our best interests at heart, the interests of the government are those of the bankers and the multinational corporations
       <em>
        because they are the same fucking people
       </em>
       . Cunts like Cheney effortlessly glide between halliburton and government, Obamney has more Goldman Sachs bankser scum on his board then anyone before him.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you seriously claim the iraq war or ANY of these fucking wars are in the interests of the american people? This would mean that the policy makers in the US are mentally retarded, which unfortunately they are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only people that profit from almost ALL major american policies are
      </p>
      <p>
       A) the clusterfuck of weapons manufacturers nestled comfortably underneath the pentagon, being gorged on a monstrous stream of our money
      </p>

       B) the fucking banker scum that also are fed a
       <em>
        disgusting
       </em>
       diet of fiat $, only to rape the american people again for the third time in the last hundred years
      </p>

       C)all the fucking perpetrators that profit from the drug war, be that Big pharma, private prisons, LE etc.

       So you think that a sarcastic and condescending "fascinating" response is warranted when someone says and feels that the ruling class have all but taken over this country and this world and are doing things to it (and us) that are NOT in its (and our) best interest?

       how about a slow grind? like, you ever try to machine something? on a mill? if you go full depth all at once, reasoning here that you need to make a pretty significant change, you either shatter the bit, or throw the piece.. you have to mill off just as much as you can at a time, too fast and the piece damages the machine, or throws the work right back at you.. too slow and you'll miss the deadline..
      </p>
      <p>
       the funny thing about both beck and gore is that they were/are pretty wrong timing wise, but their core logic is pretty sound when it comes to the overall(in my understanding, gore pointing out that humans effect their environment on a grand scale, beck that governments with a fiat currency will graft away until obsolescence) .. not that I really think either has anything but a demographic to hustle, but whatever, of no consequence.

       I disagree. I think this is a case of the slippery slope argument where people insist that if something bad happens it'll just get worse over time (forever, seemingly). In medieval times we would have all been peasants, and although some of you may hyperbolically argue that we still are (because you don't have the rocket-powered jet car that some billionaire has), I'd say the human condition has improved vastly over time.

       Very well said! The list in your last paragraph is right on point. We need to learn how to express our volition and seek out what we can find as true-living, based on our ability to seek our and make obsolete, the contradictions around us.

       I agree the wars are mass murder, but I meant of our own people within our own borders. We've been going to wars since this country was founded and people have always been dying. What we haven't had are mass murders of our own people by our own government.(I know people will say 9/11, but I am not entirely convinced that was us. Though I know a lot of things don't add up.)

       The only people I believe are really wrongly imprisoned are non-violent drug offenders, the rest of the people in prison are there for reasons that are completely legitimate.

       Even the IRS, Department of Education, Census, and a few other entities have purchased firearms with their budgets, especially shotguns. The FBI purchased several Anzio Ironworks 20x102mm cannons; the first of which was set to FY 2010:

       No disrespect whatsoever, as I think you have sound points, but what I think you're missing is how devious and underhanded TPTB can be and are.  I mean, afterall, the constitution of the U.S. has already been all but stripped and raped as it stands.  I don't think that the 2nd amendment is something that would be beneath TPTB to at least
       <em>
        attempt
       </em>
       to undermine and do away with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think before anyone assumes the OP is simply to outlandish to be true or real, I think we need to realize that it's much better to be mindful and watchful of something like what OP posted to be a reality first.  Better safe than sorry I say.

       I heard they are trying to now translate the 2nd amendment as anyone in a "well regulated Militia" (quote from Bill of Rights).  In this manner, they could begin using loose-language to 'define' certain new parameters.

       Under the Militia Act of 1903, every able-bodied man of at least 17 and under 45 years of age who are not members of the National Guard or Naval Militia.(that is, anyone who would be eligible for a draft). Former members of the armed forces up to age 65 are also considered part of the "unorganized militia" per Sec 313 Title 32 of the US Code.

       a story about it was reported on, and discussed briefly, on FNC's special report yesterday... iran is one of 15 countries on some sort of advisory panel and our president supports it. the bill will likely die in congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT - the bill would not allow the UN to take any weapons, the purchases would just need to be documented in a big UN database that would not include any weapons used by hezbolah, hamas, the crips, north korea, or anyone else that already does, and will continue to run afoul of national and international law.

      <p>
       "That the people have a right to keep and bear arms; that a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defence of a free state; that standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided, as far as the circumstances and protection of the community will admit; and that, in all cases, the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power."

       we are under global government now wether you like it or not, it's just not official yet. A gunban will be devastating in the usa, since the only people that will get a hold of guns then will be criminals and the fasci police. Normal people will have to shoot with bows and arrows, is that what you want?

       Glenn Beck's job actually was to copy Alex Jones but try to put a neocon spin on it. He had to try it because the alternative media was so popular and the TV networks are so unpopular. It didn't work to well, because people that get started with Alex Jones ned up migrating to other alternative media like The Daily Bell, antiwar.com,Land Destroyer blog , Corbett report, What really happened etc.

       states and municipalities are free to create and interpret their own laws as long as it is NOT unconstitutional. With little exception, the Supreme Court's 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller upheld the 2nd amendment to a degree that an individual's right to keep and bear arms SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED. The problems have been in the legalistas determining what infringement entails, and politicians just flat out ignoring it as in Washington DC- another city with draconian laws against defense or even owning a firearm yet among the top cities for firearm crime.

       Is there somewhere to actually read this treaty? If so, then that could answer some questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And from what I have read, the Senate still does not have the necessary support to be ratified, so I don't know where you get the claim that it is "likely to pass" all of a sudden.

       Why are Americans so interested in being able to possess a firearm? Honestly? I live in Canada ( previously in 2 other European countries) no one ha access to guns, and se also had far less fatalities and murders  because of it. Not only that, large shootings and massacres are very rare if not almost non-existent.

       Mass shooting in Toronto? One man was dead, and he was targeted and involved within the gang scene in the area. I think that's a completely different scenario than this. Again, Canada,Europe, Australia, New Zealand , etc, all have thriving societies and very few of those countries have to deal with gun related violence.When it does happen its 90+% of the time related to illegal activity such as gangs and robberies. Most US Citizens own guns, but I don't see a decrease in gang activity and gun related violence there just because people are "protected". It doesn't add up to me.

       My reading about the jewish ghettos in Germany and about Cambodia undert the Kissinger/Brzezinski supported Khmer Rouge are two of the main reasons I am concerned about increasingly corrupt governments trying to take away the guns of their people.

       I can understand how people ignorant of history and naive about the true nature of governemnt would be pro-gun control. please study and try to develop your powers of empathy.

       Glenn Beck's job actually was to copy Alex Jones but try to put a neocon spin on it. He had to try it because the alternative media was so popular and the TV networks are so unpopular. It didn't work to well, because people that get started with Alex Jones ned up migrating to other alternative media like The Daily Bell, antiwar.com,Land Destroyer blog , Corbett report, What really happened etc.

       The internet reformation is underway and their isn't much TPTB can do about it but try to take over the internet...and so far that has failed thankfully.

       meh, civil war will happen if they try to go through with this, and it will be ugly, considering how polarized the field is.
