       For me it was my Grandfather and Dad, My grandfather was in WW2 and always told me “Don’t believe what you read about WW2, It was different from what I saw to what I read and heard when I got home". From my Dad it was about WW2, Aliens and JFK. I used to think they were off their rocker, until I was 12 and the "Waco siege" happened. The news had all these reports of what was inside, and then after it was over and it was different story. At that point I was finally understand by what they meant by official stories always change when they need them too.

       Osama bin Laden could have pulled it off with his CIA training. The kicker for me is WTC #7. Fires collapsed that building demolition style. I'm not buying it.

       For me it was the educational system. "Go to school, learn these things, go to College buy these books, accept your debt, get married, buy this house, keep buying the newest car, stay in debt, might as well have a kid, spend the rest of your life working". For god's sake damn near all knowledge that can be learned is free for all on the internet. Before that we had libraries that were free. I have found I enjoy learning when I can decide what it is I am interested in, and I dislike learning when I am told what I
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       learn. Hell school doesn't even teach you how to balance your own check-book. This is USEFUL info in my opinion. I kinda learned at a young age I had been lied to, so every time I was told "how the world works" I get suspicious unless I can confirm or deny it myself.

       THIS! it such a shame that money, the thing nearly everyone on this planet use, is not taugh at school. I know economics and stuff is, but never has a school taught students how to manage their own finances.

       The movie JFK piqued my interest back when it first came out. The obvious lie that is the official story confirmed to me that governments will, and do lie.
       <br/>
       But 9/11 brought everything into focus. This was here and now, not something that happened before I was born.

       That, and I've always had an interest in UFO's and the possibility of alien existence/visitation.

       I live in NYC and was 11 when 9/11 happened, a few years later I felt the viel fall and started to question how we got to this point. The fact that it happened in my city and affected people I know only made the truth seem that more important to find.

       9/11 and watching Loose Change a decade ago really changed my view on things. Even though I watched the movie as a skeptic at first, by the end I was pretty sure that at least a good chunk of that information was accurate and how ridiculous it is to believe that a guy would pull all that off without getting caught beforehand.

       A friend taught me to question everything and to know your rights as most of the time cops will use very dirty tricks such as the clever "Do you know why I pulled you over?" The moment you admit you were speeding..bang no longer innocent until proven guilty because you admitted wrong doing.

       I got interested in the illuminati from watching music videos..one thing led to another and I got really obsessed with researching illuminati. Then I came across 9/11 conspiracies and that sealed the deal for me.
