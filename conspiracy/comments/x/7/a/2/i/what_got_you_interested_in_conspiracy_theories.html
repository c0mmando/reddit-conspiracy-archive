    <div class="md"><p>For me it was the educational system. &quot;Go to school, learn these things, go to College buy these books, accept your debt, get married, buy this house, keep buying the newest car, stay in debt, might as well have a kid, spend the rest of your life working&quot;. For god&#39;s sake damn near all knowledge that can be learned is free for all on the internet. Before that we had libraries that were free. I have found I enjoy learning when I can decide what it is I am interested in, and I dislike learning when I am told what I <em>should</em> learn. Hell school doesn&#39;t even teach you how to balance your own check-book. This is USEFUL info in my opinion. I kinda learned at a young age I had been lied to, so every time I was told &quot;how the world works&quot; I get suspicious unless I can confirm or deny it myself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The movie JFK piqued my interest back when it first came out. The obvious lie that is the official story confirmed to me that governments will, and do lie.<br/>
But 9/11 brought everything into focus. This was here and now, not something that happened before I was born.             </p>

<p>That, and I&#39;ve always had an interest in UFO&#39;s and the possibility of alien existence/visitation.</p>
