    <div class="md"><p>Main stream implies that it is information broadcast on the major media news outlets. The mainstream media has gone from dozens of smaller owners down to 5 or 6 owners. This consolidation of the media has turned mainstream news outlets into the bullhorn of the largest corporations. Many of these large corporations are doing things which are harmful to the average citizen but beneficial to their bottom line. The end result is the news you hear on CNN is deemed acceptable and will not anger or offend the folks at head office.</p>

<p>I think many people are realizing MSM, in general, is the news source with an agenda and major filtration. You seem to imply that a fact must be accepted and broadcast by a corrupt, self serving media outlet to be considered accurate. If this is part of your platform of approval for something being legitimate or not, I would suggest there is something seriously wrong with your platform and litmus test.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t a conspiracy theory: &quot;A secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing secret about Israel invading [insert name of neighboring country here].  Nor do they claim they are doing it for humanitarian reasons.</p>

<p>These wars are wrong, and illegal, and offensive, but not conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the conspiracy is not in the event of war itself (and it always is) it is in the <em>way</em> the events take place. Faking attacks by Hamas and then retaliating, I say would qualify as secretly doing unlawful things and then doing even more unlawful things as a response.</p>

<p>Every war in US history has been planned, in advance, by a small number of wealthy individuals.</p>

<p>edit: To clarify WWI, WWII it was our <em>entry into the war</em> that was planned in advance. And propaganda was used to stir up nationalistic sentiment just like always.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to do your own research and use google. If you don&#39;t know where to start - here a few terms you can try. Behind each term stands also a conspiracy. Many of these conspiracies are IMHO either reported as a limited hangout, or almost totally underreported. But all have been confirmed by trials, Senate/Congress-Hearings or official reports.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion yes. Not one with a great impact, but the cover up was not done by one men alone. It was a conspiracy to mislead the public and Tillman&#39;s relatives. There are still some questions why and how he was killed. Like the Jessica Lynch story, his tragedy was used by the PR machine of the Pentagon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>as someone who is genuinely interested in the responses to this question, in my opinion is not trying to discredit the subredit, but find out what &quot;conspiracies&quot; the &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; believe to the true or false.</p>

<p>we all know here that many of the news outlets are unreliable or are heavily moderated and tend to only report half of the story if any of it is actually true. so by asking a community that is suspicious from the beginning and determines a conspiracy that is true/false they are trying to find truth. </p>

<p>what other sources would you reccomend to trust to tell you if a conspiracy theory is true or not? the mainstream media? some random google page that could have been created by a schill? </p>
