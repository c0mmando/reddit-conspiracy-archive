I mean, yes we all know that the industry has shitty standards and doesn&#39;t seem to give two shits about the environment..... it just seems hinky to me that 5 weeks ago they were talking about gas prices lowering and I even saw gas in Ohio at an incredible $2.99 a gallon.   Now.... boom right back up higher than it has been in a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can easily cost a million USD just to replace a single damaged vessel. This doesn&#39;t take into account the cost of shutting down production or any lawsuits filed. </p>

<p>The Chevron Richmond refinery (recent site of fire) produces 244,000 barrels per day. The expected closure is supposed to cost them 3 months time. The time frame is optimistic, in my experience. Per barrel is approx ~$90.00. 
Grand total: $1,976,400,000
Does that make sense to you?</p>

<p>As far as EPA or OSHA standards, I suggest you do more research in a state of mind to garner fact, not opinion.
The EPA has been known to hinder the improvement of refineries due to insisting they upgrade whole sections of the plant rather than just an item or two. Hence, the refinery will not upgrade. You&#39;d be surprised how many hurdles go into meeting the EPA standards. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a mechanical designer for 8 years and have worked on a number of projects for big oil, including recently a tank in the Chevron Richmond plant. No, it wasn&#39;t part of the recent fire. They&#39;re certainly not without faults. But there&#39;s far more to the story. Never trust popular opinion. </p>

<p>Apologies for the wall of text. Long time reader/lurker of /conspiracy and finally felt I had something to add to the conversation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize that, but it still wouldn&#39;t surprise me that gas prices were not going to go down due to the influence on the election process.   Oil companies are doing GREAT under President Obama, but you know they would be doing even better under Romney.  There is a lot for them to gain by keeping prices high. </p>
