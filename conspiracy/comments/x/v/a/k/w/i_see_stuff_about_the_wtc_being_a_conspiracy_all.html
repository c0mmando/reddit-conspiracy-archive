<p>The fact that you are entirely relying on other people to do your research for you means you aren&#39;t ready to even be presented with evidence let alone digest it.</p>

<p>But when you are, instead of looking at easily debatable topics like how the buildings collapsed, try some grown up talk like PDD w199i where the white house threatened to prosecute any FBI if they tried to interfere or apprehend the Atta/NJ cell.  That&#39;s just one piece of dozens of unequivocal evidence that it wasn&#39;t just negligence, but a deliberate effort by elements within the government to make 9/11 happen.</p>

<p>&quot;New Pearl Harbor&quot;</p>

<p>Section V of Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses, entitled &quot;Creating Tomorrow&#39;s Dominant Force&quot;, includes the sentence: &quot;Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event––like a new Pearl Harbor&quot; </p>

<p>This is an excerpt from a document written by Dick Cheney, other Neo-Cons and Zionists.</p>

<p>The event was a catalyst for the start of a new dominating war in the Middle East. The public needed an event so horrible they would be calling for blood, and they did.</p>

<p>Last as for the international aftermath of 09/11, &quot;War on Terror&quot;, basically the continuation (and still on-going now through the &quot;Arab Spring&quot;) for the conquest of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geographical_Pivot_of_History">&quot;Heartland&quot;</a>. After the Soviet Union succumbed to capitalism the Middle East is the last remaining area left to be conquered, and at its center Iran.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money. Its always about money. The sheer amount of files lost during the collapse of wtc # 7 was astounding. All files pertained to intelligence. Also the massive insurance policy taken out just before 9/11 on the twin towers raises eyebrows. Its always about money and power. Also the war for terror ad it pertained to Bin Laden. Americans unanimously rallied behind the government to get Bin Laden, support only started to drop after we went to Iraq. The amount of money the defense department has made off of this war is immense as well. </p>

<p>TLDR: Money</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To answer the questinon <em>why</em>, we have to know who is responsible for 9/11.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know <em>who</em> exactly was responsible for 9/11. There was no truly independent investigation. The 9/11 investigation was underfunded, biased and left many questions unanswered.</p>

<p>9/11 has been used to push through policies (war against Iraq and Afghanistan, military build up, Patriot Act, control of the Middle East etc.) which were planned well before 9/11. It would have been nearly impossible to implement such policies without 9/11. Many of the people who abused 9/11 for their interests were Neocons and members of a think tank called <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3249.htm">PNAC</a> (Project for the New American Century). These Neocons not only used the opportunity of 9/11 to <a href="http://www.expose-the-war-profiteers.org/archive/media/2007/20070116.pdf">profit</a> and further their agenda, they were also found in key positions before, during and after 9/11 and helped to cover up some important evidence. So they qualify at least as suspects.</p>

<p>Many of these neocons have close ties to both the military industrial complex and to the right-wing Israel lobby. In 1996 Richard Perle, Douglas Feith and David Wurmser even wrote a policy paper called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm">A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm</a> for the Netanyahu-government is Israel. Once they were in positions of power during the Bush-administration, they abused their power to implement those policies. For example Douglas Feith was head of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Special_Plans">Office of Special Plans</a>, which was mainly responsible for the fraudulent intelligence which was given to the US public in the lead up to the Iraq War.</p>

<p>So in short: <strong>Military Industrial Complex, Imperialism, Israel, Profiteering</strong></p>

<p>Here is a short video about <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9k77h_9-11-coincidences-5-19_news">PNAC&#39;s</a> goals [6:12].</p>

<p>If you have more time, you can watch Ryan Dawson&#39;s excellent documentary <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoB80Yk9NYg">War is always by Deception</a></p>

<p>In my opinion a good list of overlooked <a href="http://www.911blogger.com/node/17949">facts</a> which sow doubt and show that the OS tells not the whole truth was compiled by Jon Gold.</p>

<p>Edited to add a lecture from 2004 (about 1hour podcast) by Dr. John McMurtry: &quot;Why the Facts of 9/11 Must Be Suppressed - Understanding the Ruling Group Mind Behind the War Without End.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Why did Hitler burn down an iconic government building and then blame a Jew? America has a long, shameful history of occupying countries by putting puppets in place through manufactured &quot;revolution&quot;. I am unsure if the end game goal is religion or oil ... perhaps it is both? False flag operations provide a unique type of instant leverage when making the case for war.</p>

<p>The government may have been guilty through their inaction. It has been suggested Bush &amp; Co. ignored a variety of warnings from the global intelligence community. Also, the twin towers were full of asbestos and this was a huge financial liability. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a solid belief that the United States had very reliable intelligence of the attack on Pearl Harbor before it happened and decided to intentionally NOT act on it and allow Japan to destroy Pearl Harbor without retaliation for the sole intention of getting the American people enraged and desire to join the war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, why? For what possible gain? </p>

<p>&quot;The Cold War&#39;s over, John. But with no clear enemy to stockpile against, the arms market&#39;s flat. But bring down a fully loaded 727 into the middle of New York City and you&#39;ll find a dozen tin-pot dictators all over the world just clamoring to take responsibility, and begging to be smart-bombed.&quot;</p>

<p>That quote is from the pilot episode of The lone gunmen where a group of less than successfull journalist with a predilection for conspiracies with the help of a defecting G-man stops a ploy to crash an airliner into the wold trade center. Even though it is a fictional quote it raises a point.</p>

<p>Also, would anyone care to guess when this episode was aired? About six months before the actual attack. That is an interesting coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally don&#39;t subscribe to the grander conspiracy theories.  I do believe Bin Laden played a roll and that many parts of the &quot;official&quot; story may have..sortof...gone down as reported.  I do also believe however that we knew in advance it was going to happen and I also believe that the planes aren&#39;t what brought down the towers. 
An important question to ask is where the money came from. Bin Laden? Funded armed and created by the US. A lot of the money involved came from the Saudis as well.  The US, the Bush Family, etc all have ties to the Saudis and their oil.<br/>
Greg Palast&#39;s Armed Madhouse gets into quite a bit of the non-conspiratorial truths around many of these things.  He doesn&#39;t make accusations that he can&#39;t back up however one can continue to connect the dots to develop a bigger pictures. 
It&#39;s a good read...tons of information without going over the top on hard to believe stuff. At a minimum it help me redevelop my own theories on the whole thing into something quite a bit more sensible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s funny is that people truly believe that a massive, elaborate and incredible complicate conspiracy was needed to justify invading Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>We are asked to believe that multiple planes were hijacked by the conspirators, flown into the WTC and the Pentagon, the WTC was rigged with explosives beforehand without anyone noticing, the explosives didn&#39;t go off even though two planes had crashed and burned into the building etc. etc.</p>

<p>An operation that would have needed to involve, hundreds, possible thousands of people, months of preparation work with no guarantee that it would actually work.</p>

<p>All the while a truck filled with TNT would have had the same effect and would only have needed a handfull of people to pull off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is funny, how a plan to topple the Afghanistan regime was OK&#39;d one day <strong>before</strong> <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4585010/#.UCIpa6DJaKU">9/11</a>. Funny also, how already years before 9/11 some Neocons called for regime change in Iraq.</p>

<p>And how wonderful funny is it, that the same Neocons who called for regime change also created the Office of Special Plans. There they <a href="http://www.dissidentvoice.org/Articles7/Leopold_OSP-Manipulation.htm">manipulated</a> the American public and the White House with fraudulent intelligence to support a war of aggression. </p>

<p>Why arent&#39;t they prosecuted? The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg considered a war of aggression to be:</p>

<p>Essentially an evil thing...to initiate a war of aggression...is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime, differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, ok. Where do you get the notion hundreds, or possibly thousands needed to be involved to cover it up? How many people were involved in the official story? Bin Laden, the 19 hijackers and a few others. So going off the official stories numbers it&#39;s entirely possible those people involved in the hijacking were either recruited by the rogue CIA network or they were not even real. </p>

<p>A few people with the right intelligence connections can organise terrorism and the terrorists to carry out operations without the terrorists even knowing who they are really working for.</p>

<p>Example: A man with a Muslim appearance can be a CIA handler/officer and recruit Jihadi&#39;s without the men actually knowing the recruiter is from, or working on behalf of the CIA. Thats how real world operations happen. They are there to appear to be legitimate to the terrorists without raising suspicions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...Sigh.... You misunderstood me.. that is what I was saying. Money is the correct term for what you were describing though. You are calling it the wrong thing. Fiat MONEY systems are based on nothing. The war was not for oil. The majority of money made in the war has been your Fiat currency. No resources have changed hands. In the end, you cant buy anything with oil, but you can trade your oil for MONEY, and use that for power and control. There for it is a war for MONEY not war for oil, even though they are close to one in the same then end goal is money, not oil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you are miss understanding yourself you say a fiat money system is based off nothing ,proving yourself wrong. We will say they didn&#39;t necessarily want or oil they wanted to control over oil. We could even say they want the illusion of oil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what purpose. Your not jumping to the end goal. They cant do anything with oil. Specially not iraqi or afghani oil. Its russian controlled for the most part. The end goal is power but money = power, there for money was the end goal. They could care less about the oil. Did haliburton make a fortune off the oil... No. They made a fortune rebuilding and securing. Dick Cheyney also made a ton off the wars. Its always about power. Oil is not power, money is. Money secures oil and an infinite amount of other things. Oil can only secure money. It sounds like we are saying the same thing but calling it something different. Truthfully the powers that be, NWO and the such, already control the oil, they dont need a false flag to secure more. Just money to purchase more souls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok lets take this back a step... money ISNT power... oil ISNT power. LEVERAGE is power and if you can tell someone you cant have this because i have it then THAT is power. Even if it is only an Illusion of power, we just dont know or cant see that what they have isnt actually there. Its the same as putting someone in an empty room with 1 button and saying, if you push that button you will die, but in reality that button isnt connected to anything. Its a lie in a lie to hide something i dont think most of the world is willing to comprehend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is funny, how a plan to topple the Afghanistan regime was OK&#39;d one day <strong>before</strong> <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4585010/#.UCIpa6DJaKU">9/11</a>. Funny also, how already years before 9/11 some Neocons called for regime change in Iraq.</p>

<p>And how wonderful funny is it, that the same Neocons who called for regime change also created the Office of Special Plans. There they <a href="http://www.dissidentvoice.org/Articles7/Leopold_OSP-Manipulation.htm">manipulated</a> the American public and the White House with fraudulent intelligence to support a war of aggression. </p>

<p>Why arent&#39;t they prosecuted? The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg considered a war of aggression to be:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Essentially an evil thing...to initiate a war of aggression...is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime, differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, ok. Where do you get the notion hundreds, or possibly thousands needed to be involved to cover it up? How many people were involved in the official story? Bin Laden, the 19 hijackers and a few others. So going off the official stories numbers it&#39;s entirely possible those people involved in the hijacking were either recruited by the rogue CIA network or they were not even real. </p>

<p>A few people with the right intelligence connections can organise terrorism and the terrorists to carry out operations without the terrorists even knowing who they are really working for.</p>

<p>Example: A man with a Muslim appearance can be a CIA handler/officer and recruit Jihadi&#39;s without the men actually knowing the recruiter is from, or working on behalf of the CIA. Thats how real world operations happen. They are there to appear to be legitimate to the terrorists without raising suspicions.</p>
