        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Living in China is different than living in the west. Some aspects of life are more free than life in western countries, however, such freedoms require white skin or some form of money/value/power.</p>

<p>My life is wonderful here and I feel the Chinese people are truly superior in many ways to any other culture and ethnicity in the world.</p>

<p>But my question is this, I am a medium/small sized business leader of my local area, although, my children aren&#39;t Jewish and are 100% Chinese. I have been told that this portion of reddit and the internet is a haven for white supremacists. My question to you, is, why do you hate the Jews so much. </p>

<p>Do you despise the Jews or are the Israelis your main target. Also, I am a Jew who supports a two state solution. I want Jews to have their own autonomy and the Palestinians to have their own autonomy with borders similar or near to 1967 peace accords. But I am not legally an Israeli. My secondary question towards the white suprems here is: does this make me a Zionist or a Jew supporting his people?</p>

<p>The value in answering my question using your valued time and energy in your own perspective is that I will listen and try to understand your point of view. Because reddit is a community of people who feel they are sharing an unbiased point of view, I just want to understand the truth in order to further my understanding of myself as a medium sized business leader and leader of my local community.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not sure if this is exactly true, I haven&#39;t read your holy books, but if it is, wouldn&#39;t that make all Jews supporting your own state anti god? And if you are anti god, that means you are with the devil. </p>

<p>Just a question, that I would like you to answer!</p>

<p>But yeah you are right, people don&#39;t like you, I wouldn&#39;t call it hate, but when you torture, kill, displace Palestinians and a lot of Jews do it with such taste and thrill its hard not to dislike you, especially since most Jews are hypocrites always falling back to WW2 and what was done to them by the Nazi&#39;s yet at the same time, you are doing pretty much the same things to the Palestinians in their own state, in their own land. </p>

<p>Even the top rabbis at the end of WW2 didn&#39;t want to sign the state of Isreal that was presented to them back then and is reality today!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except they&#39;re all white supremacists and everything they&#39;re saying is white supremacist tropes. In fact, go to Stormfront and you can see for yourself it&#39;s the same garbage. </p>

<p>Look at the copy-and-paste from the second link. I googled it and found websites like this: <a href="http://elviswinehouse-elvis.blogspot.ca/p/jew-owned-media_5861.html">http://elviswinehouse-elvis.blogspot.ca/p/jew-owned-media_5861.html</a></p>

<p>One post that still has 3 upvotes:</p>

<p>What this athlete should have said is that there are too many blacks in Greece, and their presence is hurting Greek culture and the Greek economy. <strong>Which would have been perfectly true</strong>. But she didn&#39;t say this -- she made a mild and non-racist joke about mosquitoes.</p>

<p>Anyways, you said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which is wrong because there&#39;s a ton offensive to non-whites here posted every day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well obviously no one wants world war (except maybe hitler).  World Wars happen because circumstances lead to them.  But the facts are that Israel very strongly wants to attack and/or invade Iran, and that has the potential to start toppling dominoes that really shouldn&#39;t be bothered.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So you would be OK if I stole your land because a 5000 year old religious text says that its mine?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a completely loaded question, and an absolute strawman.</p>

<p>First, I don&#39;t support Israel&#39;s, I just marvel at this argument that there &quot;shouldn&#39;t be a Jewish state&quot; when there are dozens of Christian and Islamic ones.  <strong>That</strong> was the argument you made, and the one I responded to.  </p>

<p>Second, r/conspiracy is RIFE with anti-semitism.  If you haven&#39;t seen it, you haven&#39;t been looking.  Look up bumblingmumbling, Occidentalist, tttt0tttt, or Ijob911 for examples.</p>

<p>Third, your analysis of the situation in the middle east is so simplistic as to be absurd.  The Palestinians did not &quot;own&quot; the land they lived on, the British Government did, according to the laws of the time.  If this is illegitimate and should be disregarded, then the same goes for the United States, and virtually every country on Earth; if you go back far enough, everyone&#39;s homeland was stolen from someone else.  Italy was Etruscan, France was Gallian, England was CERTAINLY not owned by those who inhabit it today...shall they give their land back, as well?  I&#39;m sorry, but if you think such issues are cut and dry, then you&#39;re actually just willfully ignorant, or incapable of understanding.</p>

<p>The British gave the land to become a Jewish state - the original proposal, from the U.N. was, of course, a so-called &quot;Two-state solution&quot;, which, r/conspiracy seems to COMPLETELY forget, was accepted by the Jewish leadership: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The British captured Jerusalem a month later, and were formally awarded a mandate in 1922. The non-Jewish Palestinians revolted in 1920, 1929 and 1936. In 1947, following World War II and the Holocaust, the British Government announced their desire to terminate the Mandate, and the United Nations General Assembly voted to partition the territory into a Jewish state and an Arab state. The Jewish leadership accepted the proposal but the Arab Higher Committee rejected it; a civil war began immediately, and Israel was declared in 1948.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The arabs there had no desire for such a solution, despite the land being legally British, and as such, they fought - a relatively understandable reaction, but one that has lead directly to the current state of things.</p>

<p>So, no, it&#39;s only about a &quot;5,000 year old religious text&quot; for the most religiously orthodox - the strawmen of your argument.  For most people in the area, it&#39;s about the law, and the homeland THEY&#39;VE been born and raised in, given that the state has existed for sixty plus years.  </p>

<p>But no one discusses any of this here.  It&#39;s always about THOSE RACIST JEWS AND THEIR TALMUD, as if every person in Israel is trying to enact a fundamentalist version of Judaism.  This is an outright lie, and if you believe it, you&#39;re just a &#39;sheep&#39;, as people on this subreddit are so eager to refer to other people.

    <div class="md"><p>wow what kind of propaganda have you been listening to?</p>

<p>The people here at conspiracy are mostly non-haters. We do not hate any specific group at all.</p>

<p>We are just aware of the fact the world is ruled by big businesses and not the people. </p>

<p>Most of the big businesses are owned by old boys networks including large percentages of jewish people.</p>

<p>Most of the governments are working to please the big companies.</p>

<p>Why? Because these people held power and money many centuries ago and somehow retained that. </p>

<p>If we are not aware, big businesses and corrupt governments and (semi-) government agencies will make this world a bad place.</p>

<p>We are only making people aware there is another option. Without supporting communism or even anarchism, just by limiting the extremes of big business and government. </p>

<p>Once people are aware they are being fooled (like you are, by the (indirect) propaganda that led you to this place), it is not so easy to fool them again. </p>

<p>It is not normal that a couple of bankrupt governments are starting WW3 because they want to protect their immense corporations interests, is it? Well, this is what is going on today...</p>

<p>Make people aware of the truth, educate them, maybe they will start their own garden and not by coca cola anymore. Maybe they will protest the wars, maybe they will vote for a 3rd option. It starts with education and a place where we are free to discuss any event without people controlling what is being said (look at <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> e.g.)</p>

<p>You are probably a troll, but tell me what business are you in, and we will tell you which large companies are taking advantage of you and why the prices for your produce are so low, but the people in the western world still have to pay a premium...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very few hate &quot;Jews&quot;. But aggressive and immoral policies of the Israeli gov&#39;t cause many to not delineate between anti-Semitism and opposition to the state of Israel&#39;s militaristic and apartheid policies. The gov&#39;t of Israel relishes and favors this confusion, since it obfuscates their policies. An objective view of history will tell you what you need to know.</p>

<p>Even though Jewish Zionists reported pre-WWII that what was once ancient Israel was populated by a variety of groups and religions, those Zionists started their program to buy up land in what was once ancient Israel.</p>

<p>That Zionist program only managed to buy up a pretty trivial percentage of Palestine when WWII happened.</p>

<p>Because of a massive genocidal crime committed by Nazi Germans, the Zionist cause was greatly bolstered. </p>

<p>Thousands of Jews fleeing European tyranny fled to Palestine. This had a number of effects. It bolstered the Zionist program of buying up Palestine. But it also caused Europe to rethink the situation about the oil-rich Arabs.</p>

<p>When Jews started fighting British colonialism, the declining British empire and the west had to decide on a new program. They decided they had more in common with new Jews in Palestine than with Palestine&#39;s native Arabs. So the two state &quot;solution&quot; was created.</p>

<p>Some of Europe opposed the non-viable state of Israel. Others supported Israel since they saw it as a European/western colonial state injected into a key part of Arab lands.</p>

<p>By the 1960s the entire west generally supported Israel based on that colonial settler state concept, and also as a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; distraction tool to be used against Arab countries.</p>

<p>In 1967 Arab states were not happy with the non-viable Palestine territory, and were seeking to have Israel go bankrupt or to eventually take over Israel militarily. At this point Israel, with US support, launched a devastating sneak attack: a series of air strikes on the air forces of 5 Arab countries, which laid waste to those countries&#39; air capabilities and which lead to the wildly successful 6-Day War of 1967.</p>

<p>After the 6-Day War Israel was a political pariah, in wanton violation of UN Resolutions but protected politically by the US gov&#39;t, and armed to the teeth by the US and other western countries.</p>

<p>The Arab states, suffering from the occupation of Palestine and their humiliating defeat in 1967, planned a counter-attack war, which they launched with a sneak attack in 1973 on the eve of Israel&#39;s Yom Kippur holiday. Though the war was initially successful for the Arabs, Israel rallied and wound up with another decisive victory.</p>

<p>Considering how close the US and USSR was to war in supporting their respective allies in the Middle East, the US under Jimmy Carter flat-out bribed both the Egyptians and the Israelis into signing a peace treaty. The Egyptian people opposed a peace settlement which ignored the Palestinians and Sadat paid with his life when Muslim militants murdered him; the US then supported the Egyptian dictator Mubarak after his murder; armed his military, trained his police, and supplied him with weapons and cash.</p>

<p>Since the breakup of the USSR in 1991 the US has had its restraints removed. After that the US has fully supported Israel&#39;s ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, and the seizure of Palestinian land by Israel. </p>

<p>With the only significant military opposition to Israel being Syria (now targeted by the west with a proxy war), Israel was free to launch multiple wars and military campaigns -- all supported by the US.</p>

<p>The most resistance the Palestinians can muster are guerrilla groups armed with small, unguided rockets, small arms, and portable anti-tank weapons.</p>

<p>Today Israel militarily reigns almost supreme. From a moral perspective it is in decay due to its apartheid laws and aggressive ethnic cleansing.</p>

<p>Iran and others offer rhetorical support for the Palestinian cause; Syria, Iran, and others some trivial military and financial aid to the guerrilla fighters brave (or foolish) enough to try to resist Israel militarily. And to highlight the weak position of the Palestinians, both Hamas and the PLO recognize Israel&#39;s right to exist and oppose military resistance against Israel.</p>

<p>That about sums it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not hate anyone (or love anyone), as a group. As a civil libertarian, I feel a responsibility to look after my own. Modern society is fucked up. Most people are so impacted by propaganda, they do not even know how to think any longer. They just mouth the words of the political correct phrases that have been pounded into their heads. I have some real issues with Zionism, just like I have issue with American Neo-Cons and white supremists. Hate is hate. Global society is in a shambles and a good place to start fixing this problem is an admission we are all the same ... flawed, insecure, human.  </p>

<p>There was a recent university level DNA study that was going to &quot;map&quot; the commonality of DNA throughout the Middle East. The cries of anti-semitism and massive political pressure put the brakes on the whole project. Many believe (myself included) that the study would have been conclusive proof that there is <strong>no difference between Jews and Arabs</strong>. </p>

<p>Being jewish is nothing more than a religion. It is my humble opinion that religion flies planes into buildings ... <strong>all religion</strong>. It is a powerful drug and kings and popes have kept much of humanity pinned to the mat with guilt, shame, fear and peer pressure for a long time.</p>

<p>The Israels have the USA as it&#39;s rabid dog of war. Israel acquires billions of tax dollars in American support every year while their own country crumbles. I do not pretend to know all the reasons why; however, religion and oil are a big part of the reason. I find it shameful that America is looking after another state to their own people&#39;s detriment. I just drove through New England and many of the roads are rotting and unfit to drive on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I strongly dislike Israel because of its warmongering and its intolerance as of late.  I wrote another post a few days ago outlining my summary of the upcoming Israel-Iran war.  It&#39;s based partly on freely accessible sources, but mostly on my buddies in Strategic Intelligence that I went to basic with.  Hell, my title is still Strategic Intelligence Analyst (or rather, that in french/german) even though my job is actually nuclear physics.</p>

<p>This is in stark contrast to my views on the Jewish religion.  I&#39;m an atheist myself, but I strongly believe in everyone&#39;s right and duty to choose what they believe in for themselves, and Jewish doctrine is second only to agnosticism in respecting that right in non-believers.  Even atheists are more likely to be militant proselytizers of their (lack of) faith, to the point where many who feel similarly to me choose to label themselves as agnostics instead.  I choose to continue to label myself an atheist because it is the most accurate label for my beliefs and I won&#39;t change the meaning of words to distance myself from those I disagree with.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s getting off topic.  Regarding the state of Israel and the religious conservatives pushing the country to war and persecution, I think that it&#39;s idiotic.  I believe that a two state solution is untenable generally, but it&#39;s outright impossible with these wackos running the show.  An integrated government with equal rights and responsibilities is the only real way to end the conflict, even if there are those who would see gentiles as inferior or unclean.  But that&#39;s never gonna happen, and the Israel-Iran war is going to break out soon, dragging an unknown number of other powers into the conflict, and potentially exploding into WWIII, though I hope Russia and China let their last middle eastern ally fall, unjust though that may be, because I fear the consequences if they do the right thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I am Jewish. I am not a White Supremacist and I find it insulting that you assume Anti-Zionists here are White Supremacist. Spend some time here on r/conspiracy, instead of making stupid assumptions and you&#39;ll actually find many good people, looking to help humanity. Many of these people are not Jewish and yet do more Tikkun Olam than Zionists. If you looking for opinions from people who are racial supremacists, go check out r/Israel or r/whitepower. r/conspiracy is a place for humanity to unite. Please don&#39;t refer to people here as White Supremacists. </p>

<p>You are Jewish in China, have you heard of the Keifang Jewish community? Your children can be Chinese-Jewish because China has a Jewish history. You can be part of that without having to be Zionist. Contrary to what Zionists teach, you can proudly be Chinese-Jewish.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not hatred of Jews, it&#39;s hatred of Zionism and Zionist/Jewish Supremacy. It&#39;s a hatred, that I share will the good people of r/Conspiracy, that Zionists have too much clout, especially in American politics. Americans are bombarded with excuses daily for why they must support Israel and why America must as well. Be it for Messianic fervor or some nonsense about shared democracy. </p>

<p>Zionists have entire organizations devoted to keeping Israels image clean. Even here on Reddit, Hasbara rats come and borrow into our forums. AIPAC and various other groups lobby the American government to always support Israel. American checkbook Zionists donate billions to Israel and the IDF. But if you donate to Palestine you&#39;re a terrorist. </p>

<p>Israel was founded by evil, despicable, Rothschild Family, who continue to fund Israel today. Israel is openly Fascist: Privately owned, Ethnocentric as well as its military culture. JNF is a private organization that controls immigration to Israel and assures that only Hitler&#39;s own guidelines for a Jew (full, half, quarter) are met for each now Oleh (immigrant). The JNF also works as a bank of sorts, they own much of the land as well. So Israel has a government, a private bank (The Bank of Israel) and the privately controlled JNF. </p>

<p>the good people of r/conspiracy would be happy to discuss with you why they oppose Zionism. I suggest next time you wish to post a question here, leave out your assumptions on who lurks here. I am proudly Jewish and proudly Anti-Zionist. When you assume, you make an ass of you and me!</p>

<p>I never considered that before. thank you. I have posted to Israel exposed before- never really knowing the intent- whether it was to report on Israel&#39;s geopolitical shenanigans or just to beat up on Jews. I&#39;m America, but I hold no one sacred- for none are. Not the right wing nor the left. The result has labeled me everything from islamo-facist, oven-dodger, liberal swine or conservative racist. Part of me likes avoiding every attempt at labeling, but I know how humans are, and I play no favorites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a white supremacist nor do I think anyone else on this subreddit  is personally. As a white person I think white people are my least favorite race because most of the time we are arrogant assholes with our heads in the sand. The problem is that any time anyone questions or criticizes the Israeli government they are called racist or anti Semitic. The Jewish people are the only people on earth that you are not aloud to criticize. Why is that?It&#39;s our love towards an oppressed people (Palestinians) not hate of any culture(Jews) that makes us speak out. It is the Israelis states racism towards the Arabs that is the problem and when the Palestinians have equal respect as humans Israel will have my respect back. FYI. Jews are not a chosen people. There is no such thing. We are all equal human beings and it is the belief in their own superiority by many peoples that have lead to their downfall in the past. Like the Nazis. </p>

<p>A little confused here. You claim to be Jewish - is that simply a cultural identification? Are you full blood Chinese? If not, did you adopt your children?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you despise the Jews or are the Israelis your main target.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dichotomizing the problem into neat little packages, each of which is as contemptible as the other. My peeve about Israel is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/xre6p/will_israel_be_the_next_world_power/c5ox41j?context=3">this</a>.</p>
