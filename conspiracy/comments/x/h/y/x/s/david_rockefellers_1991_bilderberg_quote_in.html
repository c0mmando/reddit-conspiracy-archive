<p><strong>David Rockefeller</strong></p>

<p>Everybody knows that quote. The reason I am reposting this is because there is also an audio file of that incident. In a forum some six years ago I saw a video with Rockefellers voice saying those words. I never thought it would vanish from internet, but I am searching occacionally now for the last couple of years and I can not find it anymore. Is there somebody who can provide a link or upload again, please? I would appreciate that very much. This time I want to make a copy of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Some even believe we [The Rockefeller Family] are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure---one world, if you will. If that&#39;s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.&quot;
- David Rockefeller, “Memoirs” page 405 (2002)</p>

<p>&quot;We are on the verge of a global transformation.  All we need is the right major crisis and the nation will accept the New World Order.&quot;  -- David Rockefeller </p>

<p>“We are grateful to the Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries.&quot; - David Rockefeller at Bilderberg Meeting... Baden-Baden, Germany 1991</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nations are formed and unified for many reasons chief amongst those reasons being money.  Whether it be Cesar&#39;s empire buying allies or 13 colonies fighting a revolutionary war, amassing large debts, and uniting to pay off that debt, money has led the processes of unification throughout the history of the nations of men.  </p>

<p>To consider those men that have the power to speak the words that can unify a nation anything except intellectually elite would be a mistake so yes, I am happy to entrust the future of world government to the world banker&#39;s and the intellectual elite.  I&#39;ll take money and intellectualism over religion and/or feudalism any day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another interesting and related quote not from DR</p>

<p>&quot;In short, the &quot;house of world order&quot; will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down. It will look like a great &quot;booming, buzzing confusion,&quot; to use William James&#39; famous description of reality, but an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault. Of course, for political as well as administrative reasons, some of these specialized arrangements should be brought into an appropriate relationship with the central institutions of the U.N. system, but the main thing is that the essential functions be performed.&quot; Richard N. Gardner &quot;The Hard Road to World Order&quot; Foreign Affairs 1974</p>

<p>If it existed in the early days of archive.org, it not only <strong>is</strong> archived, it probably has weekly updates for a long period of time (because of the growth of the internet, archive.org has gone from archiving the entire net once per week, to about once every couple months).</p>
