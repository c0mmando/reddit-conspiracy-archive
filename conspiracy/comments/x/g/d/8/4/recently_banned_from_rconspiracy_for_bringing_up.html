<p>Not only was I banned, but the information I presented was deleted so the public cannot see it. My original post was deleted, and I posted that my submission was almost instantly deleted. What is going on with this subreddit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sins, im gonna repost some of what i told biomassive yesterday.  There are some people on here playing mind games, learn to spot the signs.  Here is part of my post from yesterday.</p>

<p>You mods are doing a good job at keeping this subreddit legit (9000sins is cool), i feel there will be more concerted efforts to discredit or even see more active methods to try to lure the good redditors on r/conspiracy into leaving, ie: bashing, mis-direction, burying threads/comments, change of subject, personal attacks to try and bring r/conspiracy to a less attractive sub-reddit. You see, a lot of these techniques are used in the penny stock forums, most, are very effective and mess with and confuse the noob investor...if you dont know what youre looking for you can easily find yourself questioning being here or being distracted from getting work done.</p>

<p>Keep up the good work and there are enough solid thinkers/awakened minds on r/conspiracy, think most of them can hold their own pretty good. There are lots of new subscribers on this subreddit though, ive noticed, so got to stay on your toes.</p>

<p>You ban accounts and delete comments because you are offended that people disagree with you.  You don&#39;t just do it today; it seems like you do it daily.  You call users names.  You called me a fucking moron earlier today when I pointed out reddit is a user curated site, and it doesn&#39;t need you to delete stuff you don&#39;t agree with.</p>

<p>You should not be a moderator here.  Do the right thing, and resign as a moderator.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>:</p>

<p>You broke rule six today, and many times over.  Just because people commented to the same thread as you.  Resign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I will spend cash money to have you removed.  I will send cash to the the Google Checkout account of the moderator that removes you, or the user that hacks your account and deletes it (send me a PM when it&#39;s done).</p>

<p>You banned multiple users today; these users simply disagreed with you.  You then deleted their comments to save yourself the embarrassment.  Then, you call then names, and post comments out of context to misrepresent them.  You have done this for weeks.  Banning users.  Now, I call you out on it, and you post an apology.  You should not be a moderator.  You are the embarrassment.</p>

<p>Do you want me to post and link to your embarrassing comments?</p>

<p>Trust yourself. You are the one making the calls. If you know in your heart though, that you aren&#39;t in the right mindset, step away and let the air clear. A little perspective and breathing room helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like a lot of activist post but I love <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Especially considering the massive amount of censorship on reddit right now.

<p>There was nothing even remotely disrespectful about what I said. If nothing else, please simply pay attention. I would prefer this scandal not simply disappear. This is certainly shady at the very least. I&#39;m guessing this post will be removed as well, and both of us banned for a second time. Hopefully this time the community notices.</p>

<p>I had some other shill make a thread accusing me of being a spammer for infowars and working for Alex Jones simply because I post a few articles of their sites I find pertinent.</p>

<p>Have some discernment, and if you aren&#39;t a COINTELPRO shill grow the fuck up and judge articles on their individual merits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the dude in question really was a shill, his positions where counter intuitive to any discussion, never offered sources for his claims, and would simply hop to other commenters in topics if challenged with sources. He is pro war against syria, posting propaganda constantly to sway public opinion, and he even tried to dismiss claims about the fast and furious operations which is a conspiracy to have been proven true.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding the second time around. Your previous post is dead on though with how a place should be ran though. I&#39;m quite glad to see people in this community with rationality and critical thought, instead of a reactionary basis for diahrea of the hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i do appreciate this discussion, and i really can&#39;t refute your point too easily, since it is an opinion and a personal like of your own. I too share your philosophy, but i apply it circumstantially in life, as i have found that some people just aren&#39;t worth my time, and tend to detract from the human experience instead of adding anything constructive to it.</p>

<p>I can however provide the example of drowning in a sea of disinformation. If enough shills where to crowd our conspiracy forum, never changing their opinion, all we would end up with is flame wars and people wasting their time refuting invalid claims. All the while, the quality of our topics decreases, lowering the ammount of people taking up mature debate. To me, the irresponsibility resides in the human being who can&#39;t listen to reason. It is a slippery slope scenario, and must be circumcised to prevent further infection.</p>

<p>My statements may be reckless at times, but atleast i admit my own wrongdoings and change my opinion based off of the debates i engage in. I also act irresponsible at times when i falsely accuse others with my trolling style of attack, yet i never do so unless provoked by stupidity, and if i do in fact end up regretting my trolling, i sincerely apologize to the person and try to make amends. </p>

<p>Make no mistake though, i always consider every perspective possible, and only troll on topics that i have a passion about. I review all of the information presented to me, and with my critical thinking skills, i discern that information and develop my own hypothesis.</p>

<p>I am however, not a shill. Learn the fucking meaning of the word. It is mean&#39;t to describe a person in a paid position who aids a cause without disclosing their personal relationship with the supplier of their funds. I am a douchebag, an asshole, a silly faggot (i&#39;m gay, you can call me a silly faggot) and an overall nuissance to some, but not a shill. Alright?</p>

<p>Happy hunting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t feel the website necessarily is. The subreddit certainly seems to be. Read the comment I linked in this thread and you&#39;ll see what I was banned for, and what the moderator had to say about my opinion regarding the matter. Apparently, he can remove anything he thinks doesn&#39;t give the subreddit a good image in places like <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, and anyone who points out that he isn&#39;t the one who determines what encompasses what the community represents gets banned from the subreddit immediately after being personally insulted. I for one was called a &quot;fucking moron&quot; before being silenced. Is it necessarily the entire subreddit rather than one moderator on a power trip? No. Should he be a moderator at all? Once again, no. And the self acclaimed owner of the subreddit won&#39;t even respond to my comments or PMs. And before you think I&#39;m intentionally misrepresenting the situation, please go read the thread. </p>

<p>Also, his excuse is simply ludicrous. People can post about the ruling elite taking DMT to communicate with reptillian aliens, but saying that a website being posted repeatedly from the same account, (a lot of which conent was obvious fluff content not in any way associated with r/conspiracy) is spam gets your thread closed and you banned from the subreddit, along with anyone else who agrees with you. Does he really seem to care about the image of the subreddit? Or just the special interests of a website?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the dude in question really was a shill, his positions where counter intuitive to any discussion, never offered sources for his claims, and would simply hop to other commenters in topics if challenged with sources. He is pro war against syria, posting propaganda constantly to sway public opinion, and he even tried to dismiss claims about the fast and furious operations which is a conspiracy to have been proven true.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding the second time around. Your previous post is dead on though with how a place should be ran though. I&#39;m quite glad to see people in this community with rationality and critical thought, instead of a reactionary basis for diahrea of the hands.</p>
