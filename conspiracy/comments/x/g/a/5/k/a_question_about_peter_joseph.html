<p>Why is he now starting to make the front page? </p>

<p>This started, as I recall, about 6 or 8 months ago. People started posting his videos and lauding him as the leader we should all be following. But those were quickly outed as shills. It appears they&#39;ve upgraded their approach and have gone to a more subtle tactic... just post and upvote.</p>

<p>Why is r/conspiracy giving this guy any attention whatsoever?</p>

<p><a href="https://zeitgeistmovements.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/peter-joseph-merola-as-a-fortean-iconoclast/">https://zeitgeistmovements.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/peter-joseph-merola-as-a-fortean-iconoclast/</a></p>

<p>Quoting myself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>while the films may be helpful in goading people to think about things in ways they may not have otherwise, such as the relationship of secret societies to public power, or of ancient mythology within modern christianity, they are also ultimately intentionally misleading. transhumanism can be considered popularly ideal, but in actuality, it is the elite that will thrive under such conditions, that will afford such technology, not you or I. transhumanism is a persuasive, seductive and most importantly <em>reasonable</em> slippery slope that I believe logically results in merely more along a continuum of barbaric treatment of human consciousness, in this case through sophisticated eugenics-driven, scientifically endorsed stratification of classes, with tavistock institute style behavioral research being the scientific choice for informing governance, ultimately resulting in a Huxlian &#39;cyberproletariat,&#39; at the very bottom of a ladder of increasingly controlled information. the ultimate result of this centralized society would be a collection of power into an emergent technocratic elite. to witness, consider the emergent relationship  smartphone technology has with both a <em>concept</em> of personal freedom and the <em>reality</em> of intelligence gathering and data mining.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IMO, these movies are good for reaching people, and at the time, they had a rousing effect on a lot of people, but they must be moved beyond, and understood for the subtle influences they contain, for why the mistakes in the material are important, and for the context of elite philosophy they are a product of. </p>

<p>Honestly, looking forward toward so-called smart cities like <a href="http://forum.prisonplanet.com/index.php?topic=149587.0">Songdo</a> in S Korea, I find that the idealism present in Joseph&#39;s work is somewhat less likely than the world found in Charlie Brooker&#39;s excellent <a href="http://gorillavid.in/1z9sk0uh5ep6">15 Million Merits</a>. That&#39;s much more like the world I live in today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem I find in that statement is one I think White makes pretty important, and this is that where he contests zietgeist&#39;s sources&#39; claims, he does so due to their historical inaccuracy, as evidenced by historians stretching back to biblical times. His argument about Archarya S, and her influences, Gerald Masi, Kersey Graves, James Frazer, and Ed Carpenter is flawless without even having to go into actual scripture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. Peter Joseph is trite, unoriginal, and of poor character, yes, but more importantly, he is clearly a Theosophist, in support of mystical Freemasonry, and in support of the NWO, simply judging by the positions he argues whenever he argues anything. Much of what he says is deceptive, and much of what he seeks to promote is counterproductive and dangerous to people like us. I personally downvote all Peter Joseph stuff whenever I see it and recommend everyone else do the same - but only after doing some investigation and gaining an understanding of what is so illegitimate about his material.</p>

<p>I was fighting corruption before PJ was born, smartass. Is that all you&#39;ve got? An adhominem?</p>

<p>PJ has contributed nothing but his ability to compile youtube clips, hork other peoples&#39; ideas, and stroke his own ego.</p>

<p>As for original thoughts, I have them daily. They aren&#39;t always profound, but they are original and they are uniquely mine. I don&#39;t always share them with the public, and I NEVER EVER seek public recognition for them (at best, in a weak moment, I might seek the respect of my peers).</p>

<p>Next time you decide to take a potshot at someone you know nothing about, you might want to make sure they&#39;re not a respected member of the community in which you&#39;re making that potshot. I used to be a moderator here (not a good one, but I was voted in by the community... and, after sorting out some moderator drama, I chose to avoid that spotlight as well).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted one of my most significant original ideas on reddit no less than three times, trying to spread it. Only to be attacked by idiots who couldn&#39;t comprehend it. (A little programming hook that I wrote about 5 years ago, that the blind prefer to believe is impossible and refuse to even look at the code - dismissal and mockery being the easier path than investigation and understanding.) And, since they prefered their ignorance, I decided to just bury it in some encryption (that I designed myself). <a href="http://redd.it/h9vxn">Here&#39;s the link.</a></p>
