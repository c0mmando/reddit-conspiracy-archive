         Gas Mask Mysery solved?
        </strong>
        <em>
         Thanks to Harwood8907: "he is spotted removing his armor by police approaching from POINT A (on my image) in the above youtube video at 4:45. the officer sounds truly haunted by what he just saw and requests a marked car SABLE SIDE, suspect in a gas mask. this means Holmes turned and ran past his car toward Sable. Luckily the Police Commissioner was prepared at POINT C.
they met on the corner and Holmes drops his Gas Mask along with everything else. it is at this point when holmes claims to be the joker as the Police Commissioner reports finding Holmes in the Parking Lot carrying the Gas Mask.
at 5:00 you hear one officer ask "Is that the dude in the white car?" he doesn't mean a person is in the car, he's merely asking "Is that white car the shooter's?" because it was the only car parked back there so conveniently. it seems that Holmes was walked back to POINT B, where police had gathered to enter the theater/investigate the car, and place him under arrest as at 5:21 an officer witnesses the arrest from afar and says "Hold the air. Cars where that white car... is that a suspect?". you hear another officer say YES and announce what he finds in the car at 5:27 (Obviously from POINT B). "We've got rifles, gas masks, he's detained... and now we got an open door going into the theater." then he says "Hold that position, hold your suspect" and Holmes is placed in the back of a police car."
        </em>
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/x28pf/so_let_me_get_this_straight_holmes_gas_mask_was/">
        I saw a post discussing the location of the gas mask
       </a>
       - I figured there was an obvious explanation and started digging into the images released.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KilYc.jpg">
        OP's diagram
       </a>
       seems to be accurate.
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ytw6i.jpg">
        This is the gas mask,
       </a>
       it can be seen clearly tagged with (1), the first piece of evidence. In the background you can also see (3), but it is unclear what (3) is initially.
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ua9Cz.jpg">
        A different angle
       </a>
       reveals (3) blood, likely where the person who "bled out" started bleeding once again. This also shows the corner of the wall, which means it's on the right side of the building. All of this can be accepted as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you look at the blood trail coming out of the building,
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Dcbth.jpg">
        you notice the AR-15 to the left of the door as well as the notorious blood trail
       </a>
       This is the door Holmes used to enter and exit the building after the shooting. If you look closer, you can also see a pair of
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/79234.jpg">
        bloodstained pink sandals.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       At first, I thought there may be a logical explanation. Let's say this happened: an injured person may have snuck out of the theater through the entrance Holmes used and started running to make it around the corner of the building. They abandoned their pink sandals in the process. Then, when Holmes saw the blood trail when he left and followed it around the corner to see where his prey was. Frustrated, he started taking off his gear and ran back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boy, was I wrong. According to official parts of the story, the blood belongs to Allie Young who was assisted out of the building by friend, Stephanie Davies. (Who both survived).
       <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/miracle_amid_the_grief_MsZcfoCkixREy5BTBedfDJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=National">
        According to their statements,
       </a>
       Young and Davies were seated near the exit when Young noticed the shooter enter the building. She stood up to warn other theatergoers, but was immediately shot in the neck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then..
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Once the SWAT team came in, they were still trying to clear the theater. Stephanie then, with the help of several others, carries Allie across two parking lots to where the ambulance is waiting.’’
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Davies covered a wound to her artery and was carried out of the building by a group people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So either, Davies carried Young past Holmes or Holmes was already apprehended at that point.
       <strong>
        The blood stain seems to be explained with a logical explanation. The bloodstain left by Young was likely there after the gear and AR-15 were already on the ground.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        But what about the gas mask?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where it gets fishy. I dug around a bit trying to find out why it was there... Eventually I found out more than I ever was looking for. I only wanted to prove the blood stain made sense, which I feel the bloodstain does indeed make sense.
       <a href="http://www.thetorontopost.net/2012/07/aurora-massacre-what-does-location-of.html">
        This is an analysis of the cameras.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can read the whole thing, but I'll give you the TLDR.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/nJs6l.jpg">
        This image is necessary.
       </a>
       The whole back of the building is covered with security cameras. Directly under the security camera is where the Gas Mask was dropped, out of its view. The "real shooter" took off most of his or her gear and dropped the gun near Holmes car. Holmes was either in the car already or did indeed open the door for the real shooter (will explain this soon).
      </p>
      <p>
       The real shooter then ran (or walked) the length of the building, took of the mask concealing his/her identity under the security camera and got into a vehicle on the nearby street. You can see the street in

       image.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holmes, on the other hand, was probably drugged and possibly on some kind of binge. In his court case on Monday he seemed dazed, confused, and looked like he was coming down. Police described him as "meek" when he was arrested. Pictures taken from a few days prior (adult friend finder images) show him with
       <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/James-Holmes-AdultFriendFinder2.jpg">
        dilated pupils
       </a>
       . Compare his pupils to his
       <a href="http://thedirty.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DIRTY_phpRWd8BJ.jpg">
        mugshot days later:
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So.. what do I think may have happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point (Could it have been days? Weeks? Months?), James Holmes was trying met up with someone on AdultFriendFinder
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/x33iu/was_james_holmes_set_up_my_analysis_of_the_blood/c5irgaa">
        Thanks to karmabastard - the woman is actually a photo of Keeley Hazell.
       </a>
       <del>
        (I ask, who is the Blonde in the picture above?)  Maybe that was a prostitute (paid for by the real murderer), the real murderer, or someone in on the plot. Holmes had a good night, did various drugs/got slipped drugs, and then was "kept" by his kidnappers.  Holmes was repeatedly given drugs, which could have driven him insane on a long binge.
       </del>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit: Holmes allegedly
        <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/sneed/13953335-452/aurora-gunman-james-eagan-holmes-was-found-with-vicodin-when-arrested.html">
         had vicodin on him
        </a>
        when he was arrested.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       (Added in an edit): Now that the image of the woman is debunked, is it possible that Holmes was intercepted by someone he met on AdultFriendFinder or the internet? Apparently he was trying to solicit women a few days before the event happened. If this is the case, is that person involved? Even though the blonde woman has been debunked, is it possible that he met up with someone days or months earlier and was drugged or kept captive? If you're looking for a place to get a "body," any internet site would be ideal. Lure Holmes in with a pretty lady, slip him something strong, get him hooked on amphetamines or pain killers, and boom - he'll do anything for his next fix. "Go in the theater, buy a ticket for xxx, and open the door when I call your cellphone." Putting someone on high doses of drugs constantly for a month, especially amphetamines or bath salts, would certainly send them into psychosis. I say this because he oddly moved from San Diego to Colorado
       <del>
        and dropped out of college only a month earlier
       </del>
       a year earlier and then dropped out of college last month. At which point, I believe he started purchasing his arsenal and equipment. Was it even Holmes who purchased this or just someone using his bank account/credit cards? What if Holmes was on a
       <del>
        month
       </del>
       long binge (willingly or unwillingly) at this point? Could Holmes have already been drugged/sedated at the point the weapons were purchased? Holmes appeared to be in psychosis or a mania during the court hearing - usually a psychosis is the result of prolonged drug use, not single usage. What if Holmes was kept in some type of dark room pumped full of drugs with The Dark Knight playing repeatedly?
      </p>
      <p>
       (Same edit continued)
      </p>
      <p>
       During this time, Holmes' apartment was rigged with explosives and his credit cards were used to purchase weapons/equipment online. Other preparations were made as Holmes went more insane. When Holmes was arrested, he was clueless and probably on something - he thought he was part of a movie and probably thought he was still tripping.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, it means Holmes went out of the range of the security camera, took his mask off, and walked back to his car. For what reason?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing I speculate is that Holmes was just trying to help someone into the theater. He may have legitimately had a ticket, but was told to open the door for a "friend." I still speculate it's someone he met online. At which point he was put in the car, given a large dose of drugs (or was already on drugs), and was already beginning to trip when police got there.

       that's my most logical prediction, the most Probable truth BUT, i DO also think it sounds like he may have been half conscious in the car seat the whole time, explaining how calm the police are, and in court he seems suspiciously brain dead. His whole situation is HIGHLY similar to Theodore Kaczynski's
      </p>
      <p>
       Young genius studying with high rank professors on a Government grant, taken aside to participate in top secret experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a paragraph from Ted's wikipedia article:
"He also participated in a multiple-year personality study conducted by Dr. Henry Murray, an expert on stress interviews.[12] Students in Murray's study were told they would be debating personal philosophy with a fellow student.[13] Instead they were subjected to a "purposely brutalizing psychological experiment"[13] stress test, which was an extremely stressful, personal, and prolonged psychological attack. During the test, students were taken into a room, strapped into a chair and connected to electrodes that monitored their physiological reactions, while facing bright lights and a two-way mirror. Each student had previously written an essay detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations: the essays were turned over to an anonymous attorney, who would enter the room and individually belittle each strapped-down student based in part on the disclosures they had made. This was filmed, and students' expressions of impotent rage were played back to them several times later in the study. According to author Alston Chase, Kaczynski's records from that period suggest he was emotionally stable when the study began. Kaczynski's lawyers attributed some of his emotional instability and dislike of mind control to his participation in this study.[13][14] Indeed, some have suggested that this experience may have been instrumental in Kaczynski's future actions."

       was James Holmes taken aside during his Nueroscience studies to participate in experiments like this? the world will never know.

       he may intentionally want to imitate the UNABOMBER as his Neighbor states that he idolized him.

       [By JUDI JAMES, Body Language Expert
JAMES Holmes is displaying bizarre body language.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is striking is how much his court appearance contrasts with the pictures he posted on Facebook, where we see him smirking directly at the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       In court he looks like he’s just waking up from a bad dream, with very exaggerated blinking as though he can barely keep awake, and head-rolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the judge tells him he is accused of first-degree murder, he rolls his eyes as if it’s a huge surprise to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is the person who donned a gas mask, acquired an arsenal and opened fire in a cinema then to behave like this in court means he is acting or he has had a dramatic change in his mental state.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not a medical expert, but drugs or delayed shock could possibly cause such a flip.](

       I couldn't remember what her actual title was at the time as the Sun website was down but seems that she is a "body language expert".  So no actual qualifications apart from experience talking about what the Big Brother contestants and doing etc.

       I don't see a ventilation system on the
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KilYc.jpg">
        roof
       </a>
       at the location of the supposed camera. I do agree though that
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lggZm.jpg">
        this image
       </a>
       isn't really solid evidence that there's a security camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I will say that I am fairly certain
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CPXto.jpg">
        this is a security camera
       </a>
       on the front of the building. If there's a white security cameras on the front. I'd
       <strong>
        assume
       </strong>
       there'd be a similar style security system on the back. If there is a security camera on the back, it'd be mounted at a similar level on the building (the white dot in the grainy picture is in the same position) Additionally, if it's on the corner of the right side of the building, I'd also
       <strong>
        assume
       </strong>
       it uses the best angle to get the
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/P1hun.jpg">
        best vantage point.
       </a>
       . Would it be pointing down the red line or green line? Probably the green line, as it'd cover the rear exit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they have surveillance on the back of their building? Easy, graffiti and people who let other people in the movie without a ticket.

       , you'll see two objects on the roof that I'm not even sure are cameras, they might be loud speakers. At the risk of enraging you (as I see in other replies you've made), I think your theory is completely ludicrous.  I won't bother with an explanation because people who think like you do not listen to people who do not agree with them.   With that said, I really enjoyed reading your analysis and looking at the photos.  I thought it was interesting, so don't kill me please.

       Thanks for the input! Don't worry, I'm not one of the fellas who gets angered. All of my explanations were meant to address possible/rational explanations that
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       explain it, even if slightly unlikely. I honestly didn't mean to come off as a dick in any of my replies, I just wanted to try to explain how it could be a possibility.

       The community in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has always been too aggressive for me and makes too many personal attacks. I don't really think that kind of behavior is at all useful for finding the truth, so I try not to do it myself. People stand behind their theory all too often while ignoring valid input, like yours. In the end, it kind of removes some credit from the community (IMO) because obviously not every notion posted is correct. If you think my explanation is ludicrous, I accept that and I can see exactly why you'd believe that. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered and creates a lot of holes that contradict itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is, without further evidence it's only speculation as to what happened. I'm trying to piece together a puzzle that might not even be a puzzle with pieces from 100 different puzzles. Each thing speculated creates an infinite series of paths that could have happened.

       I'm working on a possible tie. He seems to have received a research grant from the National Institutes of Health, 26 Grand IIRC.

       From a more rational side, could he have blown the 26k on tons of drugs in the month prior and just snapped? Or could he have experimented on himself with what he studied: temporal illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really fucked up if you think about it, he may have honestly felt that he could go back and change the past if he did something like this, especially if he was studying it. He spent the grant money on what he was studying.

       Edit: By the way, thanks for the great information. I desperately want this to be a shooter independent of the government.

       If this is the case and it's a cover-up the reasoning could be to prevent a lawsuit. But then, why would it be a massacre?

       Of course, the simpler reason is that he may have just been crazy and was the actual one to do the crime.

       That is interesting. I wonder when people who knew him will start speaking up. Surely, if he was in academia, he did not go by unnoticed by some very intelligent people. Where are they? His "drinking buddy" says he was obsessed with Ted? I don't buy it. Too easy, neat, and tidy.

       That's from when he was 18, at a science camp. He was in a PHD program prior to the shooting, and is now 24 years of age. What he was studying at a science camp 6 years ago is not inditicative of what he's working on now.

       Also, I don't think you understand how grants work. I work at a university (incidentally, way way underneath a neuroscience department (which doesn't at all study neuroscience)), and I barely understand it... but, his department will have written a grant proposal, asking for a certain amount of money to cover a certain time period, for specific departmental programs/projects; they then allocate the money to researchers (such as Holmes) who will support the program.
      </p>
      <p>
       NIH grants support an enormous amount of our country's research programs.

       You're spot on. I'm making the assumption that it's makes no sense for him to take off his
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5FAOT.jpg">
        gas mask, gloves, and a few other various items
       </a>
       ~225+ feet from where he took off
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pN20f.jpg">
        his helmet, body armor, and other miscellaneous items
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see his car in this image with the gas mask on the
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/u4WGO.jpg">
        far end
       </a>
       . Assuming he walked (yes, I know, an assumption) a 440 foot round trip at 3 miles per hour, that's about a 1.5-2 minute walk. The time table definitely allows him to do so, but why would he? I still don't understand that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was wearing a helmet, the helmet probably came off before the gas mask (once again, an assumption), meaning he walked the length of the building with the gas mask, turned around, and came back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's impossible for that to be the case, it's just fishy as hell if it really is a security camera.

       It's possible he left the theater to pursue someone fleeing in the direction the gas mask was found. Chased them, found it hard to run/breathe with the gas mask on, and took it off where it was found. After not catching who he was after, he ran back to where the car was in an attempt to get back into the theater.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did he take the gear off before or after the cops arrived?

      </p>
      <p>
       This occurred at the premiere showing of this movie. How did he know what time the first gunfight scene would come on screen? Was he waiting outside with his gear on, listening at the door for the gunfire to start so he could barge in? Or was the person inside actually making a call out when the scene began?

       If he was partying with someone he thought was a friend who realized he was slowly slipping into delusions thinking he was the joker, I don't see why he wouldn't. He probably just got his hair dyed and was whacked out on something. He may have never realized the friend was messing with him who got him addicted to drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The person said "Hey take pictures" and used it on a profile that the friend created. Hence it says "Visit me in jail" and "Short/average" penis, kind of as a taunt?

       Thing is he couldn't have created the bombs by himself in less than one month, he wouldn't be able to afford the apartment he got just 1 week earlier, he was in a neuroscience project, its at a time when dozen major events are going around the world.

      <p>
       All false flag cases are always sealed, while any other cases are fully open to the public and no one even writes or cares about them and there are literally thousand such cases every day.

       I think they sent a pro in to do the shooting, then dropped this poor mind controlled/Hypnotized(its a real thing look up derren brown the assassin)/drugged up patsy. They did it to sway public opinion on gun laws, probably online gun laws.

       This might be a stupid question but I have to ask, since there was so many explosives in front of the door of his apartment, killing anybody who would've got in, how did he got out of there that night? We clearly saw pictures where the police was in a firetruck ladder to access the window of his apartment so he could not have jumped out of it...

       Look at this image for
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/nJs6l.jpg">
        context
       </a>
       . The upper left corner is the back of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       The security camera was close to the corner of the building pointing towards Holmes car. It wasn't a camera recording all angles, just the way it was aimed. If the shooter dropped the mask/gloves and ran for the road (see upper left image, they wouldn't have been caught on camera).
      </p>
      <p>
       The getaway car would be either parked on the side of the street or driven by someone who picked the shooter up.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Also the fact that if Holmes was in the car like you say, he would also be on camera
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If there's a second shooter, the authorities definitely know about it. Details may not be released in order to reduce panic or if it's a cover-up. If the back of the theater was not properly lit, it may not pick anyone up on camera - especially someone sitting inside of a car. However, if the street is the getaway the person needed to pass the camera before the authorities got there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Holmes was in the car the whole time sedated or had just gotten a dose of a psychoactive compound after leaving the theater, when he emerged out of the car loaded with guns due to the commotion he'd instantly be considered the shooter and other evidence would be overlooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another possibility is what if Holmes was told to meet at the car for a drug deal behind the theater? He could have been dropped off on the street midway through a tweak and told to walk towards the white car. At this point, the real shooter would already be out of the gas mask and get in the same car. When he gets to the car, it's full of weapons and the police raid in. The next 48 hours would be Holmes drugged and then coming down - he'd probably be in psychosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all speculation and just theory, I don't necessarily believe it's true - I just think something is fishy here with the mask especially. The shooting started at 12:38 and Holmes was apprehended at 12:45. I figured this was also worth mentioning: If he walked 170ft, that'd take about 1 minute for the round trip. Not to mention, taking all of his gear off and the shooting itself. Definitely not saying it's improbable or anywhere near impossible.

       I agree with dasstrooper that the images do not conclude the location of cameras or the angle they point or anything of the like. I wouldn't go as far as to say there are no cameras though. If you attempt to look at the light posts lining the grass/carpark from arial view you can see that they are smudged/compressed out although the shadows indicate they are actually there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worth noting though there are no such shadows indicating a camera on the roof.

       Anyone from the area care to go take a photo and confirm? :)

       Here's
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/x33iu/was_james_holmes_set_up_my_analysis_of_the_blood/c5ixq1l">
        my reply
       </a>
       regarding security cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me also assert this if it wasn't clear from my posts. I'm not trying to claim this is what happened. I just think the location of the gas mask is suspicious, especially if you consider the official story of the blood stains. If the blood stains happened after the suspect was apprehended, it is confusing to me why Holmes would have gone down there. I posted this more to explain the blood stains and show it wasn't really suspicious, then came across the security camera theory and it honestly blew my mind. If there are not cameras there, then it obviously is a flawed theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       However,
       <strong>
        if
       </strong>
       there is a security camera there, it'd make more sense why he or someone else would unmask there. You have to remember he took off his other items (including a ballistic helmet) far away from the gas mask.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only other reason I think he'd have to go down there is maybe to gain entry to the theater on the right side of the building. After he realized it was locked or empty already, he walked back to his car. He wouldn't have had his AR-15 (because it jammed) so that being behind the door makes sense to me. He may have been armed with the shotgun and pistol, which he'd probably keep carrying. But it also appears he got rid of the gloves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming the official story, he also may have just gotten confused, especially if he was under the influence of something or was in the middle of a psychotic episode. Maybe he realized it was real and tried to get away but realized it was too late - who knows. I seriously thank you for your input, even if it is critical of mine. I agree, there's definitely not anywhere near enough evidence to call it a video camera.

       See I read this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Madman James Holmes was forced to switch weapons when his Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P 15, with a special 100-round drum magazine, failed after a few shots.
       </p>
       <p>
        A senior FBI agent said: “If his firing mechanism had not seized, he could have wiped out the entire audience in a few minutes.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So I figured it was a rifle issue not a magazine issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do love the sensationalism of the press
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “It could have been an almost unimaginably devastating scen­ario. This weapon has only one purpose – to kill as many people as quickly as possible.”

       Could have been the rifle but anyone with AR15 training knows the first thing you do is drop the mag, clear the gun and throw another clip in. They teach it in all military basic training and since his father and grandfather were military it isn't so far fetched that he may have been taught to do this. I still believe there is more to this than meets the eye but playing devils advocate a bit.
      </p>

       This is why AKs are better. I will never own a AR15 but AKs and SKS all fuckin day!

       Actually what they teach in all military basic training is SPORTS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slap: the MAGAZINE (not clip) to ensure it is seated fully
      </p>
      <p>
       Pull: back the charging handle
      </p>
      <p>
       Observe: the chamber to see if there are any obstructions (remove if needed)
      </p>
      <p>
       Release: the charging handle
      </p>
      <p>
       Tap: the forward assist to ensure the bolt is fully seated
      </p>
      <p>
       Squeeze: the trigger
      </p>
      <p>
       My M4 has worked flawlessly with thousands of rounds. The whole jamming thing comes from the early ARs when they used junky ball powder that, when mixed with humid conditions, caused the weapon to fail to extract the fired cartridge.
      </p>

       I am still curious about the stray shield.

       Why dye your hair (The wrong color) and wear full (face covering) gear? Why say not one word to anyone from start to present day? How (which this could probably be explained easily) does he know so much about guns ammunition traps and explosives? Why at 24 years old graduating with honors and an outstanding future ahead would you throw it all away? Why is he not like every other mass murderer, arrogant, yelling crazy shit, etc... Why is everything in the case going so fast like it is being rushed? I have 3 answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       1: He stumbled upon something neurological that has been going on for years and was promptly silenced by the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       2: he stumbled upon something in his research of illusory or whatever it was he was researching, and used it on himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       3: just a normal nerdy kid with few friends no girlfriend and all that studying leads him to just snap (this one I doubt).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any one thinking that this whole thing is wrong and that something real wrong is going on, you are probably right. Not one thing out of all of this makes sense, nor does any of it feel right. Look into it cause this kid here might not have even been in the theater when it happend. I mean the first officer on the scene told the media present about events he could not have possibly witnessed.

       I would agree with the assessment of scopolamine. Others have mentioned amphetamines, painkillers, LSD, etc, but scopolamine would be a much more likely candidate. It would be easy to control him, have him purchase weapons and set up an apartment lease while under those effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       LSD doesn't really allow you to control people so much as put them in a state where they may be unsure of where they are, but from my experience I wouldn't just be sitting in a car, happy to talk to cops.

       Scopolamine seems to have gained "prestige" in America recently with various documentaries and coverage. I remember reading about it two years ago, being very surprised, and now it's become a part of lexicon. Demented organized criminals may be looking to experiment with the possibilities of this drug as an essential piece in the terrorism toolbox.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fear the worst. This drug has been used in South America with a litany of bad outcomes. If the troubled minds of the United States get a hold of it, well look what they can get away with.

       All reports say he had 100mg of vicodin, which honestly, is nothing. From my understanding, vicodin comes in 500mg and larger pills anyway, so I think there may be some bad info there. I would like to hear results from a toxicology report though.

       No. The "tylenol" portion of the pill has a high mg count usually 500 or750.  However the hydrocodone portion that gets you high is usually 5 or 7.5 mg.  So he most likely had 20 Vicodin on him, which would be enough to be very similar  to a heroin high.

       Heroin makes you relaxed and sleepy. Just saying. I knew plenty of Heroin users and not one of them could easily perform the motor functions it takes to shoot reload clear jams etc, as they say JH did. Although vicodin has many different effects on people. My wife cleans the house when she has to take her pain pills. Everyoneresponds differently.

       It doesn't take advanced motor skills to clear a jam. It doesn't take advanced anything to operate a gun. Its easy as shit. Much easier than driving a car, much much easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit.  Heroin and Vicodin have the exact same action on the brain.  Both incredibly strong opiates.  Only difference is its easier to ingest larger dose age of heroin since its more potent per gram of weight.  High doses of Vicodin are almost identical to a dose of heroin.

       Ok I see what you are saying that chemically they might be strong opiates, but take it from someone who has seen addicts and users of both they make people act different. I knew a woman that was addicted to crack, but to get off of it she took vicodin because it made her feel and act the same way as crack did. I currently am married to someone who has chronic back pain and has had to take vicodin. When she takes it she can't sit still the way the chemicals react with her is the opposite of what it would be in me or some other person. That being said I am curious if JH was on 100mg of what exactly beacause that really ain't shit for a vicodin.

       Yeah it is.  100 mg of Vicodin is 20 pills and will make you just about as high as snorting heroin.  The high may make some people hyper and active or nod out. But 100 mg is a big dose that will fuck you up.  Trust me.  Also taking Vicodin to get off crack is the most ridicuos thing I've ever heard.

       Sorry I might be misunderstanding, my wife takes 2-3 500mg Vicodin pills for back pain, and she rarely gets a high from it. I guess if he was taking PURE Vicodin then it might be different, but I've never heard of people being able to get that. I still like the Scopolomine theory best. Clearly there was some accomplice of some sort.

       Yeah that lady was a dumb bitch, she got off the crack but took like 30 vicodin a day, and she freaked the fuck out when she didn't have any. It was sad really.

       Your wife isn't taking 500mg pills she is taking 5mg pills.  The 500mg references the amount of acetaminophen or tylenol advil etc that is compounded with the 5mg of Vicodin.  The 500 mg measurement is irrelevant as acetaminophen has no pychoactive effects.  The bottle will say 500 mg acet. and 5 mg hyrocodone.  So 100mgs of Vicodin is referring to how much hydrocodone he allegedly had, which would be 20 pills, enough to get high as shit.

       So how do we know that isn't what they were referring to when they said 100mg? It all seems pretty sketchy to me. I would like to see an actual drug screening. But of course we won't ever get to know the tru story here.

       Because only people who have no experience or knowledge of drugs would reference that.  There is not even a vicodin  pill in existence that has 100mg acetaminophen anyways.  Ask any doctor ever.

       Excellent info. But would the news reference the pills as 100mg of pure hydrocodone, or 100mg of "vicodin", which would be the mixture?

       He probably took some of the vicodin, for precaution. If he was high on a strong painkiller and got shot, hed just keep on mowing people down. vicodin and adrenaline could really keep a man standing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same motivation to stay standing is probably the justification to all the armor. It probably had little to do with expecting a shoot out with the cops (if he was expecting a shoot out why would he surrender so easily?). He just wanted to take out as many as possible.

       I'm really interested to see what she'll say, hopefully the evidence comes out.

       If Holmes was a good fella just looking for an AdultFriendFinder hookup months earlier (I'm aware he only created the account a few days earlier, but what if it's not his only account? Hence penis=small/average size and "Visit me in jail") and he did find a "fuck buddy," what if that person introduced him to strong drugs? IE, he willingly took it the first time, was around people who did it commonly (his fuck buddy), and then was supplied by them (or bought them with his grant).
      </p>
      <p>
       That person may have gotten him to move to Colorado, quit school, etc.,
      </p>
      <p>
       He may have been willingly taking the drugs initially, realizing it expanded on/helped him understand his "temporal illusion" theories and then became a willing fiend. Eventually, he just slips into psychosis and is used in a massive murder. However, he wouldn't want his mother to know so he'd cut off communications from her or talk to her weirdly/out of character.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gas mask's position really does mess with me though, it being taken off under security cameras is the strangest thing to me. If he does think he's the Joker, it'd work perfectly, too. He's fooling cops into thinking he's the real murderer while another is still out there.

       I'm not sure if that's bad grammar, or if you both are really under the impression that he moved to Colorado last month. There's nothing odd about moving to Colorado to attend grad school.

       But dropping out of the program last month is more interesting. Too bad the school won't comment on why he dropped out.

       It's much more difficult to slip into psychosis from drug use than you think. It generally comes from HEAVY abuse.  Let's use LSD.  A standard dose can be from 2-10 hits(200-1000micrograms).  A heavy dose can be up to 100 hits or more(hearing of 400-500 hit trips).  Those who slip into that psychosis don't generally do it from one/a few uses.  It takes regular use of these harder substances to decay the mind to a delusional state.

       I don't think you really could, that's ~90 feet, or a 5 feet short of a full basketball court.

       What about the

       It'd have had to have been kicked far at least 3 times even if it was 10 parking spaces.

       The logical explanation I have after thinking about it during the last hour of replies is that he may have been trying to get into the door on that side of the theater.

       It took the cops 60-90 secs to respond after the initial calls starting coming in, which I'm assuming were almost immediately after the attack began.
      </p>
      <p>
       He then exited after going through four guns worth of ammunition, ran down the back only to try to enter another exit door and realize he couldn't get in, strip off his mask and gloves and then return to his car, strip off his other tactical gear and get into his vehicle before police apprehended him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this is possible, it doesn't sound very plausiable. I'm curious to see if the footage from the camera in the rear is released as this would clear up a lot of these questions.

       But why would he even think he could get in? He took the measure to keep the emergency exit door he walked out of initially propped open, as those doors are locked from the outside.

       I think after he left the building he dropped his jammed AR-15. Then he walked to his car, took off his helmet (he'd take this off before the gas mask) and body armor. Then, he ended up on the right side of the building (see the edit at the top of my main post, it seems someone discovered the reasoning on police radios) and took off his gas mask. I was under the impression he was arrested at his car, but this may not be the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think for sure he took the helmet off then the gas mask.

       Excellent review of this increasingly suspicious case. You put to words exactly what I have been thinking as I read more and more into this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what would be the real motive for any entity to create a terror threat like this? In other threads, some have mentioned the UN small arms treaty, but I seriously doubt this would have an effect on that.

       I don't necessarily think it's related to governmental entities, but it could be. The two dead military raise questions (especially with news of the Grants) as well as the small arms treaty.

       It also could have just been someone wanting to commit mass murder and get away with it. Holmes could also have been a lesser figure in the crime, assuming he is just crazy. There could be two shooters, one escapes.

       I don't know if this has been posted but I've been reading about this non stop now so just wondering. 
Did anybody consider how heavy this gear was along with the guns and ammo. How much would all that stuff weigh I'm guessing around 100 pounds . I'm about his size I can't imagine running around for 3 minutes breathing in a gas mask while doped up carrying all that shit.  Then running a couple hundred feet dropping off the mask then going back in time and not be out of breath when the cops show up. Sorry if this is too unreadable.

       Yeah, that's what I thought at first, but then I was wondering why two cars would have been parked back there...and where did this KIA go? I have the full 3 hour recording as well.. but this part is taken out of it and there is even a part that loops (that's why I figured it had been tampered with since I originally heard it)

       Yes they do. Bathsalts refer to a variety of potent amphetamine RCs (research chemicals), such as 5FMA, Mephedrone, and 6FMA. They also refer to stuff like Methylone - which is all bad. 5FMA &amp; 6FMA are borderline psychedelic.
      </p>
      <p>
       RCs are pretty damn cheap and have a low dosing - $20 of RCs can last probably as long as ~$200+ of street drugs. They're easy to take super high doses (Most are potent in 50-100mg doses) and a 1-2 week binge on them can send someone into psychosis.

       Amphetamines are not psychedelics. Some of the RCs have crossover properties, sure, but I think "bath salts" refers specifically to the amphetamine and cathinone (very amphetamine-like) derivatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       MDAI, for example, has structural and entheogenic (induces spiritual experience) similarities to MDMA. Many RCs are tryptamine based (DMT derivatives galore), and these are by and large psychadelic. But I don't consider these chems to be bath salts, per se. There is no specific reason for this distinction, suffice it to say that the tryptamine powders have never been marketed as "bath salts"; Not to my knowledge (I've done some consultation in this field).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prolonged use of amphetamines may very well lead to hallucinations and psychosis, but this is due to a combinatorial effect of sleep deprivation, chemical imbalance and exhaustion, rather than any particularly "hallucinogenic" effect of the drug. Also, these episodes are by and large violent and aggressive in nature (Not, hello Mr. Police, I'm the Joker LOL). I put my dollars on that he wasn't on salts or any RCs in general.

       can you provide a link to legally obtainable bath salts that contain the chemicals you've mentioned?

       it seems absurd that a product could be sold with ingredients that are actually psychoactive or even psychedelic.

       Its easy as shit to get online. Silk road you can get every drug made easy as pie, if you know how to use tor browser. Most bath salt formulas are absolutely psychoactive, especially after a night or two with no sleep. Source...

      <p>
       Edit.  I'm not going to link you there.  If you really are interested spend 20 minutes installing tor and finding the silk road URL.  You can currently buy meth heroin "bath salts" coke pills ecstasy lsd mushrooms etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Mephedronenow.com or net used to be incredibly easy to order salts from.  Not sure about now though.  There's shit tons of sites like that, motivated people can easily find them.

       Yeah then dont be so matter of fact about things you have no facts on, it comes of arrogant and douchey.  Also every ellict drug can produce psychedelic experiences in people.

       Yes they do. Bathsalts refer to a variety of potent amphetamine RCs (research chemicals), such as 5FMA, Mephedrone, and 6FMA. They also refer to stuff like Methylone - which is all bad. 5FMA &amp; 6FMA are borderline psychedelic.
      </p>
      <p>
       RCs are pretty damn cheap and have a low dosing - $20 of RCs can last probably as long as ~$200+ of street drugs. They're easy to take super high doses (Most are potent in 50-100mg doses) and a 1-2 week binge on them can send someone into psychosis.

       It's much more difficult to slip into psychosis from drug use than you think. It generally comes from HEAVY abuse.  Let's use LSD.  A standard dose can be from 2-10 hits(200-1000micrograms).  A heavy dose can be up to 100 hits or more(hearing of 400-500 hit trips).  Those who slip into that psychosis don't generally do it from one/a few uses.  It takes regular use of these harder substances to decay the mind to a delusional state.

       I'm not sure if that's bad grammar, or if you both are really under the impression that he moved to Colorado last month. There's nothing odd about moving to Colorado to attend grad school.

      <p>
       But dropping out of the program last month is more interesting. Too bad the school won't comment on why he dropped out.
