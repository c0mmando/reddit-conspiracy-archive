(<a href="http://www.dailypaul.com/246012/shooter-james-holmes-and-darpa-weird-science">http://www.dailypaul.com/246012/shooter-james-holmes-and-darpa-weird-science</a>)</p>

<p>Wayne Madsen Report</p>

<p>July 23-24, 2012 -- Aurora massacre: several links between James Holmes and U.S. government research (Salk Institute involved in neurologically enhancing soldiers&#39; abilities on battlefield...connections to DARPA)</p>

<p>James Holmes, the 24-year old suspect in the mass shooting of Batman &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; movie goers in Aurora, Colorado that left 12 people dead and 58 injured, has had a number of links to U.S. government-funded research centers. Holmes&#39;s past association with government research projects has prompted police and federal law enforcement officials to order laboratories and schools with which Holmes has had a past association not to talk to the press about Holmes.</p>

<p>Holmes was one of six recipients of a National Institutes of Health Neuroscience Training Grant at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Denver. Holme is a graduate of the University of California at Riverside with a Bachelor of Science degree in neuroscience. Although Holmes dropped out of the PhD neuroscience program at Anschutz in June, police evacuated two buildings at the Anschutz center after the massacre at the Aurora movie theater. Holmes reportedly gave a presentation at the Anschutz campus in May on Micro DNA Biomarkers in a class titled &quot;Biological Basis of Psychiatric and Neurological Disorders.&quot;</p>

<p>Initial reports of Holmes having an accomplice in the theater shooting have been discounted by the Aurora police. However, no explanation has been given by police why the Anschutz campus buildings were evacuated after Holmes was already in custody in the Arapahoe County jail.</p>

<p>The Anschutz Medical Campus is on the recently de-commisioned site of the U.S. Army&#39;s Fitzsimons Army Medical Center and is named after Philip Anschutz, the billionaire Christian fundamentalist oil and railroad tycoon who also owns The Examiner newspaper chain and website and the neo-conservative Weekly Standard. The Anschutz Medical Campus was built by a $91 million grant from the Anschutz Foundation.</p>

<p>In 2006, at the age of 18, Holmes served as a research intern at the Salk Institute at the University of California at San Diego in La Jolla. It is noteworthy that for the previous two years before Holmes worked at the Salk Institute, the research center was partnered with the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Columbia University, University of California at San Francisco, University of Wisconsin at Madison, Wake Forest University, and the Mars Company (the manufacturers of Milky Way and Snickers bars) to prevent fatigue in combat troops through the enhanced use of epicatechina, a blood flow-increasing and blood vessel-dilating anti-oxidant flavanol found in cocoa and, particularly, in dark chocolate.</p>

<p>The research was part of a larger DARPA program known as the &quot;Peak Soldier Performance Program,&quot; which involved creating brain-machine interfaces for battlefield use, including human-robotic bionics for legs, arms, and eyes. DARPA works closely with the Defense Science Office on projects that include the medical research community. Fitzsimons was at the forefront of DARPA research on the use of brain-connected &quot;neuroprosthetic&quot; limbs for soldiers amputated or paralyzed in combat.</p>

<p>According to his LinkedIn profile, James Holmes&#39;s father, Dr. Robert Holmes, who received a PhD in Statistics in 1981 from the University of California at Berkeley, worked for San Diego-based HNC Software, Inc. from 2000 to 2002. HNC, known as a &quot;neural network&quot; company, and DARPA, beginning in 1998, have worked on developing &quot;cortronic neural networks,&quot; which would allow machines to interpret aural and visual stimuli to think like humans. The cortronic concept was developed by HNC Software&#39;s chief scientist and co-founder, Robert Hecht-Nielsen. HNC merged with the Minneapolis-based Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO), a computer analysis and decision-making company. Robert Holmes continues to work at FICO.</p>

<p>It has also emerged that Holmes, when he was 20, worked as a camp counselor at Camp Max Straus of the Jewish Big Brothers and Sister of Los Angeles. According to the Jewish Journal, among other tasks, Holmes helped to teach boys between the ages of 7 to 10 archery. In another unusual detail, the car Holmes used to drive to the Aurora movie theater had Tennessee plates. Holmes is originally from San Diego.</p>

<p>James Holmes is the grandson of Lt. Col. Robert Holmes, one of the first Turkish language graduates of the Army Language School, later the Defense Language Institute, in Monterey, California. Graduating from the Turkish language class in 1948, Holmes spent a career in the Army, which likely included more than a few intelligence-related assignments. Typically, U.S. military officers conversant in Turkish served with either the Defense Intelligence Agency or the Central Intelligence Agency at either the U.S. embassy in Ankara or the Consulate General in Istanbul, or both.</p>

<p>Terrence Sejnowski, the Francis Crick Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and the director of the Computational Neurobiology Laboratory, in an interview with Cognitive Science Online in 2008, had the following comment about recent studies of the human brain: &quot;Alan Newell [cognitive psychology researcher at the intelligence community-linked RAND Corporation] once said that when AI [artificial intelligence] was founded not enough was known about the brain to be of any help and in the early 1980s, symbol processing was the only game in town. That has changed and we now know a lot about the brain, perhaps more than we need to know [emphasis added].&quot;</p>

<p>More than we need to know!</p>

<p>The links between the younger and elder Holmes and U.S. government research on creating super-soldiers, human brain-machine interfaces, and human-like robots beg the question: &quot;Was James Holmes engaged in a real-life Jason Bourne TREADSTONE project that broke down and resulted in deadly consequences in Aurora, Colorado?&quot; In any event, if the Batman movies are now serving as a newer version of J.D. Salinger&#39;s &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; subliminal messaging triggering mechanism, -- Salinger&#39;s novel was of interest to a number of American political assassins --</p>

<p>Holmes seems to have received a research grant from the National Institutes of Health, 26 Grand IIRC. According to budget information, the NIH is partially funded by public/private donations, but also shares funding and real estate with The Department of Veterans Affairs, and multiple DoD entities, including a Cybersecurity Department,DARPA and the Office of Security and Strategic Information. (OSSI)</p>

<p>National Institutes of Health . ...... Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense to share medical facilities and expands authorities for urban organizations.</p>

<p>DARPA’S BIO-REVOLUTION
DARPA is hard at work spearheading a “Bio-Revolution.” This broad-spectrum strategic thrust
develops and leverages advances in all areas of biological and medical sciences to improve
Department of Defense (DoD) capabilities. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEsQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.darpa.mil%2FWorkArea%2FDownloadAsset.aspx%3Fid%3D2581&amp;ei=pxIPULTHKMie6gG5xYHADA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGtA635l_MstYxLa02sMtrJIkjDTg">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEsQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.darpa.mil%2FWorkArea%2FDownloadAsset.aspx%3Fid%3D2581&amp;ei=pxIPULTHKMie6gG5xYHADA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGtA635l_MstYxLa02sMtrJIkjDTg</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most frightening of DARPA&#39;s weaponized science projects are those that deal with militarily enhancing that most violent of apes – man. In its 2003 strategic plan, DARPA touted the &quot;Enhanced Human Performance&quot; component of its &quot;Bio-Revolution&quot; program whose aim is to prevent humans from &quot;becoming the weakest link in the U.S. military.&quot; Lest rats, bees, and trees become the dominant warriors, Enhanced Human Performance will &quot;exploit the life sciences to make the individual warfighter stronger, more alert, more endurant, and better able to heal.&quot; Yes, what now captivates DARPA researchers once captivated comic-book readers – the dream of creating a real-life Captain America, that weakling-turned-Axis-smashing-super-patriot by way of &quot;super soldier serum.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder why that is? They claim he was just another crazy who snapped when the opportunity presented itself, so why would they withhold surveillance video unless there is something more to the story that they don&#39;t want to become general knowledge? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most interesting part of this is that they evacuated Anschutz after he was in custody. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m guessing they also evacuated the entire apartment building he lived in. My assumption is that they suspected he may have set up similar traps or bombs in his school, and that they wanted to look there for clues. And so they&#39;d issue an evacuation just in case the search for clues uncovered bombs.</p>

<p>The DARPA/NIH/Salk stuff seems only mildly notable. But who knows!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most well written thing to come out of this so far, and gives me better thinking points. I&#39;m glad it was finally revealed he had access to grant money so people arent all going OMG WHERE DID HE GET MONEY$$$ FROM.</p>

<p>This certainly makes me err less on the side of caution, when people up to now have what I feel been grasping at straws without a full complement of info available to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great info thanks. There&#39;s something about the whole case that&#39;s seems fishy to me. From day one it something seemed odd about the whole thing...  One article which add to the suspicion:</p>

<p><a href="http://denver.cbslocal.com/2013/01/02/james-holmes-supporter-i-have-written-to-him/">http://denver.cbslocal.com/2013/01/02/james-holmes-supporter-i-have-written-to-him/</a></p>

<p>&#39;Besides the courtroom there will be two overflow rooms that will provide feeds of the hearing. Family members of victims have been told in a letter from the Arapahoe County District Attorney that they may not be prepared for what is presented in court.</p>

<p>A sentence from the letter reads: “Carefully consider whether or not you think that you are ready to be exposed to potentially difficult information at the hearing.”&#39;</p>

<p>It it me, or is that a bit unusual? Typically it would be difficult to hear of their loved ones etc, but i get the feeling that&#39;s not what it is referencing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of solid facts here, but James Holmes was not acting as an agent of the DoD or any US government agency. Most things just &#39;are&#39; - there is no conspiracy involved.</p>
