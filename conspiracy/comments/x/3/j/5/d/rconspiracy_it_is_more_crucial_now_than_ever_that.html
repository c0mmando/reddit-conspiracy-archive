Post all the links you can find on your facebook. Post on your friends walls. </p>

<p>Send e-mails to media and government officials, this is probably  the least effective but there are good people there that are just bein duped that might listen.</p>

<p>There is strong anti-war sentiment in the world, unfortunately the way the propaganda was played out, most of the anti-war faction has been rendered neutral or even manipulated into demanding that action be taken. Disturbingly people that are against military intervention have been relegated to the conspiracy division. </p>

<p>As if it&#39;s really a conspiracy theory that the largest military powers in the world responsible for most of the carnage we&#39;ve seen in this and the last century would stage a coup in a country hostile to it&#39;s interest.</p>

<p>Do anything you can. I don&#39;t want to play the emotion card but I feel compelled to. Think of all the men, woman and children that will be massacred by NATO bombs and killed by the ruthless thugs if we don&#39;t intervene. Think of all the people that will be tortured for &quot;humanitarian reasons&quot;.</p>

<p>Libya has already been ruined but it&#39;s not to late to save the Syrian people. </p>

<p>All we need to do is to generate enough awareness so that opinion polls start shifting and they would deem it to risky to attack in terms of popular opinion.</p>

<p>This is the most important issue right now. Be courageous, and just imagine how great it would feel if we manage to generate enough momentum to make people expose this. It would be an enormous upset to the globalist plans. And never mind the trolls and downvote bots, they can&#39;t harm you.</p>

<p>And what would that be?</p>

<p>As a 40-year-old recovered conspiraholic, we&#39;ve spent a lot of our time indulging ourselves in fantasies that make us feel important because we have the gnosis that unlocks the truth that the &quot;sheeple&quot; can&#39;t see, and we get to see explanations for what other people realize as the randomness of the world. We also get to feel in control of our lives and in some cases find people to blame for everything bad that happens to us. But never, ever did we actually accomplish anything. And any time we actually had something useful to say (e.g. pointing out that Bush had clear warnings that Osama was preparing to attack but failed to prevent it) our worst elements (which are the majority of our elements) create &quot;no plane hit the Pentagon&quot;, &quot;the Twin Towers were blown up&quot;, &quot;Bush planned 9/11&quot; and so help me, the article that ran in Nexus magazine that claimed the towers were brought down by a nuclear explosion stories to make us look like fools and drown out the rare times we actually do produce any useful information. </p>

<p>Oh, and we&#39;re also good for getting people to believe the world is about to end, that they should rack up credit card debt before the Y2K bug wipes out civilization, that aliens are coming with the Hale-Bopp comet so now would be a good time to commit suicide, etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not too late to turn back from this destructive course and spend the rest of your life helping people to think rationally, understand that ideas need evidence, that extraordinary ideas need extraordinary evidence, and that being skeptical means being skeptical of woo as much as the nightly news - in fact, much more skeptical because woo is extraordinary claims. That way you&#39;ll make a positive difference in the world rather than encouraging the neurotic feelings the poster is exhibiting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where&#39;s the questioning in this thread of the claims of the original poster, especially given that what the poster claims is contradicted by every single piece of evidence in existence (the world is doing almost nothing to help the people of Syria and even Annan&#39;s peace plan was vetoed in the U.N. security council which puts into question whether the U.N. observers will even remain)? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can give you specifics about regional rebel groups.  The &quot;Free Syrian Army&quot; is not some united group taking orders from the top down.  The situation is like you would expect it to be if the US military invaded Nevada, there are regional militias that sometimes work together to attack larger targets.  Politics wise, most people are fighting because there are soldiers and tanks in their neighborhoods.  Snipers shooting people walking in the streets and friends and relatives being &quot;disappeared&quot; into torture camps.</p>

<p>It is basically the exact situation everyone here on r/cons has been warning about.  The government invades neighborhoods, declares martial law and then attacks civilians in the name of fighting &quot;terrorism&quot;.</p>

Not rebels, not soldiers. People marching with signs.</p>

<p>&quot;He watched through his telescopic lens as men, women and children scattered in panic as his shots rang out, dropping their anti-regime banners and running for the cover of buildings and alleyways.&quot;</p>

<p>And from <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/07/syrians-fleeing-to-lebanon-not-just-the-poor.html">here</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“As we were leaving Friday, snipers fired two shots at our car,” she said. “They just shoot randomly at anyone and even burn the trees so you can’t hide behind them.”</p>

<p>If you dont support helping stop the slaughter of the Syrian people, thats your choice to do so. It shows a pretty callous disregard for human life though, and I&#39;m not shy about saying it. Your little play theories about NWO&#39;s, Illuminatis, Greys, Reptilians and all are fun to dream up and what not, and I&#39;m sure entertaining. But now there are massacres and civil war, with people being cut down, literally murdered, for having the audacity to decide they should have a voice over their own affairs. If you cant see that we owe at least a factual evaluation of the idea, then I&#39;m sorry to say you&#39;re just lost to reality and there&#39;s nothing more we can do for you.</p>

<p>Ok.... NATO stopped the heavy weaponry from being used on civilians, Britain armed the civilians, the civilians killed Khadaffi, they cheered NATO and thanked us profusely, then we went home... in fact the U.S. went home before NATO did and I believe it was France whose jets halted Khadaffi&#39;s convoy from escaping. Meanwhile conspiratology proclaimed that this was all &quot;propaganda&quot; and wasn&#39;t happening (it did), that the U.S. was going to put boots on the ground (it didn&#39;t), and that NATO was going to occupy Libya (it went home). People like Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich had their reputations tarnished forever for making these types of extreme predictions that were extremely wrong. The conspiratological outlook (that all wars have a secret purpose and are caused by unseen hands and everything America does is evil by definition) completely failed a test of the hypothesis. So why should anyone take seriously a repeat of the same claims about Syria - especially when the world is doing much LESS to help Syria than it did Libya?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve gathered, the conspiracy crowd knows that Assad has been ruling with an iron fist for too long, it&#39;s just that we&#39;re not about to believe that these &quot;rebels&quot; aren&#39;t being <a href="http://globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;amp;aid=29072">funded/provided intelligence</a> from outside sources in order to topple the regime. </p>

<p>The conspiracy crowd also understands that when regimes fall, power vacuums are created that result in violent clashes to fill them.  With Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and now Syria, there has never been a plan for what happens after the regime falls.  It&#39;s great cheering on the &quot;good guys&quot; until the Evil regime falls, but destruction and suffering is often left in the wake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;conspiracy  talking heads&quot; get tricked into supporting every dictator. I remember them doing the same thing with Yugoslavia and attempting to exonerate Milosivich and portray the whole thing as a propaganda campaign to steal... something. They do the same thing with Afghanistan. It isn&#39;t so much that they support Assad as their worldview postulates that all use of military force by a Western power has a secret reason different than the official reason (which they alone have fathomed) and that unseen people secretly cause the war to further certain vague interests. That&#39;s why they have to support Assad; their worldview tells them any use of force by the West against him must be part of some sinister plot by definition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you accept without proof that there&#39;s anything &quot;really&quot; going on in Syria outside of what the rest of the world believes? What&#39;s going on in Syria is exactly what you&#39;ve heard: the Arab Spring has come to Syria. Assad has turned out to be even more of a brutal butcher than I remember his father being and has shown an even greater desire than Khadaffi to wage war on Syria&#39;s civilian population. Some military and embassadors have defected, but it&#39;s mostly been civilians battling the bulk of Syria&#39;s military until very recently and a great deal of atrocities have been committed that&#39;ll see Assad swinging from a gallows if he ever makes it out of Syria. The fighting&#39;s close to the capital now and the rebels have some of the border crossings under control so it&#39;s less likely Assad will be able to leave (although he still controls the airport). Syria shot down a Turkish training jet so it&#39;s unlikely their former ally would let him slip across their border.</p>

<p>Russia and China, friend to all evil people the world over, have aided Assad and Russia has been selling the butcher weapons. Former U.N. chief Koffi Annan has been in Syria, but Russia and China vetoed his ceasefire plan in the Security Council. The U.N. observation force has already suspended operations because the fighting is too intense and now they might have to leave entirely.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s what&#39;s going on in Syria. Unfortunately, in the conspiratorial viewpoint, every war HAS to have a secret meaning - in fact, EVERYTHING has to have a secret meaning, which they and only they can see through. Thus this thread, completely devoid of any claims or information, other than suggesting the horrible slaughter of thousands of civilians, including children, is &quot;propaganda&quot; (because the evidence doesn&#39;t fit their worldview, the evidence can&#39;t be real, and in their worldview, any evidence that disagrees with them is proof of their conspiracy in action).</p>

<p>Hope that helps... don&#39;t let people&#39;s belief systems trick you into letting innocent people die. The vow was &quot;never again&quot; after WWII, but it happened again in my lifetime in Rwanda. NATO intervened and saved the Libyans, but so far no one&#39;s helping the Syrian people. Remember the same people telling you there&#39;s a conspiracy in Syria were the ones telling you that the Libyan rebellion was a conspiracy to take over the country, to enslave the Libyan people, we&#39;d never leave, blah, blah, blah. What happened? NATO came, put no boots on the ground, stopped the heavy weaponry from being used against the populace, the Brits armed the rebels, and the Libyan people did the job themselves - THEN WE WENT HOME. We have had no involvement in forming a new Libyan government. In short, the conspiratologist worldview was proven to be completely, totally wrong. What walks like a duck and quacks like a duck was a duck. Now they&#39;re at it again and begging you not to help the Syrians just like they begged you not to help the Libyans (who cheered NATO and thanked us profusely for our help). What the world needs now is pressure to use NATO to save the Syrians - who yesterday threatened to release biological and chemical weapons on their citizens!!!!!! - rather than doing nothing. Conspiratology, which purports to truly understand history, so often ends up on the wrong side of it.</p>

<p>Article which gives sources how the members of the U.S. Institute for Peace (USIP) which are currently planning a post-Assad Syrian government were actively involved in regime-change government-funded NGOs.
<a href="http://thepassionateattachment.com/2012/07/21/quiet-planning-for-post-assad-syria-has-roots-in-2008-conference/">http://thepassionateattachment.com/2012/07/21/quiet-planning-for-post-assad-syria-has-roots-in-2008-conference/</a></p>

<p>Statement made by the most prominent Syrian defector Abdul Halim Khaddam on Israeli TV. Khaddam was Vice President of Syria from 1984 to 2005. He has acknowledged to have received money and help from the U.S. and the EU in order to overthrow the Syrian regime.

<p>This is no Syria-specific source, but I think it is worth listening to the late Chalmers Johnson. In this video he describes how the same trick is used again and again to justify military intervention and forced regime changed [watch from 56:40 till end]

Reading r/cons about Syria is like an episode of the fucking Twilight Zone.

Imagine if this happened in the US in the neighborhoods of r/cons subscribers, what do you think they would do?  They would grab their GoPro and record the shells falling in their neighborhood.
