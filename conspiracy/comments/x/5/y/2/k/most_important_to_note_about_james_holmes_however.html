       <p>
        Most important to note about James Holmes, however, this report says, is that his father, Robert Holmes, was said to have been scheduled to testify within the next few weeks before a US Senate panel on the largest bank fraud scandal in world history that is currently unfolding and threatens to destabilize and destroy the Western banking system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Robert Holmes, whose “blueblood” family links go back to the Mayflower, is known throughout the global banking community as being the creator of one of the most sophisticated computer algorithms ever developed and is credited with developing predictive models for financial services; credit and fraud risk models, first and third party application fraud models and internet/online banking fraud models.
       </p>
       <p>
        Educated at the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University, Robert Holmes is currently the senior lead scientist with the American credit score company FICO, which was formally known as Fair, Isaac and Company, and which every American citizen is beholden to should they need to borrow money.
       </p>
       <p>
        The massive banking crime being investigated by the US Senate is called the LIBOR Scandal where UK banks fixed the London Interbank Borrowing Rate with the complicity of the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve (which knew about this crime for 4 years and didn’t report it) and many other major Western banks.

       We all know those "Kremlin" reports and Sorcha Faal are
       <strong>
        full of shit,
       </strong>
       but is there any truth to this bit about his dad?
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that his father was going to testify before the US senate about LIBOR, and his mother said "yes you have the right person" on the phone, makes this whole "elite killer, gas mask, getaway car, drugged up Holmes as a patsy" theory more credible no? His son could've been made the scapegoat for this as a way to keep his father silent or something?

       His mother was asked by a reporter "Are you James Holmes mother?" Her reply "Yes you have the right person." She was not commenting on her son, she was replying to the reporter confirming her identity.

       I've been reading up on the circulating theories about Holmes being a patsy and whatnot, but the hypothesis that the stress of failing out of grad school precipitated psychological issues that lead to him committing the shooting off his own accord seems more plausible at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they frame the son if they were after the father? They could've murdered him and covered it up as a suicide. That would've been much more straightforward.

       If this is what that can do to your adopted son, what do you think we will do to your daughter in college or your nurse wife.  If this was a set up, there would be almost nothing more frightening than seeing this unfold knowing its all BS...Let the dads mind wander a little and he will not wanna test these people again with his or the rest of his families lives.

       Yes but the scenario still begs the question: why bother with intimidating the father in this way when the father could have been knocked off on a quiet morning? Why squander the resources into making James a patsy?

       Silence is best if under threat. IF it was true that it was a setup it would accomplish nothing. James Holmes' life is over. Doesn't work as blackmail if you release the pictures then make the threat kind of thing.

       James Holmes did look drugged.  Who knows if he actually killed people?  I suppose he has no memory of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The chance of this hearing and the massacre happening so conveniently close to each other are extremely small.  I would estimate a 1/60000 or less chance of both the family connection and the time connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming this is true, I wonder, why didn't they just kill the dad?  Would that have been too suspicious?  Are there other ways they could prevent the testimony?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a theory: if this doesn't prevent the testimony, it will be used as a pretense to kill the father, a rogue gunman blaming the him for the deaths.

       which is mere speculation until someone actually confirms all of this..it sounds terribly convoluted. Not complex, and cunning, but clunky and strategically flawed. Is it really so difficult to wait until more evidence is presented to make a judgement call? This kind of dialogue is really a dead end until more comes to light.

       True I get that. But ultimately the issue with these conspiracy theories is that they exist BECAUSE not enough data is disseminated to the public. Also some of the data that is disseminated becomes highly questionable under analysis and no running dialogue is maintained with the government to iron out a true and believable story.

       Which would be great if this were a Mission Impossible movie, but I think most alleged hit jobs are much better at keeping things straightforward and tying up the loose ends to a degree that ensures plausible deniability.How on earth did you come to such an estimate without even knowing for sure that the hearing is in any way related to Holmes or his father and what kind of algorithm would produce such a number?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I could say we're catching them in the act with our keen eye for inconsistencies in official reports, but it would be incredibly naive to believe it. If this were a state-sponsored or banking cartel-related job, it would not be so unnecessarily complicated. They're very good at sweeping most things under the rug. They've been doing it since even before the dawn of market societies. It's too early to tell whether this is what it seems.

       The dude hasn't even spoken about it yet. That doesn't mean he's a mind control victim,hell, it may even mean he's a fucking sociopath who knows what he's doing, and knows every time he opens his mouth the media will piss itself over the boost in ratings theyll get for covering it. Sometimes circumstances can exacerbate latent mental conditions. Who knows at this point.

       True I get that. But ultimately the issue with these conspiracy theories is that they exist BECAUSE not enough data is disseminated to the public. Also some of the data that is disseminated becomes highly questionable under analysis and no running dialogue is maintained with the government to iron out a true and believable story.
