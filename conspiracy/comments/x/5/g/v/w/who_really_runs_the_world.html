    <div class="md"><p>The world is governed by a very loose coalition of shareholders in &#39;connected&#39; investment banks, a few political dynasties, a few billionaire that are &quot;in to&quot; the coalitions and old boys networks, a loose confederation of CEO&#39;s in major defense contractors and a few stray hard conservative opinion-makers, intelligence community kingpins, oil people, a few former high echelon organized crime figures, a bit of European royalty, and the odd media magnate.</p>

<p>These people are by and large caucasian, english speaking, over 50 and male. They disagree on many issues, but they are increasingly in agreement a one world government is essential. They are also universally terrified they will lose most of their considerable (<em>and very corrupt</em>) influence and affluence in the next 10-15 years.</p>

<p>And they are seriously over-extended. They can&#39;t afford to lose their fortunes, because they have almost as high expenses. </p>

<p>Also - there seems to be a distinctive lineage/breeding component to this particularly extreme entitlement. Many of these people are related, or share distinctive genetic qualities. Also, many of them would be diagnosed with &quot;functional forms of psychopathy&quot;. These people share an <strong>evolved</strong> lack of empathic ability. </p>

<p>Many have descended from autocratic-inclined historical lineages and bloodlines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Familial Dynasties that operate exactly like the Mafia does cornering markets that can be controlled: Banking, Energy, Drugs. </p>

<p>The Bushes, Bin Ladens, Rothschilds, Murdochs don&#39;t give a monkey about religion, nationalism, ethnicity or political philosophy. They are interested in their own dynasties.</p>

<p>Most of the time it is in the interest of these families to cooperate in their exploitation of everyone else but occasionally they fall out.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church used to be the biggest non-familial power player but its power is fading in the era of Big Finance.</p>

<p>The Royal Families and lesser Houses of Europe still have considerable power and centuries of experience but their power is too on the wane.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe someone rules the earth but I think most people would be amazed how few families hold significant influence in what we call history, in total land ownership and in shares of minerals.</p>

<p>Right now there is a power transfer to the east. There are families in China and India who have both enormous wealth and influence whether they are drawn into the plans of the Old European Elite or have other plans is probably too soon to say.</p>

<p>The illuminati is made of a few people. These people are the heads of the major banks and controllers of the federal reserve. This includes Rothschild, Morgan, and Rockefeller. Their agenda is to create and control a New World Order.</p>

<p>If I had to narrow the top of the illuminati pyramid down those at the top, it&#39;s Rockefeller and Rothschild. </p>

<p>This is no <a href="http://rense.com/general45/kol.htm">accident</a>.</p>

<p>However when a person of Jewish ancestry is separated from that toxic ideology, you get guys like <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJFJ4K8oJ8">David Cole</a></strong> who can tell the truth.  Let it be known that I have no problem with guys like David Cole.</p>

<p>However, something needs to be done about the ideology.</p>

<p>It is a mental and spiritual cancer on the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews aren&#39;t innately evil. They are hardworking, creative, and think outside the box. The idea, however, that Jews are &quot;G-d&#39;s chosen people&quot; is racist and the perfect justification for a sociopathic outlook. And the stories of Judaism seem to promote the ideas of deception and revenge: Passover essentially being the story of a false flag attack (Egyptian babies being killed at night, supposedly by G-d but more likely, reading between the lines, by the Jewish themselves) and Purim being the story of Jews gaining royal favor and using that talent to &quot;preemptively &quot; slaughter 75,300 people they considered enemies. </p>

<p>Zionism is the organized movement to carry the Jewish supremacist ideology to its extreme: an effort not simply to create a homeland for Jews but, it appears, to establish global economic/political domination by Jews and allies using the justification that this is required to protect Jews from persecution. The elite of the Zionist movement and its aryan-friendly spin-off Neoconservatism are ruthless and highly competent. It&#39;s going to be an interesting century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews have always exploited. Historically, they&#39;ve regarded the nations and the peoples among whom they live, and in which they were born, as alien to their tribe. Because they are alien, they are both a constant threat, and a ripe field for exploitation. Jews haven&#39;t had to feel remorse when they cheated gentiles, because their Talmud tells them it&#39;s perfectly fine to cheat the goyim. In the Talmud there are rules about how a Jew behaves toward other Jews, and there are rules about how a Jew behaves toward a gentile ... and they are not the same rules. Gentiles are treated as, at best, second-class humans, and at worst, as sub-humans, by Jews. This attitude of paranoia and exploitation is built into the very structure of Judaism.</p>

<p>Read up on those 3 organizations and those two jackasses on the web. It&#39;s not just a select Zionist or European few. It&#39;s many countries and their political, corporate leadership that participate in hopes of the spoils for power and greed of the rest of the substandard world. Youtube has lots of info. These assholes are so arrogant they don&#39;t even deny such anymore cause they believe you can&#39;t do jack about it.</p>

<p>I pretty much think my fellow r/conspiracy will agree with my assertion on that control group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The devil ultimately rules the world.</p>

<p>On one hand mystery schools like Freemasonry, Skull &amp; Bones, Scientology, etc. initiate their applicants into demonic possession. Applicants go through series of steps which prepare their psychologies to take on demonic attributes, basically copying demonic code into their human consciousnesses. Once initiated, these applicants go on to fill positions of significance and prestige in world institutions in order to work toward a central plan. (All of this, minus the demons part, is readily available in the texts produced by mystery schools themselves, and their graduates)</p>

<p>On the other hand, people are being targeted by New Age and &quot;consciousness revolution&quot; type stuff, regular people are being initiated just the same as mystery school applicants, except they&#39;re being initiated by a different &quot;brand.&quot; This brand includes wisdom teachers like David Icke and Robert Anton Wilson etc. and their goal is to &quot;wake us up&quot; by teaching us what evil is going on in the world and teaching us about unlockable, magic properties of our minds. People follow the teachings of &quot;ascended masters,&quot; take on &quot;spirit guides,&quot; and so on - which are actually just these same demons. We all share this same demonic propaganda amongst ourselves and it becomes this broad, cultural thing. All of this increases the efficiency of our &quot;waking up&quot; into this new magical paradigm, we are all helping wake one another up at this very minute, it&#39;s become normal to do this. We ourselves are being initiated by this behavior.</p>

<p>So on one side, we have the elite working for the devil, doing their thing, trying to &quot;take over the world&quot; or whatever. But on the other side, it&#39;s orchestrated, these wisdom teachers are making sure we know exactly what&#39;s going on and telling us exactly how to respond (this is why conspiracy related stuff has gotten so popular in the past 10 years or so, it&#39;s become mainstream, this is not accidental)</p>

<p>The end game is obviously a showdown between these two powers. Once everyone knows the NWO is real and everyone knows about these unlockable properties of human consciousness, we&#39;re probably going to be set free, we&#39;re going to &quot;defeat&quot; the NWO by taking the steps the wisdom teachers tell us to take. We will be the new elite, initiated into occult magic, doing the work of the devil just the same as the elite is doing now. Most of us will not look at things this closely and will be happy with the outcome - the outcome will probably seem very pleasant and we will feel as though we are completely free. Nobody will concern themselves with where this new power comes from, or who we serve, or what is &quot;right,&quot; because of what we have come to believe about these things - this is most likely the ultimate purpose of this campaign.</p>

<p>One way or the other the devil is definitely in charge. If you look into these matters and you&#39;re willing to consider the rabbit hole is really this deep, you&#39;ll definitely start to see the connections, because they&#39;re out there.</p>
