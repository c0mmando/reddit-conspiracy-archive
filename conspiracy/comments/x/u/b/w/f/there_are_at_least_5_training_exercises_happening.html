    <div class="md"><p>Also you can add Iowa to that list.</p>

<p>Yesterday I woke up to see 4 military choppers (hueys) fly into the cedar rapids airport. There is a national guard armory right next to that airport but it is quite small. It probably has a total of 15 to 30 vehicles and a couple of small buildings. I called my dad to see if he saw them, he said no but KCRG 9 said to expect to see jets flying over as they were running exercises.</p>

<p>I have never seen military jets here in iowa except when 2 f-16&#39;s were buzzing around and visiting with some people from Rockwell Collins at the airport, and when 3 f-16s flew over kinnick stadium they also flew directly over my home. The only time I have seen military helicopters over our area have been once a few years back, and 3 times within the last month. The choppers I saw yesterday were four deep flying within I&#39;d say 100 feet of each other.  2 weeks ago I saw a single Huey fly over my workplace but what struck me as odd was it had two booms coming off the sides of the helicopter and they looked to be some kind of a sprayer, but was not spraying anything at the time, can&#39;t confirm they were even sprayers but me and a customer both commented on how it looked like it was fitted for crop dusting. And about a month ago two Huey&#39;s flew over my workplace from the west to the east, couldn&#39;t see these as well as they were right along the tree line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These happen annually in California. A couple years back there was one at the ports about biological or nuclear contamination or something. It was a proper FEMA thing, by the by. Obviously nothing came of it. And they&#39;re annual.</p>

<p>Then again something might come of it.</p>

<p>But living like that means always being a step behind. I think we should take the game to them. They are criminals. What do you do with criminals? You file charges and prosecute them. They are not above the law. They are subject to the same laws we are. Sometimes I wish I was a lawyer. I hope a talented lawyer with some righteous indignation takes it on himself / herself to do something bold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to believe they&#39;re not locking you Americans down for a totalitarian nightmare.</p>

<p>It could just be a show of strength/display of power to creditor nations thinking about calling in the U.S.&#39; loans backed with a threat of invasion.</p>

<p>The guy in the video is right.  You Americans have the power of private prosecutions and you should use that to charge elected officials with misfeasance in public office or some equivalent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live near the Westover Airforce Base in Chicopee, MA.  Every Thursday for the last 4 years they conduct a &quot;training&quot; where they circle C5As overhead for several hours.</p>

<p>I think there are a lot of bases around the country, and I think they are training no more than they have in years past, it&#39;s just that there are more people with cell phones and access to the internet than in years past, and so we&#39;re hearing about it more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but with the recent events in Anaheim and seeing people being carted off by unidentified men in military garb, and loaded into the back of what I would describe as rape vans lol. </p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that a large portion of our constitutional rights have been taken away since September 11th, and specially considering the passing of the National Defense Authorization Act, and the continued attempts to pass laws for indeffinate detainment.</p>

<p>Not to mention FEMA camps. You have to ask yourself why does ( prior to all these large scale exercises) it look like our nation Becoming more and more militarized? Why do our police now look like military officials more than a friendly face that could help you out in your time of need? </p>

<p>And then you start to see large scale exercises that are going on. The one in Alabama had the largest convoy ever seen in the united states. </p>

<p>And I just want to point out one scene in the dark knight rises. The largest police &quot;exercise&quot; seen in Gotham was actually a cover up, yeah its a movie reference but where do you think they get there inspiration from? </p>

<p>My point is, though I&#39;m no doomsday theorist, I do believe that our government has been plotting against us, the people for sometime now.</p>
