       actually, I have "business" to conduct with this individual. As per usual though, you're just following me around like a little lost puppy throwing meaningless and completely false accusations at me. First you say I'm an Obama supporter, then a Romney supporter and finally a Bush supporter. Which is it? Why don't you gather up all your personalities and sock puppet accounts, take a vote and let me know what you decide, k?

       Man, you aren't too bright either are ya? I thought robotevil was the only one suffering from mental retardation but I guess it runs deep with EPS members like yourself. Anyways, it's pretty obvious what I was referring too since all three of those people are one in the same.

       No, but I never said I was looking for escalated you assumed that I was looking for that. Exo facto, you decided I was not intelligent because of a preconceived notion that I was attempting to cite an Internet meme that had previously existed to describe the escalation of your conversation into a fight...

       I doubt you were doing  it maliciously, even if you said the batman movies were encouraging violence.  That's not ban worthy.

       The Aurora shooter just found something he identified with, if it wasn't Batman, it would have been something else.

       It was in bad taste but the sheer amount of ignorance on firearms was appalling. I hit them where it hurt and I think the mod couldn't stomach it. No big loss.

       I still appreciate having a website where the peoples voice determines which subjects are discussed and which responses carry the most weight. It is just sad to see it is dominated by liberals but that is too be expected from a website predominantly visited by young people who come from safe secure places who have never had to know what war or combat is.

      <p>
       Why would you ever support gun rights when you live in a nice upper class white gated community that is guarded by private security and backed by a well paid police force?
      </p>
      <p>
       How could you ever know?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a lot like Christians arguing against evolution while going to the doctor to have their child cured with the most modern medicine and medical techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
       The liberals are quite content to have a military/police presence ensure that they have the right to free speech and at the same time shit on the firearms that guarantee they are free to speak.

       I think the reddit community is just tired of you white supremacists and your agenda on worldnews. You push peoples' views too far and the pendulum will suddenly swing in the opposite direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those that don't know, there is a community of white suprems on reddit coming from outside message boards on the internet. They target politics, worldpolitics, worldnews, and conspiracy. Conspiracy, world politics are the worst often directly enter antisemitism.
      </p>
      <p>
       which is ironic because redhawk is complaining about them. these white radicals have been on reddit for years but some of the bigger players have come and went. the reddit community, media players following reddit, admins are all aware of this group and their agenda against jews using zionism and israel as the indirect default of attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of these people even pretend to be Muslim redditors, when infact, they are not religious and have no such background in real life. We Jews aren't stupid and know exactly what is happening but our numbers are too small in places like this. We can ultimately only go with the flow of the tide and hopefully the majority of the reddit community sees through the coordinated conspiracy efforts of the white supremacist community.

       Im an Arab American, the US census may consider me white (and id pass for an Italian American), but I consider myself Arab and the Palestinian struggle is important to me. So am I against the crimes of Israel ? Yes I am, and I dont hide it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have nothing against Jews or Judaism as a religious belief. However I am against the concept of Zionism and against Israel. Nothing wrong with what I am doing and its just the opposite of AIPAC.

       That's like saying "I know for a fact 95% of EOS want Ron Paul as president" - so? I'm British but I'd prefer to see Obama win over all the other gloits running. Actually voted Conservative in the last UK elections too, because they were the better party. Don't get why some people are staunch 'x' party constantly.

       There's no call to arms in EPS. Downvote groups are fucking stupid and pointless. Why censor discussion? I've downvotes 25 posts in 7 month, I bet that's a

       Well, I guess you find racism hilarious apparently. Especially when it comes to the holocaust deniers like nolibs. Why do you defend these people again?

       Exactly.  Occasionally this subreddit produces an interesting gem.  Or at the very least, gives me a reason to kill some time on google.  But the bulk of it IS in fact mindnumbingly retarded (see current post as a reference).

       Will never understand why any person would choose to hang out with people they don't like, or sit in subreddits they think are stupid. Seriously - what's up with that? There just HAS to be something else they could be doing with their time. Isn't there? SOMEthing? ANYthing?

       I'm interested in conspiracies, not how every single event is part of a global elite depopulation agenda, and shite like this post and the general american malaise feel here. It's pretty interesting to keep up with the bandwagon here and see the justification for how all events are connected (Sikh shooter lives on Holmes street? obvious false flag!).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's cathartic. You could apply the exact same reasoning to this post - if
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       is such a joke then why post about it? Why even bother?

       I'm saying I think that's you in the linked post calling eps a neocon whatever, can't even remember the point now.

       Citation is unnecessary when I said it's
       <em>
        like
       </em>
       saying.

      <p>
       Out of context comments from EPS mean nothing, and I love how you're linking to your linking of comments. If EPS is a downvote mob then what the fuck is NLW? just a more concentrated version centring on a few people.

      <p>
       [citation] - votes are public aren't they?

       Shill - You've called me a nuclear before and referred to me and my colleagues as shills too.

       No, but I never said I was looking for escalated you assumed that I was looking for that. Exo facto, you decided I was not intelligent because of a preconceived notion that I was attempting to cite an Internet meme that had previously existed to describe the escalation of your conversation into a fight...
