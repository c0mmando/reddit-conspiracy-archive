       Masons do seem friendly, however TBH, unless you are 32nd, you don't really know what your organization is about. It is just a friendly fraternity. All the satanic stuff comes at 32. and before you deny it... are you a 32? . remember: "Anyone who is a 32nd degree mason is no "higher up" than a MM (3rd degree)" that is just what they tell you.

       No, that's a huge myth about masonry... A real Mason is a Master Mason, 3rd degree... from there it's optional to do the Scottish Rite (32 degrees) or York Rite (10 degrees), but those are optional, and don't have any real weight to you "ranking"... there really is no ranking beyond the 3rd degree.. just optional "courses" you can take

       No worries, well that's one of the reasons (along with the few-too-many scotches i've had) I'm doing this tonight, just to let you know... at least from my experience, there's nothing sinister about it.. it's just an old men's club these days.

       I don't trust secret groups either, and that was my main motive for joining, to see what it was all about

       of course, all you have to do is ask - we're not allowed to solicit for membership, but most lodges are desperate for membership and will gladly accept anyone

       To be honest, not much at all. I joined curious about the esoteric side more than anything and am still pretty disappointed. So far it's a bunch of old (relatively nice) men who aside from the formal ritual just bitch about life and their wives

       Well, that's another misunderstood thing about masonry. There are only 3 degrees, Master Mason being the 3rd. You can do the "Scottish Rite" which is 32 degrees but it's optional doesn't hold any real value within your ranking. Similarly theres the York Rite which is 10 degrees. Anyone who is a 32nd degree mason is no "higher up" than a MM (3rd degree)... As for what he found, I'm not sure, but Masonry is full of allegory and symbolism, it could be any number of things

         What are the privileges of being a mason?

         You claim to be a conspiracy theorist so let me ask you this, if you were asked to be part of a mass revolution against us government what would your answer be? :Hypothetically speaking of course, we love our government here in america

         One of my friends once 'found' a masonic ring, level 32. When opened, in it were about five small (but very sophisticated)'pages' made of gold all with different symbols on them the first one of course was the square and compass symbol (dont remember the rest but they were real trippy)... any insight on this kind of thing?

       Is there any literature you have to read in order to advance in degree?
If so does this literature differ from lodge to lodge?

       We have a big masonic library at our lodge, but none of it is required reading to advance. To move up the degrees you just have to read and recite the 'memory work' which is the same process every mason has done since the 1700's when we started. I've tried reading Albert Pike's "Morals and Dogma", which is supposedly a good insight from a prominent mason, but found it hard to read all the way through
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: and so far i haven't found anyone within my lodge put any significance on numerology, but that's not to say it's not a big factor, I may just not know it so far... don't think it is though - Masonry is all just symbolism and allegory
      </p>
      <p>
       and yes, it's very common for us to attend and visit other lodges, and it's encouraged always. You're always well received if you're a visitor from another lodge.

       Alright. So this memory work, it's passed by word of mouth? Or is it written down somewhere? I believe you are not at liberty to share this knowledge with a non-mason but can you please roughly touch upon what it is about?

       I have a binder with the "degree work", I had to memorize it and say it during my initiation of each degree.. It's a lot of work.. I did well at it, a lot of the older guys who join have a really hard time memorizing it, then having to recite it in the lodge, wearing a noose around your neck in front of apron wearing strangers.. hah
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: and the work itself is just separate stuff you have to say for each degree.. 1st = entered apprentice, 2nd = fellow craft, 3rd  = master mason... each has their own oath that must be memorized

       Thanks. I understand the curiosity it can spark. What interested me the most about it was all the famous people that are masons and of course the secrecy. I do think that there is a big difference between lodges and some might be more serious on the spiritual side of things but most are (no offense) more like yours. Also because the 'supreme being' side of it is left for your own interpretation, I believe some masons may be satanists which is why people find links between masonry and satanism/lucifarianism. I may be wrong here but that's just my best guess for I can't know what really is the core of the Masonic rites.

       very well may be, yeah. one of the requirements to join is that you have to have belief in a supreme being, but doesnt discriminate on religion or anything. My deal was I absolutey hate organized religions in general (sorry to offend anyone), but in my interview when asked about that I just said something along the lines of: I think there may be something greater than us, but as for Christianity and the like, i just dont agree with their dogma.... The old guys just looked at each other and smiled, didnt say a word. then I was accepted. I haven't seen anything overtly "satanic" from my experience, but wouldn't doubt there's elements of it, especially at the higher levels. And even if so I dont really care, i have no interest in that.

       Yeah great question. I'm 28, I joined when i was 23 and was the youngest mason in my whole district. I joined basically to infiltrate because I was so damn curious, and wanted insight into the esoteric aspects of the craft. But after years of work and commitment I was left pretty disappointed. And you hit the nail on the head about the general state of masonry today... We do our formal ritual but after it's all just guys bitching about their wives and there purely for the fraternal aspect of it. Which is fine... but I'm losing interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of the "networking" i still have the square and compass on my resume, and so far no one has noticed. I've seen a few guys who are insurance brokers join (slimebags) soley to try and advance their business and they never made it past the first degree

       2 more Q's. 1. why dont you go for the 32 degree next? that is what all the conspiracies revolve around. maybe there is secret knowledge or satanic stuff there, knowledge of the universe. 2. do you believe in magic/the secret, with manifestation, creating your own reality, etc..

        I have just started, masonic lodges go "dark" (non-active) in July-August, but i'll resume in Sept, and should be 32 Scottish Rite by next spring. 2. In a way, but certainly not because of anything to do with masonry.... I know there's some truth to it. But that movie is complete crap, and very misleading. It was made by some money hungry film producers, don't buy in to its message

       Hello sir, why do you believe so many non-mason youths are scared of the organization of freemasonry? Who benefits from scaring people from joining?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why are there certain criterias around the world, that you have to believe in a certain religion to join depending on the country you live in?

       well I can't answer your first question, you'd have to ask them. No one benefits from scaring people away from masonry, to be honest we're quite desperate for new members.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the criteria for joining is the same worldwide. You do need to have a belief in a god of some sort, but it's not based on religion. I'm not religious myself.

       yeah, definitely... We pay dues yearly, about $200, most of which goes to local charitable organizations (for my lodge, it's all for Cancer and MS)... Also if a fellow mason (brother) get's sick we usually rally around him in terms of charity, or in the case of one who passes away (happens often), we'll support his surviving family; wife or other, with a modest but adequate amount of financial support.

       That's what I like about masonry, that many masons actually do care for people suffering and will support, even if they are being used to sustain a network that can be focused working towards certain goals. That is a very positive thing, I wish people would gather and support people without the top down hierarchy for a better society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway keep up the good work and stay hidden in the dark as a beacon of light and do influence other members positively. I doubt you will ever get close to the innerwork, because they are hand picked :)

       Well the thing is freemasonry is just a bunch of men, wanting to belong to some group. But because its such a big secret group, its used by the Illuminati, military industrial complex, Jesuits, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       At the higher levels it is more serious, but we are talking about the bigger centers and older lodges. But its mostly used by various groups to do stuff and recruit people, as it is secret and works under a code of secrecy.

       Soloman's Temple has a huge role in the verbiage of the degree work... but I dont think it's totally related to Judaism... For example there wasn't a single Jew in my lodge of over 100 people. The Star of David is a main symbol in masonry too, but within masonry it holds a different meaning than it does to the jewish religion.

       i have owned the morals and dogma book for years. is this book still a standard in freemasonry or just in the south ? albert pike was a great man , and that book is one of my treasures. how strict are they really about this book being in public ? i know it says in the front "to be returned upon death or withdrawl of recipient".
      </p>
      <p>
       also  , i noticed a few people mentioning satanic rituals &amp; whatnot , hehe
       <br/>
       i guess the rituals &amp; rooms look a bit odd to a laymen , but all these ceremonies are highly symbolic &amp; esoteric - that doesnt equate to evil tho - i know like all things that pass through time , freemasonry has been diluted &amp; fraternized to the point of it now being pretty bland &amp; stale  , no ?
      </p>
      <p>
       that book was a big influence in my early spiritual seeking , as i discovered it in the early 80`s ! -- i still see it every now &amp; again
[ i gave my first copy to elijah blue allman in 1999 ]

       I'm actually not sure. At my level there's no registry I can go look up to confirm. Talking to more senior guys at my lodge have told me a few, like G. Bush Sr., and quite a few other republicans... not particularly proud of that, but is what i've heard.

       This is the most pointless AMA in existence. You realize that anybody with an IQ above that of a sack of potatoes won't believe or trust a single word you type. The very nature of the society you are apart of is inherently secretive, meaning there's no way in hell you are telling anyone the whole truth.

       Obviously, there are levels in how you interpret symbols, at least religious symbols. So saying it has no relevance you can say that for your level...
