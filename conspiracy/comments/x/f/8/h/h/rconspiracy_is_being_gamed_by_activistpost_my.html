       Presumably that would entail viewing the mod log of
       <a href="/r/uncensorship">
        /r/uncensorship
       </a>
       and examining the code you use with
       <a href="/u/censorship">
        /u/censorship
       </a>
       to ensure there is no ability for a mod to pre warn the bot to ignore a submission about to be deleted.  Would that be about right?  If so how would a person know that was the correct code?

       But since you ask I wouldn't mind mixing it in with my project of learning python programming.   I'm not too far in my progress (chapt 16 python the hard way) but am starting to feel I could probably write something to automate the audit.  Don't worry if the mods do not want to allow the temp. mod access as this will be an interesting mini project to get my head working.

       biomassive, you should probably just let 9000sins handle stuff in this subreddit. I see him posting stuff ALL THE TIME, as well as commenting and giving awesome feedback. I never even heard of you until today and it looks like you are kinda stepping on some toes.

       You're removing perfectly rational content from a subreddit dedicated to content like this because you might get made fun of by a subreddit full of people who don't even acknowledge facts that are fully documented? And that's okay because the censorship in this subreddit is readily available in another, less popular subreddit? Makes perfect sense. How about you reserve your power for when it's actually necessary, rather than when people post things you personally don't agree with. And whether or not you feel that the website is legitimate, doesn't give you the authority to remove content that others might find interesting. All he's presented are the facts, which are open to interpretation. Whether or not it turns out to be true is completely irrelevant. Keep your opinions to yourself, and try not to silence the opinions of others in the future. Even if you're afraid a community of scared children might mock you. That's the entire point of the subreddit. All we ever see is mockery. If one day we come to the conclusion that 80% of the information on this subreddit was incorrect, (which it possibly is), I would be more proud to be a part of a rational discussion about subjects which don't get enough attention that turn out to be incorrect, than a part of a discussion moderated by people who have the same amount of information as me and decide to censor opinions they disagree with. Also, maybe you should edit your rules to include "7. NOTHING I THINK ISN'T TRUE". And if you want to see less of this, take your own advice and downvote it.

       Well let's start with the fact that I was banned for the post you just responded to. Do you genuinely feel that was warranted? Because it doesn't feel that my criticism is allowed. Apparently what I wrote warrants me being called a "fucking moron" by the moderator. I'm pleased that you're ready and willing to accept constructive criticism. He however is not. Apparently his comment about how we should downvote things we don't want to see only applies to us lowly people, considering he gets to simply remove content he disagrees with, and ban people who question him in a perfectly rational and respectful manner.

       He doesn't listen to reason. His subreddit blew up and now he thinks he can do whatever he wants. I was just banned for the post he responded to. If you could even call that a response. It was basically "Fuck you, I don't need to answer to anyone I can simply ban." He insulted me personally because we're allowed to be critical of anyone but him and any website he personally supports, in which case your post is removed or you get banned. How interesting. It's funny who gets to decide what's "bullshit" in this subreddit.

       you remove anyone who disagrees with you. You just banned me for literally no reason. And the community saw it happen. Nice going. Really smooth. And as for your idiotic statement regarding whether or not I know what you remove, you claim in your
       <strong>
        very own original post
       </strong>
       that you remove things based on the way the community will be viewed, in order to "represent the community in the best way possible." You know who best represents the community?

       I proved your point? Do you even think before you post?  Not that you need to--you have yet to adress a single point I've made. Arguing sure would be easier for me if I could just pretend I've done nothing wrong and respond to all criticism with personal insults followed by a ban. Why admit when you're wrong? Saying whatever you want's a lot easier when you don't have to justify it to anybody, isn't it?

       No. I was already aware of that. Was it so hard replying once without insulting me? You make it seem difficult. The original submission isn't the issue anymore.  I wasn't afraid you were a part of an illuminatic conspiracy to keep us from figuring out about one website with sub par information. I just think you don't know how to effectively deal with the opinions of others. You don't seem to be trying to hide that fact, though. Is there a reason you removed the OP's second submission, banned him, me, and at least two other people from the subreddit for respectfully disagreeing with you? I assumed moderators were here to moderate discussion. Not regulate the userbase to suppress dissent.

       Hey now!  You are the moderator of a public space, telling me to shut the fuck up for pointing out your misguided censorship.

       Seems to me that you and SovereignMan fit most of the characteristics. Continually trying to discredit me, ignore what I'm presenting, and changing the subject to something with no relation to the topic at hand. This post is not about me, and I won't let you guys rile me up. I have replied to all attempts to do so. I stand by what I have presented, and I am hopeful that others will at least pay a little more attention.  I can deal with the downvotes.

       The community should be aware. This guy is spamming r/conspiracy, and the moderators "came to a consensus" that posts from iemmawriter should be allowed. If you visit reddit.com
       <a href="/r/uncensorship">
        /r/uncensorship

       you will see that not only are certain posts removed, but some are marked as confirmed spam. How is this not spam?

       So our authorities can't be trusted, and a subreddit like this is necessary to expose corruption. Therefore the word of the moderators is final and should be trusted fully? I don't even agree with dummyaccnt and what you're saying is absolutely ludicrous. People post here about the ruling elite taking DMT to communicate with reptilian aliens and prepare for the anti-christ, and he posts that one website might be spamming, and gets removed? This wasn't even remotely suspicious until moderator actions were taken. 9000sins thinks
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       is what we're being mocked for? Good joke. The website in question has tons of great submissions to the website. It doesn't mean that the moderator has the right to remove a post about corruption within a subreddit dedicated to exposing corruption, and it certainly doesn't mean he should be vilified. Not that you care about logical reason, As is obvious by what you just said. He shouldn't post anything that he finds suspicious if the person in control of the subreddit assures you that it isn't suspicious? How many people do you think you're actually fooling?

       My original post to show the community that this is spam was deleted. Then he says the moderators came to a consensus that it should be allowed, and it's not spam. However in r/uncensorship some sites are marked as spam that aren't nearly posted as much. I'm not saying the moderators are corrupt, but this wouldn't be the first time moderators in a subreddit allow something for profit, and its not unconceivable.

       If one acct is spamming 2 sites too much, we have no proof that the submitter is associated with either of the sites, do we? That should be left to Reddit Admins. They can see IPs and all that. If you're convinced, report them (

       Anyone could launch a "counter" op like the one here, against any site. It'd take about 20 minutes.

       More importantly, as SovereignMan pointed out, do you have any evidence that the sites are providing sub-par content? That's what I wanna know.

       What is your proof that it is quality content? It's all subjective. My issue is not with the site, it is with spam. It would be considered spam if there was another account who only posted to one site multiple times per day in any other subreddit.

       I would like to know how my submissions are spam. They are real articles from a real website, number 1 - all of them are original articles, or contributed articles that writers have agreed to have posted and promoted. Lastly, people can vote on Reddit directly from the site. As I see it, Activist Post has only encouraged people to visit Reddit and participate there. Even though Reddit is already a massive website, I'm sure Activist Post's support of Reddit has helped the Reddit community.  Thank you for permitting the posts and for being able to respond.

       It's interesting that govtslaves.info was gaming this subreddit about a week ago, and now their links are appearing unchallenged.

       I enjoy activeposts stuff.  And as for it being spammy, during an entire week, i see maybe 3 or 4 articles reach about 30-60 votes (enough to get noticed).  Plus, to me, not sure how accurate, but it doesnt seem that they recycle stories, i feel their content is pretty good and some effort is put into putting out legit content.  Not ground breaking, but none the less, good.  jmho.
      </p>
      <p>
       You mods are doing a good job at keeping this subreddit legit (9000sins is cool), i feel there will be more concerted efforts to discredit or see more active methods to try to lure the good redditors on r/conspiracy into leaving, ie: bashing, mis-direction, burying threads/comments,  change of subject, personal attacks to try and bring r/conspiracy to a less attractive sub-reddit.  You see a lot of these techniques used in the penny stock forums, most are very effective to mess with the noob investor...if you dont know what youre looking for you can easily find yourself questioning being here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep up the good work and there are enough solid thinkers/awakened minds on r/conspiracy, think most of them can hold their own pretty good. There are lots of new subscribers on this subreddit though, ive noticed, so got to stay on your toes.

       This is censorship and moderator bias. This is most certainly spam with the amount of posts pointing to this domain. One has to wonder if someone is selling their influence.

       I am a large poster on this reddit. Some of what I post is not by itself a conspiracy, but has the capacity to become one in the future- so I use it as a reference in case something DOES occur.

       Case in point- Cheney skipping out on the RNC. If something happens there, it would suggest Cheney had prior knowledge.
