    <div class="md"><p>Someone who, depending on where you read it, has a contact at HAARP (I think) or who has hacked into HAARP, predicted the big Japan earthquake. A week or so before the event he said something was happening and said he&#39;d give a 104 hour warning. Pretty much 104 hours before the earthquake, he gave that warning. (If Facebook screencaps are to be believed.) Apparently once he says it&#39;s happening, there&#39;s no way it can be avoided which is why it&#39;s always 104 hours. </p>

<p>This week he announced that California and Sydney would get 9.6/9.5 earthquakes soon and he would give another 104 hour countdown. We&#39;re still waiting for him to actually give the 104 warning. </p>

<p>This man has also claimed that NRL games in Australia are fixed by a betting agency and has two (?) times predicted almost exactly the correct score (he states that the losing team will always be spot on, but the winning team will be within 4 points -- and he&#39;s been in this margin of error both times). I&#39;m not quite sure how this links into the earthquake thing. </p>

I could be wrong, but I think you have to do some hacking to actually change THAT date.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure mate, seems like a pretty pointless feature to be honest. Anyway, I&#39;d like to think that if someone did have a way of getting a 104 hour accurate countdown on a major earthquake like this, then they would have at least some explanation for how other than &#39;hacked from HAARP&#39;.</p>

<p>I find the 104 interesting too. Can anyone work out any significance? only thing I can this is 52 weeks in a year. The fact it&#39;s 104 hours twice means something and I know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quick question on Mitchell&#39;s profile - I have been following this for some days now.  I subscribed to his page, however it seems like his posts aren&#39;t updating &quot;to the minute&quot; per se...for example, his latest post for me is VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE PLEASE READ which was posted Wednesday...however, I did not see that until today (8/10).  Before that, his most recent post was Tuesday with the warning.  So what&#39;s the deal, am I not able to get an update on this immediately?  Is there a 2 day lag? IS SOMETHING FISHY ABOUT ALL OF THIS? sorry, overreaction at the end..</p>

But wouldn&#39;t it present an immediate challenge to his credibility if his hourly &quot;prediction&quot; only showed up as public directly after the event? 104 hours is a little bit over four days, so it doesn&#39;t seem workable, even with a 24-48 hour lag.</p>

<p>Coombes states he hacks into HAARP and once the HAARP personnel fire up the array, they cannot simply shut it down. In other words, once the process has begun, the exercise is a done deal. From the moment the array is fired up, says Coombes, there are approximately 104 hours before the destruction occurs and the process cannot be aborted</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can stop HAARP. All you do is have to throw the circuit breaker to &quot;Off&quot;. I&#39;d take this guys word with caution. There was plenty of discussion about this guy changing the dates on his prediction dates.</p>

<p>Edit: really downvoters? Where did you go to school?</p>

<p>HAARP is a high-frequency transmitter system used to modify the ionosphere. The main HAARP station is located in Alaska.</p>

<p>HAARP has 246 antennas erected. Each antenna acts as a transmitter, <strong>sending electromagnetic radiation into the ionosphere.</strong> HAARP can transmit between 2.8 and 10 MHz. This frequency range lies above the AM radio broadcast band.</p>

<p>The HAARP <strong>“electro-jet” is a river of electricity that flows</strong> thousands of miles through the sky and down into the polar icecap. The electro-jet is a vibrating artificial antenna for sending electromagnetic radiation raining down on the earth and into the oceans.</p>

<p>Claim 1 A method for altering at least one region normally existing above the earth&#39;s surface with electromagnetic radiation using naturally-occurring and diverging magnetic field lines of the earth comprising transmitting first electromagnetic radiation at a frequency between 20 and 7200 kHz from the earth&#39;s surface, said transmitting being conducted essentially at the outset of transmission substantially parallel to and along at least one of said field lines, adjusting the frequency of said first radiation to a value which will excite electron cyclotron resonance at an initial elevation at least 50 km above the earth&#39;s surface, whereby in the region in which said electron cyclotron resonance takes place heating, further ionization, and movement of both charged and neutral particles is effected, said cyclotron resonance excitation of said region is continued until the electron concentration of said region reaches a value of at least 10.sup.6 per cubic centimeter and has an ion energy of at least 2 ev. </p>

<p>Claim  13. The method of claim 1 wherein said electromagnetic radiation is generated at the site of a naturally-occurring hydrocarbon fuel source, said fuel source being located in at least one of northerly or southerly magnetic latitudes.</p>

<p>Claim 14. The method of claim 13 wherein said fuel source is natural gas and electricity for generating said electromagnetic radiation is obtained by burning said natural gas in at least one of magnetohydrodynamic, gas turbine, fuel cell, and EGD electric generators located at the site where said natural gas naturally occurs in the earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is his second prediction. Supposedly, he didn&#39;t just pull it out of his ass. He provides a logical (if unlikely) reason behind it.</p>

<p>The first one, over a year ago, came true to the day. There is evidence to support it. I actually remember seeing his prediction about the earthquake on another site before March 11 (I was made aware of it by a Japanese friend).</p>

<p>Is it logical? Not really. But it doesn&#39;t mean that we should not write it off completely because we don&#39;t understand how it works.</p>

<p>btw, the solar wind is pretty low right now which makes big earthquakes more likely to occur.</p>

<p>Claim 1 A method for altering at least one region normally existing above the earth&#39;s surface with electromagnetic radiation using naturally-occurring and diverging magnetic field lines of the earth comprising transmitting first electromagnetic radiation at a frequency between 20 and 7200 kHz from the earth&#39;s surface, said transmitting being conducted essentially at the outset of transmission substantially parallel to and along at least one of said field lines, adjusting the frequency of said first radiation to a value which will excite electron cyclotron resonance at an initial elevation at least 50 km above the earth&#39;s surface, whereby in the region in which said electron cyclotron resonance takes place heating, further ionization, and movement of both charged and neutral particles is effected, said cyclotron resonance excitation of said region is continued until the electron concentration of said region reaches a value of at least 10.sup.6 per cubic centimeter and has an ion energy of at least 2 ev. </p>

<p>Claim  13. The method of claim 1 wherein said electromagnetic radiation is generated at the site of a naturally-occurring hydrocarbon fuel source, said fuel source being located in at least one of northerly or southerly magnetic latitudes.</p>

<p>Claim 14. The method of claim 13 wherein said fuel source is natural gas and electricity for generating said electromagnetic radiation is obtained by burning said natural gas in at least one of magnetohydrodynamic, gas turbine, fuel cell, and EGD electric generators located at the site where said natural gas naturally occurs in the earth. </p>
