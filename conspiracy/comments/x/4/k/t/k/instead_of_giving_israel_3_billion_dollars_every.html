       But if we campaign for it on reddit and other places on the Internet it may become one of the arguments the pro-Science/NASA community have for wasted tax money that can be more useful if used on NASA or other science organizations.

       I really like Ron Paul's stance on it: we are broke, and there is evidence that our support prevents Israel from engaging in proper foreign policy (a viewpoint that even some in the Israeli political scene share).

       Why not try pulling the funding?

       This is one of the few things I agree with Ron Paul with, but like most of the things he says (even the ones I support him on), they simply will not work for many reasons.  They just
       <em>
        sound
       </em>
       really good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether people want to admit it or not, it would be political suicide to do so.  The US' Jewish population is both rich and powerful.  They are a big player both in government, as actual politicians, or as aides or counsel.  As voters, they make up a large part of Florida voters.  You lose Florida, and as a Presidential candidate, you lose a really big state.  If an established politician voted for cutting funding, not only would he be labeled as an anti-semite, but he could also be labeled as weak on defense or even pro-Muslim or all manner of other labels.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would NEED bi-partisan support to kill funding of Israel, but good luck getting any bi-partisan support for anything these days.

       Just because one view isn't help by everyone, it doesn't mean that a group still doesn't lean one way or another, and you better believe that Jews in the US hold extremely close ties to Israel.

       Nope. Sorry, that's a stereotype. There are even Orthodox Jews IN Israel that disagree with the Zionist regime ON PRINCIPLE, stating that the Torah expressly forbids the chosen people to have a State in the sense that Israel exists now.

       Well, their current government is one of the most broad-based and popular in decades.

       Most israelis are against ending the occupation for one reason. Ending the occupation of gaza and south lebanon led to a massive

       Who's missing the point now? A distinction hardly worth making, I assure you. If we were spending the equivalent to shore up own own infrastructure and social systems, you'd have a point. But we are not. Which indicates to those that are paying attention that this "mission of peace" is anything but. What you call allies are instead defensible beachheads for Corporate interests to launch their mineral rights campaigns from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is the most polarizing force in the ME, and is supported to aid in destabilizing the region to this end, making it easy for a corporate entity to swoop into these countries and buy up mineral rights for pennies on the petrodollar, then turn around and sell them for insane profits.

       The fact that it would be political suicide to pull funding isn't a good excuse to not do it. It just shows how broke the system is. We are going to have to tear it down and rebuild a system governed by direct democracy, not representational. These "representatives" do not, and cannot adequately represent the will of the majority.

      <p>
       Its not their fault that the American people are short sighted and so easily swayed by 5 second sound bites. Our representatives, whether you want to admit it or not, do indeed mirror their constituents.  But too many people are foolish enough to think that just because you can voice your opinions, its the same thing as acting on those opinions and going out to vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a very good reason why the young people in this country always seem to get shafted by elected officials.  Its because the average spoiled American teen and twenty-something is more interested in their new iPod than to bother voting and getting involved in the system.  Conversely, seniors in this country are, for the most part, treated like royalty, because come hell or high water, they vote.  You want to see what other groups vote? Go see who gets the best treatment when it comes to politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there too much money and corporate influence in politics? Oh, abso-freakin-lutely. But there are other ways that that could be fixed or curtailed that doesn't involve some silly idea of "tearing it down".

       I'm always interested in other peoples opinions on how to fix everything. The whole issue of voting concerns me too, because we know that voting can easily be rigged. So it doesn't seem like voting can or will make a difference. It feels so helpless without a true revolution. What was that Thomas Jefferson quote regarding revolution every so often?

       Its not gonna happen, and quite frankly the idea that you "need" a revolution to get things done is utter BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a political revolution in this country some ~30 years ago when the NeoCon movement swept the national stage and since then we've been living under their policies and we feel those repercussions all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The notion that "the system is rigged" is both tiring and smells of defeat.  Apathy is the establishment's biggest ally because it makes people think that "both parties are the same" or "its not gonna matter".  I buy into that thinking, I'm sorry.

       I agree with you, however, I don't think you'll get that out of most a-typical christian americans (which are a minority, so I don't know why their opinion matters so much on something that doesn't make sense).
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking for myself as a Christian, I think the US made a big mistake by trying to force most of the Jewish population back into Israel to try to fulfil a Biblical prophesy; the worst part is that they forced the Palestinians out of their own land to do it (which is why there is so much unrest in the area).
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as I would want the funding pulled, since the leaders of the US made a precedent to give funding, I suspect it would be almost seen as an act of war to pull that money away from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For this, among other various reasons, Ron Paul will never be elected.  He wants to do good things, but unfortunately those good things are very opposite of what the US government is slowly leaning towards.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT:
       </strong>
       I should mention that when I'm talking about Israel, I'm talking about Israel State, not the nation.

       Not quite.

       Most of the Chinese who died under Mao (40 to 70
       <em>
        million
       </em>
       ) died from starvation due to incompetent applications of Communism. It wasn't an attempted genocide, as all the victims were Chinese. The intent wasn't to wipe out Chinese.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stalin actually
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       attempt to commit genocide against the Ukranians, but even conservative estimates put it at about 10 million deaths, compared to the 12 million who died under the Holocaust. Most put the deaths closer to about 1-4 million. Those who died afterwards (some 1 - 30 million depends on how you count) in the Gulags and other offices of Stalins regime were not from genocide attempts, but from sheer ruthlessness at wiping out political "opponents" which including nearly everyone in Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither of them even came close to what Hitler did per capita, on his attempted genocide of European Jews, he killed a full 2/3rds of the people he attempted to wipe out.

       Wikipedia fwiw declares that Stalin murdered
       <em>
        7 million in Ukraine alone
       </em>
       by deliberately creating famine.  Sentiment in the Ukraine is that the event should be characterized as ethnic genocide.

       even with the edit it's still absurd. considering that the Germans killing thirty million people gutted the USSR for a generation, Stalin pushing that to sixty million would have made Russia look like Upper Volta (
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       missiles) a generation early.
      </p>
      <p>
       the claims that the 1937 and 1938 famines were acts of deliberate genocide is just as ridiculous, unless you want to extend that to include Russians and other ethnicities too. over a third of the population of (largely Russian) northern Kazakhstan died of starvation during that same period, for example. the reasons there was armed resistance uniquely in the Ukraine are because they were the major breadbasket of the country (and wanted to feed themselves first) and because Trotsky
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       cause mass intentional famines ten years earlier as part of his strategy against the Makhnovists (not a few people actually thought that he was back and lamented "if only Comrade Stalin knew of this, he would stop this!").
      </p>
      <p>
       both Stalin's and Mao's death tolls were almost entirely because nobody in either government had no idea how to run a country and put ideology ahead of pragmatism, not any deliberate malice on their part. the idea that any of Hitler's contemporaries were doing anything close to what he did is largely just a fanciful
       <em>
        tu quoque
       </em>
       argument made by weirdos who want to rehabilitate fascism as being anything other than an ideological excuse to go a-viking.

       Nobody gave Israel nukes. Mossad snuck nuclear materials into Israel from the States, from Jewish laboratory owners. The US was not happy at all about Israel having them.

       Much of the Christian support of the Israeli state does in fact come from Prophesy.  The second coming can not occur until the Jews retake Palestine, according to many Christian traditions.

       Actually it's a semi-shared prophesy between the Jews and Christians, as most of it is within the confines of the Old Testament.  The reason that it's only semi-shared is because popular Christian theology has certain twists based on the New Testament, which Jewish people generally do not believe is canonical.

       The historians who make an attempt to be objective (and criticize both sides) basically all agree that about 5% of the palestinians were kicked out by the jews, and the rest fled because they didn't enjoy living in a war zone and, unlike the jews, had some place to go.

       No forcing went on, and the Zionists rightfully bought most of the land, and won the rest in a war. No one disputes the Louisiana Purchase or the fact that the United States conquered Texas and Florida from Spain.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of my biggest pet peeves with the Israeli right to the land question. America was conquered in a much more disgusting and wrong manner than the establishment of the State of Israel, yet Israel gets a lot more hatred. The Palestinian people were never asked to crowd into the territories, it was the surrounding Arab countries that refused to accept their own "brothers".
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I didn't even notice your comment about the "Act of War". The discontinuation would NEVER be considered an act of war, and I don't know why you would say something like that. In addition, I can't imagine why anyone would ever want to stop helping (and being helped by) their ONLY ALLY in a hostile region of the world.

       Honestly, I think Israel State may be the US's only "second gun" because they are pumping so much money into them.  It may not turn into some sort of act of war, but it certainly wouldn't have a response like, "I guess you need your money somewhere else, no problem."
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there is an issue over the bought land (however, some may criticize the tactics used to purchase it), but I think the bigger issue was that land was lost over war, as an aggressive expansion to fully reclaim some land to make a few Zionists happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the reason a lot of people don't like Israel (at least in these post world war times) is because everyone sort of sees them as the weaker brother to the US when it's very clear that they can hold their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what do they need these extra billion dollars?  It's not like the state is particularly hurting financially (at least not any worse than the US).

       Can you imagine the kind of financial help the U.S. would need if Canada and Mexico regularly shot rockets in the U.S. and threatened the security of the country? If Mexico decided to invade, and all of Central America smuggled it illegal weapons? Our defense budget would be astronomically HIGHER than the already INSANE sum that it is, so I think it's difficult to question Israel's need for economic assistance.

       The Palestinian extremists shoot rockets into OCCUPIED territories, which are a violation of international law. Is it wrong? Yes. But the palestinains are rightfully upset that their land is being occupied, just many iraqis and afghanis are upset that their land are being occupied by the US.

       Israel currently has a blockade on palestine that blocks food and medical supplie. What point is there to this other than to make the palestinians suffer?

       Also,  you stated the Zionists bought the land. No they didn't. The Jewish Legion  conquered Palestine and led to the 1920 palestinian uprising. The Palestinians never consented to their land being taken. And since Israels creation, Israel has taken more and more land

       The uprising was a completely unprecedented attack of the Arabs living in Palestine at the time, who brutally attacked Jews for no reason.

       I never said Israel was 100% innocent. I agree that these are horrible things that should have, and should be, prevented, but at the same time, you cannot say that the displacement of Bedouin people is the direct cause of Hamas suicide bombings and rocket attacks. I don't want to start an argument here, let's end this amicably.

       Fair enough, but then I suppose it would be reasonable to hear both sides of the story of why everyone is shooting rockets at, and attacking Israel.  My knowledge of those politics is rather limited, and most is based on me trying to get over-excited Zionists to shutup and read their Bibles since often times their Zionist agenda seems to sort of contradict their sacred word.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, no problem with being kind.  There are enough trolls in social media, and I figure I don't need to add to the population.  I know I'm not the most informed when it comes to politics, but keeping the thread in a relatively sane direction is always good.  :)

       Won the rest in a war of aggression. Fought after a world war against aggressor regimes also looking to expand their territory. A war in which the same people now doing the expanding were horribly abused.
The aftermath of WWII was an agreement by the world that (open) wars for the purposes of territorial expansion could no longer be tolerated. Yes, this idealism didn't extend everywhere or manage to hold up 100% of the time but one would have expected the people who as a group got their shit kicked in the hardest be the last ones rolling fucking tanks into their own Rhineland.

       As for equating it to the conquering of Texas etc. anyone who's read that history knows the young United States acted pretty horrendously. There were glorious even honorable
       <em>
        moments
       </em>
       as there are with most wars but, on the whole? Fuck those guys. It's "ok" now because nationalistic whitewashing of history happened along a long enough time frame that the details have been "forgotten". Welcome to the 21st century, that kind of shit doesn't (shouldn't) fly anymore.

       It sure was. An entire indigenous population was almost exterminated. Some Mexicans died too (I kid). But you know what? Those events happened during colonial, post-colonial and imperial phases of western history. That's not an excuse for conduct, that's historical context. Context is important. Again, the young state of Israel didn't get a free pass to employ historically shameful expansionist practices because "you did it first". A new state is expected by the global community to come into the world cognizant of the era it finds itself in and conduct itself accordingly. I don't get to own slaves if I can subdue some just because my great-great-great grandfather owned slaves.

       Are you fucking kidding me? Crowd into the territories? As if the land was already carved up just like that before Israel the new state existed? As if they weren't peacefully spread out before the state existed?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why should the surrounding nations have accepted a nation of refugees created overnight by expansionist military aggression? Because they're Arabs? They should have just ignored the socio-political and economic situation within their own states? Just bankrupted themselves absorbing sudden unplanned immigration because their new neighbor decided to unilaterally expand its borders? Come the fuck on.

      <p>
       Reread what you just wrote because what you basically said was, "if they didn't like it they should have just left and other countries should have taken them in".
If I were to say "if Jews in Nazi territory didn't like the segregation and discrimination they should have just left (during the period they were free to do so obviously) and other countries with Jews should have taken them in. I mean no one

       I think the scenario's are very different, there is a real possibility that Pakistan could be taken by Muslim extremists. Iran isn't funded by the US afaik (if they do then wtf) but they do fund opposition groups, not that they have any chance because Iran is relatively wealthy and well run ('well run' depends upon how you feel about defending yourself against the US).

       Now, of course, Iran is funded by the US insistence on massive-scale use of fossil fuels, as well as intense opposition from the very people wo see them as a threat. The opposition to taxing carbon, or at least paying for the wars we are fighting to keep prices stable, also is a factor.

       The money to Egypt is also a kind of annual payoff for the Camp David Accords. So in a way it's indirect aid to Israel.

       Egypts knows that agression against Israel will be punished by a cutoff of aid. Imagine if Egypt had engaged in some of the military adventures Israel has engaged in since 1979, such as bombing Iraq. Do you think they would still get aid? Israel did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that I think Israel and Egypt are equivalent, but aid to Egypt clearly helps Israel.

       But the reverse is the same too: If Israel attacks Egypt they lose their funding. That's one of the main reasons you haven't heard anything from Netanyahu regarding Egypt like what he says about Iran.

       That's absolutely true, but the issue is regional stability. Israel has a lot more leeway than Egypt. Imagine if Egypt had started supplying the Libyan government with arms, or Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Egypt had its own problems to deal with so that wouldn't happen anyway, but if Mubarak had maintained his grip on power it would be in a position to meddle in other states.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also a reflection of internal stability. If Egypt had a stronger economy like Israel the relative importance of foreign aid would not be so high.

       Implying that someone would "single out Israel" is not an argument. That ad hominem at best, and just a more elegant way of saying "I disagree with you, you must be an anti semite".
      </p>
      <p>
       "Egypt did it as well" is not an argument either, that's more on the level of a kindergarten-debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, Israel's been constantly occupying its neighbours because 2000 year old fairy tales told them so. Or whatever reason the right-wingers claim nowadays...that's giving them kind of a bad reputation. Is it really so hard to understand why some people don't want to support the completely baseless expansion policies with their tax dollars any more?

       How is that not the argument. OP mentions only Israel spending cuts of $3 billion dollars without any word of any other foreign aid or $3+ trillion in annual spending. I really don't see how you can argue that.

       Why is this in quotes? I did not say that. You are making things up, which is actually the level of a kindergarten-debate. It is a valid point as OP is not against ALL foreign aid, which would make sense... just Israel (again singling out).

       Well no, that is not true. That land has been the home of Jews for several thousands of years. There is ample amounts of evidence. It was previously controlled by the Ottoman Empire, which ended and split up. The UN divided up some of the the land and gave a small sliver to Israel. This was agreed upon internationally. Israel has fought and won several wars defending themselves. It is theirs. This isn't "right-winger" claims or whatever idiotic stuff you want to spit out. These are the facts.

       That's the whole point. The european powers put borders down and said "you're a country now". That's why there is so much ethnic violence in the middle east; there was no logical reasons for these states to become states.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the "palestinian people" are a product of this. They never were a people or had a single ethnicity ever.

       If you withdraw the funding to Israel they wont be able to fund their defence program... If they dont do that, then Israel will be attacked by the mindless Iranians and the Muslim communityies in the middle east... the death of milions of jews is not something the US can do with. Remember the Iranians want to wipe the jews off the face of this planet.... Please think about what you say!!

       Are you kidding me? Please research your facts before you insinuate the US would cause the next holocaust by stoping our money to Israel. While it is true that the US gives the most money to the Jewish state, private individuals have been sending money to Israel for DECADES and it is in the millions if not billions of dollars. (It does not have to be public knowledge as it is thought of as a religious donation). Also Israel has the most nukes of any country in the region, a hawkish government who is not afraid to use its military and a militeristic element of the population who believes that land was actually promised a thousand years ago but some man in the sky that must be reclaimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also The Iranians talk a big game they would never attack Israel because they know Israel alone could wipe them out.

       This would be argued against and have you labeled an anti-Semite. The modern usage of the word was used to mean anti-Jew and that's how it's commonly used. It's also good for branding purposes if your group has a specific word to denote people who are against your group. It's a lot more powerful than saying anti-Jew.

       Question - why Israel instead of Pakistan (which receives slightly more aid than Israel)?  Or Egypt?  Or Colombia or Jordan or Russia?  Maybe the reason people call anti-semitism on threads like this is because it is awfully suspicious to single out only Israel when there are numerous other countries that receive substantial foreign aid packages despite not being seriously under-developed.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, NASA probably is a better use of funds than some of these foreign aid programs.  Frankly though, we waste significantly more money on domestic programs that have even less benefit which I would rather divert funding from.

       Nobody's "wah wah wah", you said they can afford to defend themselves, and they can't without aid.
Also, if you cut their defence funding, you lost a lot of the technological and biomedical technologies that they provide to the rest of the world.

       Israel can afford to defend themselves, full stop.  If not, 3 billion is not going to do the trick.  Besides, Israel was fully capable of starting wars with neighbors before we started giving them money; in fact I do believe the 3 billion had something to do with getting them to stop.

       So now we're funding the private industry of Israel with our three billion?  If Israel invents something marketable, it doesn't need the US to pay it money to sell it.

       Oh, we wouldn't have the Kinect, a bit of consumer electronics?  Well, 3 billion a year would have funded a

       I also hate the illegal settlements, and think they should stop building them. Many Israelis feel the same way. I also don't believe Jews came in the night and "stole" the land from the Palestinians. I think it was given to them by England/UN.

       I know you don't like me, but I'm not actually arguing with you, except about a country's finances...I didn't make any moral argument in support of Israel. So...now you're in a one-sided argument about how much you hate those land-stealing Jews. Which there are plenty of places to vent your anger...

       ...so I guess you're not that cool and smart after all...maybe not so handsome either.

       Quite frankly, I say cut all aid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe not to ZERO, because I do believe that some money spent on supporting out allies is cheaper than fighting our enemies, but still cut funding for all countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here's the kicker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Far as I know, Israel is the only country that time and again sells our military secrets to countries like China, and goes against our best wishes when it comes to dealing with international situations.  If they want to go all rogue on us and start WW3 in the middle east, then that's on them, but unfortunately, every time that Israel does something, WE are automatically implicated as accomplices.  And I for one am sick of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, but lets be clear here.  You mention Egypt, Columbia, Jordan and Russia.

       Russia doesn't even make this list and I've never heard of us giving them money.
       <br/>
       Egypt, Jordan and Columbia COMBINED don't get as much as Israel gets.  Egypt gets a little more than HALF of what Israel gets.

       Your link doesn't work for me - I get an error about the site not allow hot linking.  According to USAID here are the total receipts of foreign air/military assistance for each country in 2010 (in millions):
      </p>
      <p>
       Pakistan: 2,853.5
Israel: 2,835.8
Egypt: 1,698.9
Colombia: 863.7
Jordan: 767.1
Russia: 505.9
      </p>
      <p>
       So Egypt, Jordan and Colombia combined do get more than Israel, and Egypt gets more than half of what Israel does.  Also interesting to note the West Bank/Gaza received 693.1 million, a full 10% of their GDP.

      <p>
       What Israel has done, and continues to do to the Palestinians is on the level of Apartheid in South Africa.  And the Palestinians being Muslims, all the nations in that region hate Israel, and because of our close ties to Israel, they hate us as well.  Any time Israel does something to instigate their neighbors, we are typically the ones that are indirectly blamed for their actions.

       why do you see them as enemies.. you cant blame the 3 billion$ you give israel and not blame the 700 billlion $ (the real number is larger) the taxpayers pay for all these murders and domination over others.

       Why do you call them enemies if they have never attacked your country  or why do you not blame the USA.. Israel is just a tool for the elite.. the main millitary powers is in the hands of the taxpayers and voters of america

       Who are Americas enemies?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is a loaded question.  If you want to follow the media and certain groups in this country, the "easy" answer is "all those Muslims", but that's bullshit because the only reason many Muslim nations don't like us is because we as a country have meddled into their affairs for decades now.  And one of the reasons that is that we blindly support Israel even when they instigate their Muslim neighbors.  So even though Israel is supposedly  an "ally" of ours, they get us into trouble with the very nations that have the single most important resources to our prosperity.  Also Israel, even though again, they are supposed an "ally" has been caught stealing our military secrets and selling them to the Chinese.  For that alone, we should cut funding to Israel.  Not only would cutting financial ties to them save us a tiny amount of money, but it would also improve the US' standing in much of the Arab world.
      </p>
      <p>
       If makes most economic sense, to be friendly with the people that control a vitally important natural resource, than it does to see them as enemies.

       that knocked down the towers.  I don't wanna hear that stupidity because that is all it is.  Next you are going to say that its some green space aliens that did it.  Or it was the big bad gob'ment that was to blame.  Conspiracy theorists have something wrong with their brains.  They want to explain away some tragic event by trying to say that a whole huge mess of people were involved or some other crazy explanation.  Except that its totally wrong. Sometimes shit just happens.

       Right, because Pakistan harboring Osama Bin Laden, permitting the Taliban to operate against US forces in their country, and selling nuclear technology to North Korea is no big deal.  We send money to plenty of shitty countries and you are kidding yourself if you think Israel is the worst.

       Israel used WP as a smoke agent, not in its weaponized form, in Gaza.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, American and coalition forces have used weaponized WP in afghanistan and iraq.

       If you think Pakistan isn't occupying an indigenous people without their consent, then you've never heard of the Baluch people. Who, unlike the Palestinians, had a history before the creation of the state of pakistan.

       While we're there, the accusation of "apartheid" is pretty sickening to those who actually saw apartheid, in its real form, in south africa. And again, if you think Russia and Pakistan aren't sending spies into other countries to kill diplomats and politicians (something israel hasn't done, unless you consider arms dealers to be politicians), then you're just not paying attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: your comment is the epitome of the argument that criticism of israel is based upon double standards, inappropriate and emotionally manipulative use of provocative phrasing, and ignorance.

       The term "Palestine" never referred to a state, people, ethnicity, language, culture, etc, etc, etc before the creation of Israel (and it wasn't in widespread use, even in the Middle East, until after the 1967 war).
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, many Arab sources referred to the Jews as Palestinians before the creation of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the debatable exception of Egypt, Morrocco, and the UAE, all the Arab states were drawn up on an arbitrary basis by the European colonial powers for their own ends. There was no Palestinian people, just as there were no Iraqi, or Jordanian people.

       Incorrect. The average Israeli Jew is descended from Arab Jews ethnically cleansed from the Arab countries between 1925-1970. Before the Jewish refugees from the former Soviet Union arrived in the 1970's, they numbered about 70% of the Jewish population of Israel. In addition, while the exact numbers are debated, it is certain that a significant percentage of the "Palestinian" population is descended from those who lived outside of what is now Israel and the occupied territories prior to 1948. Look at the leaders of the Palestinian movement. Arafat was born in Cairo. Edward Said spent most of his childhood in Egypt and was half Egyptian. The large Palestinian clans which dominated pre-zionist politics can mostly trace their histories back to outside of Palestine in the last few centuries. Non-palestinian nisbat (arabic name modifiers which imply a familial origin) are extremely common amongst palestinians. And the area has been conquered dozens of times in the past few hundred years. It has also been subject to waves of mass immigration/emigration, natural disasters, and massacres of the majority of the population. It's disingenuous to assume that the palestinians are "indigenous" and the jews are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why all your pity for the Arabs uprooted by violence, but disdain and denial about the greater number of Jews uprooted from arab lands by violence?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe my original comment answers that question quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's not to say that I don't think Israel deserves criticism for a many of its actions. But there's no difference between criticism and hatred when the criticism is based upon lies or double standards.

       While I hail your command of the facts and recognize that you're responding to another post, I still think this exemplifies the main problem with "defense of Israel" posts, which is that you end up accusing your opponent of hate because he criticized based on information you disagree with. Frankly, I think if the term anti-semite (and the accusations of hate that come with it) were no longer used in the U.S., criticism of Israel would drop off a cliff. In other words, I would
       <em>
        theorize
       </em>
       that the double-standards you discuss exist because no one really cares to defend Russia or Pakistan on any but the most "pragmatic" (in the worst bastardization of the word) terms.

       I never said they were an anti-semite. But I do think that much of the "criticism" towards Israel is based on blind hatred. Of Israel, not of Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I think that accusations that "those who criticize israel get accused of being anti-semitic" mainly exists within the head of critics of israel. I pay close attention to this debate, and it's very rare that I see those who defend israel accuse their critics of anti-semitism.

       The money we send to Israel, Pakistan, Russia, Egypt etc. pays for a stable democracy in the Middle East, dozens of military base locations and diplomatic relations with unstable governments. To the US it is worth the money.

       So we accept nuclear winter in exchange for a small, highly dependant colony on Mars?  I am not saying sending money to
       <em>
        Israel

       is a good strategy.  But every sane nation must use every lever available to prevent all out nuclear or biological war. Insularity no longer exists, there are no islands or fortresses anymore.

       Or without foreign meddling these countries realize that they have to learn to live together and after some trials and setbacks they finally do.

       Throwing money at this problem doesn't solve anything.  People bitch about the US being too involved in everyone else's business.  We are vilified if we go into a war. We are vilified if we stay out of wars. We are vilified if we enter wars "late".  I know my opinion isn't popular but I say we leave the rest of the world alone and don't do shit unless someone directly starts shit with us.  Use our resources for space exploration.

       Right. So since when we should stop doing what we feel is right because someone else label us? There has to be a sea change on US foreign policy. Bribing countries to be our 'friends' is not a sound strategy, especially when their stance is likely to reverse when there is no more money to give them.

       I'm Jewish, and I am not opposed to this idea. Israel is a booming country on its own and while I'm sure the money helps, they can probably manage without it. NASA is the god damn future of our race.

       Nah, I think it keeps with the Judeo-Christian scripture.  According to Revelations, 144,000 Jews from the tribes of Israel are going to be taken up to meet Jesus in the sky and are the only ones who get to heaven.  Simply take the most orthodox Christians and Jews, and send them on a one-way trip into space!  Problem solved!

       Any time an Israel-related thread comes up, this comment (or a similar one) is made long before any mention of antisemitism. You are trying to make it seem like if you hadn't said this, antisemitism accusations would be flying around, when this is
       <em>
        not the case
       </em>
       . I'm not sure what this logic is called, but it's something. Can anyone help me out on the term for what he's doing here?

       It's called a straw man, and you're right. Anti-zionists love to insist that criticism of israel is silenced by accusations of anti-semitism...all while nobody calls them anti-semitic.

       The reason why America give Israel so much money is for help with intelligence. Israel Has discovered more terrorist cells in the U.S. and warned of constant attacks that were prevented due to Israel intelligence. We also give Israel money so we have an ally close enough to the Muslim arab states incase the plan to attack the U.S. as there leaders have proclaimed. I do not agree with many thing Israel has done but do not be so quick to judge.

       As for the second, yes, this is partly true. It also probably has to do with oil, some holdover Cold War mentality, and the fact that it is also the Christian holy land. Who really knows. Regardless, we do or have done the same thing in Egypt, Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc.

       Having said that, I have nothing against the Jewish people. Not a single thing, unless they are... wait for it... Militaristic Zionists.

       I'm from California and I've never met an anti-semite who didn't also hate pretty much every race and were just generally very hateful people, and the Jews seemed to be pretty far down their list too.

       thank you truestoryrealtalk, I live in the South and that may be why I see anti-semtism to such an extent, but I also encountered it when I studied in Europe and the Middle East.  It seems to be very wide spread especially in Arab countries although most will adamantly deny this.  I am caught in a catch 22: people will and do use hate for Israel and Zionism as a shield for their antisemitism but if I call them out they say that everyone says your antisemitic for disagreeing with Israel but on the other hand those people make people like me suspicious of most anti Israel people because so many are really just anti jew which makes it harder to accept their opinions (does this make sense)

       This is the same reason why there should be self-policing amongst all groups and cultures.  If someone has done something evil regardless of their affiliation they should be handed over for justice or ostracized.  We saw an example of this in the US with Jerry Sandusky.  This man was evil and the fact that he was hidden and his deeds covered up by people trying to protect their own was something that cultures around the world do regularly.  Police brutality in the US falls in the same category IMO.
I agree people use anti-Israel as a shield of anti-semitism but quickly jumping the gun on both sides of the argument prevent intellectual conversation.

       When you research and dispute the facts for yourself.  There is a point when theories based on untruths becomes obvious.  When convenient explanations become more complex and start to repeat things that didn't happen. However open dismissal invites wearing blinders similar to those in Pennsylvania when the first Sandusky victim came forward they actually had to put him in protective custody because of the community backlash.  And he was the victim!!!

       but so many of these claims are nonsensical, If Israel does something its bad, if something happens to Israel its good, these people want all the negative to be placed on Israels shoulders and they don't require any research to start foaming at the mouth and screaming false flag

       I gather there are various interpretations of Zionist. I mean the part of Zionism that purports superiority and exceptionalism of Israel. Texas. I have never met anyone that made it apparent they are anti-Semitic. They might have been, I just was never shown it. I'm all for Jews but not when they act the way Israel has. I honestly don't see the two as the same thing. From what I gather, some Jewish fundamentalists feel the same way.

       This posting has nothing to to do with anti semitism but about transferring funding from a system that is doing reasonably well in its own, to a other system that could use the help. Not only for America's well being, but NASA does benifit people around the world.

       I have never heard a jew actually refer to a non jew as goyum, only redditors seem to do that.  Have I said anything that is anti anyone? no.  I simply hate it when people say non factual statements.  I don't disagree that we should take some funds from foreign aid and move it towards NASA but I responding to this stupid sentiment that people can't criticize Israel for fear of being called an antisemite.  Which was exactly what the original post I commented on said and is incorrect.  Just a shed some light on my "closed mindedness" all I have said here is that people who are antisemitic tend to cover it by saying zionist or Israel, explain how this is anti goyum as you say

       Giving a few billion to Israel and Egypt to maintain some semblance peace in the region is a lot cheaper than getting dragged into a regional war. However, if the US really wanted to use its aide dollars more effectively, it would tie its payments to achieving milestones and peace initiatives. This includes providing aide to the Palestinians as well.

       Actually 0 aid goes to palestinians from the military aid that is sent to Israel. And on top of that, israel is not forced to declare what it spends americas money on, so money can go towards building settlements inside Palestinian territories -- in violation of international law.

       The UN general assembly (a body heavily biased against Israel, as the muslim nations easily outvote israel) and related organizations say it's illegal. Several eminent, non-jewish legal scholars disagree.

       Actually no, 75% of the aid has to be spent on american equipment, and the rest must go towards munitions and weapons. None goes towards building settlements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that it matters, because there haven't been any new settlements constructed in years. You are speaking about construction within existing settlements.

       I can explain to you why the US acts as the policeman. It is to provide cover for British and European Royalty and (largely Jewish) Bankers. If the US goes into country X and blows up shit and kills thousands of people, the country's people will quite rightly hate us, but they do not see the real shotcallers who are behind the invasion. Of course, there are US people who are in on the game too (the 1%), but the vast majority of the controlers are Old World  types.

       if we stop giving aid who is going to come to America to engage us in a war? No one. They can engage us because we keep troops all over the middle east... Israel and Egypt wanna fight, fine... Who cares?!?!?!?! Why does it merit American intervention?!?!?! Im sick of seeing young men and women sent to stupid countries to die for stupid reasons so stupid people can spend all our tax money!  Its insane. No country in the middle east could come to America and hurt us one bit... but when we go there they can use $4 worth of trash and HME to make an IED to take out $1,000,000 vehicles and people. Wake UP!

       Still won't fix the deficit. You need at this point to cut 40% of the budget.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you cut 700 billion, which means ALL of the "defense" budget and lets say you find the "black ops" operations that get funded in hidden bills and stuff, you would get another 250-300 billion dollars, that would mean you still have 400 billion deficits. Yeah it won't be 1.3 trillion every year, but you would still need to cut.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US government spends 4 trillion US dollars each year, that is 500 billion more than the whole German GDP and only 1 trillion less than the SECOND biggest economy in the world ~ China, which has a 5 trillion GDP.

       I have a problem with that article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Posit (fallacious)
        </strong>
        : These anti-drunk driving ad campaigns are not going to work. People are still going to drink and drive no matter what.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Rebuttal
        </strong>
        : Complete eradication of drunk driving is not the expected outcome. The goal is reduction.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The problem is that anti-drug commercials and programs as they are currently implemented fail spectacularly, and if they do reduce drug use/misuse, it's not significant enough to matter.

       "Climate Change" is a great neologism, and is less apt to be misunderstood, but it's hardly canonical. I agree that it's the better term to use, and I shall endeavor to remember that for the future.

       Listen, I can't stop you from mentioning Kim Kardashian or anything else, but muddying up discussions about admittedly small cuts in foreign aid with discussions about Climate Change do neither of those topics justice.  Turns into one big mess of incoherent yelling.

       The economics is a bit counter intuitive, but can be illustrated simply.
      </p>
      <p>
       If nobody thinks the economy is doing well, they do not shop, or invest in the future, because they believe that saving the money, instead of investing or spending, is their best option. This leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy, where the economy really does slow. This is a recession.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government starts investing, people see the results, and it can jump-start a recovery. This requires borrowing, in lean times such as today. It's not "Money we don't have," it's a loan. When is borrowing a good idea? This is actually the same as any corporation - if the government thinks that the things it borrows to buy or create are cheaper now, or will cause benefits that exceed the costs. If the government can spend $100 on something that saves $20 / year from now on, that is a good investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if the government can spend $1t to help the economy recover, the only question is whether the total economic benefit from doing so exceeds the cost. If the benefit of that spending is, say, $500b/year, then (without really discussing tax policy and the effects on spending,) the idea is that spending the money now will be worth the investment, which can be recovered by taxing half of that added benefit for a bit more than four years.

       or, people arent saving because the govt is printing money out of control to pay for wars and finance debt and if i but $1 in the bank today in a year the $1.03 i will have from interest will only but $.94 of what i could have bought that first year. And its not the govts job to run the economy. Its not in the Constitution to take from the people to spend on companies who lobby so that we can get a "jump start". Every time the govt gets in the economy it changes for the worse. How bout we let the free market work, stop bailing out companies and let them fail so the ones who live will be stronger and learn about malinvestment. This "no consequences" society needs to stop.

       I agree with the sentiment, but the reality is that the government is needed to make the economy work. In complex systems, reductionist solutions are tempting, but rarely optimal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without government backing, the dollar you have today is worth nothing. Literally nothing. So who decides on the rules for currency, fractional reserving, and interest? We could go back to having nobody in charge, but modern economies would not work if that were the case. (There would be significantly too much uncertainty to invest in anything.) The US government certainly has some corrupt practices, some bungling, and some very significant drawbacks, but the response can't be "we'll just let companies do whatever they want." Unlimited corporate power isn't capitalism as envisioned by Smith or other theorists, and it does not work.
      </p>
      <p>
       A central issue is that governments tend towards maximizing their power, which means they interfere when they should not, and they are less efficient at running programs than the free market. In a democracy, the only check on this is the will of the people; if the government upsets too many of them, they will be forced out of office.
      </p>
      <p>
       But corporations are not the answer; corporations also tend towards maximizing their power, and they have no responsibilities to anyone but their owners. If the most profitable course of action is to let people die, they will. If the most profitable course of action is to kill people, bribe governments, or destroy the environment, they will do that also. The only check on increasing corporate power is government, in the form of regulation and pressure from people, in the form of boycotts - and that only works when government forces corporations to be transparent enough for the public to know what companies are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have a system that has two forces that interact, and collusion between them is the "no consequences" society you dislike. It's a problem, but upsetting the balance of power in the favor of corporations isn't a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS. As a final point, capitalism works best when corporations are small, and non has the power to materially disrupt the market. Government is notoriously bad at encouraging small companies at the expense of large ones.

       TL; dont have time but if the feds werent controlling the dollar it would be a competitive currency market and the ones backed by gold would survive. Our dollar is worth nothing, BECAUSE of the government. Therefor i will not dignify you by reading the rest of it.

       I did explain the point a bit, but not sufficiently. I'm not saying it's impossible for it to work, it's a complex topic. The problem with your approach to the argument, however, is that you are trying to win instead of discuss the topic and understand it. Because of that fact, confirmation bias will ensure that you never change your mind, right or wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your theories about competitive currency are not well thought of by economists for a variety of reasons. That doesn't imply that you are wrong, just that people who know a lot about the subject disagree. If you are convinced of your argument, you should read what the other side has to say, with an open mind. That won't force you to change your opinion, but it will make you evaluate your opinions outside of an echo chamber that only reinforces your prior beliefs.

       I have been living with the other side and seen the dollar lose 96% of its value since the Fed got involved. Scotland had competing gold backed currency and no legal tender laws for years and it worked just fine. The people who disagree with the policies i suggest benefit from the policies we have. When has a government ever surrendered a power peacefully?

       To be fair, Germany has ~80 million people, vs. ~300 million in the US. If you scaled the German GDP (assuming the 3.5 billion are correct) to the size of the people it would be roughly 30% of the GDP.

       What is significant enough? The top 1% pay something along the lines of 25% of the tax burden, and the top 20% pay over 90%. Cutting spending is the key- not increasing taxes.

       The top 1% make much more than 25% of the nations income, so they should at least pay accordingly. You can't get rich without profiting from government spending on education you and your workers received, the infrastructure that is built, the protection that is provided by police and the fire department.

       we  should be shooting for a 100% unemployment rate. we SHOULD have robots do everything practical for us so we can pursue more important things like philosophy and sex. everything is backward. we should be shrinking the economy until there's like 100 of us and we can have the entire world's population live like planetary kings.

       I think you need to look at the chronology of those events.  The 90% of stock market loss and GDP drop was due to the impending bankruptcy of the country, not due to bank recapitalization and currency devaluation.  The negative impacts PREdated the ameliatory measures and are what precipitated them.

       I don't disagree that the market and GDP drop started before hand, but it was continued because of the devaluation.  Again, as I stated earlier it's a great concept anyway, but it would not be possible in the US. We're talking about 1/10000th of the population in the US. The comparison will not work.

       That's easy, I have 100,000 barrels of oil produced in a day. Say you make profits of $1 a barrel.  Spread those profits out over 32,000 people and they get about $3.  Spread out over 350 million and everyone gets less than a penny.
      </p>
      <p>
       These numbers of course are arbitrary and there are areas of the US that would do very well if this was to happen, but it's a lot easier to take care of 30 thousand people when times are tough than 350 million with very diverse attitudes about things.

       No, the recovery happened because of the devaluation.
       <br/>
       I suppose you would also argue that Obama is responsible for the job losses of the recession because the recession deepened just after he took office.
Of course it would be possible in the US.  We already do do this, it's called quantitative easing.  However, it's probably not sufficient or desirable to do the job only through inflation and so we also need economic stimulus investment from the US govt.

       I never disagreed that the recovery happened because of the devaluation, but the decline continued through the bank changes and devaluation.  The only reason the recovery happened was because the resources could now be sold off at a far lower price of extraction due to the devaluation, helping to create low cost jobs in the resource industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this can NOT happen in the US.  If you devalue the currency more all you will do is create even larger trade imbalances and end up costing everyone MORE for the resources that the economy requires to continue at the rate it does.  While the US is resource rich, you still import a massive amount from the rest of the world, and dropping the dollar will only make that harder.

       It will make exports and US labor more competitive.  Pretty sure devaluation does work since it has before in the US and around the world the past few years.

       No it's not, but that Hydro and Geothermal power is all that's needed to keep 32,000 people doing ok.  If you moved another million people into Iceland they would be an extremely resource poor country, but we're working on per capita basis here.

       They relieved the mortage debt for over 10% of the population and threw out those banks.  We have opened more drilling sites in the States in the last four years than the rest of the world combined.  We are also resource-rich, I don't get how the two cannot correlate.

       Over 10% of 320,000 people is about the amount of people you would have to bail out in Tonawanda NY, let alone the other 150 Million people you need to deal with.  And you are no where near as resource rich per person as Iceland is, not even close.  You've tapped most of the easy oil wells, dug up a lot of resources, are on the brink of massive water reserve issues, and an integrated global economy that DISAPPEARS if you decide to 'throw the banks out'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get your intention, I don't like the system the way it is either, but you are way further down an integrated global market path than iceland was, pulling out would be catastrophic.

       I would've like to see a bailout for home owners instead of a bailout for the banks. If the 3 trillion dollars given to banks would've been divided through out the American population and they paid their mortgage debts, wouldn't that have bailed out the banks too and put a end to the housing bubble and the economic down turn in the US and the world?

       Sure, but the justification given was that you'd be bailing out irresponsible home owners, and that's just not acceptable to the big bankers.  If they don't control the money people might make their own lives better.

       Well I meant to say all Americans, divide the money to everyone. You have your mortgage situation under control, you'd have the consumer spending situation under control since people without homes would just buy stuff, and you could put the student debt problem within control for college students. But instead of doing all that and working from the bottom up we bailed out the billionaire bankers and not the backbone of this country; the American people.

       The people who made the decision about it do not care though, they only wanted to make sure they were going to get reelected by their masters.  Bailing out college students and 'irresponsible' home owners sounds like socialism.  Apparently bailing out bankers is capitalism.

       The core issue at stake in a financial crisis is liquidity. To have a functioning economy, money has to move back and forth between parties. Debt is a major source of liquidity, as it allows people to both hold money and spend it at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of stimulus spending during a recession is not only to "kick-start" the economy, but also to add a huge influx of cash into the market. After Japan's crash in 1991 they refused to provide a sufficient influx of liquidity into the economy. They have never recovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       A strong central bank manages not only interest rates, but also liquidity.  Have you ever heard of the crash of 1987? Probably not, because the Fed immediately added liquidity and the economy was able to recover.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinging to the gold standard extended the length of the Great Depression, because in a Gold Standard economy you
       <em>
        can't
       </em>
       add liquidity.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main point is that people need money to do business, and if everybody is hoarding theirs, you need a central bank to start handing it out. Without a central bank, we'd be screwed in situations like these.

       Money may be just paper, but its Legal Tender gives it the ability to pay off debts.  Inflation in turn represents how much 'debt' money is worth.

       This was pointed out, i was looking at the numbers pulled from around reykjavik, the capital and my brain forgot to doubel it, i already acknowledged it but it still doesn't change anything, 175k,320k is still insignificant compared to even the population of Alaska, which is double that again.

       You can wipe the debt, I support that, but it won't fix anything, unless you cut spending. You are adding about 1.5 trillion per year, even if you were to wipe all the debt, in just 6 to 7 years you'd still go up at about 10 trillion debt.

       Look you can't bring down the defense budget to 0, as that would mean you would have no military at all. So from about 700 billion you can cut half or so and bring it to about 300-350 billions, that would still make for 1 trillion deficit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes I do see other ways to cut spending. If I was elected to be a tyrant I would allow competing currencies, print another 10 trillion dollars and give all individuals over 18, 30k us dollars, cut the deficit by 1.4 trillion by abolishing the FBI, reducing the CIA by half, dismantling the homeland security, ending the wars and cutting back the defense budget to about 250 billion dollars, cut the FDA, EPA, end Obamacare, remove medicaid and medicare, transfer state schooling to the states, reduce congress salaries and benefits by half, remove insurance companies from the medical equation and provide real FREE medical services paid for by the government in the emergency service and set up an account for donations to the emergency service, remove fractional reserve banking, allow market interest rates, abolish the FED, remove all business regulations, end all food stamps, revamp the social security and make all accounts private, unable to be used by the government, allow everyone to opt out of it, start a full audit of unemployment benefits to curb double users or users that are employed and I believe this will be enough to cut 1.5 trillion dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the 30k worth of bailouts of every individual it will assure people who are fired like all the people in the FBI and TSA and the rest of them have money for about a year, it will insure most of the debt is payed off, whether its student loans, business loans or house loans, this will in turn free up the banking system and increase confidence as people are paying off their debts, this coupled with the removal of fractional reserve banking and allowing market interest rates will promote accountability by the banks and allow for savings, with interest rates rising high due to the economic situation before this, we'd actually see the value of the US dollar increase offsetting the 10 trillion dollars of newly printed money and then ending the fed to ensure no more manipulation of the markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       In case the 10 trillion actually causes very high inflation or borderline hyper inflation, I would have allowed for competing currencies of all kind be used, so people have a fallback.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all of the cuts the federal budget would actually make a profit for the first time in over 100 years. I would do all this within 3 to 6 months, the sooner its done the faster the recovery can occur and I expect within a year all that individuality and all those entrepreneurs to start building businesses and producing stuff, starting to offset much of the unemployment and I expect a full recovery within 1 to 2 years with  a steady growth of about 2-3% percent for the next 5-10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd probably cut taxes as well within 2 years or actually increase taxes for some who have been paying 2-3% only and have a flat tax rate of 18%, remove all corporate, inheritance or other taxes and only have the income tax set at 18% for everyone with no exceptions, even for charities.

       But you have to also take into the argument that the US is the only first world population that is still growing, so our future tax forecast is still increasing so that's why our economy hasn't gone in the shitter like it would for most other countries with the same situation. Also you have to put into account whoever has the biggest stick makes all the rules and with a 14 trillion dollar debt which is mostly spent on the military I'm pretty sure we have the biggest stick by far.

       Yeah and that stick goes both ways, in your assholes and other countries people's assholes and is controlled by the globalist elite.

       You got to understand the USA has been taken over and it does not serve the general public interest, it serves the globalists and bankers interest and that is to destroy all free countries that aren't under globalist control and then form a one world government with the global economic collapse and global warming as a pretext to set it up, so they can "fix" it.

       Oh yeah I know what's happening only the dumbest of the people can't see that anymore. But I'm just trying to say that's what we should have done instead. I'm also saying that since we have this huge military our debt really doesn't matter because who's going to come collect it. But way to recognize the problem good sir robot.

       Yeah, but the USA debt to other countries is not very large, about 3.5 trillion only, most of the debt is owned to the federal reserve actually.

       About 6 trillion is real debt to banks and investment companies and countries and stuff like that, the large portion is owned to the federal reserve.

       Yeah I agree, lots of domestic debt from the banksters. That just makes my argument even more valid, if we owe the people in control all the money and they control the military then they're the one's with the biggest sticks making it impossible for us to collect our liberty from them. They read the same things we do, they just know how to turn them around on us.

       even so, if we can take that money and invest it in things that bring a return on investment (industries that provide essentially profit for the gov't) then I think it could go a long ways.

       Well again, nice theory, but it rarely works. Thing is as long as the government can auction off money (for whatever reason, even things like building roads) it will provide incentive for private companies to lobby and that creates corruption and corruption creates more corruption and we all know where that leads to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say you want very limited government and only small local government being able to offer small local contracts like to some company to maintain the lights and stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, 4 trillion dollar government and look where that got you, more or same amount of government isn't the solution, its less government, less governments contracts, less government workers, less government involvement, less, less, less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look the USA just federal government is bigger than any government that has ever existed in the history of the world, there has never ever been bigger government in the world, how is that working out for you?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is less government, significantly less.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: And believe me I've heard and analysed the argument of: "oh we just need better government, not less" it doesn't hold water at all. Its absolutely incorrect. Its just not humanly possible, any way you look at it.

       That's just a soundbite to get you into the false paradigm of more government. I call it getting back to free markets and property rights and family. You can still have actually many government programs like social security type, which is supposed to be a guaranteed bank account of your money and when you reach a certain age you are able to get back your money.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a free market system, putting those same amounts of money into real banks will be 10x more beneficial as you would be getting big interest on your parked money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially if you put 50k in your social security account you will only get 50k, if you park it at a bank, you would be getting 100k, 50k more on interest over your lifetime.

       This is just incorrect.  The government spent 3.6 trillion dollars this past year. You just rounded up 10%. And more than $100B was for the wars that are ending. And this ignores the costs that are indirectly caused by the war, like increased military costs. (See
       <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/29/us-usa-war-idUSTRE75S25320110629">
        http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/29/us-usa-war-idUSTRE75S25320110629
       </a>
       . )  So take the total down to $3.5T.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, most of this is social welfare programs, instituted because the Us government decided that the policies that allow economic growth at the expense of some individuals should be compensated by creating a safety net, paid for by the increased growth the policies allowed. The problem is that the taxes have been decreased as economic growth and resulting displacement have increased.

       Most people that use that argument think they contribute a lot more than they actrually contribute, and don't even realize how much they already get back through basic public necessities.

       If this does not apply to you, then move along. Just realize that most people that will pick up your torch on this one are giant moochers with zero understanding of how tax dollars are actually used. A lot of them are people that especially

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's a pretty silly idea. Obviously that wouldn't be a "free market". The US should stop taxing/taking money from people by force and let them spend it where they see fit. If the government gets out of the way and frees up resources, individuals can allocate those resources.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of course not. No one who thinks about the issue for  more than a minute would think this. I mean this is already the case that people create and maintain roads privately (i.e. gated communities and businesses). We don't need to socialize the costs of road upkeep in a community to the entire nation. Honestly, google or youtube search "free market roads", there is ample information. It's not a difficult problem to solve, especially with technology, but even without it.

        My response was implying that a lack of free market spending should not be taken as a sign that it is not valuable or in the public good, and while my examples were hyperbolic, the price paid by the consumer rarely reflects the implicit costs of an object or service, whether it be a net positive or negative one.

       Yes, this is why for example we have an unsustainable situation of suburban sprawl, because the true costs have been socialized.

       Had resources been allocated more efficiently as a result of a functional pricing mechanism, such massive problems would not arise at least to the same degree.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And as a result, researchers over the years have come up with a wide array of returns on investment for NASA spending. Estimated ratios of revenue generated compared to spending have been as high as 14-to-1.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Some early academic and other studies "made very 'generous' assumptions about the spinoffs, goods and services produced as a result of NASA's investments," G. Scott Hubbard, a consulting professor at Stanford University, said in an e-mail. A study commissioned by Hubbard in the mid-2000s when he was director of NASA's Ames Research Center in California on the center's local economic impact found a "more conservative" 2- to 3-to-1 ratio.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to find a precise value for the economic benefits of NASA spending, though, may miss the point as long as it's acknowledged that the spending has at least some positive returns, Hertzfeld argues. He said that
       <strong>
        for a mission-focused organization like NASA, which isn't making a play for profits, any ratio of economic benefits versus spending that exceeds 1-1 "is a success."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow, so this paragraph is fraught with glaringly obvious economic fallacies and does not consider the opportunity cost. It assumes that such contributions would not have arisen without funding NASA, that NASA was the best way to achieve them and that there were no better ways or means to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is of course the logic behind government spending who need to justify their actions (taxation/theft) to their tax livestock.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the money spent on NASA was the best thing to do, it's difficult to say, but I doubt it and more importantly, I don't think its right to force that decision on people. Of course I think this way about all government spending and much less so far NASA, though this is the topic of this thread.

       No dispute from me on this, I was just extending his logic one step farther. IMO if you simply jump to the point of "all tax money is misdirected", then you've gone way outside of his perspective.

       Dude. it is fluoride. it doesn't do anything to you but protect your teeth. I've left the country for periods of time longer than a year and drank fluoride-free water. I didn't become aggressive or something. I think we would notice if we were being sedated. You are an insane conspiracy theorist.

       Probably one of the stupidest posts I have ever seen--even stupider comments. Its this black and white thinking that has gotten our society to this stage. I would not agree that simply cutting foreign aid to Israel would just fix all the problems. Also, I dont see the point of building NASA up again when it space exploration is being privatized. It was clearly needed in the 60s when corporations were not willing to take the risk (it wasnt in the interest) where as now it is in their interest--they are doing it. Google the Google  space asteroid mining (Im sure youve all heard of spacex). The problem isn't funding Israel, Egypt or any other country. Its the fact that bureaucrats have this power in the first place. Its clear that your name "freepalestinekashmir" is not about fixing the US but rather screwing over the "evil zionists".

       Yes, privatized, which means that companies will be doing what is profitable. Not what will best expand the collective knowledge of the human race.

       Its clear your a bit out of touch with what science is all about. Regardless, if you look into who are running these space explorations corporations, you are talking about people who have much passion for science and are not motivated by profits. I recommend you look at the interview of John Steward and Elon Musk, its very inspiring and gives you an idea of what this sector is going to be like. Were not talking about a Steve Jobs running a marketing scheme to make money, were talking about genuine people who love science and are willing to risk money for the research. Once again, you are keeping the argument too black and white. Also, because of the passion that most scientists have, they are easily exploited, its why many of the them get sucked in by wall street, because the govt programs in the major US universities are paying crap. Making it impossible to get a research position. Imagine how many geniuses are working for Goldman Sachs right now--look into it.

       If by majority of people you mean poor, 3rd world countries, then of course not. Most of those countries have no infrastructure to take advantage of the benefits of space. That's not the fault of other countries.

       There are many more, but I think I've made my point. You can search Wikipedia and other websites for more. NASA puts out a magazine every year called Spin-Offs which detail all the products that are either direct implementations of NASA research or draw on NASA funded research to create new privatized products.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how you feel about the topic, the fact remains that NASA needs to do shit in space. They need to do it well. If they don't have the technology to do what they need to do, they fund research to make it so they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have the technology. That research either brings about new products that can be used in the home or social infrastructure,

       it is used indirectly to improve already existing technologies.

       So basically space exploration hasn't helped me. R and D projects used in space have. What has been discovered in space that improves our every day lives? Nothing. All the things you listed are great but we would have discovered them anyway. Wars encourage development of products and new technology as well but you never see anyone supporting wasted money on a war. Fact is NASA was a great organization when the budget could support it but private industry is catching up and the budget can no longer support it. I'm sorry you like space but it isn't doing anything for us.

       Except that it's not. Investing in new technologies and creating new industries is exactly what would boost our economy. But again, you probably don't understand that, considering I've given you plenty of reasons that NASA has been more than worth the investment. It's been one of the most profitable investments the US has ever made, always making us
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       money in tax revenue from its new industries and spin off technologies.

       I do understand that. I personally feel the private sector does it better than a bureaucracy. NASA was a good investment. In the future it might be a good investment. Right now the money NASA gets is fine. It doesn't need more. It especially doesn't need money that keeps the middle east from turning into a shit show.

       In the 60s it was still an off-shoot of the arms race, that's why government was involved.  It restricted private corporations from even having satellites, go look up the levels of restriction and the dates different steps were made generally open to privatization.  Obama has done more to open space to corporations and individuals than anyone before him, the result is going to be a space boom.

       As to using high school kids with talent...  that is not something we talk about here.  MK-ULTRA picked up half a million of the smartest kids of that generation, held them for months, then returned them to their families.  Who knows what all they did and do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know about the Duke talent search?  If you show up as being in the .001% in terms of IQ or an individual gift the Duke talent search scoops you up before you're 12 and then WHAT HAPPENS?  Where do all these most gifted go?  They don't reappear in society...  their families receive a stipend...  but what about the smart kids?

       Most of it is military research and trading.  We give them money and weapons in return for high level R&amp;D for military technology.  It's also our most stable ally in that part of the world.  Whether you agree with us even needing a presence there comes down to your own opinion.

       Here's a read up on what they do with the money and military technology we give them

       I would be impressed with all that military technology and stuff, but the reality is that the US has been fighting a bunch of goat farmers in the hills of Afghanistan for the last 10 years, people who have pistols, AK47s, RPG7s, the occasional 50 Cal anti-aircraft and a smattering of road-side bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite this very basic arsenal, against which the US has 2 of everything that's available to the modern war fighter, they haven't won a decisive victory. I think that's ever-so-slightly embarrassing, especially when you consider that the US spent almost $140 billion dollars on the war in Afghanistan in 2011, the Afghani GDP being in the environs of $36 billion. And that doesn't translate into a victory.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much toys do you actually need? At the prices mentioned above, you could give every Afghani a job, double their pay, give them Afghani-level single payer health care and you'd be cheaper off than what you spend bombing them. I really think you should try that one time.

       Fair point.  I'm more talking about the USSR's involvement over that region and what their influence would have been if we were never involved at all.  The history of that region since the end of WW2 is so complex due to the worlds involvement that it's hard for me to simplify it if we were never involved with Israel in the first place we wouldn't have these enemies.  But if you get into current events, and the fact that no other world power has a whole lot of influence there, then I do agree that our current involvement directly relates to having enemies in the region.

       They do some of the best military research in the world and there's some minor trading of it back to us once they've hit the next step.

       To some neo-cons Israel is on "our side" and the Muslims are "their side" and that mindset has obvious pitfalls, like turning a blind eye to the faults of our friends.  I've literally had people become spitting mad that I was criticizing "our only friend in that sandy hellhole."

      <p>
       The thing though, I'm seeing a country where desperately many things are going wrong and very many millions of people need very much more help from their government than they're getting. It's time to cut some DoD spending and start using that money where it will do some good.

       Band got me to college on a scholarship. Pretty much everyone in my band is on some sort of scholarship. Yet only about a quarter of our 300 piece band is majoring in some sort of music field. 
Supporting the arts doesn't mean the person is going to do that for the rest of their life, it's a good way to pay for college.

       careers pay on average better than most office jobs, and actually making a career in it isn't farfetched any more. There are hundreds of applications for many, many different art disciplines now.

       Besides, the biggest benefit of arts in schools is it breeds creativity. Being able to express yourself, in whatever small way, rather than being dragged through the motions day in day out in education will help a shitload more than it hinders.

       Ok, so there's actually two problems with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) 3 Billion dollars is miniscule. The NIH has $30 billion of funding per year, and NASA's funding is $18 billion. Adding $3 billion to either (unless directed towards a particular goal/project) basically amounts to a blip on the radar.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The money towards Israel gives us something (a stable democracy in the Middle East willing to do our bidding and provide us bases) that's surely worth $3 billion a year. Compared to where else we send our money (ahem, Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc.), that's not bad. To Israel, that money means a lot more than it does to us, who have massive budgets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look for yourself. I honestly can't believe that you'd think that giving money to most of these countries is better than giving money to Israel.

       And a reason for Islamic countries in the Middle East to hate America even more. America needs to end this idealization of "peace-keeping" operations. It has no right nor reason to be in the Middle East, besides the oil to be acquired and a sense of "democracy" or "peace" given to us in exchange for American lives. America shouldn't be funding Israel, nor should it be funding any other Middle Eastern countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The situation in the Middle East benefits Israel, defense contractors, oil companies, and the political elite in the US. It has no benefit whatsoever for the average American citizen.

       The US has allies in the region besides Israel, it usually calls on these Arab allies to get shit done.

      <p>
       The US get's nothing out of it. Jordan, Egypt (Pre-arab spring), Saudi, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE are all countries that maintain healthy relationships with the US. The US also has bases all over these countries. It's these bases they use to flex their muscles.

       Israeli citizens have universal healthcare. Effectively the US subsidises Israeli healthcare without having any of it's own (I know this is worded to sound worse than it is, but you get the point).

       Israel creating stability in the region? Are you kidding me? The west bank and Gaza? Never heard of them? And Why the flying fuck Would you need a thousand bases all over the globe fore? What imaginary threat are you scared of? Or does the us just feel the imperial urges of euroupe 1600? And don't give me the "budget is already to big crap" since when did 3 fucking billions become a small sume? They could do a shitload of stuffs with that money. And about the other countries that you mentioned as a horror example, those are mainly countries that are in a rebuilding state from when the us fucked them up, by giving them this money they are mearly repaying what they fucked up and helps the countries back on foot. Israels main priority seems to be fucking up their neighbouring countries.

       OP clearly hates Isreal, check his username "FreePalestineKashmir", also notice his comment/post history, all anti-Isreali and a redditor for a whole 5 days.

       Why don't we pull money from farm subsidies, or one of the many other corporate welfare programs we're currently running?  There are many, many sources of funds which could be re-allocated to NASA, so what the fuck does NASA have to do with Isreal? It's not like someone said "lets shut down NASA and give the money to Isreal" so I don't even see why this is being discussed, other than the fact that OP is using a popular sentiment on Reddit (NASA getting funding) and twisting that into their anti-Isreali agenda.

       Upvoted for making a good argument. But it's also important to note that the people (I'm assuming) you think they are being 'assholes' to, are not Israeli citizens. Israeli Arabs and Israeli Muslims get the exact same rights and treatment as Israeli Jews or Christians. This is no different from non-citizens in countries all over the world.

       A palestinian needs an israeli passport to travel. Israel does not give many palestinians passports however, so many of them can't travel freely.

       Supporting Palestine does not mean you hate Israel. Israel violates international law by occupying Palestinian territories. It is not outrageous to assume our money can be better spend somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish Israel the best, but it has no right to occupy Palestinian terrorities and US money should not support it.

       Very few of those countries are engaging in the levels of blatant injustice the Israelis are.  Our tax money is literally paying for the solitary confinement of restrained children in Israel.

       You think that if a kid throws a rock at a cop in the US he gets stuck in solitary confinement?  Also, you're not READING the article, all some of these kids did "wrong" was have a parent the Israeli Defense Force was investigating.

       You don't really understand the American criminal justice system do you?  It's actually in violation of national human rights accords to place a CHILD in solitary confinement.  In America you can't even take them into custody, you contact a magistrate who determines the correct course and if it is to hold them you take them to a youth facility.  Stop talking out your goddamn ass and listen to what they're doing.

       So yea, your article follows the predictable pattern of anti-israel hysteria. Link to an article about somebody who has made a living bashing Israel, criticizing them for some minor complaint (arresting children for what would be considered attempted murder in most places and putting them in solitary) and acting as if they're the only country that acts this way, even when the majority of western countries are
       <strong>
        worse
       </strong>
       in that regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty of legitimate things to criticize israel about. But bullshit like this is why most americans ignore the palestinians. Their supporters rely far too much on emotional manipulation and blatant double standards.

       Most Americans ignore the Palestinians for the same reason they ignore the Somali genocides or any other of numerous atrocities: because our information flow is controlled.

       That article is linking to a UN sanction...  not one person's testimony, sorry you perceive a world where anyone who thinks atrocities are wrong are anti-Israel.

       Also, your counter link has absolutely no sources for its statement children in America are placed in solitary confinement AGAINST THEIR WILL barring extreme violence.  Most children in solitary are over 16 and are there per their request for protective custody.  Not even similar situations.

       <strong>
        far
       </strong>
       out of proportion to the actual conflict. Every time an israeli builds an apartment in the occupied territories, it's front page news all over the world. Israel kills a ten terrorists and one civilian in an operation, the HRC holds a meeting to bash israel.

       Ten thousand civilians die in the Congo, or Sri Lanka...and it's buried in the back of the international section.

       The UN has a systematic bias against Israel due to the Muslim bloc having a stranglehold on the organization.

      <p>
       I can find numerous other sources. It's not even a debatable fact. In western countries, children are placed in solitary. Just as it's not remotely debatable that calling the solitary confinement of violent offenders an "atrocity" cheapens the term.
      </p>

       Again, I'm perfectly willing to criticize Israel. But this is just the epitome of stupid, double standard arguments.

       I'm sorry your persecution complex is so complete.  It's really a shame how often this occurs to people who associate themselves with Israel, in terms of ego investment.  If America was systematically bulldozing Mexican homes and moving the border and the Mexicans blew up a few buses (And in America people not in contact with the Jewish communities are exposed to the anti-Israeli violence all the time in the media) I suspect the UN would sanction America just like it keeps trying to do to Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict gets covered front page... there's a significant portion of the US that is made up of ignorant bible thumpers who like to hear how white people control Jerusalem again.  There's also a large group of liberals who believe it is the nexus from which the next world war will begin, this means that there's a lot of the population who pay attention to stories about Israel, not as many care about "that African country" and "those black people."  Sad truths.

       I have no persecution complex. I'm not israeli, ethnically, more non-jewish than jewish, and religiously agnostic. I don't associate myself with Israel in any way. In fact, I criticize Israel on a regular basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't do, is single Israel out for criticism based on something that every other country does. And I don't do it based on the testimony of those who have made a career attacking israel. And I don't do it based upon a body which is structurally biased against Israel. I do it based on what Israel does; not what its bitterest enemies accuse it of doing.

       When I linked you criticisms of the American policy on solitary confinement, which is nowhere near as unjust as what is occuring in Israel, you tried to tell me that was a double standard.  That's not rational, that means you are seeing persecution where there is NONE.  That is called a persecution complex.

       Quote me.  I specified against their will and without extreme violence.  The Palestinian children being placed into solitary frequently WERE NOT violent with the police, it was routine to blindfold and bind them and transport them alone, that by itself is solitary confinement, however short term, and there is no discussion of them being placed into protective custody, rather they are placed into adult jails with adults.  The situations are NOT parallel, only similar.

       First off, most of these allegations you're offering were not specified in your biased link you already posted. More importantly, of course the situations are not exact parallels. Palestinians are not israeli citizens, israeli law is completely different, and palestinians for the most part hold antagonistic attitudes towards israeli institutions.

       Well, as long as it's apartheid it's okay then.  They're not citizens so abuse the living hell out of them and steal their land.  That's some fucked thinking.

       So both articles acknowledge the fact that such practices, even though they oppose them, are common in the west. So this is, in fact, a double standard. Glad we cleared that up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And personally, I agree that non-violent offenders shouldn't be put into solitary. Throwing rocks? A violent offense. Several israelis have been killed or badly wounded by thrown rocks in recent years.

       You're not really understanding the differences here and it's a shame.  America IS getting called out for it too, it's NOT a double standard unless you critisized Israel and then turned a blind eye towards out own nation.  And since it's ME you're talking to obviously I criticize both practices.  Raiding a child's home at night and placing them in solitary before they get a trial is NOT the same as placing a child in solitary for protective custody.

       Falk is one of the few critics of israel who actually can be considered to be an anti-semite, thanks to his posting of anti-semitic cartoons and his endorsement of the anti-semitic book, "the wandering who".
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, if somebody makes a career out of bashing a single state (while defending, amongst others, the ayatollah khomeini) while never responding positively to that state, then it's reasonable to assume that they lack the ability to be objective on that issue. There are plenty of people who at times bash israel but who I still trust to speak about it. Richard Falk has long ago ceased to be included on this list.

       if we cut funding from Isreal, we lose our base in the Middle East.  trying to get america to cut aid to Isreal would ruin our presence in the area.  They're our creation and can do no wrong in our eyes.  I'm not saying I support the funding, but this is a wasted effort, there is no way the gov. is gonna cut funding.

       Probably because the 3 bill in cash and 2 bill in guaranteed loans goes to nation that is financially solvent, used to buy weapons, and promotes hostilities that lead to blow back that is not in America's interest.

       Also Israel is the largest recipient of US foreign aid. It makes them top of the list to be struck out for budgetary reasons

       Not sure where you go those numbers. From what I saw Afghanistan was number one in 2011 (4.10 billion). With Israel second (2.7 billion) and Pakistan third (1.8).
      </p>
      <p>
       Like it or not Israel is a strong friend of America, in a time when we don't have many. I'm all in favor in taking that 1.8 from Pakistan and give it to NASA.

       That's 0.13% of the federal budget for FY2011.  We don't have to choose between these two options.  In fact, the only thing these issues have in common is that they both fall into the "shit college kids care about" category.

       the military-industrial complex is the main place where pure research gets money in the u.s. and if you think that's insane, wait till you hear a libertarian seriously worshiping nasa w/o realizing that it's an arm of the military-industrial complex that failed to produce enough scary cold war space weapons and consequently lost funding.

       what i'm trying to say is that no matter what, the eventual goal of nasa is to create an independence day mothership so to scare people with and all the other research is more like a bonus or diversion or whatever.

       I think it's definitely a good idea to give it to NASA, because it will hopefully create more jobs in America too.

       It's not so much the anti-semite bit, it's the fact that all of our aid is military aid, and much of it is required to be spent on US military goods and services. It's essentially a big funnel of cash to the military-industrial complex. Like most of our foreign aid, it allows the government to take tax dollars and hand it out to the corporations that fund our politicians/parties. So, while you could politely disregard any allegations of anti-semitism, there's almost no way to beat the system.

       Israel has been our military foothold in the middle east for 50 years, they are almost a sovereign state of the USA for the purpose of holding a highly aggressive extremely well armed military presence at the throats of OPEC.

       If you need to know the strategic value of israel, just look at what the U.S. did in response to the U.S.S.R. attempting to set up missile bases in Cuba, which only happened because the U.S. set up missiles in Turkey.

       Isn't aid in the form of a loan?  Doesn't Israel have to pay back that money (unless it is forgiven)?  NASA won't pay back that money.

       I don't see what we get out of sending all that money to isreal. They don't foster stability in the region. If anything their treatment of the palistinian people promotes violence and bigotry. It would be one thing if they let the them into the country and gave them a voice in politics, but they don't and that is about as unamarican as it gets.

       In foreign policy, america is very happy to do lots of business with regimes that rob their own people of democracy and human rights. If U.S business has cheap access to that countries resources.
See 'The school of Americas'.
A training academy By the department of defence that trains mainly latin american officers. Their graduates have gone on to erode human rights and been involved in many massacres.

       I was reading that there are some peaks in the Andes that are best of all.  We're almost there with super tensile solids (carbon!)and the powering of the vehicle is hitting some major breakthroughs.  The Andes are near the equator, there are places you could take loads from Atlantic AND Pacific without too much additional work, and it's sparsely populated so if something goes wrong less people will be in the danger area.

       I thought about that at one point.  Instead of the gov't deciding 100% of the budget, they decided on basic 'minimums' then part of our vote would be voting for where to place the rest (so you could vote to have 50% of that remainder going to NASA, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is, I looked at the U.S. spending,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2011.png">
        pie chart
       </a>
       , and Mandatory Spending makes up
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget#Major_expenditure_categories">
        over 50%
       </a>
       of the spending, and reducing the military to non-war levels (only my thoughts on this) would still take up a good deal of that pie chart to keep us 'safe'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The remainder, in my mind, is so small that I'm not sure whether giving citizens a vote on what's more important would change much at all.

       The way you described it is how the Fed's budget already works. Congressmen are elected by constituents and they figure out the budget. What I'm talking about is drastically cutting spending from the budget, which reduces the need to tax people, which then allows people to keep more of the fruits of their labor. Letting individuals decide how to best spend their money means it doesn't go to the government at all, it means they are free to voluntarily give it to whom they see fit through the purchase of goods/services, donations, investments, etc.

       There is a point to be made here; there are a lot of places we could cut spending so that we could fully fund NASA. I have heard that we spend more than a few dollars paying for the defense of Europe many believe they should be paying for their own defense. I am very frustrated with the lack of funding for our public school system and NASA; I am at the point where I think perhaps we should stop giving out any foreign aid at all. It’s seems all it buys us is terrorist attacks and comments about American imperialism.

       Imagine all the good that could be done with this money by NASA, or by the school systems of the southern states, or to upgrade a few power generating plants. Almost anything it was spent on would be better than giving it to Israel, to be used to kill innocent human beings.

       A world population of 9 billion people is projected in the next couple of generations - we either practice eugenics and breeding programs (heil Hitler) or seek out new resources, which sadly only exist in infinite abundance in space.

       There are at least two Israeli spies in US prisons for espionage. Israel sank the USS Liberty (a naval vessel) in 1967. Currently the country is trying to buy the US election through its proxy, Sheldon Adelson. Now tell my why we're giving Israel any aid at all. By their own admission, they've got over 250 nukes and a booming economy. Let them stand on their own.

       I wouldn't say we need to cut the 3 billion to Israel (although i think it is absured we give them an unlimited amount of money so they can sustain their "military advantage" over their neighbors) I think we should be out of Afghanistan before we worry about Israel. The money wasted on Afghanistan is ridiculous.

       I would rather give 3 billion to Elon Musk. IMHO the whole shuttle program was a designed by congress pork barrel program. The 1986 Challenger failure for example, would never have happened if they didn't insist on building the rocket booster in sections from some congressman's home state, which meant they required double o-rings. No I don't have sympathy for those working at NASA either, because they were playing a bureaucratic game just trying to hang on to the money.

       Giving money to SpaceX wouldn't help. SpaceX is a business, it looks for profit, and space exploration does not give that much profit. You need government funded agencies to do the research first, then try it, and then give it to the private sector. That's what happens everytime. Space exploration is very, very risky, and there's a very low chance that it would give profit very soon.

       I disagree. A long time ago I thought "Hey that asshole from paypal is trying to go into space?" But I've come to learn that Elon Musk is a very dedicated and forward thinking person. His businesses aren't about profit as so much moving the world forward. I suggest you do some googling and check out some youtube videos. No one else sinks their entire fortune into space, solar, and electric cars, while at the same time telling VC's "we're doing this to go to space, you may never see a profit".
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time we move forward is when we find dedicated and competent leaders. Otherwise it's just a giant money sink. I find nearly everything about the shuttle program stupid, whereas SpaceX is doing everything right.

       Yes, Elon Musk is a space fan. But, what I meant was that private companies will never lead the space frontier. It was always the governments which start the trade, always map the roads and so on. Columbus didn't go to 'the edge of the Earth' because he was an explorer, he was given the money by the governments, and was told to put their flag if he finds any land. Later he mapped where peaceful natives were, where dangerous ones were, and so on. THEN he gave the information to the private trade so the people could profit. I'm just looking at the history, because it was always the government funding which leads everything, and later it's given to the private sector.

       Well no this is wrong again. A great deal of science (probably could be stated as most of science except for the past few decades) has been done in the past basically by rich people who could afford to fund themselves and had the time to do so, or worked for a private education institutions. Isaac Newton for example? Pretty much all the classical scholars, even ancient greek.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying NASA couldn't do good things. What I'm saying is they have no clear goals and no leadership to provide it. In case this post is viewed as private vs public, this is certainly not the case. I've worked at private institutions with the same problems as NASA. No leadership, no vision, a bunch of bozo's entrenched in their jobs who somehow never seem to do anything or get fired for it. You have to understand I was 6 when Challenger blew up. I followed that story intensely, that was my lesson in "what not to do" as an engineer. My dreams were crushed by the weight of the political and organizational problems at NASA. At 6 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       The leadership is at SpaceX so there the funding should go. This is clearly a better choice. 3 billion dollars would buy NASA 2 shuttle launches! Watch my circular logic here - that program was designed the
       <em>
        spend
       </em>
       money in US, not to go to space. The biggest pork barrel boondoggle ever conceived by humanity. Besides the Big Dig, at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually I've been thinking seriously of sending my resume in to SpaceX. Do something useful with my life...

1. Stop all funding for foreign military aid everywhere. Now.
2. Cut "defense" spending 10% every year for the next 10 years

       rather than risk angering people by having to vote about cutting off funding (though..we don't have to even vote to let the tax cuts expire and that's a huge fight anyway....) i assume that foreign aid already has to be renewed..if not..we really need to see why a country can get money forever and our transportation system can't...we should tie all foreign aid to some kind of emergency trigger. like if tax revenue drops the foreign aid will be in the first layer of 'crumple zones' to absorb the impact. well maybe not immediately since there's probably some contract between us...but maybe it can be auto flagged for not renewing it and since it's based on a financial statistic it's not like we're purposefully being mean to any specific country.. the world is probably used to us having a lot of strange rules that keep popping up :)

       This, while being a great idea, will never happen. This country's politics have become more polarized then ever before with the extreme elements of each party leading the political conversation. The extreme bible thumping christian right totally and unequivocally believes for Christ to be resurected the ancient temple of Solomon must be rebuilt. Therefore there must be strong Jewish presence in jeruselm to eventually force out the muslim population, tear down the dome of the rock and rebuild the temple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason for this to never happen is the concerted effort by pro Israel groups over the last 30 years to become more and more  influential in Washington D.C. politics (which they have done with insanely large politcal contributions).

       Still a great idea though...

       What's one got to do with another?
You are making two entirely separate arguments:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         NASA, which has a budget of 18$ billion should receive a larger annual budget.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Israel, which receives 3$ billion a year, should not receive any money at all.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Why the two are related for any reason other than the fact that they are both reddit-popular opinions is beyond me. Let's debate our policies one at a time. Putting NASA in this post to get some reddit love is plain demagoguery.

       Why would you do that? NASA's current budget is less than 1% of the entire national budget (much less iirc). 3 billion is nothing compared to the amount of money we spend on defense, how about taking some of THAT money and giving it to NASA.

       Absolutely, Israel has developed this symbiotic relationship with the United States - unfortunately the relationship of a parasite to its host.

       Actually Israel is the only country we don't fight wars with in the middle east. Not to mention our best ally, the only democracy, and the only one without a shitty economy in there. And if by mosel you mean Muslim Terrorists. Terrorists coming from the middle east destroyed the world trade centers

       its ok to attack my intelligent.. but educate my please because the only one who are willing to talk about this intellectually are the one do not belive your view.

      <p>
       this explains a lot about your world view.. this is import.. If alqaeda did atttack.. do you know of any proofs.. how did they get the bombs in the buildings... very safe and  secure buildings.. can you help me to see your world view?

       They didn't use bombs the flew planes into them. And there were only 2 world trade center buildings. They also flew a third plane into the pentagon which is a totally separate building. The proof of it is tons of videos and eye witness accounts of seeing planes flying into the buildings. There were no bombs involved. What country do you live in that they don't teach you this? I'd be happy to fill you in with any details about the attacks you don't know.

       with basic services equally. The economy is messed up and the worst thing about it is that they are pulling the whole world with them into the same fucking negative circle. But then again, in a dictatorship, they take of the rich first.

       There are certain things in America that just can't be questioned: Israel, the NRA and the War on Drugs, just to name a few.  Attempting to go against the establishment on any of these three issues will have your financial legs pulled out from underneath you faster than you can grab on to the corner of the closest table.

       That doesn't say banks have $32 trillion tucked away. It says the combined worth of offshore holdings (much of which is 100% legally held), belonging to all parties (including non-banks), is $32 trillion.

       Given that our aid to the palestinian authority has been proven to have gone to both the swiss bank accounts of the palestinian leadership as well as terrorists who used it to target innocent people, I don't think we should end military aid to israel until we end all aid to the palestinians.

       Apart from your obvious agenda against Israel.. In today's dollars the budget for NASA was about $30B/year during the peak Apollo years and the estimated cost of getting us to the moon was about $130B.
      </p>
      <p>
       While $3B is nothing to sneeze out, it is definitely not a solution to the problem of funding NASA and its a drop in the bucket if you are worried about things like the deficit.

       Split it down the middle. $1.5 billion for each. Israel is one of a few if not the only ally we have in the middle east.

       Look into the soft loans we give Israel, and then we forgive the debt. The $3B could be called a red herring, to get people to focus on distractions like how much "comes back," versus how much comes back in the form of bribes, intimidation, and espionage.

       The reason why I posted that is because it's the same argument I have, but worded much better then I can (also, NDT has allot more "Street Cred" then I do. If I were to say that NASA's budget was a half penny on the dollar, you probably wouldn't believe me. So I let NDT make that argument for me.

       So I am coming up with my own arguments. Just that me and NDT agree fully about the issue and I'm not as good of a public

       I know that NASA wouldn't take a lot of money to fund, and as such I don't really care much either way whether it gets funded or not. I'm just clueless as to why it's treated like it's so important relative to other government programs that save lives. Plus, I'm pretty sure a big portion of NASA's budget is connected to the military-industrial complex anyhow, so NASA should not only be funded if it is to be funded, but also restructured.

       Did you not watch the video? I'm being serious here. He explains a few reasons why you should save it.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Doing missions out of low earth orbit will lay the framework for more money and services (thereby helping our economy).
      </p>
      <p>
       2) If we repopulate at least 1 other planet, no planet-wide problem will be able to remove the human race from existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) NASA does what kids dream of doing. Without it, you lose kids interest and the ability to look forward to tomorrow. Doing so will have a cascading effect in where we lose all interest in advancing science (or at least the space sciences).

       No thats stupid. If we cut funding to Israel then 40 years of American policy in the Middle East goes to shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big picture of military spending on Israel has tremendously stabilized that region. Israel had been in three big regional wars in 20 years from 1948-1967. US started backing Israel around Lyndon Johnson's presidency. Egypt and Saudi Arabia realized that with a great power backing the tiny state, any action by them united or otherwise would be useless. Ever since we started overtly backing Israel, there has been one large war involving Israel. That was in 1972, however their foes were backed by the Soviets in that conflict- the only time the Soviets intervened militarily in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the years have gone by, those nations, the former overt enemies if Israel, have cooled their prejudices, its populace becoming more tolerant of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, i have not mentioned the Taliban, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq or Afghanistan. The resurgence of Islamic extremism in those states has really thrown a bone into the grinder. But that is a product of religious fervence. The Egyptians and Sauds have come to grips with the political reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though, we in the United States are confident that strategy of, in the short run, wasteful allocation of resources(your words) through military backing of Israel will eventually cool the tensions of the current enemies(extremists) over several decades, as that policy was 100% effective with Israel's former most prominent enemy (Egypt).
      </p>
      <p>
       So in the long run the US has stabilized the Middle East, but in the headlines we're always the warmongering dick.

       Sorry for the dick fingers(I love parentheses)

       So who will fund us when we stop getting loans to send to Israel? Who will stabilize OUR region? Sorry, but there is no way you are going to convince me that as deep in debt as we are, we should be giving out such large amounts of money on a regular basis.

       Why do we went to dominate and kill people over there?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fair enough question.
      </p>
      <p>
       To ask that question you have to ask why we are there in the first place. There's an easy answer. I'll tell you, but in return I want you to read the rest of my answer. We are there for the petroleum, oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oil is what made the United States the wealthiest nation on Earth. It's why we have a high standard of living. Oil makes our plastics, medicines, cars, tires, you name it. Hell there's some hydrocarbons compounds in our money. Because of it, energy is cheap and plentiful thus we can only produce as much as our imagination limits. But I'm not getting into. If you want to know how valuable oil is to the US, become an economics major. If you want to know why oil is such a wonderful compound, become a biochemist. But I'm not getting into that because that would take freaking days. I'm giving you the sociopolitical benefit that the Middle East has gotten from exploitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       We choose to stabilize the region so the oil companies fields, refineries, and shipping routes will be safe, thus they will invest further. Oil, oil, oil, oil, oil. Say it a hundred times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assumed you already knew that.

       Israel should be declared a pariah state and taken apart,most of the inhabitants are Khazars who converted to Judaism and therefore have no relationship to the middle east,the best solution was Stalins and that was to sequester them to

       It's not like the US writes a cheque for that full amount, or delivers it all in cash. A lot of the money is given in military and civilian hardware. Things like fighter jets. medical equipment and so on. That benefits the American economy because it helps to keep those industries in operation. The alternative is that Israel would buy these things from other nations, or manufacture them themselves.

       The larger issue is that the defunding of NASA has been intentional, as is the shift towards the privatization and militarization of space exploration. Some theorists believe this ties in with the "elite's" plans for a breakaway civilization. We civilians, the "profane", aren't welcome in this new frontier.

       That's a valid point. If civilians are allowed participation, you can be sure they would not be allowed equal status. We're viewed as a resource (like here on earth!). I guess the main point I was making is that the "elite" don't want a transparent, public space program. They're not anti-science, they just want to be the ones controlling it.

       "the rich" are as varied in their objectives as the countries of the earth.  If a few arab princes want to take some surfs up into space let them.  If some brilliant Gates type wants to setup a fund to send people one by one (like a Macarther grant!) to their moonbase based on intellect and ability then let them.  Who are we to judge what is right or wrong, let natural selection decide but don't leave the full responsibility in the hands of the GOVERNMENTS of all fucking things.

       What if all North American redditors supported another space program instead of NASA? Maybe reddit should look to places other than their own government program. I mean, if they dont care, why keep beating their dead horse? Why not expel our energy/money to a private company or another country with a space program? Maybe someone would take notice.

       It's not really giving Israel 3 billion. Almost all of that money comes in the form of defense spending credits that has to be spent on US military equipment. So it actually goes to the US.

       Putting 3 billion "in the economy" is like throwing a drop of water into a rainstorm. It disappears and it's effect is non-existent. OR you could give it to NASA and they can turn it into something tangible, giving us amazing insight into the Universe.

       I just don't see the productivity of learning more about space I highly doubt that NASA will increase the money tenfold like people before have said. There's just more uses for a few billion dollars although if America would stop being everyone's hero and running to fork out money after every natural disaster like Hati for example then the economy would be a lot better but we can't change past problems we can only hope to improve the future for our kids because if we don't then in about 100 years there will be a dominating country like china or Russia that owns everything.

       we give them money because after world war II we were basically like, here you go jews here is jerusalem and land to make your own country. We give them money because everyone around there HATES them. We give them money because if we didn't they would be fucked. We give them money because the oil in the region is 100% essential to our economy. We give them money because it is a secured foothold in the middle east if shit were to really hit the fan.

       those reasons are all the ones people give but also ignore cause and effect.  the locals hate us for propping up the injustices and blatant racism of Israel, those locals all have the oil.  The only way Israel being in the area with the oil comes into play outside of the hate it's creating is if Israel is going to invade and control the oil fields.  Surely that's not what you're suggesting?
      </p>
      <p>
       "secure foothold"  If you say so.  they muck around in our politics, are one of the least just societies on earth, alienate the neighbors, and place children in solitary confinement if they happen to be of the wrong race in the wrong place.  This is not an ally.

       oh, it's completely our fault. I'm not saying its a good thing, but we did what we did by setting up Israel and it's ours to help protect. unfortunately they are our only ally in an area that is ridden with american hate and we arn't about to just step back and say goodluck to them. In reality Israel is a big military base were we can tell them to go fuck with Palestine without our government being officially tied to it

       Amazing technology has come out of the defense research partnership between USA and Israel, including the Arrow/Iron Dome system capable of protecting cities and bases from rocket/artillery fire.  The technological innovations coupled with the fact that Israel must spend that $ with American companies, has most certainly benefited both nations greatly.  Not to mention, America's continued support for Israel provides the US with a stable and democratic ally with an almost unmatched military, in the heart of the turbulent and strategically important Middle East.

       Israel has transferred a large amount of advanced military technology to China. Furthermore, Israeli arms companies use US developed technology to take market share from US arms makers in the global arms market.

       You're right. 10 times that amount is. There is the official handout, then every single fucking year, there are guaranteed "loans" - that when come due, subsequent administrations quietly "forgive" the loan - they have never paid a single loan back.

       Most of it is Foreign Military Financing and goes to U.S. defence contractors like Lockheed Martin. Since WWII the United States has provided Israel with $115 billion in bilateral assistance. Much of this money is given as a form of kickback-scheme. Israel and the defence contractors profit at expense of the average taxpayer.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it is a logical consequence that many neocons operate as lobbyists for both defence contractors and Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a Congressional Report from 2012 about U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel
       <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf">
        http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is an excellent inteview. Richard Cummings highlights how lobbyists and profiteers of defence contractors played a vital role in the lead up to the Iraq War.

       That's a valid point. If civilians are allowed participation, you can be sure they would not be allowed equal status. We're viewed as a resource (like here on earth!). I guess the main point I was making is that the "elite" don't want a transparent, public space program. They're not anti-science, they just want to be the ones controlling it.

       I thought about that at one point.  Instead of the gov't deciding 100% of the budget, they decided on basic 'minimums' then part of our vote would be voting for where to place the rest (so you could vote to have 50% of that remainder going to NASA, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is, I looked at the U.S. spending,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2011.png">
        pie chart
       </a>
       , and Mandatory Spending makes up
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget#Major_expenditure_categories">
        over 50%
       </a>
       of the spending, and reducing the military to non-war levels (only my thoughts on this) would still take up a good deal of that pie chart to keep us 'safe'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The remainder, in my mind, is so small that I'm not sure whether giving citizens a vote on what's more important would change much at all.

       Haha, Israel can afford its own defense.  And perhaps paying for it themselves would make them think more before acting provocatively and belligerently.  They do so knowing they have a big brother who will have to come save them.

       Very few of those countries are engaging in the levels of blatant injustice the Israelis are.  Our tax money is literally paying for the solitary confinement of restrained children in Israel.

       Are you kidding me? Please research your facts before you insinuate the US would cause the next holocaust by stoping our money to Israel. While it is true that the US gives the most money to the Jewish state, private individuals have been sending money to Israel for DECADES and it is in the millions if not billions of dollars. (It does not have to be public knowledge as it is thought of as a religious donation). Also Israel has the most nukes of any country in the region, a hawkish government who is not afraid to use its military and a militeristic element of the population who believes that land was actually promised a thousand years ago but some man in the sky that must be reclaimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also The Iranians talk a big game they would never attack Israel because they know Israel alone could wipe them out.

       the ideas have been there for millenniums, but the founders which succeeded in creating the state are much more recent figures (hertzl's followers).  all im saying is suggesting that jews were "forcing" jews into israel is simply not true.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Posit (fallacious)
        </strong>
        : These anti-drunk driving ad campaigns are not going to work. People are still going to drink and drive no matter what.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Rebuttal
        </strong>
        : Complete eradication of drunk driving is not the expected outcome. The goal is reduction.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The problem is that anti-drug commercials and programs as they are currently implemented fail spectacularly, and if they do reduce drug use/misuse, it's not significant enough to matter.

       That's easy, I have 100,000 barrels of oil produced in a day. Say you make profits of $1 a barrel.  Spread those profits out over 32,000 people and they get about $3.  Spread out over 350 million and everyone gets less than a penny.
      </p>
      <p>
       These numbers of course are arbitrary and there are areas of the US that would do very well if this was to happen, but it's a lot easier to take care of 30 thousand people when times are tough than 350 million with very diverse attitudes about things.

       They WERE funded by us directly - a brutal dictatorship that they overthrew, and took the weapons from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, of course, Iran is funded by the US insistence on massive-scale use of fossil fuels, as well as intense opposition from the very people wo see them as a threat. The opposition to taxing carbon, or at least paying for the wars we are fighting to keep prices stable, also is a factor.

       I just don't see the productivity of learning more about space I highly doubt that NASA will increase the money tenfold like people before have said. There's just more uses for a few billion dollars although if America would stop being everyone's hero and running to fork out money after every natural disaster like Hati for example then the economy would be a lot better but we can't change past problems we can only hope to improve the future for our kids because if we don't then in about 100 years there will be a dominating country like china or Russia that owns everything.

       Honestly, I think Israel State may be the US's only "second gun" because they are pumping so much money into them.  It may not turn into some sort of act of war, but it certainly wouldn't have a response like, "I guess you need your money somewhere else, no problem."
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there is an issue over the bought land (however, some may criticize the tactics used to purchase it), but I think the bigger issue was that land was lost over war, as an aggressive expansion to fully reclaim some land to make a few Zionists happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the reason a lot of people don't like Israel (at least in these post world war times) is because everyone sort of sees them as the weaker brother to the US when it's very clear that they can hold their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what do they need these extra billion dollars?  It's not like the state is particularly hurting financially (at least not any worse than the US).

       That's absolutely true, but the issue is regional stability. Israel has a lot more leeway than Egypt. Imagine if Egypt had started supplying the Libyan government with arms, or Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Egypt had its own problems to deal with so that wouldn't happen anyway, but if Mubarak had maintained his grip on power it would be in a position to meddle in other states.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also a reflection of internal stability. If Egypt had a stronger economy like Israel the relative importance of foreign aid would not be so high.

       Listen, I can't stop you from mentioning Kim Kardashian or anything else, but muddying up discussions about admittedly small cuts in foreign aid with discussions about Climate Change do neither of those topics justice.  Turns into one big mess of incoherent yelling.

       Well no this is wrong again. A great deal of science (probably could be stated as most of science except for the past few decades) has been done in the past basically by rich people who could afford to fund themselves and had the time to do so, or worked for a private education institutions. Isaac Newton for example? Pretty much all the classical scholars, even ancient greek.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying NASA couldn't do good things. What I'm saying is they have no clear goals and no leadership to provide it. In case this post is viewed as private vs public, this is certainly not the case. I've worked at private institutions with the same problems as NASA. No leadership, no vision, a bunch of bozo's entrenched in their jobs who somehow never seem to do anything or get fired for it. You have to understand I was 6 when Challenger blew up. I followed that story intensely, that was my lesson in "what not to do" as an engineer. My dreams were crushed by the weight of the political and organizational problems at NASA. At 6 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       The leadership is at SpaceX so there the funding should go. This is clearly a better choice. 3 billion dollars would buy NASA 2 shuttle launches! Watch my circular logic here - that program was designed the
       <em>
        spend
       </em>
       money in US, not to go to space. The biggest pork barrel boondoggle ever conceived by humanity. Besides the Big Dig, at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually I've been thinking seriously of sending my resume in to SpaceX. Do something useful with my life...

       What Israel has done, and continues to do to the Palestinians is on the level of Apartheid in South Africa.  And the Palestinians being Muslims, all the nations in that region hate Israel, and because of our close ties to Israel, they hate us as well.  Any time Israel does something to instigate their neighbors, we are typically the ones that are indirectly blamed for their actions.

       The fact that it would be political suicide to pull funding isn't a good excuse to not do it. It just shows how broke the system is. We are going to have to tear it down and rebuild a system governed by direct democracy, not representational. These "representatives" do not, and cannot adequately represent the will of the majority.

       Its not gonna happen, and quite frankly the idea that you "need" a revolution to get things done is utter BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a political revolution in this country some ~30 years ago when the NeoCon movement swept the national stage and since then we've been living under their policies and we feel those repercussions all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The notion that "the system is rigged" is both tiring and smells of defeat.  Apathy is the establishment's biggest ally because it makes people think that "both parties are the same" or "its not gonna matter".  I buy into that thinking, I'm sorry.

      <p>
       Won the rest in a war of aggression. Fought after a world war against aggressor regimes also looking to expand their territory. A war in which the same people now doing the expanding were horribly abused.
The aftermath of WWII was an agreement by the world that (open) wars for the purposes of territorial expansion could no longer be tolerated. Yes, this idealism didn't extend everywhere or manage to hold up 100% of the time but one would have expected the people who as a group got their shit kicked in the hardest be the last ones rolling fucking tanks into their own Rhineland.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for equating it to the conquering of Texas etc. anyone who's read that history knows the young United States acted pretty horrendously. There were glorious even honorable
       <em>
        moments
       </em>
       as there are with most wars but, on the whole? Fuck those guys. It's "ok" now because nationalistic whitewashing of history happened along a long enough time frame that the details have been "forgotten". Welcome to the 21st century, that kind of shit doesn't (shouldn't) fly anymore.

      <p>
       It sure was. An entire indigenous population was almost exterminated. Some Mexicans died too (I kid). But you know what? Those events happened during colonial, post-colonial and imperial phases of western history. That's not an excuse for conduct, that's historical context. Context is important. Again, the young state of Israel didn't get a free pass to employ historically shameful expansionist practices because "you did it first". A new state is expected by the global community to come into the world cognizant of the era it finds itself in and conduct itself accordingly. I don't get to own slaves if I can subdue some just because my great-great-great grandfather owned slaves.

      <p>
       Are you fucking kidding me? Crowd into the territories? As if the land was already carved up just like that before Israel the new state existed? As if they weren't peacefully spread out before the state existed?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why should the surrounding nations have accepted a nation of refugees created overnight by expansionist military aggression? Because they're Arabs? They should have just ignored the socio-political and economic situation within their own states? Just bankrupted themselves absorbing sudden unplanned immigration because their new neighbor decided to unilaterally expand its borders? Come the fuck on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reread what you just wrote because what you basically said was, "if they didn't like it they should have just left and other countries should have taken them in".
If I were to say "if Jews in Nazi territory didn't like the segregation and discrimination they should have just left (during the period they were free to do so obviously) and other countries with Jews should have taken them in. I mean no one
       <em>
        asked them
       </em>
       to stay in the land they identified with home" people would lose their goddamn minds.

      </p>
      <p>
       There are many more, but I think I've made my point. You can search Wikipedia and other websites for more. NASA puts out a magazine every year called Spin-Offs which detail all the products that are either direct implementations of NASA research or draw on NASA funded research to create new privatized products.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how you feel about the topic, the fact remains that NASA needs to do shit in space. They need to do it well. If they don't have the technology to do what they need to do, they fund research to make it so they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have the technology. That research either brings about new products that can be used in the home or social infrastructure,
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       it is used indirectly to improve already existing technologies.

      </p>
      <p>
       Fair enough question.
      </p>
      <p>
       To ask that question you have to ask why we are there in the first place. There's an easy answer. I'll tell you, but in return I want you to read the rest of my answer. We are there for the petroleum, oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oil is what made the United States the wealthiest nation on Earth. It's why we have a high standard of living. Oil makes our plastics, medicines, cars, tires, you name it. Hell there's some hydrocarbons compounds in our money. Because of it, energy is cheap and plentiful thus we can only produce as much as our imagination limits. But I'm not getting into. If you want to know how valuable oil is to the US, become an economics major. If you want to know why oil is such a wonderful compound, become a biochemist. But I'm not getting into that because that would take freaking days. I'm giving you the sociopolitical benefit that the Middle East has gotten from exploitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       We choose to stabilize the region so the oil companies fields, refineries, and shipping routes will be safe, thus they will invest further. Oil, oil, oil, oil, oil. Say it a hundred times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assumed you already knew that.
