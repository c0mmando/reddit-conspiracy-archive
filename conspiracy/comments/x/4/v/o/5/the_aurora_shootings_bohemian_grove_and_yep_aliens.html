       So this, like much of the theories on here is pretty outlandish, but try and stay with me...
       <br/>
       Last night while browsing through threads on James Holmes, I noticed someone made a comment saying they noticed the shooting took place same day that the infamous "Cremation Of Care" ceremony at Bohemian Grove kicks off, and that maybe these shootings were apart of some "ritual sacrifice".
       <br/>
       I found this to be a very interesting insight. I immediately wanted to see if their were any other correlations between the cremation of care ceremonies and mass killings, such as this one, and oh boy...
       <br/>
       Bohemian Grove was started in 1872, 140 years ago exactly. I want people to do some independent research here (simple googling) as I am on my phone and want to get all of this out before I forget. I'll update with links later. Look up news events
       <em>
        every twenty years
       </em>
       from 2012 on, during the same weekends as the cremation of care ceremonies. So July of 1992, 1972, and finally July of 1952. You'll discover that there were suspicious killings in both 1992 and 1972.   Even creepier, once you get to 1952 you'll see this is when there were MASS UFO sightings over DC. Now the crackpot theory is that since the "visit" we have provided a sort of ritual sacrifice every 20 years to appease these visitors. But again I would love for people to do more research on this and report your findings. The more I searched for information, the more unsettled I became.
       <br/>
       Also as of this morning, the comment I originally saw showing the correlation is no longer there.

       EDIT: Ok folks, back at the ole computer.

       Young people seem to be targeted for some reason, I couldn't get any ages for the people that were abducted in Peru, but it was at a university and I can only guess they were in their 20's.

       To be fair, a lot of pretty horrendous stuff happened in Ireland in those years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason this one stuck out at me is because a man by the name of Michael Norman was found shot dead in his car with photos of the incidents in 2005. The article about his death seems to be scrubbed from Wikipedia?

       I'd just like to explain while I think this is absurdly improbable, that I am open to listen if anyone can find anything more than a few loose connections.  I'd say that you would need to find some sort of mass sacrificial event on all-or a lot more than over half-of the dates that the ceremony has taken place, with some sort of similiarity in all of them (not just finding a list of murders that happened on those days in some random place in the phillipines.  these things happen everywhere all the time).  Otherwise, I think it is fairly safe to say that this is easily coincidental (not even suspiciously coincidental)

       When one looks for a particular pattern (in effect creating a pattern) rather than observing a pattern. This usually happens when there is a plethora of general events that occur, but only a few are picked out to support the conclusions of the premise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/08/world/la-fg-nigeria-violence9-2010mar09">
        2010 - Nigerian Massacre
       </a>
       <br/>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy's_massacre">
        2000 - Wendy's Massacre
       </a>
       <br/>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_massacre_of_Sri_Lankan_Police_officers">
        1990 - Sri Lankan Police Officer Massacre
       </a>
       <br/>
       <a href="http://ufos.about.com/od/ufocrashes/p/rendlesham.htm">
        1980 - UFO Landings at Rendlesham Forest
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can clearly tell from this chain of events that every ten years since 1980, we've been sacrificing people to the alien gods that invented the Illuminati and caused the financial crash of 2008. /s
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean to be overly sardonic, but my point should be clear. If I'm only looking for specific information to confirm my line of thinking, I can usually find it, but only when I use information that is so conveniently broad I can find almost anything to support my premise. This is the type of thinking that makes me so critical of conspiracy theories. If I'm going to support a conspiracy theory, I need evidence that is at least somewhat reliable--not poorly linked (if at all) events to support a preconceived notion or bias.

       You are absolutely correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       However what you are seeing in this thread is the process of organizing facts to see if a hypothesis is true. You have to understand that if this was even remotely true it wouldn't be on frontpage CNN, so digging through what may look like garbage on the internet to attempt to see a pattern is sometimes necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I digress, I'm not saying anything here is true without question obviously, but it definitely warrants further study.

       Fair enough, I can understand collating data and referencing it with the community. At the same time however, any data submitted should be thoroughly checked and cross-referenced by the OP before it gets submitted. Yes it would be rather tedious, but it would add credibility to whatever is posted and encourages a more scientific approach to whatever one is studying.

       It might help to look at this page as a dynamic document in which ideas and theories are thrown out so as other people may add, correct, cross-reference in there own research.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am all for using scientific approach in verifying everything being claimed, but because of the nature of the subject a lot of guesswork is necessary which may not always seems scientific, but should never be relied upon when you try to prove it as fact.

       Its more interesting to me when the deaths are of the same flavor.  I've noticed that there is a huge pattern of events from April 19th to May 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have my writings in front of me but basically some of the days are death by fire and some are specifically captives being killed (prisons, stadiums).  For example; the Waco massacre and other events fit into this.  One of the patterns in this time are people being confined or moved into a place where they are controlled and then on the day they are all killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also "Earth Day" fits into this period and I discovered that "Earth Day" is not about saving the Earth but about actually sacrificing part of the Earth by defiling the land.  The event that caught by attention was the Deep Water oil rig incident but looking further back there were many nuclear bombs detonated and things of this sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then May 1st seems to represent a wish of things to come so to speak so Hitler is announced dead, Osama bin Ladin is announced dead, etc.  There is a lot to this thirteen day period.  After the Deep Water accident and the Pakistani Times Square "bomber" was foiled on May 1st I said to myself "lets just fucking see what happens next year between April 19th and May 1st" and sure enough the incarnation of evil Osama bin Ladin was "killed" on that day and Pakistan was again blamed.  May 1st is the make a wish day to set the tone for the year.

       You certainly seem to have some research under your belt concerning world affairs. However, you're really not giving me anything solid to go on. Can you go into detail concerning one of these "pattern" instances?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go back and look at hundreds of murders that happened historically between the 25th of December and January 1st. That doesn't mean I can claim that Christmas promotes murder or make any other conclusions from that fact. The problem I have with these ideas of "patterns" is that there have been millions if not billions of events in the course of human history of varying significance. Just because certain events (invariably) overlap on certain seasons, months, days, time frames, circumstances, etc. does not necessary indicate that they are connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'd need to see some of your personal data in detail before I can draw any conclusions about the specific instances you are referencing.

       The issue that I have from observing modern day events is that May 1st doesn't seem to be a day of sacrifice.  It seems to be a day to announce something.  Sometimes that can be a death but it seems to me that the day is more generally a new social or political theme.

       I wouldn't say very skeptical with all types of subject.  Something like 9/11 for example has enough evidence and results to show that something definately is up; more so than speculation.  I completely stand behind wanting to research it; but there must be a point where you have to concede, that it is mere coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had said that over the last 70 years that every ceremony date, or let's say 40, or maybe every ten years, there were similiar events that happened that were suspicious...then yeah I'm listening and almost convinced there could be something up.  Three small massacres on the ceremony date, over the last 70 years, and one completely different event on that date...to me is no more than a slightly interesting coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main skepticsim in many conspiracy theories stems from linking of dates/events like this.  It can be done with anything.  Literally any date can have coincidences such as this.  For instance; my birthday April 15th.  Jesus is reborn (if the bible is to be believed. i was born on easter sunday), Da vinci is born, The titanic sinks, lincoln dies, hillsborough disaster, greatest flood in us history. Due to the 7 degrees of seperation, you could find a link, however weak, to all of these.   By all means, carry on investigating...and if you find something interestingly substantial I'm right behind you.  But just keep in mind, somewhere in your head that there's a high possibility that it is a minor coincidence.

       I am of the same school of thought on the linking of dates and events.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would usually dismiss something like this just how you mentioned, but too many things from the Aurora didn't add up and the OPs hypothesis intrigued me. I found a small pattern of deaths of young people (young people are often attributed to dark rituals linked to the Bohemian Grove).
      </p>
      <p>
       I admit these are all just small coincidences, but I think its worth looking into rather than not.

       I hear your larger point, but I would certainly dispute that "these things happen everywhere all the time"  these things are actually quite rare. That's why you and I have, as yet, not been killed in a random massacre.

       Well, I'm stretching here (in regards to the relevance of this particular comment), but the Columbine shooters were both Montauk boys. Can't remember the source but it IS proven. There seem to be very many of them centered around the Denver area. Would not surprise me ONE BIT if Holmes is connected to the Montauk Project.

       Yeah, I've been studying the Montauk project for many years. When you are ready to go a bit further down the rabbit hole check out some interviews with Al Bielek or Preston Nichols. This shit is SICK and goes deeper than you would imagine.

       What, are there another 1.2 million that disappear and somehow nobody notices?
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, a large large proportion of these kids are found.  They either ran away, or went with their non-custodial parent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, a huge percentage of kidnappings are just dad taking the kid away from mom, or mom taking the kid away from dad.  Illegal, since they don't have custody, but definitely not part of a massive mind control program.

        The big King Tut exhibit doesn't open at the Denver Art Museum until the end of the month, but the first piece is already on display, standing tall outside Denver International Airport.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an exhibition of royal artifacts thousands of years in the making and it's never been seen in Denver before and will never be again -- "Tutankhamun the Golden King and the Great Pharaoh."
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the biggest sculptures from a new exhibit of ancient Egypt was unveiled Wednesday at the airport to kickoff the event. In a mere 27 days Denver will go Tut crazy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The installation of the 7-ton, 26-foot tall statue of Anubis took place at the south end of the DIA terminal. Anubis was the ancient Egyptian god of the afterlife.
       </p>
       <p>
        "It's an exhibition of about 100 objects, both from King Tut's tomb, and 2,000 years of ancient Egyptian history. And it really walks people through what pharaohs' life was like, what families' life was like; and then you'll actually go down some stairs and into a space that's basically a replicated tomb of King Tutankhamun and see about 50 or so objects from the King's tomb," Kristy Bassuener with the Denver Art Museum said.

        One speculation in this report, however, does note that the scenario to be played out in late May, in Colorado, as planned by the Americans, does, indeed, mirror similar plans of the Russian General Staff of actions to be taken in the case of sudden civil war where “outside forces” would be called upon to protect the government from overthrow by internal forces or armed rebellion by the military.

       I would play along with this find-the-link game, but I'm not sure what kinds of events qualify. You seem to have linked all sort of random things--a ceremony at a private club, UFO sightings, plane crashes, and various massacres/bombing.

       Something I should point out about Holmes.
      </p>
      <p>
       A local news station here in SF (not affiliated with any of the major TV networks), mentioned that an FBI agent at Holmes place noticed the controller for the booby traps was something they've never seen before here in the US. Only have they seen this type of setup in Iraq and Afghanistan. Which leads me to believe there's something else going on here.

       This and a lot of other inconsistencies are what got me interested in the OPs theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if its just a total coincidence with the dates and the killings, the Aurora case itself has way too many unanswered questions and what I consider an ongoing cover-up with what were seeing on TV.

       Now, before I continue we should probably compare this to any other week and see if the same pattern can be picked up in it. Otherwise we may just be creating a pattern in a world full of violence. But there at least seems to a consistent pattern of carnage surrounding the grove meeting.

       Nah. Its too rare, its not related and its not one sort of sacrifice, UFO's over 1 town has got nothing to do with say blood sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore I believe the Bohemian Grove was established in the late 60's, several years AFTER the Bilderberg group and didn't exist before that. Before that I believe they met in other groups like freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't see how it could be related.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Oh and your hypothesis is based that Aliens from another planet/s exist and are visiting us and require human sacrifice once every 20 years so they won't kill us. I mean you got to admit, its pretty far fetched.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean if this was any other forum, I'd say you were dis-info agent or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT2: Now that I checked your account its only 5 days old, so yeah, I'd say this is pretty out there theory, not based in sound science or facts or history for that matter.

       While you are correct that the op is wrong about when Bohemian Grove started,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Club">
        the Bohemian Club
       </a>
       did start in 1872 and the Grove came about
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove">
        6 years later.

       That's according to wiki, but it seems reasonable.  So it started before the end of the 19th century.

       I wouldn't say aliens come here specifically so we sacrifice, maybe a coincidence or cover up of something bigger.

       I dunno about this theory. I do believe that there is something evil and ritualistic about the Aurora shooting. I don't believe Aliens have anything to do with it, at all. There is no way to know whether or not aliens had anything to do with it FOR A FACT. Yeah, there was that sighting over DC but there have been lots of huge sightings like that. Providing a few examples of July sightings is really just cherry picking some sightings and saying "Look, they are connected.." but consider every major sighting and it falls a part. I agree with you about Bohemian

       2 unknown men kills 12!!! And injures 14 people in zamboanga, philippines..

       Look under "oceania and maritime southeast asia"

       Great list of mass killings.. There is also a killing in sweden in -52 but that was in august so might not be related..

       I will try to find more about the philippine killings.

       O now your'e looking for an event in which people died within a 3 or 4 month window? Might I suggest that you could do that for just about every year ever. The world is a big place and depending on the time frame we are talking about a lot kiling are going on certain places. In this thread people are linking to IRA and phillipine related massacres. That would be like linking to a mass killing in syria right now. Or picking out a single suicide bombing during the Iraq war and acting like it means something.

       You are correct! One can make connections of any event recurring on any given day, week, month or year. The thing is that some recurring events on some particular dates seems to make more sense then others. 
I mean if you take a step back and try to get a concept of all the thousands of tinfoil hat conspiracies posted around forums like this one, i am quite sure you will come to the same conclusion i did. They are all pointing in the same direction, no matter what the conspiracy was originally about, be it aliens, evil bankers or the "war" in syria. There are evil forces at play, you can not deny that fact.
      </p>

       Yeas i did expand my search criteria with a couple of months in this particular case. Bohemian Grove is just one of many ritually inspired get togethers among the elite and others. How many others are there that are truly secret? I´m just trying to create awareness, who knows, my post my get someone to dig deeper and discover something new, something legit..

       I'm going to quote myself because it seems pertinent to this conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It is logical fallacy to associate UFOs with aliens, and a lot of work is being done to the end of making the words interchangable. We've seen videos of unexplained objects moving with unnatural trajectory from satellites/telescopes, but I have never once seen beyond the 'machines' (if they are that). As beautiful as the theory of alienkind may be, it is sad that such effort is taken to exploit the fact that people believe what suits and interests them. NO ONE is immune to this deception. Ever having set foot in this subreddit is proof enough of that. We're all of the opinion that there is a bigger picture. We're so desperate for the truth that any model can be taken to heart if not properly examined. On the subject of UFOs, aliens are more likely a guise created to play on people's imaginations and distract from the true culprits. Until we entertain this logical conclusion, no work will begin as people are satisfied that aliens rule space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore (and if I'm not mistaken), plans and prototypes of hovering disks were looted from Germany after WWII. Along with that, many German scientists working in military research and development were drafted into America's own R&amp;D. I would consider myself a fool to think their work stopped after their assimilation. I honestly have no sources readily available for this information, but I'm sure a simple DuckDuckGo search can provide more than enough for any interested and unknowing."

       In that post, there is a quote centered around a trip to find and photograph this phenomenon--do you know where to find these images?

       Pick a date, any date. Now working backwards from this year look for killings at or around that date... Lo and behold you've found a new conspiracy. This is a fucking ridiculous theory and you are a moron.

       There's really nothing to debate. If you believe this you might want learn about critical thinking and logic, because this theory is based upon nothing other than (very common) coincidences, there is no evidence. As I said, you would find exactly the same kind of correlations with any date.

       Okay. What's the harm in allowing discussion if there's nothing to it? I'm inclined to agree, but I like to get out of my own way when it comes to new information. I might learn something, I might not.

       But I learn nothing by saying 'this is bullshit' and nothing else.

       You make a fair point. I just find peoples beliefs without justification infuriating, but it wasn't terribly constructive of me.

       Justification is what some of the people are trying to do in this post.

       Of course all this just looks like a jumble dates and vague connections, but that's what brainstorming looks like, and you may or may not come up with a solution at the end.

       Sure. And I'm not trying to villify you for saying 'this is bullshit'. All I'm saying is, do that little extra and explain why it's bullshit AND be ready to engage in conversation about it.

       We have to learn from one another, which means we all have to become better teachers. Myself included. Apologies for saying you contributed nothing, we should be learning from everyone we meet.

       You are absolutely correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       However what you are seeing in this thread is the process of organizing facts to see if a hypothesis is true. You have to understand that if this was even remotely true it wouldn't be on frontpage CNN, so digging through what may look like garbage on the internet to attempt to see a pattern is sometimes necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I digress, I'm not saying anything here is true without question obviously, but it definitely warrants further study.

       Its more interesting to me when the deaths are of the same flavor.  I've noticed that there is a huge pattern of events from April 19th to May 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have my writings in front of me but basically some of the days are death by fire and some are specifically captives being killed (prisons, stadiums).  For example; the Waco massacre and other events fit into this.  One of the patterns in this time are people being confined or moved into a place where they are controlled and then on the day they are all killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also "Earth Day" fits into this period and I discovered that "Earth Day" is not about saving the Earth but about actually sacrificing part of the Earth by defiling the land.  The event that caught by attention was the Deep Water oil rig incident but looking further back there were many nuclear bombs detonated and things of this sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then May 1st seems to represent a wish of things to come so to speak so Hitler is announced dead, Osama bin Ladin is announced dead, etc.  There is a lot to this thirteen day period.  After the Deep Water accident and the Pakistani Times Square "bomber" was foiled on May 1st I said to myself "lets just fucking see what happens next year between April 19th and May 1st" and sure enough the incarnation of evil Osama bin Ladin was "killed" on that day and Pakistan was again blamed.  May 1st is the make a wish day to set the tone for the year.
