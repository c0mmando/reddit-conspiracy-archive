       There has been an overwhelming influx of posts regarding him, I'm even intrigued by this whole case. I have noticed syria, banks and the false flag at the Olympics getting less coverage. For the sheer amount of naysayers in the comments its amazing these posts are making to the front page. Its all just a little weird. 
I have my own questions about the Holmes case like why all the armour? Was he expecting to take on a army? Did he change his mind about going out in a blaze of glory, is that why he was sat in his car 'meekly'? But they can remain unanswered for now.

       That's how I feel everytime a celebrity dies or anything of that matter that distracts us from the big issues. Like KRS-One said, We were on the brink of revolution during the bush years, Than we put a black guy in his seat and everybody just sat back down.. These are no idiots running the show, They know how to keep us pacified with media opiates.

       Once you near the precipice of an unfolding plan things start to happen very fast. This is no surprise that tons of different things are happening at once. Little time is left before they need guns out of our hands..Little time is left before ww3 starts...little time indeed

       I will not pretend to understand everything  thats going on. What I do understand is that our country is poised on the edge of a knife, shouldwe the people stumble an falter all will be lost. Events are moving, things are in place, but we can stop, if not with words then by force of might. This country was founded on a dream that became a reality.

       "false flag operation legit or cover up of something bigger" - Really? Those are my only options? How about you gather some semblance of a case by doing some research, and THEN connect the dots. We are all slaves to confirmation bias at some level, but good god man. You are ASSUMING not only that something will happen, but that it will be part of some greater scheme.

       So it's been orchestrated to divert attention from something people don't understand or care about? Does that make any sense to you? Like, at all? If the people were going to revolt over anything it would have been the bank bailouts during the 08' meltdown. That's if they understood or cared. But they don't. What youre seeing here is just plain ol' ignorance. No cover up necessary.

       I believe it could have been setup to help reel votes for the UN Small Arms Treaty coming up next week. Coupled with the exxageratted news reports and misinformations, it is very possible he was used to convince the voters how 'evil' firearms can be, and if the laws pass our 2nd amendment will be virtually destroyed.

       How to you suppose it will affect US gun laws? I read somewhere it will ban use of any semi-automatic firearm except to military/police and will low legal ability to confiscate/destroy said banned firearms. If that is truly the case, that is a huge trample on the rights US citizens withhold dearly.

       I'm reading that, too. But not from any reliable sources. So I dunno.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't think our rights are contingent upon non-militia's bearing semi-automatic weapons (it's a far stretch from the amendment's original intention). But I don't really care to debate it.

       I have heard this mentioned before and it just doesn't jive with me.

      <p>
       Killing and wounding so many people in order to
       <em>
        possibly
       </em>
       garner citizen support for a UN vote just doesn't seem plausible.

       Now killing a bunch of people in order to gain control of 80% of the worlds oil supply, and start wars freely.....now that makes sense.

       I just don't see that plausible after this incident.  They would need more to scare the sheeple into surrendering their firearms.

       I agree, but it could be a step in the direction. I'm not saying it will happen the day of, but I know American's as a majority will not simply hand their rifles over if/when the time comes. I imagine there is much tension to be built in the meantime, the treaty being a possible catalyst.

       This is just retarded. You really think some UN vote is going to pass and they are going to come for our guns (tm) Seriously get a fucking grip. And while you're busy doing that try reading a bit about the actual bill instead of parroting the shit that fits your preconceived notions.

       You mad bro? Chill, instead of trying to jump on my ass about misinformation I had, how about you correctly inform me instead of looking for a point to make yourself feel superior over something I admittingly don't know too much about. Hence the phrase 'I believe'. Your hostility doesn't change the fact that I threw in my part of a discussion over a subreddit for conspiracies, which what I stated happens to be.
