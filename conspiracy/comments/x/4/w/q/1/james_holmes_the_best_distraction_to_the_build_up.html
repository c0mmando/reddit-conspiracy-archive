        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There has been an overwhelming influx of posts regarding him, I&#39;m even intrigued by this whole case. I have noticed syria, banks and the false flag at the Olympics getting less coverage. For the sheer amount of naysayers in the comments its amazing these posts are making to the front page. Its all just a little weird. 
I have my own questions about the Holmes case like why all the armour? Was he expecting to take on a army? Did he change his mind about going out in a blaze of glory, is that why he was sat in his car &#39;meekly&#39;? But they can remain unanswered for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;false flag operation legit or cover up of something bigger&quot; - Really? Those are my only options? How about you gather some semblance of a case by doing some research, and THEN connect the dots. We are all slaves to confirmation bias at some level, but good god man. You are ASSUMING not only that something will happen, but that it will be part of some greater scheme. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it&#39;s been orchestrated to divert attention from something people don&#39;t understand or care about? Does that make any sense to you? Like, at all? If the people were going to revolt over anything it would have been the bank bailouts during the 08&#39; meltdown. That&#39;s if they understood or cared. But they don&#39;t. What youre seeing here is just plain ol&#39; ignorance. No cover up necessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it could have been setup to help reel votes for the UN Small Arms Treaty coming up next week.

    <div class="md"><p>How to you suppose it will affect US gun laws? I read somewhere it will ban use of any semi-automatic firearm except to military/police and will low legal ability to confiscate/destroy said banned firearms.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m reading that, too. But not from any reliable sources. So I dunno. </p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t think our rights are contingent upon non-militia&#39;s bearing semi-automatic weapons (it&#39;s a far stretch from the amendment&#39;s original intention). But I don&#39;t really care to debate it.</p>

<p>Killing and wounding so many people in order to <em>possibly</em> garner citizen support for a UN vote just doesn&#39;t seem plausible.  </p>
