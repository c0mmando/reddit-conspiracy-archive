It&#39;s common sense to not open up your borders to everyone and everything without any regard for the consequences (looking at you, Europe). To put things into perspective, my parents were immigrants who fled the Middle East due to religious persecution. It makes my head spin when some sheltered, white yuppie chimes in with their hippy-dippy opinion on Islam. They have absolutely no idea what it&#39;s like to be a minority living in an Islamic country.

<p>No they don&#39;t. If only you could convince them, but they will refuse to see. How would hardcore muslims live next to gays? How could women dress sluttily around them? They would say we are homophobic and sexist for having those views. I&#39;d say they live in world devoid of facts and statistics. Those don&#39;t matter anymore though. It&#39;s sad. </p>

<p>Fascism/national syndicalism is characterized by focus on national spirit, mistrust of finance capitalism, consolidated power in the hands of a strongman leader, disregard for constitutional limitations on power in the name of industrial progress, militarism, futurism and anti-communism.</p>

<p>A much better definition than my sketch, but which of these do we not see in the movement that made that child&#39;s death a reality? Futurism I guess?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the futurism.</p>

<p>The consolidated power that Trump&#39;s administration holds is, at this point at least, democratically obtained.</p>

<p>Disregard for constitutional limitations on power isn&#39;t really present, the decisions of the judiciary have been effective at limiting the actions of the administration.</p>

<p>Mistrust of finance capitalism isn&#39;t really there, either. The administration has been doing everything it can to woo investments from finance capitalists and I haven&#39;t seen any threat of nationalisation of industry. That&#39;s more a beast of the far-left these days.</p>

<p>I can definitely see what you&#39;re saying and I agree to a point - but if all Western nations are partially fascist then the label rather loses it&#39;s meaning.</p>

<p>Interestingly, another word used by fascist leaders to describe fascism was &#39;corporatism&#39; which definitely applies.</p>

<p>Only insofar as you&#39;re trying to use it to judge countries holistically and against each other, and quibbles about &quot;finance capital&quot; vs &quot;the elite&quot; aside, I think that&#39;s most of our disagreement. I wouldn&#39;t say the US is a fascist country, but then that&#39;s a different concept than there being a popular strain of fascism in the US that has a lot of power under this government.</p>

<p>Do you read much? There&#39;s a book which was written at the beginning of the Reagan era by Bertram Gross called &#39;Friendly Fascism&#39; that I think you&#39;d find interesting. He largely argues that neo-conservatism/neo-liberalism represent the introduction of fascism into US politics with a friendly face. I think you&#39;d enjoy it.</p>

<p>Were these camps indicative of fascism when Obama was sending kids there when they were caught with drug smugglers?

Are all the children and adults who die at the hands of authorities indicators of fascism?  </p>

<p>Because this sub is supposed to be about <strong>conspiracy,</strong> not great athletes who are shitty people.  </p>

<p>It a clear sign of the level of control reddit have SOLD to commercial interests, to keep their fans from talking openly and honestly in their respective subs.  </p>

<p>When the NFL sub can bury/ban conversations about players who prey on underage drunk girls and others who fight and kill animals for &quot;entertainment&quot;, the NBA sub &quot;zero-vote&quot; comments about Kobe Bryant the rapist after he wins an Oscar ... it&#39;s all a wash now.  </p>

<p>Conspiracy is now the last place you can go and talk the (unpopular) truth and have others contribute, with their thoughts/opinions. Sad days indeed...   </p>

<p>Tbh if that is true (and I don&#39;t know that it is) I personally don&#39;t think its a big deal. Maybe childish but w/e some white dude makes a dumbass comment against asian ppl you reply with the same dumbass comment against white ppl.

<p>If its not true that she was replying in kind then obviously it&#39;s unacceptable racism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s interesting is my own cursory search of her posts only told me they were &quot;dirty jokes targeting conservatives&quot; posted 5 years ago and the only explicit quote I found was the fact she used the hashtag &quot;cancelwhitepeople&quot; which makes it all seem very benign.</p>

<p>&quot;Groveling goblins&quot; and &quot;fucking asshole white people&quot; were not mentioned. The problem is racism means two different things depending on if you believe the dictionary or modern academia, in a lot of people&#39;s minds there is no statement she could have made that would have been an exhibiton of her &#39;racism&#39;, that is the belief that (by definition) white people are inferior humans.</p>

<p>Obviously the classic argument is to substitute white people for Jews being &quot;Groveling goblins&quot; but bizarrely enough many European Jews could easily be seen as &quot;white&quot; so this isn&#39;t a swap, just focussing her vitriol on a subset of white folks.</p>

<p>So follow this: (1) there exists light skinned european Jews who identify simply as white and (2) we know her claim that white people are groveling goblins should (by any logical axioms worth using) imply that those aforementioned white identifying European Jews are groveling goblins but of course calling Jews goblins is racist; Reductio Ad Absurdum.</p>
