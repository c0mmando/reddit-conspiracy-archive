       If you support Trump and think that he is standing up for the good guys, why do you think he hasn't repealed Obama's Smith-Mundt executive action? The Smith-Mundt act weaponized propaganda against the U.S.'s own citizens. Literally everything in the news cycle could just be a story that has no basis in reality. You want the "truthiest" truth, well that's it.

       Btw... I don't care at all about politics or any type of affiliations for that matter. I'm way more interested in presenting information.

       I don’t support nor oppose Trump. But, I can imagine a scenario where removing, exposing, or disabling the specific people within the current political system who also wanted and are powerful enough to usher in a Smith Mundt Act in the first place might be a more effective way of un-rooting the Act permanently.

       For a while, I thought Trump wasn't supposed to get in and it was supposed to be Hilary but it doesn't matter now.
      </p>
      <p>
       If trump was for the little guy, it doesn't matter because he is in there and won't do anything about the real issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter what you think the reasoning behind this is, he isn't that white knight saving the day.  It's a good thing because if we had to put up statues of that guys......fuck me.  I'm not sure it would be worth it.

       Fair question.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it is a small part tied to a large act (NDAA). Also the executive branch does not make laws. Not making excuses just stating some facts. The extreme media propaganda has opened the eyes of a lot of people that wouldn't have understood otherwise. So in a way Trump has taught america how it has been manipulated over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he is letting everyone dig a deep enough hole to bury themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in all reality I do not think the rogue intelligence agencies really need a law changed to infiltrate the media and push propaganda. They would do it regardless.

       I think it is a bit more nuanced than just repealing. And you are right,  what we are seeing these days is not coming from the state department. We have many factors feeding this beast right now.

       Very good question that I do not have the answer to.  My guess is that, honestly, they know it is too powerful of a tool to get rid of.  I know thats not the answer you're looking for, but that is probably it.  The fruits of this law are what we see everyday in the MSM now.

       Um hello. Ive been there since the start. Im just saying that due to this propaganda act stated in the OP, it could be a legal farce. I have trusted the plan for too long without tangible results. Charts, graphs, and sealed enditements aren't enough when your government can legally lie to your face.

       The answer is simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, the act was passed by a GoP Congress, and they remain in power. The chances of a repeal arriving on his desk are slim until Democrats take the chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, Obama thought tooth and nail, threatening to veto the act but bowed down under pressure. He failed, and Trump always goes opposite of what Obama did. Thus on principle Trump will not repeal the act.

       At what point do you realize Obama, like Trump plays the game of opposition?  Obama also ran on single payer, and according to his supporters fought for it, but failed, and instead we got Romney Care... I mean Obama care.  Then Trump and the republicans pretends their going to get rid of it, but It's a Republican's wet dream.  It was created by a right wing think tank in the mid 90's, and it a hand out to the  insurance companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama also did the same thing with sec 1021 of the 2012 NDAA, threatened to veto it because it literally allowed the Government to indefinitely detain US citizens without a trial, but he also failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to over reaching power grabs by the government, the president will always "fail" to stop it.  Kind of like how Trump reauthorized FISA while at the sametime the entire right were point to It's abuses against Trump.  It's all theatrics when it comes to erode our civil liberties, let companies walk all over us, and have the MIC brain wash us through media.

       That was a Congressional law passed in a Republican controlled congress attached to a necessary funding bill. Not something that was directed by Obama.

       Considering the Congressional leadership during Obama Presidency, perhaps if he had said he wanted it they would have blocked it since that is what they bragged about constantly, blocking anything Obama requested.

       that one is actually incredibly easy to answer. If your enemy has an advantage over you, and you suddenly have the opportunity to seize that advantage and use hpit against him, then you should do exactly that.

       That fucker through out the rule book the moment he legalized propaganda against US citizens. In fact, before that Operation Mockingbird was working that way anyway! Then, you take a look at who is working for CNN (Clapper, Brennan) which makes you realize that these clowns never planned to play fair in the first place. There are probably many more agents working alongside them and Trump is going to need every advantage he can get to stop them.

        Secondly, Obama fought tooth and nail, threatening to veto the act but bowed down under pressure.

      <p>
       At what point do you realize Obama, like Trump plays the game of opposition?  Obama also ran on single payer, and according to his supporters fought for it, but failed, and instead we got Romney Care... I mean Obama care.  Then Trump and the republicans pretends their going to get rid of it, but It's a Republican's wet dream.  It was created by a right wing think tank in the mid 90's, and it a hand out to the  insurance companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama also did the same thing with sec 1021 of the 2012 NDAA, threatened to veto it because it literally allowed the Government to indefinitely detain US citizens without a trial, but he also failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to over reaching power grabs by the government, the president will always "fail" to stop it.  Kind of like how Trump reauthorized FISA while at the sametime the entire right were point to It's abuses against Trump.  It's all theatrics when it comes to erode our civil liberties, let companies walk all over us, and have the MIC brain wash us through media.
