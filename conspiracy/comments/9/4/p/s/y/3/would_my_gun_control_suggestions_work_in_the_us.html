        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am an American gun owner, former National Guardsman, and recreational shooter, and I would like to see gun reform in America. </p>

<p>Here are my suggestions for gun policy in the U.S.-</p>

<p>For black powder rifles and shotguns one must simply be 18 or older.</p>

<p>For all other guns, a license should be required. For an unrestricted license(meaning you don&#39;t need a reason), a person must be at least 21. A person does not have to be 21 to obtain a license so long as you have a genuine reason, such as sport shooting, agriculture, and hunting. For a concealed carry license, a person must be 21. To obtain a collector&#39;s license, a person must be 21. For persons without a concealed carry license, the firearm may only be carried in public if being transferred to intended destination of use, such as shooting range, farm, place of employment, or hunting ground. To obtain a license, a person must pass a written multiple choice test regarding gun legislation, safe handling of a gun, and legitimate use of a gun, followed by a physical test involving safely handling, loading and unloading the gun, and a target shooting test.</p>

<p>Guns capable of full automatic rate of fire, hollow point pistol ammunition, guns not cleared for civilian use, armor-piercing ammunition, incendiary ammunition, and suppressors may be purchased only by licensed collectors or persons with a genuine need for such weapons(such as security detail). The person must obtain a may-issue exemption for such weapons, and must have a place to store them securely, as well as allow ATF agents to inspect the safe to ensure the weapons and accessories are stored properly.</p>

<p>Handguns, semi-automatic weapons, sawed-off shotguns, and pistol carbines should require registration. The registration must be filed before purchasing the weapon, and includes the caliber and type of weapon.</p>

<p>For bolt-action, break-action, lever-action, and pump-action rifles and shotguns as well as black powder pistols, only a license is needed and the gun can be bought upon presenting a valid license.</p>

<p>To obtain a license, a person should be required to undergo a mental and physical health exam and be cleared by a general practitioner. If they have any mental or physical conditions which render them potentially unsafe, they must be cleared by a specialist. Essentially, the person needs to be fit to drive.</p>

<p>To be considered eligible for a license, a person must not have ever been sentenced to imprisonment longer than 12 years or have been adducted as mentally defective, must not have been sentenced to imprisonment for more than 5 years int he preceding 20 years, must not have been sentenced to imprisonment for more than 2 years int he preceding 10 years, and must not have been sentenced to imprisonment in the preceding 5 years, or be on criminal probation in the preceding three years.</p>

<p>To be considered eligible for a license, a person must not, in the preceding three years, have been subject to treatment for alcohol or drug abuse or committed serious misdemeanors(such as DUI, vandalism, assault, etc;).</p>

<p>For permanent residents of the U.S., foreigners from NATO countries, countries that are NATO Global Partners, EU countries, Mexico, the Philippines, and Switzerland, and permanent residents of any of those nations, a firearms license is shall-issue. For all other foreigners, it is may-issue.</p>

<p>Do you like my suggestions?</p>
