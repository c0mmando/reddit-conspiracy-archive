       First of all, you can’t blame him for getting a Nobel he probably didn’t want at the time. Second of all, it’s only a couple of years later. Third, he saved the system after the crash and restored economic normalcy; if you hate the system and that normalcy then fine but don’t expect the mainstream to produce a radical critique of the status quo. Finically, he’s getting the benefit of comparison. Obama comported himself with honor and decency relative to the presidency historically - unlike the asshole we have now.

       Well thats a new take on Obama.   Honor and decency implies truthfulness,  frankness,   upright intentions,  without fault in his day to day conduct,  considerate,  law abiding,  upholding the US Constitution,  not given to predjudice or entangling himself in racial strife, division or social unrest,  all of which has already been proven,  he was not,  and was an instigator of.

       No, it's just that when you start out in the depths of a recession there's nowhere to go but up. He doesn't get credit for the most anemic recovery in U.S. history, while actively hampering the economy with his retarded policies. I voted for him twice, but I have the intellectual honesty to admit I was wrong. The economy immediately started doing better after election night, tell me, how long does "Obama's economy" extend into Trump's presidency, because now the economy is at all time highs with unemployment, especially for minorities who you're supposed to care about, at all time lows; did Obama just plan it out so his failed policies would only start working once he left office?

       I have plenty of criticisms of Obama but I don't believe that Presidents are responsible for the economy. There are too many moving parts. They can influence it for sure but it's silly to think any one person or factor is responsible.

       The market is based on consumer and investor confidence, those investors including institutional investors and corporations investing in themselves, which is greatly helped when there's a high level of confidence that market strangling regulations (with dubious benefits and diminishing returns in many cases, see: Clean Air Act) will be repealed and new ones not enacted, as well as federal agencies being reigned in and not allowed to act as unilateral legislative bodies run by appointed beauraucrats any longer, see: EPA.

      <p>
       Just to explain before I have someone freaking out about how I don't like "The Clean Air Act" (how could I not like clean air?!?), that particular regulation came with a cost to the economy of I believe ~$30b/year, while causing a net reduction of carbon dioxide emissions of 0.25%. Most of that cost wasn't to the companies by the way, it was passed on to the already struggling customers. One of many of Obama's record setting number of regulations he put in place.

       It's not a new take re: the OP's premise. Relative to the presidency historically, what I wrote is just objectively true. He's in the norm, more or less. Did he make some of the mistakes every politician does? Sure. Is it reasonable to believe his policies were terrible? Sure, it's reasonable to hate his policies, though I don't. If you think Obama instigated social unrest, perhaps you should have a look at the presidencies of Johnson, Nixon, Hoover, Lincoln, Roosevelt, etc. Any reasonable person will say that, like him or not, disagree with him or not, he was no worse than average. Now, was he a good or great president? I've no idea at the moment.

       Took money? You mean he was personally bribed? It’s difficult to credit your comment unless I’m misunderstanding it. He presided over the process of recovery. I would agree that there is a question of whether the bailout was good. Maybe it wasn’t. But there is no evidence he did it for personal gain. More likely, Obama was just a very mainstream moderate in terms of economics. It’s legitimate to criticize what he did but he WAS president during the process of economic recovery whether or not you believe that recovery was handled well or not in terms of policy.

       I did not imply he did it for personal gain. I am just saying he literally took money and gave it to the banks. That’s all I said. He approved that. That is true and only true.

      <p>
       You outright said he “saved” the situation actually. So in that case there is no question of the situation. Obama saved it. According to you, of course. It was all a sham. The whole thing.

       His Nobel Peace Prize whether or not he threw his name on the ballot it set him up to be a media darling for 8 years. Exact opposite coverage of the current administration. 90% positive. Everything he did was great. Couldn’t do no wrong. Fucking Barack Midas Obama.

       The Noble was questioned at the time; it was an embarrassment for Obama and had nothing to do with later perceptions of him. This is a fact. You could say it was a result of early (overly) rosy perceptions of him. That’s true and fair enough as a critique. He saved the economic situation for the establishment in as much as any president can take credit for general economic conditions while they are in office.

       Yeah, I know the left and right meet 'round the bend. I'm not saying you don't have a case but that what you describe as robbery and criminality is mainstream behavior of presidents and likely an institutional problem/effect. Obama didn't come in and with malevolent intentions like the current president, rather, he took advice from the institutional representatives advising him. The giant aircraft carrier that is America was kept rolling along as opposed to being turned to some other dark course. Supporters of Obama could argue that he altered the course a little, as far as the difficulty of turning such a giant structure is. Others can argue he didn't have the will or integrity to change the system.

       "Anonymous source says 'Trump leaks as anonymous source'"- both of your articles. That's not the type of leaking i'm talking about, that's more of a trap to try and catch leakers within the Administration, if it's true at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking about leaks to the media regarding the "Russia-gate" investigation, and other
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       leaks of classified intel from the Obama admin to media:

       I think you underestimate the cultural impact. The corporate news and general mass media are falling on their swords over this admin and it's antics. No one will ever buy their bullshit again, and if that was all that was accomplished, it would be a good thing. Mass arrests of the deep-rooted corruption within gov't would take quite a bit of effort and time, and would have to be done quietly, lest you risk bringing down a large part of the country with it.

       Do you even CNN or MSNBC? Do you not see former CIA and Intel
       <em>
        openly

       panicking about a sitting administration? It's almost as if Dulles had gone on national television to admonish Kennedy after he was fired... he was smartly much more quiet...

       Correction.  First Muslim president.  He isnt black.  We are assuming he is because of the color of his skin.
Nothing about him stands out as being black.
Now his husband Michael,  is black.
Michael acts and has manerisms of a black person,  according to their heritage.
 Barack does not.

       Well,  your entitled to your opinion,  as I am,  but we are not entitled to our own facts.
       <br/>
       The truth is the truth no matter how much it is disputed or disliked.  Same holds true for untruths.
The facts are,  what has been done, and proven  beyond the point of denial.  Some will deny till their dying breath,  but that no more makes it truth than calling black,  red,  or purple,  green,
       <br/>
       Stop means stop,  no matter how you twist the definition to suit a paticuliar purpose.
You nor I,  or anyone else,  can change the facts.

       My larger point would be that in an increasingly pussified society, a natural alpha as a leader is a turn off to the average joe.

      <p>
       I totally get that Cheney had a lot of pull behind the scenes, but this is the same dynamic that was present with Bush Sr. and Reagan.  Doesn't mean that Reagan or Bush Jr weren't alphas.  Just look at how they talk to "normal" people.  Totally different than Obama.

       Obama is so loved because of his persuasion and hypnosis skills. Not a lot of people know this, but he was trained by one of the leading hypnosis practitioners back in the early 60s. If you know anything about body language, it's obvious in any Obama speech what he's up to.

       Obama was born in 1961. Let's say "early 60s" end in 1964. So he was "trained by hypnosis practitioners" at the tender age of 2-3? Do you understand now why your theory sounds like some made up garbage?

       Obama was definitely not loved by all the mainstream media. Certainly the left wing media loved him, but he got nothing but flack from the right wing. It's just their job. But even the left criticized his foreign policy and drone attacks, and diehard leftists see him as continuing the neoliberal policies. I really don't get the impression that the media sees him as one of the best ones ever. Certainly one of the most charismatic and dignified, but Obama had plenty of criticism.

       Sure it does. People were getting paid off their content until youtube started deciding which content was worthy of monetization. When people are no longer making money theyll simply stop producing the content..

       okay first you cant provide me any examples or sources which list the said videos being censored. then you change the definition of what censored is. for the record youtube demonetizing is fully automated and you can always dispute. also you can always support your youtuber with Patreon.

       ALL mainstream media is corporatist (far right wallstreet trickle down shill economics). Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, etc. etc.
they ALL WERE SHITTING ON BERNIE SANDERS.
And even he was only slightly left wing (American spectrum)
but Europe would consider him centrist like FDR.
This is what happens when the corporate media gives the nation
a "politics lesson". They're lying through their asses.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to snap out of this bullshit identity politics propaganda.
Being an SJW does not make you left wing. It just makes you a brainwashed moron.
Also, just because Obama was leftish on social issues (LGBT rights, pro-choice on abortion) doesn't make him left wing. His economics were very right wing like Clinton's
but not as much as Romney, Bush, Rubio, Cruz, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern Dems and Repubs are shitty corporatist shills.
There has not been a moderate right, centrist or left wing president for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fox promotes Repubs, CNN promotes Dems. Status quo business as usual.
I don't believe Trump is playing 4D chess because nothing has significantly changed. Elites are still screwing us over like they've done for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       People want change, and most outlets are marketing themselves as progressive or whatever, but they're just corporate shills with an LGBT flavor or whatever gimmicky bullshit. I'm left wing economically and socially non-authoritarian, and I've never been an SJW in my life. Corporate media is manipulative bullshit.

       People have been brainwashed by the corporately owned media to think Obama is so cool and progressive......uh he's a wallstreet warmonger shill just like the rest. It is trickle down NEOliberal bullshit economics. Both parties do not care about workers or ethical small/medium businesses. They only care about the scummy tax-dodging, worker exploiting, big corporations, banksters and other oligarchs. Modern Dems and Repubs are shills. Bernie (initially an independent) was an exception I feel, as he was an FDR style European centrist (or slightly left wing on the American spectrum). The corporate media's spectrum however, is utter bullshit, pretending wallstreet warmongers Clinton and Obama are left wing lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       But consider most of Europe is also NEOliberal (just not as far right as America which is the NWO battleground)
and also consider he got rigged against and all corporate media smeared him 24/7 while obsessing over crazy Trump and promoting crazy Hillary. Both can kiss my ass, I see no evidence of Trump being anti-establishment so far, and Clinton is obviously a wallstreet shill too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money in politics is partially to blame for all this crap. Corporate/banking conflicts of interest in government
lead to shill politicians promoting shitty policies and the monopoly corporate media saying it's good shit (muh lib vs con when again, both parties are just two shades of far right corporatist economics).
      </p>
      <p>
       But because they talk about those "far right NAZIS!!!"
they try to make themselves look normal. The establishment is in fact extremist.
Extreme right economics + authoritarian social issues (ahem NSA spy state).
The Nazis were extremely authoritarian, but that shouldn't put the current establishment off the hook.
Corporatism leads to NWO fascism.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need money out of politics and then we'll start to get
center left, centrist, moderate right politicians instead of extreme right NEOlib trickle down shills and NEOcon warmongers (Dems and Repubs are both of these simultaneously).

       I'm a progressive and Obama definitely continued the neoliberal policies. As I'm noticing with my local democrat officials, the rhetoric and the actions differ a lot. He even acknowledged and praised the death of a guy in my community who was known for being a hotheaded criminal. He supported my mayor, who was an intern at the white house during his presidency, who now receives his largest local donations from RNC donors(Spanos family) and Bohemian Grove attendees (Greenwald Fritz Grupe Jr). Obama is a token black guy that can be used to soften the blow of the agenda being pushed, he wouldn't have received his position otherwise.

       CIA as MSM:  There are scores of books about the CIA and their nefariousness (which includes Operation Mockingbird), this is well trod ground.  If you prefer movies, Everything is a Rich Man's trick is a great primer on the CIA (in the context of the Kennedy assassination).
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA as Obama:  This is a bit more dot connecting, though I think somewhat accepted among conspiracy folks.  With a firm understanding of the CIA, the dots are not difficult to connect.  I see the reductionist reply to the SA = Citibank = CIA, so I won't get into all the dots.  I don't want one dot to tank the whole concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       If both are new concepts, start with the CIA in general.  Obama is a flower that grew from the CIA's garden.

       Media job isn't to attack, but to present current events, and of course, he was one of them. Government is a representation of us, and that makes him one of us. We act like the Government is this utterly detached thing that is meant to keep us down. If the Trump Administration has shown me anything, it is that clearly that isn't true. Look at the shift from 2015 to now in the political climate, and how many people are watching. Thinking that they are utterly detached, and do not answer to us is the first step in allowing them to do so.

       "one of them" doesn't mean government. Government are just factions of people. What "one of them" means is that he owes favors to donors and bankers, who are known as "them". The money people. The people that pull strings

       Mass corporate media because of consumerism &amp; selling the most products possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason is corporations already know that promoting multiculturalism is the way to sell the most stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deep state candidates are of late identity politics candidates because the belief is that the masses are stupid &amp; will accept these candidates with less opposition. H Clinton proved that doesn't exactly work.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Mainstream" propaganda media will promote anything that they think will appeal to consumers. Pure whites &amp; blacks don't really exist in the same numbers of mixed consumers &amp; pure whites/blacks accept mixed races easier than the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       They pushed Trump to hide the socialist after Clinton failed to attract any real support. She sure as hell didn't really 'win' the popular vote. The bitch couldn't even get people to display her bumper sticker.

       Obama was trained in communist subversion by bill ayers (weather underground ) Communism created by karl marx, coming from a jewish intellectual matrix.  that matrix controls our MSM, just tabulate the jews at the top.

       He had a certain charisma.  But let's be honest, he was the first black President, a concept that a lot of people are invested in.  The media loves to push a highly integrated image of America that I think is less true on the ground and in everyday reality, and Obama was an ideal character for this fictional drama.  Don't forget that he was also more than willing to indulge in a certain amount of pop culture identity and accessibility, which the media loved.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was also the follow-on to Bush who had something of a hostile relationship with the press, so a President who is press-friendly is going to get more positive coverage, above and beyond the obvious ideological preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also sure you can overplay Obama's popularity, especially among left-wing Democrats.  Many were disappointed that his policies were oddly misaligned with the progressive vision pushed in the campaign.  This ultimately led to the Sanders campaign.  If Obama had managed to keep the party 100% unified, Hillary's chances would have probably improved enough to win the Presidency.

       MSM loved Barack Obama because there was no way a Republican was getting in after GWB, Obama was moderate and even took to commending Ronald Reagan, and MSM knew that a really huge savior attitude at the beginning would provide "disappointment" dividends on the other side. And it did.

       If, instead of Trump, we got someone who spoke and used his/her/their mind as good, or better than Obama, then, rather than stroking the image of Obama, we would probably be collectively patting ourselves on the back, re: our ability to put intelligent, useful, respectful leaders into office, such that our whole humanity-deal would be flourishing, unquestionably so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, that's not how it went down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have someone who is not well spoken, not anywhere near as intelligent or self-aware, and, quite obviously unstable.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why does the media like the prior leader so?
      </p>
      <p>
       The same reason someone in a burning house might reminisce about the prior un-burning state of the house, of the example the un-singed bits set for this and other houses, etc, of the good life such conditions promise...
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama wasn't perfect; intelligent, a good example, useful, yes, but not revolutionary, no.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Trump? Well, if you can look at him, his ilk, his actions without the distortion of those whose interests are benefited by civil division, by Trump's reign, more generally, then you can see why we'd like the intelligent man who preceded him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama isn't a lucerferian pedophile, and Trump isn't a 4-D chess genius.
