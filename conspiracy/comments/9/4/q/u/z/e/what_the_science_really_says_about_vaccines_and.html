       <strong>
        Vaccines don't cause autism
       </strong>
       , there are thousands of studies that show vaccines are not related to autism and the science is settled. Nothing to see here we are being told. Is this really true?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        WebMD - The research is clear:
        <strong>
         Vaccines don’t cause autism
        </strong>
        . More than a dozen studies have tried to find a link. Each one has come up empty.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mayo Clinic -
        <strong>
         Vaccines do not cause autism
        </strong>
        . Despite much controversy on the topic, researchers haven't found a connection between autism and childhood vaccines
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here is what the high priests of vaccinology say summarizing that studies that had been done so far:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908388/">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908388/
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Twenty epidemiologic studies have shown that
        <strong>
         neither thimerosal nor MMR vaccine causes autism
        </strong>
        . These studies have been performed in several countries by many different investigators who have employed a multitude of epidemiologic and statistical methods. The large size of the studied populations has afforded a level of statistical power sufficient to detect even rare associations. These studies, in concert with the
        <strong>
         biological implausibility
        </strong>
        that vaccines overwhelm a child’s immune system, have effectively dismissed the notion that vaccines cause autism.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What they are saying is that they have investigated whether or not mercury in vaccines causes autism and whether or not the MMR vaccine causes autism. They have investigated
       <strong>
        1 vaccine
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        1 ingredient
       </strong>
       so far. There are over 10 childhood vaccines given in 40+ injections and dozens of ingredients. That means they have never investigated whether or not the current childhood vaccination schedule with over 60 vaccines doses given can increase the risk of developing Autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to them they have not studied it because it would be unethical and would lead to unreliable results.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what they have done was to compare the health outcomes of vaccinated children to the health outcomes of other vaccinated children.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         No studies have compared the incidence of autism in vaccinated, unvaccinated, or alternatively vaccinated children
        </strong>
        ....These studies would be difficult to perform because of the likely differences among these 3 groups in health care seeking behavior and the ethics of experimentally studying children who have not received vaccines.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The reason why they think that giving too many vaccines can't cause autism is because they say it is biologically implausible. They haven't done the studies but they don't believe it could happen because it seems implausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course if you think vaccines are the greatest gift to mankind and you could give 10000 vaccines in one day you don't believe vaccines could possibly do any harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition in the MMR and mercury studies there is possible bias and data manipulation so we can't even say mercury in vaccines or the MMR vaccine is safe.
      </p>

      <p>
       So in reality we have never studied whether or not vaccines can cause Autism but the vaccine experts
       <strong>
        <em>
         believe
        </em>
       </strong>
       they don't so it is a belief based on faith not on science.

       No, this is absurd. Stop being silly. These things clearly are not related, and those that have done all of the relevant scientific tests have found absolutely not evidence to suggest autism and vaccines are related either

       Oh yes. Go with blind faith that what someone tells is the truth. And comparing the causation of a fly in your room from an open door to a vaccine causing autism. Horrible analogy. Try again.

       You cannot sue in america and they have the highest rate of vaccinations, they pump them out because no liability.  Other countries have less vaccines and adopted similar programs to the 1986 act.  In Canada you can "technically" sue, you will basically never win and they don't have their own compensation act, even if you do sue them the legal battles take years and years, they make it take as long as possible so that you give up or die in the mean time, usually they coerce you into settling out of court.  There are people who win these battles, but you've just spent years of your life fighting something you have a low chance of winning since you are likely not an expert and do not have all the information and are expected to go up against this super giant industry that is presumed safe because we haven't done the proper safety studies like saline placebos, vax vs unvax, long-term, or looking for autism at more than 1 vaccine and 1 ingredient.

       Wrong. Go ask the parents who gave their (now dead) children all the CDC vaccinations if they were able to sue anyone. Ask them if anyone even acknowledged that there was even a slight possibility that the vaccinations could have caused complications. The answer will be a resounding no.

       You know who does the relavent scientific research don't you? The vaccine makers use their own scientists. How can we honestly believe them? That's like the FBI putting together it's own investigation team to investigate alleged illegal things happening within the FBI.

       Every parent has the same story when the noticeable changes take place. The kid receives vaccinations, that night, the child is irritable, high fever, crying like they're being hurt and everything goes downhill from there. Seizures, banging head on wall, loses everything the kid has learned up to that point, the talking, the walking, the look in the kids eyes like nobody is home and they witness their kid change over a few days. Those are the lucky kids, I guess. The unlucky kids will die. I personally know 3 families who lost children after getting vaxxed. My friend was watching his three month old nephew who received shots earlier in the day, his nephew died in his crib that night. "SIDS" they said. 
A year and a half ago my daughters friend got the HPV vaccine, she was home with her younger brother that night and he heard her crying in the bathroom, thought nothing of it. Finally went to check on her and she was deceased on the floor. Medical examiner said cause if death was "natural causes" I mean wtf? Seriously? 
Another family friend had twin girls, also my daughters friends, at their 6 month vaccinations, one of the twins reacted bad from it and was seriously messed up, RIGHT AFTER RIGHT AFTER RIGHT AFTER getting that round and permanently damaged her and she did finally pass away 2 years ago. She suffers a vaccine injury that made her suffer her entire life, it damaged her heart and her brain. Those are just the ones I know personally who died. I know several others affected some way by vaccinations. I know one family who received money from the vaccine courts because it was proven the vaccines she recieved gave her severe autism. 
BTW the vaccine court has paid out 3 or 4 billion to vaccine injured ppl since 1986 so your argument that vaccines are safe doesn't hold water. 
The meningitis vaccine almost killed me when I was 2.
So it's not just autism that is the focus here. Vaccine are killing kids, babies, causing severe brain damage and many other life long aliments. Read the actual inserts of the side affects.   It's beyond calling it possible side affects. Those side affects are happening, everyday. 
There has never been. Any long term testing on the combined multidose vax schedule they push today and inject into little babies. You really think a newborn can handle the same amount of everything in the MMR shot as well as a grown adult who decides to get another MMR shot?  Both receive the exact same shot! That amount of crap wreaks havoc on a newborn or young baby, ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!?!
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with you ppl defending vaccines and say they're safe is you can't bring yourselves to admit you blindly followed the pediatricians orders, you didn't educate before you vaccinate, didn't ask questions. You did absolutely nothing before letting someone inject something into your children. Inside your heart you know there is bad stuff in those shots but staying in denial gets you off the hook for being completely irresponsible and risking your kids health and life by questioning nothing at all. Just believe the pediatrician because he's in a doctor costume. Maybe your kids did get fucked up, just blame something else then. Whatever doesn't make you feel guilty. 
A cpl of the parents I know who had kids die or became injured choose denial as well. That would be hard to live with when someone could have just asked a few questions.

       Anecdotal evidence is very powerful in my book. If I was faced with the decision of whether to vaccinate or not, I would not only want to research each individual vaccine, but would also give equal weight to both anecdotal experiencial evidence and scientific research. I’m glad I’m no longer at baby making stage of life.

       I know for a fact that if you have a complication from a vaccine doctors will deny that this is the case, and by doing so the adverse reaction to the vaccine will not be reported, and that means that the safety figures which are based upon adverse reactions are under reported.

       It doesn’t matter if you do report. My kids got one vaccine at a time and when my daughter was about 2 or 3 and took her for one vaccine to which to pediatrician gave her one vaccine. When I brought her in she didn’t have so much as a stuffy no let alone a cough she was perfectly health.  Two days after vaccine had her back at pediatrician office and she had full blown pneumonia. He had given her the pneumococcal vaccination when were there two days before and when confronted about it he assured me it in no way made her sick it isn’t a love vaccine. I said was don’t know what that means but she was perfectly healthy and now has full blown pneumonia. My kids don’t get vaccines anymore

       So you daughter skipped the incubation period of pneumonia? Sorry to tell you this but she probably had it before she got the vaccine because you definitely can't go from completely healthy to "full blown pneumonia" in less than 2 days and definitely not from a pneumonia vaccine since those don't actually contain any bacteria in them.
       <br/>
       TLDR: She didn't get pneumonia from the vaccine.

       I'd buy it if it wasn't the fact that there literally isn't a single bacteria in those vaccines that could infect you. Even saying it gave her autism would be more believable since at least the OP could claim it was because of chemicals or something but when you claim something that physically cannot infect you infects you and in record time by skipping the incubation period that pneumonia has then it just sounds bullshit.

       There are 1000s of reports like this. Lots of kids and adults get sick (in various ways) after they got vaccinated. Your daughter’s natural immune system could have been fighting off a flu when she got vaccinated. This process was interrupted by vaccination.

       But there is a line of thinking that the Vaccines do work, and that the benefits they provide out weigh the risk. Now if enough of these people agree on this, and can see that vaccinating everyone will save a lot of people and medical cost over not, then shouldn't they be able to agree to do this if their of government allows that? Or basicly we have 100 people and 99 of them want chocolate, but 1 wants vanilla. Should we all go with vanilla because that one says that Chocolate is going to kill us all, because he saw this one thing on a web site, and Jenny McCarthy told them that the Ghost in her house said so too.

       Good strawman, but we're not talking about chocolate, we live in a world where everyone has the right to choose what goes into their body and how to live.  Vaccines go against peoples beliefs and religions, if you want to inject yourself with miscellaneous ingredients go right ahead, but don't force that onto other people.

       We have a country of many ideas and beliefs, and sometimes they clash, but when the majority of a people agree, coming from different walks of life agree, this happens. We have local governments that allow us to go into communities that allow more custom rules within the allowed rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for our country to continue in the way that many see, they make rules for the masses to abide. But it must be able to pass the masses, as we do have numbers, and are part of the rulemaking.

       The majority of people have mandated that Vaccines should be put into place. If a large amount of people disagreed this would not be allowed. You said earlier that you do not live in an area that allows this, and if the majority of people think like you this will continue. But if the majority of people decide that they want to change this and they do it accordingly, and with any luck, they do it with a majority of the population agreeing that this should happen, why should it not?

       I am not opposed to vaccines and I don't believe they are the cause of autism. My opinion is based on the research done when that quack doctor first made his false research backed claims.

       Guess what? I am in my 50s now and cannot recall ANYONE in my area ever having autism in my youth. Strange that now its as common as it is..The common denominator is the amount of vaccines now being mandatory and the ingredients added to them that were not during my youth. Although it would.be tedious, a person could actually research the data to find when autism cases spiked and what vaccines were being mandated. Then those vaccines could be compared to older recipees of vaccines to deduct problems.

       It's not like you do a bloodtest to determine autism though, it's a collection of symptoms.  Back in the day you just called autistic kids weird, quiet, introverted etc.

       this is such crap. I didn't know a SINGLE person my age who had autism.....now disabled children (not quiet or quirky, I'm talking about disabled) are everywhere. Meet a child with severe autism. Spend a little time with said child and then walk around your closest city and observe the children you see. It's gonna scare the shit out of you.

       this article is garbage. They say that Asperger's and some diagnostic criteria changes could explain the rise. That's bogus since we have seen a 1000 fold increase since 1930 and Asperger's makes up only a small part of Autism cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       They rely on a single UK study that would mostly track mild cases and tells us nothing about severe autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many better studies that show a dramatic increase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Autism  is now bigger than heart disease and cancer combined (in terms of economic impact) and still growing and the funds and the services are not there and parents are begging for help. We surely didn't notice that for the past 30 years.

       This is what I thought had happened. Haven't we noticed that the prevailence of aluminum derrivitives keeps repeating itself in medical sickness? Ultimately, big pharma always states something along the lines of "used in safe doses" or something thereof. But its not safe.....its the same as flouride and many other chemicals. They are POISIONS and should be completely removed from modern medicine altogether. These "harmless" doses sure have increased the amount of sicknesses in my lifetime. Its like the AMA and big pharma are using us as their lab rats in a huge germ warfare project. Unfortunately, we are the ones that lose.

       yes indeed. One of the MMR study authors became a whistleblower and he did not only suggest that they had repeatedly hidden statistical associations but they also have the data to do such a study and if I remember correctly they moved the data so that it could no longer be accessed with a freedom of information act request.

       This really is blind faith, in fact, I would say this is even anti-science, people are asking for these studies and being attacked for it because it could "harm" their religion and go against what their god says.

       The current research shows aluminium adjuvants are strongly linked to autism. When you inject a child with a vaccine containing aluminium it gets transported via immune cells called macrophages across the blood brain barrier and it stays there. Once there high levels of the cytokyne interleukin-6 occur and persistent brain inflammation also occurs. This causes brain damage in the children which causes autism.

       The science is very clearly pointing towards aluminium adjuvants as causing autism and the information is getting clearer and clearer as time passes.

        CDC Dr. Verstraeten et al research group (1999) found causal links of childhood vaccines to brain damage/autism.  Both mercury and aluminum adjuvant nuerotoxins were identified as causal factors . This damning data was eventually falsified and manipulated over years for eventual publication in Pediatrics (2003) , which officially found no associations.

       What is it shilling? People who criticize vaccines and ask for more studies to be done aren't selling a product, they don't have any financial backings, they have to do a kickstarter to make up 600,000 to do a study on aluminum.

       I read one study that showed that mercury in a vaccine was low enough, to be safe. But that was assuming that the vaccine would be given in at least 6 separate doses over the course of a year, but in reality, it's hiven in 1 to 3 doses. Thus it actually does cause damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the same as the study on thesis monkies decades ago, that tried to prove that smoking cannabis causes brain damage. The study was supposed to go on for a year, but the guy running it, didn't want to pay an assistant for the full year, but instead did it in 6 months. Which required them to double the dosage given. In the end, it proved that lack of oxygen causes brain damage.

       Same idea, but kinda opposite points.
