        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems that everywhere I look, things are getting more and more degenerate. Remember when Elvis was a Maverick? He completely revolutionized the times and broke new ground with his suggestive hip gyrations. That was a shocker back in the day.</p>

<p>Now listen to any song on the radio, its about hooking up with randos, throwing your life away for animalistic urges, selling drugs, popping xans, etc etc. </p>

<p>Movies, before, just sleeping in the same bed as your partner was shocking, but now there are movies that push extreme promiscuity, its cool to sleep around. It&#39;s OK to be a slut, it&#39;s ok to be in a Poly relationship, infact, you should! Traditional marriages are boring! Sleep around! True love does not exist. Perfect example, &quot;I do Until I Dont&quot;, I didnt see the movie, but the trailer is enough for me. It&#39;s about a couple who is in their 30&#39;s and is in a boring marriage, what better way to solve it then to sleep around? Don&#39;t talk your feelings out, don&#39;t connect on a soul level, no sleeping around is the answer!</p>

<p>Miley Cyrus, America&#39;s innocent sweetheart, the symbol of purity and wholesomeness. Boom corrupted to the absolute extreme, twerking on stage and having drug fueled orgies.</p>

<p>Porn, vanilla sex isn&#39;t enough, no it has to be incest porn, or Cuck porn, or anal for it to get views.</p>

<p>WTF I feel as I am going crazy here. I grew up in the 90&#39;s. What happened to the wholesome America that once was? Is it gone forever? Why is every aspect of popular culture so degenrate? What happened to true love? Faith? Soulmates?</p>

<p>Those he posits are the result to too long of a period of wealth and power, selfishness, the love of money, and the loss of any sense of duty. And nn average the length of time for any empire to rise to prominence and then collapse has rarely ever exceeded 250 years over the past 3,000 of recorded history.</p>

I have to admit Frnzlnkbrn&#39;s comment about &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have a word to say to someone whose favorite rappers are MC Hammer and Will Smith&quot; made me laugh and I&#39;m probably about to double down on it. My favorite singer is Falco. Yes, what an off the wall interest. I&#39;ll be the first to say it. Anyway, man had drug problems and alcohol problems and those are my examples. I&#39;ve got a mind that knows how to think for itself, life&#39;s hard enough without being drunk or drugged up by 10 in the morning. I&#39;m not being catty towards him. I sympathize for the troubles he went through. He had a hell of a time. I just have no desire to play copycat and do what he did in his life. This has been my thoughts the entire time. I&#39;ve been a fan of his since the 90s.</p>

<p>Ya know what&#39;s funny?  People said something similar back in the late 80/90&#39;s - only it was about those with HIV/AIDS.  Ryan White was diagnosed with HIV at 13 years old and people ran him out of school and tried to run him out of town.  We NOW know how incredibly ignorant those people were.  But back then?

    <div class="md"><p>Cross dressing has been around forever, from Charlie Chaplin bits to Shakespeare&#39;s As You Like It and Twelfth Night. Go even further back and the ancient Greek plays were all performed and sang by men playing female roles, Japanese kabuki theater too I believe. And we have more modern crossdressing comedy like White Chicks as well as musicians like David Bowie. Korean dramas and Japanese tv series like Ranma 1/2 also feature gender bending.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s degenerate, it&#39;s just a made up element of life (what clothes/ makeup you wear could destroy civilization as we know it!). As a feature of storytelling it&#39;s used either as a comedic device, a disguise, or a plot twist. Cross dressing is rarely confused with trans genderism in fiction despite a certain level of homophobia in society.</p>

<p>I’m assuming you’re referring to opioids, and if so I agree that’s bad.  That’s also the only sentence in your post that’s actually bad, so that’s why I picked it.  It is a problem and it’s fueled partially by greed and partially by attempts to control the populace.  There’s been discussions here before regarding its cause and potential true origins, which I think you can use the search function to find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People end up painting a mental image of a world that didn&#39;t exist.
Brains are weak things that are easy to mess with.</p>

<p>Take for example the classic statement of &quot;music isn&#39;t what it used to be&quot; by a range of people looking at what is popular today.
The only songs we tend to remember today are the good ones, we&#39;ve just forgotten the terrible ones. For a song to remain popular for decades, it has to probably be quite good.</p>

<p>This applies to memories of decisionmaking, politicians, etc. We are talking about a world where 63% Americans openly supported the Iraq war, yet 13 years later only 38% remember supporting it. This is 25% of people gaslighting themselves over probably the <em>biggest decision of a generation</em>, how the hell is a nation meant to learn anything when 1 in 4 people can just &quot;be on the right side of history&quot;.
This is why a decision making diary is essential where you explain why you&#39;ve come to the decisions you have today.</p>

<p>Just look at the set of lies being told about Iran. They&#39;re suddenly linking Iran to 9/11, nuclear weapon programs which ended 15 years ago, taking a whole speech and using a soundbite to scare people, laughing at Iran&#39;s weather control claims (ignoring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Popeye">Operation Popeye in Vietnam</a>), endless false claims about the Iran deal too.
But speak up about it and you&#39;re a <strong>traitor</strong> who wants to see <strong>dead children</strong>. Psychopaths lie, always claim to be the victim and always blame someone else. Until we relentlessly target these lies, they&#39;ll escalate into millions of deaths. Such is the joys of modern life where huge crimes against humanity can be done and you&#39;re just told to &quot;calm down bro, it&#39;s okay because I&#39;ve got porn&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things are better. Back in the day people were fake as shit. Sexual repression was rampant and took its toll on people. Instead they either lied about having sex, lied about rape, married young, put up kids for adoption against the mother’s will, lied about not getting abortions, or lied about being strait. None of those things are healthy. </p>

<p>You don’t have to like these things.  Please don’t watch them. They are not for you. Heavy metal doesn’t cause extra violence, video games don’t either. I hate fake shitty comedies like Big Bang Theory, but I know it is not made for me, so I don’t bitch about it. </p>

<p>I think it come down to standards and social norms. The kids of today are more comfortable talking about sex and promiscuity but it&#39;s not translating to a rise in actual sex. Some will blame porn for that, and that may well be a  factor, but I think it&#39;s more likely an understanding of the consequences and a fear of getting sucked into a family when higher education is so highly valued these days.</p>

<p>I remember when I was growing up that you only had two options to see classic tv--Nick @ Nite and TV Land. Now you have Antenna TV, MeTV, CoziTV and there might even be more channels that&#39;s just not coming to mind because I&#39;m not familiar with them. So if you&#39;ve got somebody younger that wants to watch something &quot;cleaner&quot;, they have stuff on those channels to choose from. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s provided they choose anything at all. I used to be somebody that watched a lot of tv when I was growing up. I still watch a few shows but it&#39;s no where near what I used to watch. It&#39;s gotten to the point where I prefer hearing music instead of background tv noise or I prefer silence. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t help thinking of your post compared to something I thought when I was younger. I was old enough to see the big reality show tv boom. I wrote it off and thought it&#39;d be a flash in the pan. I was wrong. People flock to this stuff like flies to shit. I&#39;d rather drill a hole in my head than watch the Kardashians, The Bachelor or any other reality tv show that&#39;s on. But that&#39;s my two cents. There&#39;s plenty enough people that will continue to watch, continue to make the shows a hit, etc. </p>

I&#39;ve abandoned those beliefs because they&#39;re not realistic. A jerk will continue to be a jerk. I have a lot of negative feelings for my younger self because I ALWAYS tried to be nice and respectful to people even if they treated me like garbage, snapped the olive branch into two pieces and threw it back in my face. People like that aren&#39;t worth the effort. I think of those people and would wager to bet they&#39;re even bigger assholes the older they get. Nothing&#39;s gonna change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response. I feel you on that. There&#39;s a lot of people that are beyond saving. But there&#39;s a lot of people residing in the middle.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that I get treated like garbage. I actually feel like people respect me. I&#39;m different in real life, not trying to talk myself up but I&#39;m outgoing and charismatic to a degree. I&#39;m also trying to start my own business, got many of my jockish friends into spiritually and will be traveling the United States surfing and snowboarding.</p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s hard to put that type of vibe out in text form and maybe I&#39;m not communicating properly in the responses above. Bottom line is to help others you need to help yourself. I want to continue to learn and continue to grow and one day I&#39;ll be able to influence my community on a wider scale.</p>

<p>You speak the truth, but I believe I can do something about it and I trust my path to lead me. The world is always changing and I am going to be one of the agents of change</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“The works of the contemporary historians of Baghdad in the early tenth century are still available. They deeply deplored the degeneracy of the times in which they lived, emphasising particularly the indifference to religion, the increasing materialism and the laxity of sexual morals. They lamented also the corruption of the officials of the government and the fact that politicians always seemed to amass large fortunes while they were in office. The historians commented bitterly on the extraordinary influence acquired by popular singers over young people, resulting in a decline in sexual morality. The ‘pop’ singers of Baghdad accompanied their erotic songs on the lute, an instrument resembling the modern guitar.</p>

<p>In the second half of the tenth century, as a result, much obscene sexual language came increasingly into use, such as would not have been tolerated in an earlier age. Several khalifs issued orders banning ‘pop’ singers from the capital, but within a few years they always returned.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I know I&#39;ll be labeled cynical for this one. It doesn&#39;t exist. I was a teenager that grew up watching &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; and longed for a kindred spirit, soulmate, my own &quot;Gilbert Blythe&quot;. I didn&#39;t really have healthy real relationships around me and I had to look to works of fiction to see something healthy. And at the same time, that&#39;s not healthy either. Fiction isn&#39;t real life. You can write the best characters that wouldn&#39;t be assholes to their &quot;soulmate&quot;, run around, abuse them in any way, etc. You don&#39;t get that same luxury in the real world. And truth be told, I&#39;m a misanthrope these days and there&#39;s just very few people I care to be around. I&#39;m secure being single and dying single. I&#39;m not running around and sleeping with every man I possible can get my hands on. I just have no interest any more. My main interest is just being done with this shit and hopefully I can cease to exist when I die.</p>

<p>All of this is coming from somebody that doesn&#39;t really keep up to date with current pop culture stuff. It&#39;s once in a blue moon I want to sit down and watch a new movie. I watch very few shows and what I do watch are mostly reruns of old stuff but you still have a few current stuff mixed in. I love music but also don&#39;t keep up to date with current stuff either. There&#39;s still older artists I enjoy putting out current stuff but honestly couldn&#39;t name 5 songs from musicians that are up to date. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I&#39;m sorry if I sound too rough on your friend. I have nothing against him being really into taking care of himself and his body. I see how that can be a common interest in somebody&#39;s he&#39;s looking for and it&#39;s an activity they can do together. So please don&#39;t think I&#39;m saying he needs to start looking for the overweight people to date. That&#39;s not gonna fly on either end and both parties will lose out. </p>

<p>You know what, I want to drop &quot;unattractive&quot; in all my posts to you. I can&#39;t help putting myself there and goodness knows I carry a lot of scars around from my youth. Unattractive people know they&#39;re unattractive and the paranoia would shoot up sky high if you&#39;ve got some good looking person acting interested in somebody that damn well knows they&#39;re out of this person&#39;s league. &quot;What&#39;s up with this? Is this a prank or a set up of some sort so I look like a fool?&quot; That sorta thing.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s just focus on plain people. They still have a lovely figure but have at least one or two features that might have people think they&#39;re a 6 or 7 instead of an 8 or 9. Maybe they have hair that looks and feels like straw because they dye it a lot or straighten it obsessively. Maybe they have a big nose. Stuff of that nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sexual morality ebbs and flows throughout history. Mid-Victorian era was a peak of sexual morality. It noticeably declined in the 1890&#39;s, known as the &quot;Mauve Decade&quot; and also the beginning of the Progressive Era. The other bookend of the Progressive Era is the Roaring 20s. And it&#39;s been speeding downhill ever since. Like a drug addict, society is going to have to hit rock bottom before it repairs itself.</p>

<p>As others have pointed out, there have been other eras of sexual degeneracy throughout history.</p>

<p>Although singles who value sexual purity are rare these days, they can be found online. Sometimes it&#39;s necessary to set the search radius to hundreds or thousands of miles. You just have to be clear about your intentions and goals. And probably be on something like catholicmatch.com (and be Catholic yourself).</p>

<p>The media of the time also reflected the wholesomeness of America, the heart of a vibrant and loving society. </p>

<p>It hid the rot.</p>

<p>Sure there were issues relevant to the times like racism, and whatnot, but watch any music video from the 90s VS one from today. Vibes are sooo different. It&#39;s hard to put words to it, but the energy signature is distinctly different. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>People of your parents&#39; generation felt the same way about media from the 90s.  Remember all the outcry about MTV?  You are comfortable with it because that is the media you grew up with and therefore your mind shaped into it.  Modern media is not comfortable to you because it doesn&#39;t fit the mold of your mind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What happened to the America that once was? Is it gone forever? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It never was.  What you feel is an astroturfed field of artificial perfection that was constructed for you to believe in.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is every aspect of popular culture so degenrate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because -- as we are now starting to see with the likes of Harvey Weinstein -- it is produced exclusively  by people who are either predators or prey.  Most are prey, crying their pain and trauma and heartbreak into every line of their music and thus passing the trauma on to the population.  A few are predators themselves.  We are saturated 24x7 with an unspoken maelstrom of fear, pain, and suffering.  It takes a toll on the national conscience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What happened to true love? Faith? Soulmates?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s out there but you won&#39;t find it in popular culture.  You have to turn off the TV and social media.  You must engage with the real world.  You must seek out extraordinary experiences that dissemble your mind, body, and soul until you learn what faith actually is and why we have it.  You must reject the false promises of this artificial world that is constructed, look between the cracks of your reality, and find the people living there, and walk with them.</p>

<p>Ya know what&#39;s funny?  People said something similar back in the late 80/90&#39;s - only it was about those with HIV/AIDS.  Ryan White was diagnosed with HIV at 13 years old and people ran him out of school and tried to run him out of town.  We NOW know how incredibly ignorant those people were.  But back then?  People were losing their shit about a boy with HIV being around their kids.</p>

<p>That&#39;s when I first became aware of how shitty morally righteous bandwagons are.</p>
