    <div class="md"><p>Is it though?  Does anyone <em>really</em> think there&#39;s going to be some kind of white genocide?  The white race is finally having to deal with what they have dished out for centuries and should quit their whining about genocide and persecution and let this pass.  If it doesn&#39;t pass and white people start getting killed for being white - then perhaps it&#39;s time to react, but at this point it appears those who keep bringing this up are just playing into a us-vs-them narrative.</p>

<p>Also, I feel like &quot;white genocide&quot; is this sub&#39;s Phrase of the Week or something. It&#39;s been coming up a lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, yeah, react when the genocide has <em>began</em> instead of acting now when it can be prevented... </p>

<p>Would you have said that to Holocaust victims?</p>

<p>And trust me, I’m not saying that white people are in danger of becoming the new victims of genocide. What I am saying, however, is that the time to react to violence isn’t when you see violence, it’s when you see the language and the politics driving this call for violence being normalized that you react. Why <em>not</em> stop it before it began? Why appease hateful groups when they are calling for violence? </p>

<p>Absolutely ridiculous. You can tell someone&#39;s race by their very DNA. A crime scene investigator can tell the race of a person just using a few bones. There are morphological differences that any artist has to take into account lest they just draw caucasians with different skin tones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve done that for far too long. People all lose their minds if the N word is used, we just laugh at being called cracker. Affirmative action is instituted and we laugh because we know we&#39;re skilled and trained. People call us racist for living in the world as it is and we just say &quot;umm yeah ok buddy, the sky is purple, you&#39;re right&quot;. </p>

<p>We are now in danger of losing everything that our forefathers fought and died to give us, all because we pretend like we don&#39;t care, or some people would trade their countries for good boy points, like Germany and Sweden, who are now minorities in their own countries within the breeding-age bracket, meaning that within a single generation, they will be an overall minority, in the lands they have lived in for literally thousands of years, and all because some usually-Jewish news network or one of their assorted propagandists says &quot;umm you&#39;re a racist if you don&#39;t give away your nation, you racist&quot;. Now that they&#39;ve succeeded in flooding our countries with invaders, they are fomenting violence and hatred into their hearts and are obviously gearing them up for an eventual otherthrow. These plans have been written about for generations, their trail is not even cold. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s even more interesting when you look into how the communists of the early and mid 20th century took control and used language to attack , stigmatise and marginalise certain groups, in the same way now we see this attack on whites and they will attack anyone who has any iota of patriotism or nationalism as being a racist or a nazi or sexist or homophobe. </p>

<p>I don’t believe they actually know what they are asking for or understand the implications of attacking white males. they’re playing a deadly game, and we have seen what happens when we go down this road and it is bloody as all hell. </p>

<p>There are plenty of countries that exist that are homogeneous of race, that in jeong case, like South Korea, would free her from the tyranny of white men. But they don’t want to go there. 
Similar to how white American men laid down their lives against the same tyranny they seem to desire, when the USA fought and saved South Korea from the commies.</p>

<p>Personally I’m Optimistic, the fact that trump is getting more popular, in all demographics shows that most sensible people don’t buy into this and it is the young and low IQ individuals who believe this stuff, being the white supremacy and patriarchy control everything. It’s surprising how switch on tje working class is, they can spot a phony.</p>

<p>A lot of opinions have come out that Jeong shouldn’t be fired, I am not of that opinion, I think there should be consistency and if we changed any of the tweets she made from white to black to Jew or Asian, the outcome would certainly see her unemployed. Similar to Roseanne and James Gunn. Jeong not being fired emboldens the racist left, and they are racists. They believe that all races are inferior to whites, that is why whites are able to be attacked so openly. </p>

<p>What will happen? The mainstream media will need to change its cultural bias if it wants to survive eventually. We will see more and more attacks on whites. Any organisation that caters to this racist minority will see the result in their bottom line. That is the reason they behaving like this, they think the click bait anti white, anti male, everyone is racist articles will keep working, but like anything it will get old, it’s only been a few years since this culture war began. It’s just making people money at the moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao don’t know why you got downvoted when that’s 100% truth</p>

<p>Everyone said he’d lose in 2016 and that his candidacy was a joke — as soon as he was the president-elect, they promised they’d have him impeached as soon as possible. As November nears closer, Democrats are vowing that the Trump and his affiliated will “never again” see the success they did two years ago. </p>

<p>Why would anyone believe the mainstream news narrative when it has been directly contradicting the reality of the situation since Trump announced his candidacy? Likely even before then, when Obama was the supposed president “without scandals.” </p>

<p>It <em>is</em> all fake news. The actual, explicit yet hidden in plain sight, fake news. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And we’re going to pretend that the constitution wasn’t amended to specifically make slavery unconstitutional after the bloodiest war in American history? </p>

<p>Men and women, of all colors and nationalities, fought for slavery to be illegal and unconstitutional. Hundreds of thousands of them fought for the rights of our fellow African-American citizens and for other enslaved minorities. Blood was shed to outlaw slavery. <em>Gallons</em> of blood was shed. And we’re going to act like that doesn’t matter?</p>

<p>100 years after 1776, there was no slavery in the U.S. Why can’t we take a minute to love our country for abolishing such an evil trade within 100 years of our founding? That’s real progress. </p>

<p>Even thinking about it makes me love America more. How much this country has fought for and how far we’ve gotten in such little time is truly a miracle. God bless. </p>

<p>&quot;<a href="http://necrometrics.com/warsusa.htm">Although more American died in the Civil War, more Americans were killed in WW2. It&#39;s a pedantic technicality perhaps, but the Civil War was America&#39;s deadliest war, World War II its bloodiest.</a>&quot;</p>

<p>However, that is neither here nor there. None of what you just said changes the fact that the 13th Amendment provisionally allows slavery. There is, in fact, nothing you can say to change that. </p>

<p>You just finished arguing about how many bodies had to drop to make that happen. Real progress that required droves of people to be put in pine boxes because they were willing to fight to the death not to allow it to happen. </p>

<p>Beyond that, I see no reason to celebrate your arbitrary number (100) when slavery was already over 250 years old on this soil by that point in time. Why use 1776? Because that was the day we were free from the British? We who exactly? Just which men were created equal in the declaration of independence? </p>

<p>I&#39;m just so so proud of you. You stopped beating your wife to within an inch of her life. That&#39;s real progress. Now you just beat her black and blue once in a blue moon. True growth. Namaste my friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The narrative of &quot;Africans selling their own&quot; into slavery. It&#39;s largely false. There are a few exceptions, such as Queen Nzinga letting some of the citizens of her kingdom be enslaved rather than have them all face immediate destruction in war. Largely, slaving expeditions foraged into central africa, away from the gold coast where they had all of their long-standing trading relationships (a wonder more slaves weren&#39;t Nigerian), and went slaving and pillaging and burning villages to the ground (with those not selected to be abducted either already dead or still there). </p>

<p>Asian Americans are at 17% (lowest of any demo) and have the highest median family income of any demo.</p>

<p>Asians aren’t smarter or more prone to success, they’re just more likely to come from stable home environments with a strong support network. This increases the likelihood for success, economic or otherwise.</p>

<p>But we’re not allowed to discuss sociological aspects of any demographic when considering reasons for economic disparity. Instead it’s “institutional racism”. Don Lemon broke out the 73% statistic on CNN and was lambasted for it.</p>

<p>We should focus on strengthening black communities instead of just crying “institutional racism!!”, which basically does nothing to help anyone, it just gives people a scapegoat and a victimhood complex.</p>

<p>I’m 100% in on community initiatives, affordable housing, and criminal reform that lets more young black men have a chance at staying with their families, etc.</p>

<p>But bitching about institutional racism and levying all the ills of the world at white men (and white female Republicans) is not going to do a damn thing for anyone besides let them be a victim in their own life instead of having any sense of personal agency.</p>

<p>I’m merely of the opinion that the problem is more of a socioeconomic one than a “white people keep holding everyone down” one.</p>

<p>Asian Americans have higher median family income than whites. If the system is rigged to filter whites to the top, how is that the case?</p>

<p>Poverty rates and median family income are in lockstep with single parent home rates by demographic. That’s socioeconomic, that’s not solely the fault of “institutional racism”.</p>

<p>And I’m not even saying there’s not societal constructs that impact those statistics, there are. But let’s address those constructs specifically instead of just bullshitting about how you can’t win if your not white.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty interesting. You want criminal reform (because evidence shows discrimination there) but don&#39;t wsnt to discuss the work force (because evidence also shows discrimination there) or education  (because evidence shows discrimination there as well). </p>

<p>Asian Americans stay at the top of the pile for a few reasons. One is Chinese school (also known as Saturday school). Another is tiger moms (also known as &quot;achievement syndrome&quot;). Another is a propensity for ethnic insularity  (also behind the success of other nth generation immigrant communities, the jewish, and the mormons). They are also (big surprise here) largely permitted to assimilate (which opens additional oppoetllrtunities, hello <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/47949/">country club</a>). </p>

<p>Need I say more? Need I also discuss the radical anti-white sentiments in revolutionary Asian Americans? Need I discuss the disgust many have for &quot;hapas&quot;?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here for any explanations relying on the fundamental attribution error. If your argument is anything like &quot;make better choices&quot;, then we have nothing further to discuss. Can&#39;t reason people out of positions they were never reasoned into to begin with. </p>

<p>Which is great. Now either take the causality chain a step backward and say why that is. And, as I indicated in the previous comment, if your answer even so much as hints at the fundamental attribution error, we need not type another word to one another. </p>

<p>And I am clearly, unambiguously, stating that that is a structural issue and that if you insert the fundamental attribution error here, the conversation terminates. </p>

<p>No one has ever said that was the case, the expectation or the plan. You should probably read Freire fi you want to know what the actual plan is. </p>

<p>So sad that we have to accept systematic forces keeping this in play. So sad. So sad that our hands are entirely tied and nothing can be done about these large systems, policies and procedures that keep this horrible thing alive. So sad. Hear my lament. Am I not morose? /s</p>

<p>Just like Greenwood. </p>

<p>You know what&#39;s really great at breaking up strong black neighborhoods? Model minorities and gentrification.

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t know what it is you’re so certain I’m going to say, and I really don’t care.</p>

<p>I get it, you like using the fundamental attribution error. I’m not solely attributing the lack of success to only the single parent stat, I’ve absolutely acknowledged discrimination exists and I’ve stated we should implement reforms as well to work on correcting this institutional racism. I’m stating a more immediate and impactful fix would be to start from within those communities. I’m not saying to not do anything and let AAs fix all their problems on their own, but if you honestly think that the rate is 25% higher than Hispanics and it is due solely to external, systemic oppression then good luck. And single parent rates absolutely drive lack of economic success.</p>

<p>Also, Freire notes the oppressed must play a part in their own liberation by continually examining themselves, is that right? I mean how is postulating that African Americans should focus on cultivating complete family units and stronger communities so that they have a support network and can have the importance of <em>education</em> reinforced not in line with what Freire’s plan is?</p>

<p>Respond whatever you want I’m done, you disagree and you don’t care what I think because you’re convinced I couldn’t be more wrong, so yeah you’re right this is a pointless exchange.</p>

<p>Google isn&#39;t going to help you on this one. Read the book. Then we can have a discussion on it.

<p>But let&#39;s compare apples to apples. I can only speak for myself, but the biggest thing I notice in both statements, the players unequivocally apologize for their offensive words. The tone is contrite and full of remorse.</p>

<p>In the NYT statement, the Times claims the tweets were a reaction to online vitriol. Sarah says they were taken out of context, and the closest thing to an apology is that she regrets it. Reading it I feel like they are shifting blame away from her and claiming to be a victim.</p>

<p>I believe if she had come out with a message like the baseball players, I would still be upset, but I wouldn&#39;t be upset enough to call for her job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are completely opposite reactions so thanks for proving my point. The baseball teams never made excuses for the comments made by the players. In the case of Jeong, the New York Times DID make excuses and rationalized a reason for her making them in an attempt to absolve her of any responsibility. The New York Times also framed Jeong as the real victim. The MLB teams never tried to frame the players in question as the real victims.</p>

<p>The MLB players all apologized directly, Jeong has not directly apologized.</p>

<p>Other MLB players and teams did not come to the defense of the players you mentioned. Many in the media have come to publicly defend not only Jeong, but her statements as well. A Senator has even come out in support of Jeong and her statements. Have you seen Senators supporting Tweets from the MLB players?</p>

<p>These are obviously not comparable cases at all if we are talking about the reaction to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t understand but what I conclude from all this is that white people are at fault for every problem in the world since they are the creators of modern society or something like that. Therefore it&#39;s open season on the &quot;oppressors&quot;. I am white and I Promise you I have never oppressed anyone nor did my ancestors. It&#39;s a miscalculated and just plain insanity if you ask me. people are complaining and telling, teaching people that it&#39;s not okay to generalize about a group of people (which is a good message obviously) but for some reason you can generalize about &quot;white people&quot; all you want. There are so many different types of white people from class, gender, religion, beliefs, etc and I think this toxic way of thinking has unfortunately seeped into simple thinkers minds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in a predominantly white town and lately people have been moving here (white people) and complaining that this town is too &quot;white&quot; and that it&#39;s not diverse enough. I hear this a LOT since I am in the transportation industry so i drive people around all night. is this okay? it makes me really mad that someone is mad at the fact that there are too many whites around and I just tried to think how crazy it would be if I moved into a predominantly black neighborhood and I said &quot;it&#39;s nice here but there are just way too many black people, it&#39;s not diverse enough&quot;. that shit wouldn&#39;t fly and I would get my ass kicked. I just can&#39;t understand why it&#39;s okay to attack white people. Human history is filled with rulers stemming from all sorts of backgrounds, religions and races. there have been many different types of oppressors and it just shows that humanity is flawed and that we should be angry at ourselves and fix our mistakes. But when we start blaming one race for all the problems of the world...things just might get a little crazy. </p>

<p>When people like you move to predominantly black areas, it&#39;s usually to gentrify... which accomplishes the exact same thing as making those statements, except it uses the police and pricing strategies to make the &quot;diversity&quot; a reality instead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I know I will be downvoted because that makes some of you feel better about yourselves. I am just throwing this out here, I know most of you do not believe in God but be openminded and consider this is the reason.</p>

<p>Genesis 15:12 (KJV) And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.</p>

<p>13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety <strong>that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years</strong>;</p>

<p>14 And also <strong>that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge</strong>: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.</p>

<p>I also know that must have you don&#39;t think everyone in the old testament is black. But consider what God told Moses.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 28:68 (KJV) And the Lord <strong>shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships</strong>, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and <strong>there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen,</strong> and no man shall buy you.</p>

<p>I know it sucks to get punished for something your ancestors did. We are paying for our ancestors sins too, it fucking sucks. Really wish I could help, but there is nothing we can do. It will get worse and worse for us.</p>
