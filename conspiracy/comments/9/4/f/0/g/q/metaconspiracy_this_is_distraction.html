The Jeong hoopla gets a ‘head start’ so that tempers can really rise in response to the most comically tone-deaf response from the NYT. </p>

<p>So comically tone-deaf, in fact, that all the attention and all the anger is conveniently directed to it, and not the farcical “acted alone, no evidence of conspiracy, no motive determined, (but no you still can’t watch video footage of the lobby sorry)” conclusion to the worst mass shooting in the history of the United States. </p>

<p>The mockingbird media can sway opinion in ways other than just telling you outright what you should think.</p>

<p>This distraction is far easier to pull off than a school shooting/false flag. </p>

<p>Finally, BLM will be teaching about fighting racism and fascism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree because bringing attention to anti white racism in western society begins to make people question why. If anything a shooting like Las Vegas is a distraction. The consequences of a single shooting, verses the consequences of the end result of the kind of racial hatred+demographic replacement and its origins being found out are far more reaching to the established order. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That rests on the premise that they remain in control of the narrative, instead of chaotically stumbling in reaction to the ever-increasing stream of evidence of corruption, propaganda, and despairing extent of the shadow government’s control, by recklessly firing off preloaded counter-op viral sensations intended to divide and distract the public its supposed to serve. </p>

<p>I believe it’s the latter. Their short term gain will be or long term gain; desperation is a sign of weakness. </p>

At first I didn&#39;t think much of it, but then I realized every Friday was always a slow news day.  I could skip Fridays episode and come Monday I wouldn&#39;t have missed anything important.  If the media isn&#39;t going to take Friday news seriously then people aren&#39;t either.  I&#39;m glad I came to my senses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just took this pill so I feel ghe need to take aome time to introspect and regain my objective conciousness before discussing Q further. Read this post. What J can tell you is &quot;white hats&quot; are selected and do exist. However these are not the type of people who would claim a title of the people&#39;s &quot;champion&quot; as this isaac guy does during 30 minute videos. </p>

<p>The interview he did with the texas news outlet was a revision of the last 70+ minutes of pedophelic babble. To sit there and visualize the stories he iderates over and over IS the decensitazion that the white hats have been trying to warn the masses about. The most dangerous thimg about doing independant research is avoiding pitfalls of reprogramming. As a seeker for as long as I&#39;ve had internet, J can assure you that you have been to the rodeo a few more times than you can remember. It&#39;s important to note that there is silver lining to everything, in the interview Alex Jones touches lightly kn the fact that Seth Green is the creator of robot chicken, a popular show on youth television when 90&#39;s kids were just old enough to have their own tv in their room. the show consisted of multiple short skits, quick jumps with an emphasis on a <em>pop</em> in the writing over any development in the literary term. At the time, internet .gifs often were influenced from this formula, and in turn, memes. (45 second clip with sound, 3-7 second clip with sound, image with 4-10 words) the idea of pushing a narrative while offering less and less actual information to take in has value worth pondering. <em>especially</em> with the gaslighting being directed at the essential creator of <em>how we perceive and absorb information today</em>
Another precedent television program that faded the border between satire and propoghanda was notoriously MADtv. They we not only renown for their satire in the form of television skits, but for their magazine too. Note, that is in a time before internet was consumer friendly, both in terms of economic accessability and intellectual accessability. </p>

<p>I hope this presented an idea worth pondering beyond the initial thought of thrashing in water so you can drown whoever swims out to &quot;save you&quot;</p>
