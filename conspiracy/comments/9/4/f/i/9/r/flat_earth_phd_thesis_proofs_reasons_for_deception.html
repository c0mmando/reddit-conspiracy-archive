<p>The <strong>Flat Earth</strong> model is an archaic conception of Earth&#39;s Shape as a plane or disk. Many ancient cultures subscribed to a flat Earth cosmography, including Greece until the classical period, the Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations of the Near East until the Hellenistic period, India until the Gupta period (early centuries AD), and China until the 17th century.</p>

<p>The idea of a spherical Earth appeared in Greek philosophy with Pythagoras (6th century BC), although most pre-Socratics (6th–5th century BC) retained the flat Earth model. Aristotle provided evidence for the spherical shape of the Earth on empirical grounds by around 330 BC. Knowledge of the spherical Earth gradually began to spread beyond the Hellenistic world from then on.</p>

<p>In the modern era, pseudoscientific flat Earth theories have been espoused by modern flat Earth societies and, increasingly, by unaffiliated individuals using social media.</p>

<h1>Tunisian PhD student, after 5 yrs of work, submitted a thesis declaring Earth to be flat, unmoving, young &amp; the center of the universe.</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>University of Sfax  </p>

<p>PhD Student: Kharroubi Amira  </p>

<p>Professor: Touir Jamel  </p>

<p>“The Earth is flat and young, and it stands immobile at the centre of the universe, which is made of only one galaxy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A huge scandal rocked the Tunisian and Arab scientific and educational world: a <strong>PhD</strong> student submitted a thesis declaring Earth to be Flat.</p>

<p>A young female researcher at The University of Sfax, in Sakkiet Ezzit, Tunisia, working under the wing of Jamal Touir, a lecturer at The Faculty of Sciences Sfax, and former deputy at the National Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p>The student explicitly rejected the physics of Newton and Einstein, the astronomy of Copernicus and Kepler, the cosmology of the Big Bang, the main models of atmospheric and geological activity, and most of modern climatology.</p>

<p>The “<strong>results</strong>” of this PhD thesis include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Earth is flat &amp; young (only 13,500 years of age)</li>
<li>Earth stands immobile at the center of the universe</li>
<li>which is made of only one galaxy</li>
<li>the Sun’s diameter is 1,135km (not 1.4 million km)</li>
<li>the Moon is 908 km wide</li>
<li>and the Sun is 687 times &amp; the Moon is 23 times closer to Earth</li>
<li>there are 11 planets</li>
<li>stars are “limited” in number and have a diameter of 292 km (not millions of km)</li>
<li>the distance to the stars as 7,000 Km (4,349 Mi)</li>
<li>Speed of Light is 143,109 Km/s, 88,923 Mi/s, or 320,125,715 MPH</li>
</ol>

<p>The student submitted her thesis after <strong>5 years of work</strong>; it was then sent to 2 assessors, passing the first stage of approvals.</p>

<p>It was at this stage it was “<strong>leaked</strong>” to the former president of the Tunisian Astronomical Association, who checked that it was not a hoax &amp; then posted the general conclusions on Facebook for the purposes of condemning &amp; persecuting it before the final Thesis was submitted.</p>

<p>After sustaining serious blow-back, <strong>Professor Jamel Touir</strong> stood by his student defending both of their constitutional rights to &#39;<strong>freedom of thought</strong>&#39; and &#39;<strong>academic freedom</strong>&#39;. Professor Touir also notes that for this constitutional exercise he is now &quot;<strong>the object of a malicious campaign, damaging his reputation and his scientific skills.</strong>&quot;</p>

<h1>On April 21st, 2017, Huffington Post&#39;s Italian Branch reported that Professor Touir said:</h1>

<h1>&quot;the student had been encouraged by some American researchers who have sent the NASA publications.&quot;</h1>

<p>While the full PhD Thesis paper is unavailable for examination, here&#39;s some details from the &quot;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160925142646/http://www.theijst.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/9.-ST1608-011.pdf">The Geocentric Model of the Earth: Physics and Astronomy Arguments</a>&quot; (THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLEDGE).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract:  </p>

<p>Several astronomical observations have shown the presence of numerous failings in heliocentric model such as Mercury retrograde motion, cosmic rays and Perseids meteors. Numerous researchers are talking about these topics. Because there is no empirical evidence that the Earth actually orbits the sun, astronomy observations/ geophysics arguments provide proofs for the steady Earth and the Sun’s motion. The main contention of the paper is to demonstrate the flaws in gravity and relativity, and to disprove the alleged motions of the earth that for so long time has been unjustifiably taught. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conclusion  </p>

<p>In conclusion, various physics arguments and astronomy observations show the stability of the Earth in the universe and the sun, the moon, the stars and the planets motion around it. Then the heliocentric model must to be rejected. On the contrary, the revision of the geocentric model will be necessary. Consequently, the Sun revolves around Earth daily in 23h 56min 4.1Second from East to West. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ms. Rivas</strong> reason for the thesis:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Even today in America (and to us) there are those who doubt that Neil Armstrong has done a really small step for man and one giant leap for mankind landing on the moon...&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Professor Jamel Touir</strong>, who amidst heavy academic volatility, supports his student:</p>

<ul>
<li>defends himself by recalling that the Constitution guarantees freedom of thought and academic freedom</li>
<li>claims he is &quot;the object of a malicious campaign, damaging his reputation and his scientific skills.&quot; ​</li>
</ul>

<p>Some questions to think about: </p>

<ol>
<li>Why all the &#39;<strong>freaking out</strong>&#39; over a rough draft PhD Thesis?</li>
<li>Why was the thesis &quot;leaked&quot; to a former president of the Tunisian Astronomical Association? </li>
<li>Why is the Tunisian Secretary of State &amp; Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research wasting their time debunking this rough draft? </li>
<li>Why all the activity &amp; quotations from a PhD Thesis that is nowhere to be found?</li>
</ol>

<p>Here&#39;s one clue: <strong>Chokri Mamoghli</strong>, appointed <strong>Secretary of State for Foreign Trade</strong> back in 2008, who now works as an <strong>Academic Specialist in Management</strong> at The University of Sfax, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s unacceptable, it&#39;s inadmissible... The ignominy is reflected on the entire research community, on the Tunisian University, on the credibility of our diplomas, on the recruitment opportunities of our young people in foreign laboratories and even on the country.&quot; </p>

<li>Some celebrities have stated their belief in the Flat Earth Model such as: Shaquille O’Neal, Kyrie Irving, Wilson Chandler, Draymond Green, &amp; Rapper BoB etc.</li>
<li>The Earth curved in NASA photos – but not in amateur ones.</li>
<li>Engineers make everything straight, not curved.</li>
<li>Planes don’t have to fly downward.</li>
<li>Planes never fly over the North &amp; South Poles -- often taking an seemingly inefficient long ways.</li>
<li>It should be much more difficult for planes to fly East due to Earth&#39;s rotation.</li>
<li>Flying a kite proves that the Earth is at rest.</li>
<li>There are other models like &quot;The nORB Theory&quot;</li>

<h1>POSSIBLE REASONS for DECEPTION</h1>

<ol>
<li>The Scientific Community &amp; Government are receiving massive amounts of taxes &amp; funding for Scientific Projects &amp; Employment. If the Earth was Flat, funding would be cut drastically. It is speculated that most of the money is used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_budget">Black Budgets</a>.</li>
<li>SATAN &amp; his followers are deceiving the world, so they can defeat GOD before Judgement Day. The less people that believe in GOD, the less his powers on Earth.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Let me know if there are any other compelling Conspiracy Theories &amp; possible reasons for deception about Flat Earth that should be on this list. I will continuously add to these lists based on the most compelling comments.</h1>

And I would love to see someone bring this idea mainstream I don’t know if the earth is flat or round but the Bible seems to indicate aspects that coincide with flat earth. There is a series of video on you tube by the common man bible Institute that cover exactly what scriptures there are that address this and it is a great resource for anyone who wants to understand the biblical side of flat earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could we possibly colonize another planet? Sure. But even if we had a coordinated world-wide effort, with trillions of dollars being used to fund it, the best we could hope would be creating a small artificial environment enclosure on Mars that would allow a small number of humans to live on that planet. Barring incredible technological advancements, mass colonizing another planet is would take many generations.</p>

<p>Other planets that have more hospitable environments are so incredibly far away that current technology couldn&#39;t even get humans to those planets in a lifetime.</p>

<p>If we don&#39;t do something about the massive amount of environmental pollution and destruction, including but not limited to global climate change, humanity as we know it would not survive long enough to see steady extraterrestrial colonization come to fruition. It would be much cheaper, easier, and more realistic to try and remedy our planet than shoot for the possible but currently highly improbable pipe-dream of colonizing another planet to save our species existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mark Lehner, an American archaeologist with more than 30 years of experience excavating in Egypt, set up an experiment to see if it was possible to quarry, move and lift an obelisk weighing 1/10 of what the largest Egyptian obelisks weighed. It was filmed by NOVA and was an utter failure.</p>

<p>The team&#39;s master stonemason could not quarry the 35-ton obelisk so a bulldozer was called in. They could not move it, a truck was called in. These failures represent a turning point in the long-standing debate.</p>

<p>Lehner actually confirmed what a Japanese team funded by Nissan had already learned in 1979, it is not possible to duplicate what the ancients did using primitive tools and methods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a lot of reports they list the assumptions so they do not add in any unnecessary complexity such as &quot;air density is constant&quot; or &quot;airframe is a rigid body&quot;. Both id these are untrue but for the purposes of the report they use the assumptions because airdensity variation would be so little when landing and a plane would act very close to a rigid body. Same with assuming that the Earth is flat with no rotation. Its assumed to be its less complex state for ease of calculation due to the added complexity that would come with it.  I took these from the &quot;Investigation of Aircraft Landing in Variable Wind Fields&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing. You raise a good point about engineers designing aircraft for Flat Earth opposed to one that&#39;s in motion:</p>

<p>Earth Rotates 1000 MPH (1 Direction)</p>

<p>To make one complete rotation in 24 hours, a point near the equator of the Earth must move at close to 1000 miles per hour (1600 km/hr). The speed gets less as you move north, but it&#39;s still a good clip throughout the United States.</p>

<p>Earth Orbit 67,000 MPH (1 Direction)</p>

<p>Our orbital speed around the sun is about 67,000 mph (<strong>107,000 km/h</strong>), according to Cornell. We can calculate that with basic geometry. First, we have to figure out how far Earth travels. Earth takes about 365 days to orbit the sun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not able to go over the entire thing right now but I can easily answer the nice bullet points you made.
1) Faked moon landing does not mean flat earth
2) Appeal to authority
3) Amateurs are not at the height the nasa photos are taken
4) Th curve over 1 linear mile is about 1 inch. Which is negligible in a building (I can show the math for this if you want but I&#39;m on moble right now)
5) Gravity is always going to the center of the earth but even if they did have to correct, the difference is so minisucle even less than the  number above. Planes aren&#39;t that accurate about altitude.
6) there are routes that go over the north pole but there are none over the south because it is out of the way of pretty much every flight.
7) The air moves with the earths rotation so planes do not have to fight the rotation. Satellites do because they leave the atmosphere. That is why almost all satellites go with the rotation.
8) Can you explain this one a bit more?
9/10) There are many craft in high earth, moon and Mars orbit. We  even have a craft that left the heliosphere.
11) Could be an ironic name</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m gonna need to see the math on this one. 1 inch per mile? That doesn&#39;t seem to fit a curve. You seem to be giving a formula for a slope. Slope = rise over run. 1 inch drop per mile is a slope, not a curve.</p>

<p>I read it was approximately 8 inches per mile squared. 8 inches of drop after the first mile. 32 inches for the second mile and so on. Though I have heard that there are some inaccuracies in the 8 inches per mile squared formula, it&#39;s definitely not 1 inch per mile, which I said before, describes a slope.</p>

<p>We present the first application in geodynamicsof a (Fast Multipole) Accelerated Boundary ElementMethod (Accelerated-BEM) for Stokes flow. The approachoffers the advantages of a reduced number of computa-tional elements and linear scaling with the problem size.We show that this numerical method can be fruitfullyapplied for the simulation of several geodynamic systemsat the planetary scale in spherical coordinates, and wesuggest a general approach for modeling combined mantleconvection and plate tectonics. The first part of the paperis devoted to the technical exposition of the new approach,while the second part focuses on the effect playedby Earth curvature on the subduction of a very wideoceanic lithosphere (W = 6,000 km and W = 9,000 km),comparing the effects of two different planetary radii(ER = 6,371 km, 2ER = 2 9 6,371 km), correspondingto an ‘‘Earth-like’’ model (ER) and to a ‘‘flat Earth’’ one(2ER). The results show a distinct difference between thetwo models: while the slab on a ‘‘flat Earth’’ shows a slightundulation, the same subducting plate on the ‘‘Earth-like’’setting presents a dual behavior characterized by concavecurvature at the edges and by a folding with wavelength ofthe order of magnitude of 1,000 km at the center of theslab.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great responses. However #6 is not a real objection, because the flat earth map with the north pole at the center does allow for flight over it. It&#39;s just the south ice wall or whatever (or security measures) preventing flights. Then again, what you&#39;re responding to isn&#39;t that strong either because Antarctica is inconvenient as fuck in both models.

<p>It&#39;s not.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>People will debate anything. Especially when they have no means of disputing the standard viewpoint.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why not simply set up a Moon Base &amp; take some indisputable photos &amp; videos of the Earth from there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Extraordinary costs associated with doing that, little profit to be gained in exchange. No profit means no nation is going to bother with the immense effort. There would also be international concerns with a nation setting up a moon base due to potential space based weaponry. Any photos and videos would still be called fake by flat earth people anyway.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Helium 4 is not some magic fuel that is going to advance technology by decades to centuries to somehow make Mars hospitable to human life(or any life for that matter). No other planets in our solar system have the potential for colonization like Mars, which really doesn&#39;t have much potential in any time-frame reasonable to our lifespan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kek, the Black Knight satellite is a fun one.</p>

<p>As far as flat earth goes though, it&#39;s laughably debunked via real world experience and easily disproved.  It&#39;s the Bud Light of conspiracies.  I don&#39;t know who Chris Van Matre is and I don&#39;t care about &#39;supposed&#39; professional surveyors because I know many real ones.  I also know my profession.</p>

<p>There is a reason why we have many map projections.  From equal area, to conic to cylindrical.  If the earth was flat none of those projections would work to sub-meter accuracy (given your equipment).  We wouldn&#39;t need projections because everything could be accurately resolved with a simple x/y axis.  That is not the case in the real world.</p>

<p>The fact that map distortion is a thing proves this.  Record a known point (or 50, it doesn&#39;t matter) in California and then go to Alaska and try and find a corresponding known point using an x/y grid (if the earth is flat that&#39;s all you would need) and report back to me.  Or you could take a little time to learn why datums and projections are necessary for navigation.  It would save you a lot of time and money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why wouldn&#39;t you just work with Globe Maps rather than Flat Maps?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need a projection to translate the surface of a sphere/spheroid-shaped object onto a flat surface accurately (cell phone screen, paper, etc).  These calculations are happening behind the scenes anytime you use google earth or similar apps.  You just don&#39;t see it because what would be the point in that?  All you want to know is how to get from here to there.  You can demonstrate this with an orange.  Carefully peel the orange and lay the peel out  flat.  What happens?  You suddenly have lots of empty space where there is no orange peel.  That is basically map distortion.</p>

Why do you need to make an entirely flat rendering?

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s science so...math is pretty important.  You are approaching it as an x/y grid when it is actually an x/y/z  on a curved surface.  The greater the distance the greater the curvature.  So on large scale maps like 1 inch=1200 feet (1:1200) it doesn&#39;t make a ton of difference but at a smaller scale (1:250,000) it makes a huge difference.</p>

You are clearly wrong and it is evident to me now, along with everyone else reading this thread, how personally vested and desperate you are you are in promoting this idiocy. Muh Climate Science! Whatever man.  I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that you have a financial stake in the flat earth theory at this point.

    <div class="md"><p>OK, we humans have reached full knowledge in science of everything already. There&#39;s no need to learn or innovate anymore. LOL ;p</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the conclusion of the PhD Thesis:</p>

<p>&quot;In conclusion, various physics arguments and astronomy observations show the stability of the Earth in the universe and the sun, the moon, the stars and the planets motion around it. Then the heliocentric model must to be rejected. On the contrary, the revision of the geocentric model will be necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the heliocentric model should be rejected as stated, until a better model is produced. However, it does raise a good point that alternatives can be calculated.</p>

I wish I could get my hands on that thesis to review for myself but it&#39;s not made available in entirety.

Anyway, NASA already stated they will have a Moon Base by 2022. That will put everything to rest at that point. If they don&#39;t, then they&#39;re just leading everyone on as usual collecting the big bucks for nothing.</p>

<p>He talks about perspectives &amp; differences between visible &amp; tangible.</p>

<p>Flat Earthers see a Flat World with Spherical Eyes.</p>

<p>Globers see a Spherical World with Flat Eyes.</p>

<p>Basically, the 3D Globe &amp; 2D Sphere geometry differences have been confused or intentionally used for deception.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s a useless super power. You can see light from a satellite moving in the sky at night with the naked eye.

<p>The science icons being Royal Society peer backpatters, or secret wizards, or Freemasons with powerful pals. it doesn&#39;t make their ideas true or false.
