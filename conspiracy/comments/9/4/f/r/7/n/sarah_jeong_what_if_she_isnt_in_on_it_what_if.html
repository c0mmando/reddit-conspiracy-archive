       So I was one of the first people to post the Jeong story here on /Conspiracy and since that time I forced myself to listen to several YouTube videos of Jeong speaking at various events. (Yes I always listen to what people have to say even if I perceive them as awful)
      </p>
      <p>
       What did I learn about Jeong that isn't about her Twitter habits?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well for one she seems to be pretty damn smart, she knows her technology and law.  But here was a surprise for me, she doesn't think Russia significantly influenced the election, she doesn't think Russian Twitter bots matter and she acknowledges that both sides are involved is publishing false stories for the immediate effect knowing full well that the effect can't be taken back a few days later when the story is debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can racist people have good ideas?  Apparently in Jeong's case yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still don't like her but I can forgive her.  Fuck if I care if the NYTIMES cahses in what's left of their credibility to compete with BuzzFeed in clickbait throughput.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this made me realize something.  I can forgive her so maybe she can forgive  me for being born the color I am.  Maybe she can grow up and no longer be a racist.  And even if she doesn't do that I still win because she is redpilling people far more efficiently than I can.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fucking love this timeline!

       This is a pretty awesome attitude to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racists, racialists -  whatever - aren't going to see the light of the only response is outrage and punishment. If she gets fired from NYT she's only going to hate white people more. Seems the solution has been to shut people up rather than changing their minds. a temp solution that creates a pressure cooker.

       It's two fold.
      </p>
      <p>
       For one if we shout at racist and get them fired then it's kind of a light version of vigilante justice.  The heavy version is killing someone accused of rape without due process, something like that.  My point is that innocent people will be caught in the crossfire and we may never even realize they were innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly and equally, what you said.  How does it even fix anything?  Won't they just keep on being racist?  Maybe if we shout forgiveness at them they won't feel emboldened to continue being racist and as a bonus if we are wrong about them  they will actually get a chance to defend themselves.

       Disclaimer: I'm not defending Jeong's comments on Twitter.  I think her mind is poisoned with some extremist ideology, something akin to this intersectional identity politics or post modernism.  I think we should stop letting the ruling class command us like a mob to destroy people at the slightest provocation.  We should heal each other, EVERYONE.  Nazis, communist, Democrats and republicans alike.  I'm not saying that healing a Democrat requires they give up any of their beliefs, just that they give up their hatred of others.  Same for republicans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously Nazis and communists (and other failed ideologies like theocrats) are more complicated because a lot of the foundation of those ideologies IS hate.  But we can figure this thing out without a bloodbath.  We can give Nazis space to sulk until they see how much better we have it, we can give communists space to sulk until they see how much better we have it.

       It doesn’t matter how much money or power you give some people, if you make them feel like they don’t belong they lash out. I guess the only difference between her and an anon would be that she has the balls to put her face to her jokes.

       People lose their jobs all the time whenever their private internet lives is thrown into reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       It happens all the time in this country. It's the reason people should take responsibility for their words and actions online. Don't put up stuff you're unwilling to say in public and it won't be an issue.

       This comes in the wake of the Guardians of the Galaxy director's apples to apples tweet drama ruining his career.

       To devalue the threat of tainted information... So like devaluing the voice of a certain demographic that speaks up when they see oppression taking place/potentially taking place in the future? This isnt your local news paper that's owned by your local tycoon- this is the new york times. To downplay this is just as foolish as saying white people today are the cause for white people yesterday.

       I just think a national movement to heal Sarah Jeong would be useful than being angry about something we have known exists for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       When some white guy gets caught being racist the left just attacks him forever, isn't this a chance to prove you are better than that?  A chance to prove that you can love your enemy as if they are your neighbor?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no requirement to deny or downplay that she is racist and mentally unwell.  But there is an opportunity to not behave like they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your choice, you can immitate your enemy just like Sarah Jeong claimed in her excuse or you can actually be better than that and change the narrative to your favor.

       when someone says something I dont like, I disregard them, why? because theee are only 24 hours in a day and my time is valuable. It isnt a mattet of how racist she is, its a matter of how she will use her time to push which narrative iver another that she feels is potentially more important. Every successful person has two agendas. As a parent and a working person I'm sure you undersrand the importance of prioritizing what you want right now in relation to how to get what you want in the future.

       I dont think you understand at all, I am not amgry about her, I have no feelings towards her. My persoective remains objective, and unbiased- looking at what exists and making an educated conclusion based on other similar instances throughout history, I am presenting an advocation for an analytical side that does not require you to be a victim to see. I want people who experience my time cube to make informed decisions on how to avoid victimization, not how to deal with becoming a victim.

       The question this raises is what is a subjective editor going to do with objective information? Considering I feel we can both agree neither of us want to see a coup

       I don't think there will be any significant resistance.  There will be some extremist with no hope left if the republicans defend their seats, they will probably cause some trouble but like quicksand the more they struggle the more they secure their own doom.

       Both run risk for two enacting governments. an establishment too small runs the risk of being forced to compete with tycoons, private mercenaries, hells angels/that sort. This is seen in Canada-Their Liberal government does not call the shots to put it bluntly. However, Canada is a cultural mosaic- which means despite having the large umbrella government the communities largely police and dictate the acceptable practice of bylaws/taboo tolerance themselves.

       This is spot on, good post. The way I see it, the more people choose to be offended or outraged by this, the more power this gives to those trying to profit from it. I mean, cmon are yall

       Approach the issue with love and understanding instead of hate and vitriol and you're bound to get a better result in the end. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I think you're on the right path OP.

       Here’s a working theory of mine that’d I’d to throw out:
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM staged the Jeung controversy. The New York Times either leaked the tweets or knew that people would discover and be outraged over them. They knew that liberal mainstream and liberal social media would defend them by spinning the outrage as an organized attack by the “alt-right trolls.” They want to promote the term and its association to the alt-right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their goal is to plant an association between these “trolls” and the “russian troll factories” and “troll armies” that supposedly influenced the election in order to make them appear to be the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? I’m still speculating on that end.

       These talks are pretty interesting. Crazy to see her actually pretty level headed after thinking she was just another SJW. I'm always down to hear the other side but the problem is (why I don't most of the time), it's too much time to do on every topic.... So you kind've just take it at face value and make a pre-judgement.
