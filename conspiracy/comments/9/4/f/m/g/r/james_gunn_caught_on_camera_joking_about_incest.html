The normalization of pedophilia and organizations facilitating these behaviors such NAMBLA is evident through the behaviors of these sick individuals. This video contains most of the pertinent information surrounding the James Gunn events including behind the scene footage from the 2004 film Lollilove where James jokes about raping his daughter anally.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>When Donald Trump was watching his 16-year-old daughter Ivanka host the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant, he turned to the then-Miss Universe and asked: “Don’t you think my daughter’s hot? She’s hot, right?”</p>

<p>When asked what he and his daughter both consider their favorite things, Trump answered, “I was going to say sex, but I can relate to [golf and real estate].”</p>

<p>“Ivanka posing for Playboy would be really disappointing… not really. But it would depend on what was inside the magazine…I don’t think Ivanka would [do a nude shoot] inside the magazine, Although she does have a very nice figure. I’ve said that if Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her.”</p>

<p>“You know who’s one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. Ivanka. My daughter, Ivanka. She’s 6 feet tall, she’s got the best body.”</p>

<p> &quot;Can I ask you something?&quot; Trump asked someone I know, about his then-13-year-old kid, &quot;Is it wrong to be more sexually attracted to your own daughter than your wife?&quot;</p>

<p>Theres more I&#39;m sure, plus all the creepy pics of her on his lap by statues of animals having sex and in his bedroom</p>

<p>As it stands, It&#39;s poor judgement. Something they both admitted <strong>long before surfacing</strong> that they were wrong about. </p>

<p>Luckily AS saw straight through the <em>actual</em> smear campaign. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter which side, If they are actively engaging in either pedophilia or any other crime then by all means, arrest them, prosecute and jail them. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine the media circus if he had made real dirty jokes like Gunn. To me it just seems like trump is a dumb rich frat boy who has a hot daughter because he married a model and his dumb frat boy brain can&#39;t compute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly trumps comments are worse because they are often directed and very specific people, he has been saying them for decades in public, has never backtracked. so being dumb means he can make perverse incestual comments? why do you think the media thinks he is so bad because he has made comments just as bad if not worse</p>

<p>I dont know what you are talking about gunn</p>

<p>gunn never gave any excuse. when it first came out he apologised and even now he said he understands why he was let go he apologised again. he has never defended his comments and did not think they were inexcusable. but he has very obviously changed given that they were made a decade ago and stopped.</p>

As a victim of pedophelia I have no problem with people making light of it, it is actually nice to be able to laugh about something that sucks so bad. Until I see him with his cock in a child or actual allegations of abuse arise, I&#39;m not calling anyone a pedophile.

    <div class="md"><p>Some coping mechanisms really are bad, not just for you but for the community. You have to recognize as such so you can move past it the right way. Normalizing and making light of horrible things may make you feel like it&#39;s not a big deal, and thus feel better, but it also allows people to treat the same issues with less seriousness, which actually helps the abusers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never said I wanted that. You did for me though. Some coping mechanisms are bad (drugs, promiscuous sex, self harm), however laughing at jokes that you find funny are not one of them. Someone making a joke is not &quot;normalizing&quot; pedophelia. It SHOULD be treated with less seriousness because he was trying to be funny. (I don&#39;t think anything he said was funny, but to each his own). The police aren&#39;t going to let people go around banging kids because some leftist comedians made a joke about it. You are acting like child abusers need validation to attack kids. They won&#39;t be swayed one way or another by some leftist hack making pedo jokes online. That&#39;s the thing with criminals and the mentally ill, they don&#39;t tend to focus on much aside from finding a means to an end. </p>
