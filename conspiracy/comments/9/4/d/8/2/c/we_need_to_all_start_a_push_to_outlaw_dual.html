    <div class="md"><p>I agree entirely, I’m actually a dual citizen as well and I think it’s unethical for people in government to have them. I want to work for the State Dept. so I would give up my foreign citizenship out of principle. I’m heavily considering doing it since I feel no connection with my country of birth - I’ve been here since I was 3. But my mom... would start a dumpster fire haha</p>

<p>But to be honest, haha I went to Russia with my other passport without having to pay the $250 visa fee for Americans and I was awesome haha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha no... they gave a bullshit technical answer. They claimed that the citizen act of 18382 (whatever year it was, 18something) transferred birth right nationality to the children of US citizen even if they were born abroad. Which I totally stand behind, that makes sense. You adopt the nationality of your parents - cool. </p>

<p>But in the constitution it’s written in such a way that it basically spells out that you have to be born here to qualify to be president. But he claimed that he was a natural born citizen through his US mom and that he could in fact run. Which I call bullshit, you have to be born here and that’s the way it has always been interpreted up until 30 minutes ago... haha one thing you have to give to Trump was his nicknames - Lying Ted hahaha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice. Yea Ted is a turd. But Obama was really born in Hawaii. I lived right up the Manoa hill from the hospital and a guy in his 80s that walked his dog by my house brought it up that his wife was there and went to the same church as obamas mom.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also to note that the birther movement came from an Israeli report questioning it because Israel didn&#39;t like obamas stance on regional politics. Search Israel Obama and you&#39;ll see. It was an AIPAC cronies who started it all based on a report the Aman gave him questioning it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh good info! When this whole birthed thing came out I was still believing MSM 100% so I assumed they were giving him a hard time because he was black - not that I saw racism at every corner or anything but it came to my mind. Then a couple months ago I saw this video on it: <a href="https://youtu.be/2DEntS_iM3c">https://youtu.be/2DEntS_iM3c</a> and it seemed pretty interesting. I never did much research but it opened my eyes on “the other side” of you will. </p>

<p>I had a negative experience with AIPAC and this congresswoman i interned with. It was during the Iran Nuke deal and this congresswoman wanted to hold a debate about it and AIPAC called saying that if she held the debates they would protest her and call her out so she obviously backed out. Every since then, they’ve left a nasty taste in my mouth. Regardless of what you think about the Deal, we should debate it and talk about it without being threatened </p>
