        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi All - </p>

<p>I am working on my PhD proposal. I have already completed undergraduate degree, MBA and Master of Philosophy. Ideally, my PhD research will involve conspiracy in some capacity. I can post again in the future with more details regarding the actual research question and hypothesis. </p>

<p>MY QUESTION: If I get accepted and get a scholarship to begin my research - would you participate? </p>

<p>This is really important to me - because I don&#39;t want to produce research from an outsiders perspective. I am a fellow theorist i.e. I have been part of this sub for maybe 5+ years now (with varying user names). If accepted I would like to survey this community, interview this community and work together. </p>

<p>So - ASSUMING (a) I am accepted and (b) I provide all the usual warranties regarding anonymity, confidentiality, safety etc. Would you participate? Or will I just be viewed as a suspicious and unwanted visitor... </p>

<p>Appreciate your advice before I set out on this long journey. Regards, </p>

I can imagine I get accepted and go to do my interviews and no one will talk to me cause &quot;psi-ops&quot;... Respect your opinion and feedback - cause it helps me decide to pursue this research avenue or just go into human-robot interaction as my supervisors want. Peace.</p>

<p>Here online there is no way to validate or verify your claims with out doxing yourself so the only thing we have is your word and you just got cought in a lie.... </p>

<p>Remember a conspiracy theoriet is someone that is always sceptical about realiy it&#39;s the person that is obsessed with one small details about the status quo that does not make sense and rearchs why this is so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair call. It is hypothetical for me as well at this point - haven&#39;t even submitted proposal and from proposal to data collection is 12 months (literature review, ethics approval, confirmation etc). Eventually, in 12 months when provided a link to participate, before anyone does anything - they are presented with all the details, risks, benefits, privacy statements, my contact details etc. So yeah - in the end, the details will all be there. I just wanted to test the waters. Seems it might be tough getting people to open up - but I don&#39;t blame them. People think I am joking, but I am legit a conspiracy theorist myself - so I understand. Cheers, </p>

The subjects would have to be guaranteed anonymity by not asking personal questions that could lead to doxing them (i.e. location of birth, nationality, ethnicity, what they work with and so on). The website should be completely open and not require any kind of login etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes - agree. Thanks for the input. I learned that is the best protocol while doing my M.Phil degree. Everything goes through the universities ethics review board (we are talking good uni here) and will be 100% anonymous i.e. no individual identifiers recorded. All good research from good uni will come with cover page outlining benefits, risks, guarantees, my personal details etc. Otherwise - I would be expelled instantly. Still a while away yet from trying to collect data - but appreciate your advice. Regards, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are correct. It is probably easier to take a random sample of 200-300 people from population and measure their conspiracy beliefs, then label those people as conspiracy theorists and then conduct experiment with control group vs. conspiracy theorists.

<p>On one hand, over 50% of Americans report endorsement in at least 1 conspiracy, so it is not like it is a rare thing. But I think this group is the concentrated version of that :) Yes, I believe theorists are monitored due to link between conspiratorial beliefs and acts of violence / radicalization. Not saying it is right, but I imagine it is the case. That being said, I don&#39;t think they mean you / us any harm - just watching us and everyone else I suppose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing that might help your research would be to try to make a distinction between conspiracy realists and conspiracy fantasists. There&#39;s a spectrum of course that goes from complete conspiracy denialism to complete conspiracy fantasism. </p>

<p>On the one hand denialists refute the existence of conspiracies entirely and experience cognitive dissonance when you show them that a belief they hold is consistent with a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>While in the other fantasists need little to no evidence to believe wholeheartedly in a conspiracy theory so long as it accords with their preconceived notions of how the world works.</p>

<p>A good example of denialism would be the people that believe Trump is Putin&#39;s puppet but deny that they&#39;re theorizing about a conspiracy </p>

<p>A good example of fantasism would be the flat earthers. There&#39;s no credible evidence to support their belief, and all evidence points to the contrary, yet they maintain the belief nonetheless.</p>
