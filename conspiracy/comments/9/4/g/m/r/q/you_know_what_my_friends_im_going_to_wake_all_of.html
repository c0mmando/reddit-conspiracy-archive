<p>Everyone failed. Everyone is on team Trump/Clinton/Bernie you all forgot what real freedom is. I just had to get that off my chest. I would like to see political debate on why Gary was so awful to the deep state, the liberal cabal, or the conservative cabal.</p>

<p>A real good guy ran for president... A capitalist. A forward thinker of social rights. We failed. </p>

<p>So yeah. We all know Gary would have been cool. Legalize pot. Get us more freedom from the police state. No war.</p>

<p>On the cynical side... also we would know how much deep state controls to corrupt a free freedom president</p>

Ralph Nader got almost 3% against Gore/Bush and all indications were that Jill should have beaten that (given the loathing many had for both of the mainstream candidates) this go round.
