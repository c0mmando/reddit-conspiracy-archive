        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello all,</p>

<p>In the interest of clarification and transparency, over the last day or so part of a conversation with a user in modmail was leaked by a former <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod (<a href="/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien">/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien</a>) to another former <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod (Dusty) by way of an alt account. Prior to this incident, <a href="/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien">/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien</a> had been a long standing moderator with no history of leaking. </p>

<p><a href="/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien">/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien</a> took that course of action because he was under the mistaken impression that <a href="/u/aleister">/u/aleister</a> was an alt of another mod on the team (<a href="/u/JamesColesPardon">/u/JamesColesPardon</a>), after <a href="/u/aleister">/u/aleister</a> accidentally replied to his own modmail comment in the leaked modmail exchange.</p>

<p>As a result of the accusations made by <a href="/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien">/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien</a>, he then choose to unilaterally remove <a href="/u/aleister">/u/aleister</a> from the mod team. </p>

<p>However, before the mod team was even able to take up discussion of the issue <a href="/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien">/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien</a> deleted his account and left reddit.  </p>

<p>As such, the mod team reversed the decision to remove <a href="/u/Aleister">/u/Aleister</a> and we have chosen to make this post in the interest of full transparency. A screenshot of the original modmail exchange which lead to Dino&#39;s actions can be found <a href="https://i.imgur.com/C9M0abw.png">here</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xOgPgjj.jpg">here is the internal modmail discussion wherein Dino admitted to leaking the screenshot and explained his reasoning</a>.</p>

<p>Please feel free to discuss the situation below and we apologize for the delay in regards to this announcement, it took some time to come to consensus as a mod team with regards our shared views.</p>

<p>Regards and thanks,</p>

<p>The <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, gotcha.  I just watched Super Troopers 2 yesterday and there were a few jokes about Canadians loving pancakes, so I wasn&#39;t exactly sure what the reference was.</p>

<p>As for the actual reference, that&#39;s pretty fucking sick for people to revel in that kind of thing.  I have no issues with a morbid joke here and there because levity can sometimes ease pain, but there&#39;s a big difference between that and relishing it.  I&#39;m glad that sub is private because I&#39;m not sure I want to read it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just the fact that it was done in secret by a select group of users who we are told are more important and trustworthy than the rest of us. I don&#39;t think the rest of us would have even seen the nominations if someone hadn&#39;t leaked the screenshots. </p>

<p>The fact that one of the new mods has been suspended by admins, you resigned, and now whatever is going on with this one makes me wonder if this really is the best selection process. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh god, sorry! And no, I haven&#39;t asked to join. I dislike the whole idea of a secret club, and it&#39;s not because I&#39;m not in it. It&#39;s the same reason I got annoyed with <a href="/r/LegalAdvice">/r/LegalAdvice</a>. Once you have a special club of &quot;approved&quot; users, they get special treatment and can get away with almost anything. I doubt they&#39;d invite me anyway. Two mods don&#39;t exactly like me, and I was included in that persona non grata list the conclave put together a while ago. </p>

As someone else pointed out, it&#39;s pretty dead and is mostly just talking about brigades and TMOR. But I still disagree with it as a whole. Why have public mod logs but then a separate hidden area where mods and select users can discuss stuff like who needs to be banned? What about keeping it to approved contributors only but then allow the actual discussions to be visible to everyone? Or is that not possible on Reddit?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Because it&#39;s free of brigading, mostly.  Things like rule changes and interpretation, or vote manipulation can actually be discussed without it turning into a huge flame war or being derailed by trolls.  Plus I don&#39;t really think its existence is hurting anyone.  If people are really that curious or suspicious they can just ask to join and if they aren&#39;t trolls they&#39;ll be invited.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually not sure if that&#39;s doable but it&#39;s not a bad idea.  I&#39;ve just never come across a subreddit with that setup before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just for clarification, no one was banned during the incident (Dino only removed Aleister as a mod).</p>

<p>The way in which mod seniority works on reddit is that any moderator can remove those below them on the list (this is a system that dates back to when reddit first introduced subreddits over a decade ago). However, the check and balance is that such unilateral action will most always be overturned by the mod team at large.</p>

<p>Understandably so, especially here.  I don’t really see other subs where the mods are attacked as vehemently as they are here.  It’s understandable why some mods might use alt accounts to contribute because their mod accounts seem to have downvote bots waiting to bury every post they make.</p>

<p>I am unable to do so. Additionally, I don&#39;t actually know whether or not there was more to IntellisaurDinoAlien&#39;s suspicions that we are not being told.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying I believe that excuse, but if it is true I think the mod team has a bit of a drinking problem. How many times did Flytape go on weird midnight rants and ban sprees and then blame it on being drunk? I seem to recall other mods using the &quot;drunk&quot; excuse several times as well. Just my experience, but if I&#39;m getting drunk at a dinner party with my wife and my Swedish friends I&#39;m not going to spend the time Redditing. This whole situation is weird and this explanation isn&#39;t really making it any better. </p>

<p>That was an incident when three moderators attempted to stage an ideological coup on the subreddit by removing all of their co-mods.

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, DronePuppet is the one who was caught running dozens of alt accounts.  That&#39;s 100% proven and, as you said, he did indeed confirm it himself on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>As for Flytape, lots of people accused him of using alts over the years but there was never any evidence that I&#39;ve seen and he always denied it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yeah, they were always friendly with each other and shared some ideological leanings.  They were also 2 of the 3 mods who were part of the &quot;coup&quot;, or whatever you want to call it.  And actually DronePuppet is one of the users who was often accused of being a &quot;Flytape alt&quot;, although lots of people have been accused of that.  Even I myself have been accused of being a flytape alt once or twice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many people do you think needed to be in on it?  Just us mods, a few of which said they didn&#39;t want to participate and asked to not be mentioned or involved at all.</p>

<p>Quite a few of the users in that thread caught on immediately and called us out for an April Fool&#39;s joke and so we just deleted all of those comments to hide them.  It wasn&#39;t really too tough to pull off.</p>

<p>You can even see my comment in that thread as the top comment.  Needless to say, nothing in that comment is or was serious at all.  I understand your suspicion but in that case it really was just a prank.  We realized afterwards that maybe an April Fool&#39;s joke on this sub wasn&#39;t a great idea since so many of the users here are suspicious and were freaking out about it, and you&#39;ll notice we haven&#39;t done any of that again when April comes around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in addition to all of the mods, there are a few recognizable names in there who were either in on it or just believed it so completely that they are posting numerous comments about it throughout the thread. RMFN in particular pasted the same comment multiple times and is acting completely shocked by the accusations. I know he&#39;s part of the good ol&#39; boys club and a troll now, but I don&#39;t know if that was the case back then. </p>

<p>I like that. It&#39;s such a cute, playful way of describing someone who constantly posts contradictory, partisan topics to bait people into fighting. One day he acts like a super racist, the next day he accuses people of being horrible racists. One day he rants against religion, the next day he&#39;s a religious zealot. One day he&#39;s a super progressive liberal, the next he is complaining about how degenerate trans and gay people are poisoning our children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m sure there is a method to it, I just don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s allowed. He&#39;s been banned numerous times, had dozens of comments removed, dozens more approved even though they break the rules, and is not only allowed to keep doing it but is actually one of the so called &quot;trusted members&quot;. I also saw the leaked conclave screenshots where he outright admitted to trolling and attempting to break the rules in the most creative way possible. That&#39;s why he calls people &quot;chills&quot; and &quot;curly locks&quot; instead of &quot;shill&quot; and &quot;jew&quot;, as if that is somehow better. You might claim to not know or understand his motives, but all of the mods who approve of this behavior and allow it to continue sure do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is VERY interesting to me. I’m no one special, but I made a point to keep an eye on this sub and I came to this EXACT conclusion. That there is a mod, or multiple, with alt’s on the mod team. I don’t exactly have proof, as I originally came to the conclusion via pattern recognition, but JCP was one of my “suspects” if you will. </p>

<p>I figured that maybe someone had bought his account, though. Someone needs to do a deep dive on both histories of the accounts and find out just what is going on. With that being said, I kind of like JCP, because if memory serves me right, he was the guy I pitched the idea of transparent modmails to. (In order to avoid unjust bans, or mods ganging up on a user or ideas they didn’t like) and that policy was enacted soon after.</p>

<p>That policy came right before the “coup” led by that flytape fool, and thankfully due to having transparent modmail <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was able to see EXACTLY what went on. Which allowed the mods to fix everything without too much of a problem. However, one of the actions that implicated flytape and made him look guilty as fuck was his attempt to move the discussion of the “coup” to his own subreddit where modmails weren’t transparent. That sort of “proved intent” and that flytape was trying to subvert the sub. So if mods are using alts to communicate outside of this policy, that should also raise a ton of suspicion. </p>

<p>This is all really fascinating to me! I originally started keeping my eye on things after I suspected that Flytape was still on the mod team via an alt; now look where we’re at!</p>

<p>Yes, there is. We&#39;ve all seen them. And you&#39;re using the well-known <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">disinformation tactic</a> of denying the proof that Brock was active on reddit, and demanding the impossible proof of an article from a mockingbird media outlet describing which subreddit they were on.</p>

<p>Implying that I lack critical thinking skills and am controlled by political partisanship without even attempting to prove this claim. Strange because <em>you</em> are the one showing lack of clear judgment caused by political affiliation because you can&#39;t stop talking about Trump and the right when it has nothing to do with the topic at hand.</p>

<p>Maybe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can agree with you on that being the case, with small samples being used in misleading ways.  IDA seemed to feel that they were correct in their assumption, though with them gone who knows what else they might have to say on the subject.  It sounded like they were trying to be a whistleblower, whatever the truth of the situation.</p>

<p>The larger mod discussion posted here shed a lot more light on it and gave more context to the reasoning behind what was going on, though obviously it won&#39;t be enough for some posters.  If there were more leaks people might see more transparency and feel less distrustful, especially when there are things like <a href="/r/conspiracy_conclave">/r/conspiracy_conclave</a> that have made a lot of users wary.</p>

<p>Personally I hope for more leaks for similar reasons to wanting more leaks of emails and communications from politicians and lobbyists.</p>

<p>So, we have mods here that can&#39;t remember or even recognize their own posts an hour after they post something?  That doesn&#39;t seem like a good quality for a mod.  How do they remember what they are doing on a day to day basis, much less adding the extra stress of modding a huge sub?</p>

<p>normalizing this is wrong. it also shows that use of alts is probably widespread. if this guy is going to use alts to banter (with himself) about making dinner... I&#39;m positive he abuses the mod powers in other ways as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there&#39;s more to it than just astroturfing. That component is hidden paid messaging intended to influence and shape opinion. </p>

<p>There&#39;s another component though.  Consider Reddit as a whole, admin of the site, then individual subreddits, autonomous communities where mods have complete and total control.  The Admin and mod positions have ability to curate and remove content to promote content they want visible.</p>

<p>That power if not controlled by honest people is open for abuse.  Hence the degradation of Reddit over the past 5+ years.  As Reddit have grown larger and more popular, outside influencers have successfully infiltrated or bought mod positions on subs.  These people are political operatives, public relations, and reputation management professional that are literally paid to push messages and protect clients all day long.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t the existence of the rules that is the issue.  It is the perceived unequal way in which they are applied.  Personal attacks are technically not allowed but the enforcement is rather spotty sometimes.</p>

<p>It shows aleister replied to his comment. Modmail is weird - oftentimes I reply to the most recent messagw to add to the conversation, not necessarily as a reply to the specific mod.</p>

<p>Ok so let me dissect this.</p>

<p>You are a drunk and you are equating replying to the wrong person with having a back and forth conversation with yourself... without noticing that you did it.</p>

<p>You &quot;know&quot; these people online yet you are equating that with knowing them as different people in &quot;real life&quot;.</p>

<p>Pretty funny shit if you ask me.</p>

<p>I know exactly what I&#39;m talking about. Nothing you have posted means shit to me and not a shred of it qualifies as &quot;proof&quot; of anything.</p>

<p>You are basically saying &quot;trust me&quot; and guess what? I don&#39;t owe you anything and you haven&#39;t earned my fucking trust. </p>

<p>I know what I read... and other users here know what they&#39;ve read... this isn&#39;t a drunken mistake. </p>

<p>Please (for all of us) make a repost of you replying to yourself... you know... maybe scour your drunken posts? You are ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What was his bias?</p>

<p>I know he would enforce bizarre interpretations of the rules. For example, a SS with 2 sentences, rather than 3 or more, he closed the thread. He closed the thread on a SS with two rhetorical questions rather than 2 sentences.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember if it was him or another mod who closed my thread where I had altered the title of the thread of the article I was linking to (ie. the mod was enforcing a r/politics rule).</p>

<p>But yeah I wonder whether drinking is an excuse for mods with agendas to ban key influences they don&#39;t like by arbitarily enforcing bizarre interpretations of the rules to antagonize said users. </p>

<p>And of course its against the rules to even call them out on this.</p>

<p>a self-reply isn&#39;t conclusive proof of an alt.  It does look a little weird though.</p>

<p>What does look weird is a mod leaking modmail to TMOR, a sub affiliated with SPLC, which is known to brigade and infiltrate other subs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shit, how about a vote to throw out corrupt mods? </p>

<p>Sure, there may be some good mods thrown out too, but judging by the downvotes in this thread, I&#39;d say we have a pretty good chance of getting rid of the obvious ones.</p>

<p>The problem is that vote will never happen.</p>

<p>The power structure leaves the users with exactly dick all power except to try to get posts exposing bullshit to the front page, but even then, mods can just delete posts and perma-ban.</p>

<p>Huge problem. I hope Q fixes it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah somehow I thought you were a mod earlier. </p>

<p>Sorry for the misunderstanding.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any problem talking about TMOR or vote manipulation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to get that shit exposed for like 3 years.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted hundreds of screencaps of graphs from RedditInsight&#39;s [Trackpost](<a href="http://www.redditinsight.com/#trackpost">www.redditinsight.com/#trackpost</a>). </p>

<p>There are definitely some kind of shenanigans going on to keep the good red-pills off the front page. </p>

<p>There is some kind of algorithm that controls the score of certain posts or possibly ALL posts. Votes are weighted. New votes will show up on the graph in realtime until Reddit&#39;s &quot;vote fuzzing&quot; kicks in, which was explained by Reddit as a way to thwart bots trying to fuck with vote scores. </p>

<p>This also allows them to hide ALL new, because the graph goes +1 -1 every 2 seconds. Votes can easily be canceled out in realtime because they can always blame the -1 on the &quot;vote fuzzing&quot;.</p>

<p>Lot&#39;s of problems here. Admins AND mods are implicated in corruption.</p>

<p>Hey man, i hear ya.  Consider this though.  At no time in this life is it your responsibilty to take care or ensure that everyone.....especially people you <em>don&#39;t</em> know, to have them all accept you.  </p>

<p>That is not at all a reasonable expectation or requirement for you going on in life. </p>

<p>Strangers be damned!  Besides you come across lime you&#39;re greatly concerned with that idea.  You probably are very personally critical of yourself and you would probably conduct yourself just fine even though you over think it.</p>

<p>I think I know how you feel because I think I went through that similar process.  Now, I have made my peace with the idea that I do not.and cannot possibly expect that I can please everyone.  I definitely cannot please people I don&#39;t know and haven&#39;t even met.  Those people do no think of me in any capacity.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t personally sit at home and stew about all the people you haven&#39;t met and would probably dislike and disavree with, do you?  No.  You.....like me....still have our own personal things you focus on and the vast majority of people who would be worthwhile speaking to.....won&#39;t be either.</p>

<p>Besides that....even if you managed to piss off some goofball you could speak to that person and clarify yourself and ensure there was no miscommunication.  </p>

<p>I think I see what I went through and still worry about....but less so.  I just like to say the things that helped me get on with life.  I hope it applies and if not....well...its just some text on screen.  </p>

<p>Take care out there.</p>

<p>Regular users have zero recourse.  We can&#39;t remove them when they tyrannize, selectively enforce their own rules, and hand out bans for anyone who attempts to call them out.</p>

<p>A handful of people have taken over and ruined this place, and conspiracy is no different. The mods refuse to do anything about the obvious brigading going on in here, and all of this constant mod shuffling and infighting is sketchy as fuck.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/87/the_downing_street_memo/">The very first post on reddit was a conspiracy post!</a></p>

<p>Ironically, some years later, it came back up, and someone left this fitting comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I no longer believe that Reddit can enrich my life. People can find better news, entertainment, and discussion elsewhere. Reddit is too full of low effort content, gross censorship of both useful and non-useful discourse, and the worst kinds of arguments. I advise everyone to leave and do something more productive with your lives.</p>

<p>Go read a book, learn a language, talk to a stranger, walk around your neighborhood, take a class, cook a meal, or play with your pet. If you&#39;re anything like me, you won&#39;t look back and consider the time on Reddit to be life well lived. I hope to see you out there.</p>

<p>The site was incubated by those 3 co founders under the umbrella of a company called not a bug inc, which was itself being incubated by Paul graham thought a ycombinator summer camp in 2006.</p>

<p>This is a backup of the site for the company (as it was sadly taken off line recently)- <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071008183711/http://notabug.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20071008183711/http://notabug.com/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Paul wanted to give Aaron Swartz, another YC founder, a birthday gift in November. More than anything else, Aaron wanted co-founder so Paul suggested the &#39;merger&#39;. Merger is probably a bit hyperbolic for what actually happened, Aaron basically moved in with us and we made him a co-founder.&quot;- <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20339">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20339</a></p>

<p>Your ban was 100% warranted and a comment like that would get anyone banned from most subs on Reddit. Being extremely toxic and calling it &#39;calling out a user&#39; is lame.</p>

<p>If you think that&#39;s bias, try saying things like that about conservatives on here, you&#39;ll get banned as fast, if not faster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a member of r/conspiracy for 11 years. This sub has never been more compromised than it is now...and I get a sinking feeling that there are mods who are involved with it. The brigading here has never been worse. I have messaged mods during times of severe brigading when it was painfully obvious a received back bitchy replies telling me to prove it...WHAT!?...prove the obvious?? The mods ALLOW brigading to take place and destroy posts. They made no rules to combat it. Any mod worth their weight in salt KNOWS these threads are getting trashed by outside subs...but, at the same time they&#39;re gung ho on banning solid legitimate posts for the stupidest shit imaginable...Oh, ONE word in the title was all caps...it &quot;reminded&quot; them of a meme...if a mod has a personal problem with a post, they&#39;ll declare it&#39;s spam when it clearly is not.</p>

<p>So...not surprised at the drama and the personal mod  agendas 
and manipulations...THAT is obvious too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it becomes apparent that a post is in process of being brigaded, switching to contest mode or a mode that immediately shuts off the accumulative vote counts for the thread that&#39;s under attack would leave the thread of the post that is under attack in a more realistic perspective...rather than letting it go on to morph into some perverted version that TMOR would highly approve of.</p>

<p>There is a war against the truth...whether you want to believe it or not, r/conspiracy  is one of the most highly surveilled forums on the internet... it is constantly under attack. I&#39;ve been here over a decade and I&#39;ve seen good times and bad times here.

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve experimented with contest mode quite a bit over the last year or so.  Personally I think it sucks because it makes actually tracking discussions/arguments very annoying to do because you constantly have to uncollapse comment threads, but we have tried it with varying levels of success.  As far as switching it to &quot;a mode that immediately shuts off the vote counts&quot;, what mode is that?  All anyone has to do in order to get around it is turn off subreddit styles - there isn&#39;t any way to actually hide vote counts or prevent upvotes/downvotes.</p>

They would post memes and gifs of pancakes and laugh about it.  These are the types of people we&#39;re dealing with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying I believe that excuse, but if it is true I think the mod team has a bit of a drinking problem. How many times did Flytape go on weird midnight rants and ban sprees and then blame it on being drunk? I seem to recall other mods using the &quot;drunk&quot; excuse several times as well. Just my experience, but if I&#39;m getting drunk at a dinner party with my wife and my Swedish friends I&#39;m not going to spend the time Redditing. This whole situation is weird and this explanation isn&#39;t really making it any better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, DronePuppet is the one who was caught running dozens of alt accounts.  That&#39;s 100% proven and, as you said, he did indeed confirm it himself on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>As for Flytape, lots of people accused him of using alts over the years but there was never any evidence that I&#39;ve seen and he always denied it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just mixed the two mods up in my head since they seemed to be working together on the troll account and ban tactic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, they were always friendly with each other and shared some ideological leanings.  They were also 2 of the 3 mods who were part of the &quot;coup&quot;, or whatever you want to call it.  And actually DronePuppet is one of the users who was often accused of being a &quot;Flytape alt&quot;, although lots of people have been accused of that.  Even I myself have been accused of being a flytape alt once or twice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had several reasons, but the main one was I found it pointless and a waist of time.  It&#39;s just a constraint stream of complaints and debates over thousands of mod actions, right wrong or indifferent.  It&#39;s the last thing I need in my life, and just a major distraction from things like family and work.  I come to reddit for entertainment and different views on current events, and being a mod doesn&#39;t enhance that.  It&#39;s selfish and self centered, but hey, fuck it, it&#39;s my life.  </p>

<p>And don’t tell me to stay on subject, literally every comment of yours on here isn’t on the topic of the mods and is complaining about brigading.

<p>So yes brigading happens. And this thread very may well be brigaded, it’s stickied, it’s meta, it’s about TMOR, it has all the earmarks if outside votes. You win. I also think the mods are sketchy here sometimes and things like the JCP Aleister thing doesnt help. </p>
