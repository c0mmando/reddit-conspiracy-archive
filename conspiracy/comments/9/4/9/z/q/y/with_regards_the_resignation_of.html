       Hello all,
      </p>
      <p>
       In the interest of clarification and transparency, over the last day or so part of a conversation with a user in modmail was leaked by a former
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mod (
       <a href="/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien">
        /u/IntellisaurDinoAlien
       </a>
       ) to another former
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mod (Dusty) by way of an alt account. Prior to this incident,
       <a href="/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien">
        /u/IntellisaurDinoAlien
       </a>
       had been a long standing moderator with no history of leaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien">
        /u/IntellisaurDinoAlien
       </a>
       took that course of action because he was under the mistaken impression that
       <a href="/u/aleister">
        /u/aleister
       </a>
       was an alt of another mod on the team (
       <a href="/u/JamesColesPardon">
        /u/JamesColesPardon
       </a>
       ), after
       <a href="/u/aleister">
        /u/aleister
       </a>
       accidentally replied to his own modmail comment in the leaked modmail exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of the accusations made by
       <a href="/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien">
        /u/IntellisaurDinoAlien
       </a>
       , he then choose to unilaterally remove
       <a href="/u/aleister">
        /u/aleister
       </a>
       from the mod team.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, before the mod team was even able to take up discussion of the issue
       <a href="/u/IntellisaurDinoAlien">
        /u/IntellisaurDinoAlien
       </a>
       deleted his account and left reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, the mod team reversed the decision to remove
       <a href="/u/Aleister">
        /u/Aleister
       </a>
       and we have chosen to make this post in the interest of full transparency. A screenshot of the original modmail exchange which lead to Dino's actions can be found
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/C9M0abw.png">
        here
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore,
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xOgPgjj.jpg">
        here is the internal modmail discussion wherein Dino admitted to leaking the screenshot and explained his reasoning
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Please feel free to discuss the situation below and we apologize for the delay in regards to this announcement, it took some time to come to consensus as a mod team with regards our shared views.

       Pork chops are a powerful food, most consumed meat on the planet... Which always seemed odd, since no one discriminates against chicken.

       I make a mean hasenpfeffer. It takes a lot of effort though so it's usually just a fall/seasonal dish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last time I bought 4 rabbits and made hasenpfeffer with two and braised the other two with leeks and other aromatics.

       In case you actually aren't aware, it's a reference to the TMOR (formerly conspiratard) crew had a subreddit setup where they would laugh at Rachel Corrie, an American activist who was run over by an armored IDF truck in Gaza.  They would post memes and gifs of pancakes and laugh about it.  These are the types of people we're dealing with.

       Oh, gotcha.  I just watched Super Troopers 2 yesterday and there were a few jokes about Canadians loving pancakes, so I wasn't exactly sure what the reference was.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the actual reference, that's pretty fucking sick for people to revel in that kind of thing.  I have no issues with a morbid joke here and there because levity can sometimes ease pain, but there's a big difference between that and relishing it.  I'm glad that sub is private because I'm not sure I want to read it.

       There were some really funny parts and some parts that fell flat.  It wasn’t as good as the first one, but I think it falls just behind Beerfest in terms of humor.  I did like it though and laughed a bunch.

       I had several reasons, but the main one was I found it pointless and a waist of time.  It's just a constraint stream of complaints and debates over thousands of mod actions, right wrong or indifferent.  It's the last thing I need in my life, and just a major distraction from things like family and work.  I come to reddit for entertainment and different views on current events, and being a mod doesn't enhance that.  It's selfish and self centered, but hey, fuck it, it's my life.

       No, I don't think that's selfish at all. I don't envy the mods of any major subreddits, let alone one as contentious as this one. No matter what you do, someone is going to be mad at you for it.

       Just the fact that it was done in secret by a select group of users who we are told are more important and trustworthy than the rest of us. I don't think the rest of us would have even seen the nominations if someone hadn't leaked the screenshots.
      </p>

       The fact that one of the new mods has been suspended by admins, you resigned, and now whatever is going on with this one makes me wonder if this really is the best selection process.

       Oh god, sorry! And no, I haven't asked to join. I dislike the whole idea of a secret club, and it's not because I'm not in it. It's the same reason I got annoyed with
       <a href="/r/LegalAdvice">
        /r/LegalAdvice

       . Once you have a special club of "approved" users, they get special treatment and can get away with almost anything. I doubt they'd invite me anyway. Two mods don't exactly like me, and I was included in that persona non grata list the conclave put together a while ago.

       Thanks, but I really did mean it when I said I wasn't upset at not being a part of the conclave. And yeah, it's not quite the nefarious cabal I made it sound like. As someone else pointed out, it's pretty dead and is mostly just talking about brigades and TMOR. But I still disagree with it as a whole. Why have public mod logs but then a separate hidden area where mods and select users can discuss stuff like who needs to be banned? What about keeping it to approved contributors only but then allow the actual discussions to be visible to everyone? Or is that not possible on Reddit?

       Well if you don't want to visit the sub you're obviously under no obligation to, it's all good.

       Because it's free of brigading, mostly.  Things like rule changes and interpretation, or vote manipulation can actually be discussed without it turning into a huge flame war or being derailed by trolls.  Plus I don't really think its existence is hurting anyone.  If people are really that curious or suspicious they can just ask to join and if they aren't trolls they'll be invited.

       I'm actually not sure if that's doable but it's not a bad idea.  I've just never come across a subreddit with that setup before.

       Just for clarification, no one was banned during the incident (Dino only removed Aleister as a mod).
      </p>
      <p>
       The way in which mod seniority works on reddit is that any moderator can remove those below them on the list (this is a system that dates back to when reddit first introduced subreddits over a decade ago). However, the check and balance is that such unilateral action will most always be overturned by the mod team at large.

       Agreed, Though I’m guessing not everyone will believe the official story.  Hopefully there are more modmail leaks though.  A sub, and the mods on it, like this that values transparency should consider that to be a good thing.

       I think we should get rid of all the mods that don't actively participate in and thus love this sub. To anyone that has been here for a while it's like who the hell is that, never seen him before, and he was a mod for how long?

       Mods can sometimes feel a pressure to avoid participating as a user on the subreddit out of a desire to remain as impartial as possible.

       Dino was very active in terms of modding the sub  (which can be verified by looking at this archive of the public modlog as sorted by indvidual mod action) and would routinely weigh in on modmails and such.

       I think we should know who the mods are as a person and the only way to know that is to actually see them around. It's like UN13, I totally disagree with him in most cases, but at least I see him around, know he is a real person,  and feel like he likes and cares about this place just because he participates.. Staying in the shadows and just modding doesn't give me confidence.   We know conspiracy theorists will always be under attack and thus this sub also.

       I agree with you and have said so multiple times here in the past.  I like seeing what the mods have to say and contribute, whether or not I agree with them.  DronePuppet gave me a big distrust of the mod team for a while due to his antics and alts, so I like seeing what the mods themselves have to say regarding stuff here.

       Understandably so, especially here.  I don’t really see other subs where the mods are attacked as vehemently as they are here.  It’s understandable why some mods might use alt accounts to contribute because their mod accounts seem to have downvote bots waiting to bury every post they make.

       I am unable to do so. Additionally, I don't actually know whether or not there was more to IntellisaurDinoAlien's suspicions that we are not being told. Based on my interactions with IDA I wouldn't have guessed that user would interpret replying to your own comment as maleficence instead of a simple mistake. Obviously that wasn't the case and I am still surprised by that fact alone.

       His official explanation is in the post, as part of the larger modmail discussion about the incident with the mods.  I believe it's that he was drunk.

       I'm not saying I believe that excuse, but if it is true I think the mod team has a bit of a drinking problem. How many times did Flytape go on weird midnight rants and ban sprees and then blame it on being drunk? I seem to recall other mods using the "drunk" excuse several times as well. Just my experience, but if I'm getting drunk at a dinner party with my wife and my Swedish friends I'm not going to spend the time Redditing. This whole situation is weird and this explanation isn't really making it any better.

       The conspiracy crowd in general, from what I've seen over the years, has a problem with drinking.  I believe PLC used to post drunk all of the time here, and I swear I've seen a few others mention being drunk while posting.  It's unfortunate, and I can't really claim to be much different because I'm an alcoholic myself even if I no longer drink.

       Especially if you feel powerless to do anything about it, or even get involved in the political bickering/disinformation that happens revolving around some of these conspiracy discussions.  I've had to take a step back from this sub multiple times in the past because I felt pulled in and it was negatively impacting my mood.

       I don't have any screenshots saved or anything, but I definitely remember one case where another mod posted the next day saying "We've discussed it with him and he was just drunk" after Flytape banned a bunch of people one night.

       Bad decisions? It was a "private" modmail between like ~15 people where some dude got drunk and was really excited about his pork chops and I guess great immigration in Sweden conversation.

       That was an incident when three moderators attempted to stage an ideological coup on the subreddit by removing all of their co-mods. More information on that incident can be found

       So when IDA said that this smells like a flytape operation, does that mean that JCP and aliester are also flytape?  So flytape still has at least 2 mods on the roster, no wonder IDA was pissed.  It's almost like everyone on Reddit is flytape's alt.

       Oh shit, that was actually DronePuppet with the alts, wasn't it? Nevermind! I was one of the people who messaged the modmail about his MAGABolt account, and I'm pretty sure one of you mods confirmed it and said he even admitted it when confronted about it. I just mixed the two mods up in my head since they seemed to be working together on the troll account and ban tactic.

       Yep, DronePuppet is the one who was caught running dozens of alt accounts.  That's 100% proven and, as you said, he did indeed confirm it himself on multiple occasions.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Flytape, lots of people accused him of using alts over the years but there was never any evidence that I've seen and he always denied it.

       Yeah, they were always friendly with each other and shared some ideological leanings.  They were also 2 of the 3 mods who were part of the "coup", or whatever you want to call it.  And actually DronePuppet is one of the users who was often accused of being a "Flytape alt", although lots of people have been accused of that.  Even I myself have been accused of being a flytape alt once or twice.

       Anyone remember the "April Fool's prank" where similar shit happened with JCP and they made up a big story about it afterwards? JCP seems like an OK moderator for this sub (so far), but it seems like every damn one of the mods here has been caught doing something shady at one point or another. That and the strange mod elections... Get your shit together guys. Having to read these mod drama things every other month is ridiculous.

       Thanks, I sort of remembered it but it's nice to have the actual thread! I still don't know what to think about all of this but the "April Fools" explanation back then seems about as convincing as the "He was drunk" excuse this time. If it was indeed a planned prank last time, it sure seems like a lot of people must have been in on it. There are quite a few people upset by it in the comments and pointing out other suspicious details.

       How many people do you think needed to be in on it?  Just us mods, a few of which said they didn't want to participate and asked to not be mentioned or involved at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quite a few of the users in that thread caught on immediately and called us out for an April Fool's joke and so we just deleted all of those comments to hide them.  It wasn't really too tough to pull off.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can even see my comment in that thread as the top comment.  Needless to say, nothing in that comment is or was serious at all.  I understand your suspicion but in that case it really was just a prank.  We realized afterwards that maybe an April Fool's joke on this sub wasn't a great idea since so many of the users here are suspicious and were freaking out about it, and you'll notice we haven't done any of that again when April comes around.

       Well in addition to all of the mods, there are a few recognizable names in there who were either in on it or just believed it so completely that they are posting numerous comments about it throughout the thread. RMFN in particular pasted the same comment multiple times and is acting completely shocked by the accusations. I know he's part of the good ol' boys club and a troll now, but I don't know if that was the case back then.

       Yeah RMFN was one of the first to guess it was a joke so since he knows the three of us mods who were involved, and because he likes messing around and having fun, he decided to jump in and play it up too.

       I like that. It's such a cute, playful way of describing someone who constantly posts contradictory, partisan topics to bait people into fighting. One day he acts like a super racist, the next day he accuses people of being horrible racists. One day he rants against religion, the next day he's a religious zealot. One day he's a super progressive liberal, the next he is complaining about how degenerate trans and gay people are poisoning our children.

       Fair enough.  I'm not going to go to bat for him and I don't pretend to understand all of his antics, but I do believe there's a method to his madness.  You're free to disagree with that of course.

       Yeah, I'm sure there is a method to it, I just don't understand why it's allowed. He's been banned numerous times, had dozens of comments removed, dozens more approved even though they break the rules, and is not only allowed to keep doing it but is actually one of the so called "trusted members". I also saw the leaked conclave screenshots where he outright admitted to trolling and attempting to break the rules in the most creative way possible. That's why he calls people "chills" and "curly locks" instead of "shill" and "jew", as if that is somehow better. You might claim to not know or understand his motives, but all of the mods who approve of this behavior and allow it to continue sure do.

       Aleister banned me for 3 days for 'using slurs' by saying Jews had been disliked throughout human history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made a comment about it then had two other people DM me about Aleister and JCP banning them for talking about jews as well.

      <p>
       They [He] somehow snaked their [his] way into being a mod and has started trying to sneakily nuke discussion about jews. I could tell he had an agenda when he wouldn't directly answer my questions in modmail.

       This is VERY interesting to me. I’m no one special, but I made a point to keep an eye on this sub and I came to this EXACT conclusion. That there is a mod, or multiple, with alt’s on the mod team. I don’t exactly have proof, as I originally came to the conclusion via pattern recognition, but JCP was one of my “suspects” if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I figured that maybe someone had bought his account, though. Someone needs to do a deep dive on both histories of the accounts and find out just what is going on. With that being said, I kind of like JCP, because if memory serves me right, he was the guy I pitched the idea of transparent modmails to. (In order to avoid unjust bans, or mods ganging up on a user or ideas they didn’t like) and that policy was enacted soon after.
      </p>
      <p>
       That policy came right before the “coup” led by that flytape fool, and thankfully due to having transparent modmail
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       was able to see EXACTLY what went on. Which allowed the mods to fix everything without too much of a problem. However, one of the actions that implicated flytape and made him look guilty as fuck was his attempt to move the discussion of the “coup” to his own subreddit where modmails weren’t transparent. That sort of “proved intent” and that flytape was trying to subvert the sub. So if mods are using alts to communicate outside of this policy, that should also raise a ton of suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all really fascinating to me! I originally started keeping my eye on things after I suspected that Flytape was still on the mod team via an alt; now look where we’re at!

       I think that depends on what you define as a "Socialist". Some people would consider me a Socialist, because I believe in Universal HC and College/Trade funding- but I don't advocate for government control of the economy. There's a middle ground to be reached, and true Socialism (or Communism, for that matter) will never come about before the advent of automated post-scarcity and a societal shift towards a more social direction, imo.

       The mod team messages read like the highschool student council drama. Would love to see if there can be some type of 3rd party (perhaps some

       But when screenshots are misconstrued to look like what they are not, and spread to the mocking and brigadr subs as such as a form of Targetted Harassment, I would have to disagree with you.

       I can agree with you on that being the case, with small samples being used in misleading ways.  IDA seemed to feel that they were correct in their assumption, though with them gone who knows what else they might have to say on the subject.  It sounded like they were trying to be a whistleblower, whatever the truth of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The larger mod discussion posted here shed a lot more light on it and gave more context to the reasoning behind what was going on, though obviously it won't be enough for some posters.  If there were more leaks people might see more transparency and feel less distrustful, especially when there are things like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy_conclave">
        /r/conspiracy_conclave
       </a>
       that have made a lot of users wary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I hope for more leaks for similar reasons to wanting more leaks of emails and communications from politicians and lobbyists.

       So, we have mods here that can't remember or even recognize their own posts an hour after they post something?  That doesn't seem like a good quality for a mod.  How do they remember what they are doing on a day to day basis, much less adding the extra stress of modding a huge sub?

       This was a shitty ban appeal modmail where I was immediately attacked for chiming in and I chose to deflect by talking about my dinner (if you actually read it).

       With all due respect. This is a borderline insulting answer.

       A lot of folks here, myself included are seeing this for the first time today, and based on the screenshot it looks really suspicious.

       Implying that the only reason for the overwhelming majority of users here feeling the same is because they were told to feel this way by another sub that nobody likes makes this seem even more suspicious.

       Why though? Do you think there's any sub on reddit that doesn't have mod alts? Even this one has several bot accounts, which are also...mod alts. Nothing in reddit's TOS indicates that you can't have alts, only that you're not supposed to ban evade with them as TMOR does.

       normalizing this is wrong. it also shows that use of alts is probably widespread. if this guy is going to use alts to banter (with himself) about making dinner... I'm positive he abuses the mod powers in other ways as well.

       To be fair, that screenshot says April 1st. That's 1 chance out of 365 for there to be a good excuse, and it was because it was April fool's day. I remember when that happened.

       Its a subreddit which is dedicated to briagding communities like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       on a 24/7 basis; mostly to undermine the ethos of free discussion which they feel has no place on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Setting aside the irony of their view in light of reddit co-founder Aaron Swartz's vision for the platform, they have crossed the line in terms of harassment and brigading so many times that the site admins have banned them from being able to use username pings in their comment section (which they would often user to harass users they disliked from other communities).

       TMOR puts people they don't like on lists. I have been accused of being an alt of a r/conspiracy mod. Reddit obviously knows what is going on as the lists get passed around by the cool kids who mod dozens of defaults.

       r/TopMindsOfReddit (TMOR) and related subreddits  were setup to explicitly target r/conspiracy with brigades.

       I'm familiar with astroturfing but until more recently I never really believed it was actually effective. I think the consolidation of the internet (most people use mainly reddit, FB, Twitter, and Instagram, rather than the thousands of niche forums they used to frequent) is making it far more effective.

       Well there's more to it than just astroturfing. That component is hidden paid messaging intended to influence and shape opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's another component though.  Consider Reddit as a whole, admin of the site, then individual subreddits, autonomous communities where mods have complete and total control.  The Admin and mod positions have ability to curate and remove content to promote content they want visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       That power if not controlled by honest people is open for abuse.  Hence the degradation of Reddit over the past 5+ years.  As Reddit have grown larger and more popular, outside influencers have successfully infiltrated or bought mod positions on subs.  These people are political operatives, public relations, and reputation management professional that are literally paid to push messages and protect clients all day long.

       Also; we do certainly expect folks to follow the civility guidelines and other rules on the sidebar, but those rules exist to encourage discussion more so than anything else (as otherwise threads become nothing more than personal attacks and hostility, therein making reasoned discourse almost impossible).

       The statement is two parts.

      <p>
       1:  The rules of this sub basically stop a free and open discussion from happening.

       2: Much like the "No Meta" tag stops lots of discussion because so few of us know what "No Meta" actually means and how it will be interpreted.

      <p>
       It isn't the existence of the rules that is the issue.  It is the perceived unequal way in which they are applied.  Personal attacks are technically not allowed but the enforcement is rather spotty sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rules 2,5, and 10 stops anyone from providing examples of this as linking to the posts of others has been considered by some to be staling in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend this sub have make a stickied sub in which anyone, including new posts, can post without worrying that they will be attacked for what they say.

        Dude, it's right there, we can all read. It's kinda weird you think we're here, on
        <strong>
         Reddit
        </strong>
        but we can't read. That would be pointless. The evidence
        <strong>
         clearly
        </strong>
        shows that you replied to yourself before switching accounts.

       It shows aleister replied to his comment. Modmail is weird - oftentimes I reply to the most recent messagw to add to the conversation, not necessarily as a reply to the specific mod.

        Shit, I've done it too. We all have. You got busted. At least own it. You're a power mod who cheats with alt accounts. Your whole side does so no biggie...

       Ok so let me dissect this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a drunk and you are equating replying to the wrong person with having a back and forth conversation with yourself... without noticing that you did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You "know" these people online yet you are equating that with knowing them as different people in "real life".
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty funny shit if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know exactly what I'm talking about. Nothing you have posted means shit to me and not a shred of it qualifies as "proof" of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are basically saying "trust me" and guess what? I don't owe you anything and you haven't earned my fucking trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know what I read... and other users here know what they've read... this isn't a drunken mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please (for all of us) make a repost of you replying to yourself... you know... maybe scour your drunken posts? You are ridiculous.

       What I don't get is leaking a mod mail conversation to TMOR.  That raises a flag in my mind and makes me question if the mod that did that was a paid plant.

       SPLC is the anti-thesis of truth.  They are the definition of cheaters with paid messaging and brigades intended to subvert discussion.

       No I didn't lmao. I don't want the mods to censor either, cunt. But the rules should be applied equally. If I get banned questioning a mod, you should be too.

       You SHOULD be perma banned based on my experience on this sub. Get my point yet? Wasn't hard to see through my comment..

       Do you think there's any sub on reddit that doesn't have mod alts? Even this one has several bot accounts, which are also...mod alts. Nothing in reddit's TOS indicates that you can't have alts, only that you're not supposed to ban evade with them as TMOR does.

       This is my first on this sub and I have read the exchange thoroughly and tried to read each comment individually. I noticed they both spell pork chop differently and aleister seems lackadaisical in the reply, but then aleister returns to the thread sloshed, (but with perfect grammar) a recollection of the Swedish couple's discourse turning palpable and making the evening odd. Whatever to all that. My main issue is- if in a casual thread where each person can choose to reply or even partake: what would JCP be getting out of having a literal conversation with himself? Unless I'm missing something. It's either aleister or someone else who forgot to switch????

       I've modded with both for some time now and when this came up I did investigate it to see whether what Dino was saying was true or not. I came to the conclusion of no, they aren't the same person. I used the mod log and also looked at a private sub of ours to determine that
       <a href="/u/JamesColesPardon">
        /u/JamesColesPardon
       </a>
       was in no way instrumental in him becoming a mod to begin with.

       Also aleister is quite the techie and programmer while James never has shown any technical prowess.

       Is there going to be any attempt to get aleister's drinking under control? If this is the official explanation of what's going on here, in addition to his bias as shown in the mod logs when it comes to enforcing the rules, that doesn't seem like a very great person to have in a mod role on this sub.

       There very well could be some users brigading, I'm not denying that. I'm just saying 30 points in one hour in a stickied post is not proof of a brigade. If that's all it took then you could be in every single front page post complaining about brigades.

       What was his bias?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know he would enforce bizarre interpretations of the rules. For example, a SS with 2 sentences, rather than 3 or more, he closed the thread. He closed the thread on a SS with two rhetorical questions rather than 2 sentences.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't remember if it was him or another mod who closed my thread where I had altered the title of the thread of the article I was linking to (ie. the mod was enforcing a r/politics rule).
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah I wonder whether drinking is an excuse for mods with agendas to ban key influences they don't like by arbitarily enforcing bizarre interpretations of the rules to antagonize said users.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course its against the rules to even call them out on this.

       a self-reply isn't conclusive proof of an alt.  It does look a little weird though.

       What does look weird is a mod leaking modmail to TMOR, a sub affiliated with SPLC, which is known to brigade and infiltrate other subs.

       It's interesting the parallels. Instead of being outraged at the action it's who leaked the information in the first place. It's exactly like democrats ignoring the DNC bias and attacking the source of the leak instead of the content.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think both are equally important. The leak and what was leaked.

       I'm pointing out that a r/conspiracy mod leaked to an astroturf subreddit affiliated an NGO known to infiltrate and target other subs.

       Dusty exposed himself in his early days as a mod here, joining the enemy at critical moments, then trying to act as one of us again after.  Seems like he has given up acting now posting on TopMinds, where he has probably been posting for years under another name.  At least this now proves that people on this sub are not simply paranoid about infiltration, as the the TopMinds narrative goes

       Because there has been no shortage of weird mod behavior in this sub.  It seems those that call it out are sometimes banned shortly thereafter, so this seems like an appropriate time to discuss without that risk.

      <p>
       Are there some TMOR people here, sure. No doubt. Did I still upvote the comment because I don’t buy the mods explanation, you’re damn right I did.  Upvotes don’t make me any more wrong or you any more right, but I’m not surprised a conspiracy about the mods is getting upvoted here. Maybe if they didn’t have their own private sub, or a history of multiple accounts, or a history putting things into contest mode unnecessarily, or some sketchy stickies from time to time they’d get more of a benefit of the doubt.

       Now you're lying and saying that I think everyone who disagrees with me is astroturfing. Why are you lying?

       I didn’t lie, I asked you a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don’t tell me to stay on subject, literally every comment of yours on here isn’t on the topic of the mods and is complaining about brigading. And then when I address your direct statements about brigading, because you won’t stay on topic (topic being mods explanation of a shady situation) you accuse me of lying and changing the subject. Christ man, I couldn’t be more on topic, while you seem to only care to deflect away from the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes brigading happens. And this thread very may well be brigaded, it’s stickied, it’s meta, it’s about TMOR, it has all the earmarks if outside votes. You win. I also think the mods are sketchy here sometimes and things like the JCP Aleister thing doesnt help.

       Shit, how about a vote to throw out corrupt mods?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, there may be some good mods thrown out too, but judging by the downvotes in this thread, I'd say we have a pretty good chance of getting rid of the obvious ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that vote will never happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The power structure leaves the users with exactly dick all power except to try to get posts exposing bullshit to the front page, but even then, mods can just delete posts and perma-ban.

       What's really funny is how other "normie" subs like r/insanepeoplefacebook will ban users just for commenting in r/Conspiracy or r/GreatAwakening.

       Mods here could easily do the same to TMOR users and it would

       So, you're claiming that mods don't care about the sub because they allow people to post here. But not only do they not care, it's intentional, because they have a "guilty demeanor" as proven by their awful act of... not banning everyone who posts on another sub.

      <p>
       I've been trying to get that shit exposed for like 3 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've posted hundreds of screencaps of graphs from RedditInsight's [Trackpost](
       <a href="http://www.redditinsight.com/#trackpost">
        www.redditinsight.com/#trackpost
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are definitely some kind of shenanigans going on to keep the good red-pills off the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is some kind of algorithm that controls the score of certain posts or possibly ALL posts. Votes are weighted. New votes will show up on the graph in realtime until Reddit's "vote fuzzing" kicks in, which was explained by Reddit as a way to thwart bots trying to fuck with vote scores.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also allows them to hide ALL new, because the graph goes +1 -1 every 2 seconds. Votes can easily be canceled out in realtime because they can always blame the -1 on the "vote fuzzing".
      </p>
      <p>
       Lot's of problems here. Admins AND mods are implicated in corruption.

       Well, no, but I'm a coward. I wouldn't even be a mod pseudonymously, and I avoid leadership positions IRL because I don't want anyone to notice me.

       You’re absolutely right...I want to help people and I want to have an impact on my community, but I have a lot to lose, and I just don’t want to be hated by strangers. Maybe I’ll get over that some day.

       Late response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey man, i hear ya.  Consider this though.  At no time in this life is it your responsibilty to take care or ensure that everyone.....especially people you
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       know, to have them all accept you.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is not at all a reasonable expectation or requirement for you going on in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strangers be damned!  Besides you come across lime you're greatly concerned with that idea.  You probably are very personally critical of yourself and you would probably conduct yourself just fine even though you over think it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I know how you feel because I think I went through that similar process.  Now, I have made my peace with the idea that I do not.and cannot possibly expect that I can please everyone.  I definitely cannot please people I don't know and haven't even met.  Those people do no think of me in any capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't personally sit at home and stew about all the people you haven't met and would probably dislike and disavree with, do you?  No.  You.....like me....still have our own personal things you focus on and the vast majority of people who would be worthwhile speaking to.....won't be either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides that....even if you managed to piss off some goofball you could speak to that person and clarify yourself and ensure there was no miscommunication.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I see what I went through and still worry about....but less so.  I just like to say the things that helped me get on with life.  I hope it applies and if not....well...its just some text on screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take care out there.

       What do you mean with a long standing history of not leaking, that sounds like there's a lot of stuff you don't want leaked, and are grading mods on their integrity like a msm news outlet would grade their "journalists".

       I think it's a good question, deserves a answer.

       Reason #8309 why Reddit is circling the drain. Moronic, incompetent, power tripping, idealogue, probably mostly paid-off mods are out of control everywhere, clamping down on free speech and pushing their own narratives in its stead. This kind of Mod drama occurs regularly, subs get taken over and we have zero idea what is really going on or who these people are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regular users have zero recourse.  We can't remove them when they tyrannize, selectively enforce their own rules, and hand out bans for anyone who attempts to call them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       A handful of people have taken over and ruined this place, and conspiracy is no different. The mods refuse to do anything about the obvious brigading going on in here, and all of this constant mod shuffling and infighting is sketchy as fuck.

       Reddit was started by 2 guys in their dorm room. It only became that way later once people started telling
       <em>
        too much
       </em>
       truth on it.
      </p>
      <p>

        The very first post on reddit was a conspiracy post!

      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, some years later, it came back up, and someone left this fitting comment:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I no longer believe that Reddit can enrich my life. People can find better news, entertainment, and discussion elsewhere. Reddit is too full of low effort content, gross censorship of both useful and non-useful discourse, and the worst kinds of arguments. I advise everyone to leave and do something more productive with your lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Go read a book, learn a language, talk to a stranger, walk around your neighborhood, take a class, cook a meal, or play with your pet. If you're anything like me, you won't look back and consider the time on Reddit to be life well lived. I hope to see you out there.

       Reddit was started by 3 co-founders; Alexis Ohanian, Steve HUffman, and Aaron Swartz.
      </p>
      <p>
       The site was incubated by those 3 co founders under the umbrella of a company called not a bug inc, which was itself being incubated by Paul graham thought a ycombinator summer camp in 2006.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a backup of the site for the company (as it was sadly taken off line recently)-

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also here's a quote from Alexis himself, from a story that now seems to be scrubbed from the internet on its original URL (
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/startupstories.com/2006/11/29/passion-for-your-users-will-come-back-alexis-ohanian-co-founder/*">

       </a>
       ), confirming Aaron Swartz was a co-founder of reddit;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Paul wanted to give Aaron Swartz, another YC founder, a birthday gift in November. More than anything else, Aaron wanted co-founder so Paul suggested the 'merger'. Merger is probably a bit hyperbolic for what actually happened, Aaron basically moved in with us and we made him a co-founder."-

       Nobody's buying that this happened 'accidentally'. Nobody ever 'accidentally' replies to your own comment. How is a conspiracy sub supposed to function when the mod's themselves are conspiring against the sub? Seriously what the fuck if this sub had ANY integrity or deserved any respect before this it's all gone. This place has never been the same ever since it got The_Cancer.

       Nice attempt at demotivation and division. This is a lame 2-year old talking point and it's never going to work. If you think this place sucks so bad and you're not just trying to demoralize everyone, prove it by leaving and never coming back.

       There seems to be a lot of confusion as to how someone could possibly respond to their own message. Default modmail format is ordered chronologically and does not look like a comment thread out here. Mostly when I’m responding to modmail I reply to the last message that was made, regardless of who made it.

       Do you think there's any sub on reddit that doesn't have mod alts? Even this one has several bot accounts, which are also...mod alts. Nothing in reddit's TOS indicates that you can't have alts, only that you're not supposed to ban evade with them as TMOR does.

       So a mod on here is obviously using an alt, and the mods are concerned that another mod leaked modmail.  That's fucked up.

       I haven’t followed the mod drama over the years but holy shit looking into it some today it just looks like a bunch of partisan fighting and bickering that has gone on for awhile. The bias goes both ways and that’s not what you should get from a neutral mod team just enforcing the rules. The mods opinions come out way to strongly and the only way to stop it is to make a big change.

       But that's not going to happen. This is reddit and no one owes anyone shit. You would prefer this sub to all be people that agreed with one another? Where would you find these perfectly politically neutral (and this is all about politics, it always is with your team) that all agree with each other to run this sub?

       I don’t care if they fight or cuddle but when it comes to enforcing the rules they should be impartial. What they say and do outside of their duties is their own business. It sure looks like they mix their bias into their mod duties and that’s wrong.

       I've said this before on too many forums that have a similar theme.
Yall complain about whatever individuals or groups that you don't like being corrupt in their positions of perceived leadership. Yet #you #cant #run #an #online #forum #without #being #corrupt #yourselves. I'd guess some would say "As above, so below", but to a degree I'd consider that a cop out. If you fancy yourselves leaders, act like it.

       This is weird. IDA never gave me an impression of TMOR though.

       He's been missing forever right?

       I suppose I can see how he may have mistaken for replying twice. But the weird Swedish anti-muslim propaganda is exactly what is expect from the mid who is going to ban me one day for his partisanship. It's nice to see what he thinks of others.

       It’s not really propaganda. There’s even documentaries about Europeans saying parts of their home city don’t look like what it used to. Not really controversial or inciteful. People came over they ate and made statements.

       Your ban was 100% warranted and a comment like that would get anyone banned from most subs on Reddit. Being extremely toxic and calling it 'calling out a user' is lame.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that's bias, try saying things like that about conservatives on here, you'll get banned as fast, if not faster.

       I've been a member of r/conspiracy for 11 years. This sub has never been more compromised than it is now...and I get a sinking feeling that there are mods who are involved with it. The brigading here has never been worse. I have messaged mods during times of severe brigading when it was painfully obvious a received back bitchy replies telling me to prove it...WHAT!?...prove the obvious?? The mods ALLOW brigading to take place and destroy posts. They made no rules to combat it. Any mod worth their weight in salt KNOWS these threads are getting trashed by outside subs...but, at the same time they're gung ho on banning solid legitimate posts for the stupidest shit imaginable...Oh, ONE word in the title was all caps...it "reminded" them of a meme...if a mod has a personal problem with a post, they'll declare it's spam when it clearly is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       So...not surprised at the drama and the personal mod  agendas 
and manipulations...THAT is obvious too.

       What specifically do you think we should do about brigading?  We've reported it to the admins many times and received lukewarm/canned responses at best.  We've experimented with locking threads, setting threads to contest mode, etc.  reddit doesn't really provide many tools to fight brigades with.

       When it becomes apparent that a post is in process of being brigaded, switching to contest mode or a mode that immediately shuts off the accumulative vote counts for the thread that's under attack would leave the thread of the post that is under attack in a more realistic perspective...rather than letting it go on to morph into some perverted version that TMOR would highly approve of.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a war against the truth...whether you want to believe it or not, r/conspiracy  is one of the most highly surveilled forums on the internet... it is constantly under attack. I've been here over a decade and I've seen good times and bad times here. I've had pm's threatening me to shut up or else years ago...now, TMOR is fucking up r/conspiracy the same way they fuck up the conspiracy groups on digg....and just like then, the mods are letting it happen.

       We've experimented with contest mode quite a bit over the last year or so.  Personally I think it sucks because it makes actually tracking discussions/arguments very annoying to do because you constantly have to uncollapse comment threads, but we have tried it with varying levels of success.  As far as switching it to "a mode that immediately shuts off the vote counts", what mode is that?  All anyone has to do in order to get around it is turn off subreddit styles - there isn't any way to actually hide vote counts or prevent upvotes/downvotes.

       I do believe it.  I've been a mod here for 3 or 4 years and was a user for a few years before that, I've seen it first hand for a while now.

       We do tag posts sometimes but ultimately what does that really accomplish?  The brigades are obvious when they occur, as you yourself have admitted, so who is the tag really for?  I think most users of the sub who have been around for a while can spot a brigaded thread from a mile away whether we tag it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that tagging a thread doesn't actually
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       anything to prevent or slow down a brigade.  I don't think that's much of a solution at all to the problem.

       In case you actually aren't aware, it's a reference to the TMOR (formerly conspiratard) crew had a subreddit setup where they would laugh at Rachel Corrie, an American activist who was run over by an armored IDF truck in Gaza.  They would post memes and gifs of pancakes and laugh about it.  These are the types of people we're dealing with.

       I'm not saying I believe that excuse, but if it is true I think the mod team has a bit of a drinking problem. How many times did Flytape go on weird midnight rants and ban sprees and then blame it on being drunk? I seem to recall other mods using the "drunk" excuse several times as well. Just my experience, but if I'm getting drunk at a dinner party with my wife and my Swedish friends I'm not going to spend the time Redditing. This whole situation is weird and this explanation isn't really making it any better.

       As for Flytape, lots of people accused him of using alts over the years but there was never any evidence that I've seen and he always denied it.

       <p>
        I just mixed the two mods up in my head since they seemed to be working together on the troll account and ban tactic.

      <p>
       Yeah, they were always friendly with each other and shared some ideological leanings.  They were also 2 of the 3 mods who were part of the "coup", or whatever you want to call it.  And actually DronePuppet is one of the users who was often accused of being a "Flytape alt", although lots of people have been accused of that.  Even I myself have been accused of being a flytape alt once or twice.

       I had several reasons, but the main one was I found it pointless and a waist of time.  It's just a constraint stream of complaints and debates over thousands of mod actions, right wrong or indifferent.  It's the last thing I need in my life, and just a major distraction from things like family and work.  I come to reddit for entertainment and different views on current events, and being a mod doesn't enhance that.  It's selfish and self centered, but hey, fuck it, it's my life.

       Just the fact that it was done in secret by a select group of users who we are told are more important and trustworthy than the rest of us. I don't think the rest of us would have even seen the nominations if someone hadn't leaked the screenshots.
      </p>

       The fact that one of the new mods has been suspended by admins, you resigned, and now whatever is going on with this one makes me wonder if this really is the best selection process.

       Oh god, sorry! And no, I haven't asked to join. I dislike the whole idea of a secret club, and it's not because I'm not in it. It's the same reason I got annoyed with
       <a href="/r/LegalAdvice">
        /r/LegalAdvice

       . Once you have a special club of "approved" users, they get special treatment and can get away with almost anything. I doubt they'd invite me anyway. Two mods don't exactly like me, and I was included in that persona non grata list the conclave put together a while ago.

       Do you think there's any sub on reddit that doesn't have mod alts? Even this one has several bot accounts, which are also...mod alts. Nothing in reddit's TOS indicates that you can't have alts, only that you're not supposed to ban evade with them as TMOR does.

       I think you're mad that TMOR does brigade but get away because it's a bunch of banned users who aren't brigading but breaking the "rules" to participate with a new account.

       I fully expect T_D and greatawaking people to do the same.

       I didn’t lie, I asked you a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don’t tell me to stay on subject, literally every comment of yours on here isn’t on the topic of the mods and is complaining about brigading. And then when I address your direct statements about brigading, because you won’t stay on topic (topic being mods explanation of a shady situation) you accuse me of lying and changing the subject. Christ man, I couldn’t be more on topic, while you seem to only care to deflect away from the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes brigading happens. And this thread very may well be brigaded, it’s stickied, it’s meta, it’s about TMOR, it has all the earmarks if outside votes. You win. I also think the mods are sketchy here sometimes and things like the JCP Aleister thing doesnt help.
