    <div class="md"><p>Sec_Henry_Paulson covered most of it very well. I only want to add a couple of things.</p>

<p>First, think about what we saw.</p>

<p>We saw two planes crash into two buildings. We saw three buildings fall into their own footprint. When the second plane crashed into the building there was a large fireball that shot out of the building. That was probably most of the jet fuel. The building that was hit second and seemed to have the least amount of jet fuel fell first. </p>

<p>Now in retrospect, we have been shown molten metal from the structures and traces of thermite have been found.</p>

<p>Now, we have some things to explain:</p>

<p>All three buildings fell at near free fall speed which is 10 meters per second squared. That means the speed at which the buildings fell got faster and faster as they fell. That is unexpected. One would expect that the floors below would have provided some resistance causing the building to fall more slowly then near free fall speed.</p>

<p>Why did building 7 fall? No plane small fire. No good reason for a collapse.</p>

<p>Why did the second building fall first? The fire in the second building should have had less jet fuel then the first. The first building&#39;s fire should have caused more structural damage. All other things being equal the first building should have fallen first.</p>

<p>Molten metal was found. None of the expected materials including jet fuel burn hot enough to melt metal.</p>

<p>Traces of thermite were found. Thermite will melt metal and can be used to cut steal and can be used for a controlled demolition.</p>

<p>So, if you have a sound background in science, especially physics, you notice several unexpected behaviors. That is suspicious. The traces of thermite make things a bit more clear. The unexpected behavior was due to missing information. If the support structures were cut by thermite during the collapse of each building you would expect them to fall at near free fall speed. You would expect molten metal and you now have a reason for the building 7 collapse. Finally, if controlled demolition brought the buildings down then there is an explanation for why the least damaged building fell first (least damaged of the two towers not including building 7).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Instead of an article, let&#39;s just look at this using our own powers of observation, and common sense.</p>

<p>The biggest argument for controlled demolition is the fact that the buildings collapsed completely... all the way to the ground.</p>

<p>How can this be explained without the use of explosives?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s think about this.</p>

<p>You have the top of each tower, which represents 1/4-1/5 the total size of the whole building breaking off, and somehow pushes itself through the remainder of the building at speeds which approach freefall?</p>

<p>The important thing to remember here is the core of each of these buildings.  47 steel box columns, sticking straight up into the air.  We&#39;re being told that this structure gave almost no resistance to the floors above it?</p>

<p>More about the core:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ11i6fi7KQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ11i6fi7KQ</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.picassodreams.com/.a/6a00d83455ad0369e201053566d3df970b-800wi">http://www.picassodreams.com/.a/6a00d83455ad0369e201053566d3df970b-800wi</a></p>

<p>Moreover, it becomes increasingly suspicious when the 9/11 commission deliberately describes the core of the building as being hollow, and that the weight was born by the exterior of the building.  i think most people, given the evidence, should have no problems realizing that this is simply not true.</p>

<p>Think about it like this.  Even if you could take 1/4 of the top of the world trade center off, drag that portion of the building a thousand feet in the air and then drop it on the remainder of the building, i would not expect the building to collapse completely to the ground.</p>

<p>also, keep in mind that even in the lengthy NIST report, it is never explained how the buildings came to the ground.  </p>

<p>in the report, after describing the possible conditions necessary for the building to start to fail, they use the phrase &quot;and then global collapse began&quot; .. as if the complete destruction of the building down to the street level could be written off by a single sentence like it were expected behavior.</p>

<p>i, for one, would like an explanation.</p>

<p>then you have building 7 actually falling at freefall speed, which seems to defy logic.  other clues include the pulverized concrete, eyewitness testimony, video recording from that day, and the molten steel and extremely high underground temperatures that lasted for nearly a month, etc.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good video on the subject that I hope you take the time to consider</p>

<p><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3760797491142118919">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3760797491142118919</a></p>

<p>The first part of the video is what I want you to watch.  It&#39;s got long long portions of video footage all from 9/11.  No commentary or opinion, you&#39;re just watching the same stuff that was being broadcast on TV that day.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s up to you whether or not you want to watch some of the analysis toward the end.  </p>

<p>Anyway, just take some time to look at everything again and be willing to be open to other possibilities.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to have expectations of any kind about what might happen here.  When things get bigger than cars and houses, everyday experience is not helpful in predicting results.</p>

<p>That said, your main point is still valid.  I would say it more like this:</p>

<p>It seems very unlikely to an ordinarily rational mind that a fire, even if driven by petrochemicals, would end in total collapse and complete obliteration of a huge structure built from lots of steel and concrete, even one with a hole in it.</p>

<p>Cf. Fireman training towers.  Admittedly they don&#39;t burn for hours, but they burn over and over and over again.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to add that I can&#39;t understand how there was so little debris left after these building collapsed, like almost the entire thing was just pulverized into dust and what about the buildings steel support beams? I don&#39;t understand where they went. If the building collapsed the way reported I would expect that it would have fallen a lot slower and that we&#39;d have atleast a few of the floors stacked on the ground and you&#39;d see the steel support beams remaining pointed into the sky. Building 7 makes even less sense. How it even collapsed for a start, but the big thing for me is that I personally just can&#39;t understand how anyone can reasonably believe that it too would then fall at like freefall speed and also leave behind almost no debris. I mean really? I&#39;m not trying to be condescending or anything, but I just can&#39;t understand that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the points I like to make to which the deniers have no <em>real</em> answer except phrases like &quot;the weight of a 110-story buliding could crush anything&quot; and the like.</p>

<p>But there are two more salient points the deniers just go silent on.  One is that the central core of the building, 56 stories high, was made of a vertival cement-reinforced I-beams in a cluster numbering between 50 and 75 (the exact number escapes me).</p>

<p>Where did this enormously strong core go?  Pulverized, and neatly broken off in flatbed-sized pieces?  Interesting.  How, exactly, did that occur, without steel-cutting thermate or thermite strategically placed?</p>

<p>The second point is that the designer accounted for the possiblity of not only <strong>one</strong> plane hitting one of these towers, but <strong>multiple</strong> plane strikes. &quot;It will be like a pencil puncturing a screen&quot;, he said, it will make a hole, but the rest of the structure will be undamaged.&quot;</p>

<p>To which the deniers cry &quot;well. they were using much smaller planes at the time&quot; as if this totally negates the original design&#39;s strength against such an event.  Baloney.</p>

<p>The papers on progressive collapse and NIST provide a pretty compelling explanations.  But I&#39;m wanting to know how CD explains it.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d use the phrase &quot;breaking off&quot;, that makes me think more of an ice berg than a collapsing building.  </p>

<p>I wish I could have watched it in double speed.  I&#39;m not sure anyone is disputing the WTC blue prints, are they?</p>

<p>I liked the second link.  Hadn&#39;t seen particular pic before.  It does a great job of explaining the structure.  </p>

<p>Lots of idiotic things were said in the 9/11 commission.  Suspicious or not it doesn&#39;t provide evidence of controlled demolition just that the 9/11 commission wasn&#39;t very intelligent. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Why not?  How is the new top floor going to arrest the mass and momentum of the 1/4 of building hitting it?  I&#39;d have to see some analysis, this just doesn&#39;t seem believable. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>also, keep in mind that even in the lengthy NIST report, it is never explained how the buildings came to the ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>6.14.4 (p.196)  Does a pretty apt job of explaining it.  But from your next statement I get what your question is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in the report, after describing the possible conditions necessary for the building to start to fail, they use the phrase &quot;and then global collapse began&quot; .. as if the complete destruction of the building down to the street level could be written off by a single sentence like it were expected behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you are wanting.  Do you expect them to explain how every truss, beam, and bolt broke on the way down?  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible. They have another section that talks about the most common failures of the of the recovered steel. 6.4 It&#39;s actually a pretty interesting section.  I wouldn&#39;t have expected the welds to hold up so well and that bolt sheer would be so common.  </p>

<p>I also don&#39;t understand how if one floor is going to fail the next floor is going to be any better at holding up the now increasing amount of crap coming down?  Are you saying you don&#39;t believe NIST&#39;s explanation of how the floor collapsed or that you want to know why the floor under it wasn&#39;t able to hold up to the mass and momentum of the collapsing floor?</p>

<p>I&#39;m also failing to see how this provides evidence for CD? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>i, for one, would like an explanation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, but how does that imply controlled demolition?  So far all I&#39;m seeing are questions about the NIST reports and the 9/11 commission.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then you have building 7 actually falling at freefall speed, which seems to defy logic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it&#39;s so easy, why have there been no peer reviewed papers on how building 7 couldn&#39;t have fallen as stated in the NIST report?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>pulverized concrete  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the concrete should have stayed in fist sized chunks?  why?  Does controlled demolition only produce pulverized concrete?  Do you have some evidence to support this?  I&#39;m really looking for evidence. So far there as been a lot of questions and conjecture.  </p>

<p>Could you be more specific on these points?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen no evidence of molten steel. Mostly, I don&#39;t understand how controlled demolition produces molten steel?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The 9/11 commission report is not a technical report or an engineering study.  It should not be considered as such.</p>

<p>What would stop the collapse?  You should read Samboti&#39;s paper &quot;The missing jolt&quot; and then the rebutal to it.  It addresses this claim directly.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a thread at <a href="http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=140639">Jref</a>  Only pay attention to RedIbis, and metamars (truthers) and Mackey, Grizzly Bear, Newtons Bit, David James (debunkers).  Its a good discussion if you can stand the pointless bickering.</p>

<p>No, but in their report they took the time to spell out details about the building design and factors that lead to the collapse, some of which are blatantly not true. Why am I not allowed to point this out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your input, but I didn&#39;t even touch on thermite or the sounds of the explosions, although one of my video links does.  </p>

<p>also the molten metal i only just mentioned by name, and didn&#39;t go into detail about it because it&#39;s not the core of my argument.</p>

<p>basically what i&#39;m trying to say is this.</p>

<p>&quot;It does not make any sense to me that 1/4 of the building with no external forces other than gravity can destroy the remaining 3/4 of the building, leaving a pile of almost nothing behind.  It defies logic to me that the steel structure that comprised the core of each building put up no resistance to the collapse of the buildings.  I have not seen sufficient evidence in my eyes that would show how global collapse is possible.  The way this event is written off in both technical and non-technical reports only raises more questions about why such an anomaly was not investigated properly.  I am not saying what did or did not happen, but given everything that I have been witness to, I retain my right to be skeptical about the nature of the tower&#39;s destruction.&quot; </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a 9 second video that may still be the most convincing to me:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD06SAf0p9A">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD06SAf0p9A</a></p>

<p>These buildings stand for 100 or more years - yet this one fell without being hit by an airliner, all in one smooth motion.</p>

<h2>Also, where are the flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders?</h2>

<p>They are built to survive crashes directly into mountains; yet somehow they were destroyed when they hit mostly hollow buildings? It seems extremely unlikely, yet that is the official version of events.</p>

<p>Scepticism is quite fine: but it works both ways, for all the conspiracy theories (and there are extremely unsupported ones out there) and for the official conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>I myself am not convinced of anything except that the official version of events is not supported by a sufficiently convincing amount of evidence.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, all I can say is that I dont know what happened in the United States on September 11th 2001, and expect that I will not for a very long time.</p>

<p>I agree it seems strange that they never were able to find these.  Even if they weren&#39;t able to recover data, I still think they should have been able to find them in the wreckage.   </p>

<p>No, it&#39;s pretty standard.</p>

<p>I am not a structural engineer, so maybe it is entirely possible that buildings fall in that fashion, and maybe NIST is correct in what they are saying (I have not read the report, so I dont have any basis to criticize it).</p>

<p>It is not that I have evidence of controlled demolition, or evidence of this or that, I have no evidence, and the &quot;evidence&quot; I have seen is not quite convincing.</p>

<p>Problem is, this applies to both what the &quot;truthers&quot; and the government says - neither side is very convincing.</p>

<p>Until there&#39;s a public adversarial trial (not Gitmo courts) and I can see all the evidence in public and see the cross-ex, I will likely remain unconvinced.</p>

<p>Thanks for keeping an open mind about this.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>BTW - Have you read the 9/11 Report? You&#39;ll find some extremely interesting things in there, especially about how FBI informants seem to know about the hijackers long before 2001, pretty much since they stepped foot into the US, apparently met at a Halal food shop... It&#39;s an extremely interesting report with tons of &quot;interesting&quot; facts neither the truthers nor the main stream seem to be catching onto. Probably because the both sides have a real aversion to &quot;reading&quot; more than anything :-)</p>

<p>I will be more convinced because I can have professionals on either side trying to convince me using evidence and counter evidence: both with access to ALL of the evidence.</p>

<p>yea, read the NIST report on the actual collapse.  The government still has a lot to answer for in regards to them actually using our tax dollars in a productive way to stop terrorist attacks.</p>

<p>Well read the NIST report.  I still won&#39;t trust the 911 commission, but you should at least read the whole of the NIST reports.  They really do have a lot of information.</p>

<p>Considering the whole thing was uncontrolled - and conditions from one side of the tower to the other were different on the infrastructure... how the hell did it go down all at once?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am very saddened by the lack of actual article links in the replies, but reflects a sad reality in conspiracy circles: &#39;common sense&#39; prevails over hard fact. I mean, you can&#39;t prove anything with these observations of something not being right, you can at most illicit interest in further research and now we&#39;re being asked for the research, not reasons to doubt. I hope it took more than the statements given to convince these guys of their &#39;truth&#39;. Common sense/logic is needed of course when making decisions on the evidence, <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/proofs/index.html">and here is some that refer</a> to the points that he was referring to.</p>

<p>Now, as to the articles asked for, let&#39;s start with <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/collapses/concrete.html">concrete puliverization</a> in mid-air, <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/metallurgy/index.html">metallurgy studies</a> suggesting explosives, <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/thermite/explosive_residues.html">thermite residues</a> found in the dust and finish with <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/wtc7/demolition.html">WTC 7</a> which I think has such clear evidence for controlled demolition I shall link no more unless requested.</p>

<p>If you still want more, I recommend <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/">AE911Truth</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/ppt_web/ppt_selection.php">slide presentation</a>.</p>

<p>The fact isn&#39;t that the answers are really out there and being hidden, the fact is that <em>true investigations</em> into what the hell happened are totally thwarted and the evidence has mostly been destroyed/scrapped/moved who-knows-where, although further analysis <em>is</em> possible. So let&#39;s get some better answers. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQLFUYX2pfo">If they spent 100 million on the Clinton investigation they can spend more than 4 million on 9/11</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this is much closer to what I was hoping people would post.  Though I&#39;ve already read/seen most of it.  Here is my take.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/proofs/index.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/proofs/index.html</a></p>

<p>The towers fell faster than they could have if they were crushing themselves. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This mostly boils down to </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If air resistance is able to increase total collapse times by even 20 percent, then shouldn&#39;t the addition of the resistance of the buildings themselves increase the time several thousand percent, to at least tens of minutes?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fine but lets see some proof, are there any papers supporting this?  I always run into this when looking for answers.  A reasonable hypothesis without anything to back it up.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The volume of dust was too great to have been the product of a gravity-driven collapse. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has similar problems and how would CD account for the dust cloud?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The South Tower&#39;s top shattered before falling, and so its breakup was not a result of gravity-driven crushing. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The images are pretty blurry but I see their point.  It does look like the upper floors are not staying as intact as one would assume. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/collapses/concrete.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/collapses/concrete.html</a></p>

<p>F. R. Greening has a pretty good paper explaining this and it doesn&#39;t point to CD.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think there has been a good explanation of why WTC 7 had eutectic reactions in the steel.  I&#39;m not sure how this points to CD though.   </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Honestly I&#39;d like to see some supporting evidence for Thermite.  Just because one person says it&#39;s there doesn&#39;t really strike me as proof of it.  Hopefully this will be more clear over the next year.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but &#39;it looks like a CD&#39; isn&#39;t very good evidence.  It also looks like a progressive collapse.</p>

<p>wow, I&#39;m sorry but I could only get about 25 slides in.  Is there something particular in there?</p>

<p>Thanks for the response.  I totally agree that there could have been a much better investigation. I don&#39;t even think it needed more money.  Just the ability to not get deceived by government agencies would have been a big improvement.</p>

<p>Berkeley, CA, April 23, 2009— A team of scientists that includes 9/11 luminaries Steven Jones, Kevin Ryan, and seven other authors from three countries announced this month the long-awaited publication of their 25-page article &quot;Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/14825320/Thermite-Discovered-in-Dust-from-the-911-WTC">Here is a slide presentation</a> by Dr. Steven E. Jones, PhD (whoever he is ;) telling about thermite.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrj22lX8Bdo">Zero: An Investigation Into 9/11</a> covers some specialists who have studied the residues of the WTC buildings (link to the third part that covers thermite, whole documentary is recommended viewing).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  I don&#39;t really find fault with NIST&#39;s conclusions. Though, I believe their analysis of WTC 7 will never be fully be complete.  The real issue is with the 9/11 commission report.  It should have been handled much more like the church commission and I believe needs to be redone.  </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t spend $4 million on 9/11. The 9/11 Commission cost around $15 million, and that wasn&#39;t the only investigation. Strange how Jesse Ventura says it on TV and it starts being repeated as fact shortly thereafter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there is the copious video, in which the ration of rubble to dust is very low (i.e. mostly particulates, rather than chunks).</p>

<p>This does go against common sense, although admittedly common sense does not always apply to the actual world, especially to events that are quite a ways outside normal experience.</p>

<p>Speaking of experience, my own is with dropping cinderblocks from 3 stories or so.  They tend to shatter--into chunks, with only a little bit of particulates.  Which is pretty much not what happened to the WTC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never run across one single article that included enough evidence to be convincing all by itself. There are literally thousands of articles with a lot of duplication and occasionally one mentions something few others do. It seems to me there is really very little damning physical evidence of demolitions. 99% of the evidence is in recorded events in the days, weeks and even years leading up to 9/11 and in the days and years since. To me that is all circumstantial but is overwhelming nonetheless. Some of the video evidence is fairly convincing too but hardly &quot;proof&quot;.</p>

<p>Still, here&#39;s a pretty good one about access by Kevin Ryan (fired from UL for his stance on 9/11):</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FH I too am a skeptic. There are a few things that have me leaning over into 9/11 deception: Jesse Ventura did an interview with Alex Jones and JV has a background in...DEMOLITION. He had some very convincing arguments as to how buildings are supposed to fall and not fall. How they should sandwich instead of free fall in the way that they did.</p>

<p>The other point is it is the only steel structure in the history of the world to collapse from a fire. There are examples of other skyscrapers that had burned many hours longer and never collapsed.</p>

<p>Still a skeptic but the arguments are interesting.</p>

<p>The active thermitc paper is a joke to everyone but truthers.</p>

<p>The other red flags are the fact that these samples have not been independently verified, and that the samples were literally scooped up by someone in the days following 9/11 from their windowsill.  The fundamentals of this research are tenuous at best.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not dodging anything.  In my initial response I linked to the NIST WTC 7 FAQ that answers this exact question.  If you are going to dismiss that with the wave of a hand, what if anything do you expect me to say to change your mind? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/wtc_qa_082108.html">WTC 7 FAQ</a></p>

<p><a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/NCSTAR1Aindex.htm">WTC 7 Final Report</a></p>

<p>Why are we ignoring the towers, the poser above you seemed pretty happy to regurgitate talking points about them?  No one seems to care that those points were false, and we just keep going with debunked theory after debunked theory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WTC 7 was on fire for 6-7 hours.  The fire was started by falling debris from the towers. </p>

<p>So do you want to talk about the nano thermite article now?  Or are you going to ignore all its problems and continue to cite it as irrefutable?  Are you also going to stop saying that the steel was melted?  Because no one claims that except ignorant truthers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mentioned the paper on the side, my main point was WTC7. Of course I&#39;m sure you&#39;d love to concentrate on that paper.</p>

<p>What exactly was it in WTC7 that burned for 6-7 hours and was hot enough to weaken steel?</p>

<p>I also suppose it was just chance that FEMA was already set up the day before, that the vaults under the WTC were freshly cleared, and that 3 steel buildings fell due to fire all on the same day, the first time fire has ever destroyed a steel building and it took out 3 at the same time. I also suppose it was just chance that one of the FBI&#39;s main guys in charge of finding bin Laden was assigned chief security office of the WTC right before the planes hit.</p>

<p>Read history, this story&#39;s happened over and over again. You wanna start a war? Fake an attack. Or turn a blind eye to an attack that&#39;s already coming.</p>

<p>Good Luck. </p>

<p>edit: Oh, one other, a recent find (for me), though no recent film--<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6260646431723948415">The Capitalist Conspiracy by G. Edward Griffin</a>.  It shows the international banking connection(s), the shock-and-awe, problem-reaction-solution, and neo-con doctrines, false flag and covert interventionist policy events--both planned and unrealized and fully opeational--, as well as COINTELPRO-like operations that go <em>beyond</em> infiltration to actually <em>funding and organizing</em> reactionary anti-government groups within the country.

<p>It was also built after the NIST report on WTC 1 +2 the  recommendations made were more than likely followed specifically to allow the building to withstand a global fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.debunk911myths.org/topics/1945_B-25_bomber_crash">B25 vs 767</a>.  Clearly there is a disparity in the size of the planes, the amount of fuel and potential energy.  There are also fundamental differences in building construction and design.</p>

<p>Look at the robustness of the <a href="http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/art/photo/hinex/empire/interior.html">ESB</a> vs The <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mlPoGU4VqSk/SMktHhYAe3I/AAAAAAAADOU/zTe6r0oK2ZI/s400/site1099.jpg">WTC </a>  The WTC towers were designed to maximize floor space where at the ESB was designed primarily to be tall and strong.  Construction techniques and engineering changes allowed for this.  If a 767 hit the ESB it would not collapse.  WTC 1 +2 are unique skyscraper designs.</p>

<p>WTC and the Mandrin are similar only in height.  The designs are much different.  For one WTC had long span floor trusses that would not pass building code today.  WTC 7 was also hit by falling debris from the collapse of the towers. <a href="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/wtc_qa_082108.html">NIST</a> can explain it better than me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The WTC was also designed to withstand a jet impact.  They specifically engineered the buildings to be resistant to what happened on 9/11.  And we&#39;re supposed to believe the engineering failed that spectacularly?  So poorly designed and constructed that a small fire in one of the buildings is enough to make it implode?  3 buildings all fell straight down on the same day.

<blockquote>
<p>The World Trade Center was designed to withstand the force from the impact of a Boeing 707, lost in the fog and travelling at a relatively slow speed of 180 miles per hour</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leslie Robertson has also said that they had no way to model how the fire would spread, and they didn&#39;t account for the jet fuel.  Though realistically a plane looking to land would have considerably less fuel than one taking off.  It wasn&#39;t just fires either that caused 1+2, it was structural damage coupled with fire damage that led to the collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From an eariler post I made in this thread</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not dodging anything.  In my initial response I linked to the NIST WTC 7 FAQ that answers this exact question.  If you are going to dismiss that with the wave of a hand, what if anything do you expect me to say to change your mind? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/wtc_qa_082108.html">WTC 7 FAQ</a></p>

<p><a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/NCSTAR1Aindex.htm">WTC 7 Final Report</a></p>

<p>Why are we ignoring the towers, the poser above you seemed pretty happy to regurgitate talking points about them?  No one seems to care that those points were false, and we just keep going with debunked theory after debunked theory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WTC 7 was on fire for 6-7 hours.  The fire was started by falling debris from the towers. </p>

<p>So do you want to talk about the nano thermite article now?  Or are you going to ignore all its problems and continue to cite it as irrefutable?  Are you also going to stop saying that the steel was melted?  Because no one claims that except ignorant truthers.</p>

<p>Nonetheless we can all agree that the amount of effort and resources into getting things straight lacked appallingly.</p>
