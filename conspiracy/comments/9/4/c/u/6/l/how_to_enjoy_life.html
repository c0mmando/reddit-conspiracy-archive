    <div class="md"><p>Enjoy life by seeing it for what it is. If it really is all just by chance, a cosmic accident- then we have to take solace in the fact that we are all, together, brothers and sisters on this journey through the cosmos on board spaceship Earth. Blessed to, at this very moment in time- some 14 billion years after the formation of the cosmos, be experiencing this universe of ours <em>together</em>.</p>

<p>Friends, Family, and personal fulfillment. The third will often come with a focus on the first two- as well as speaking honestly to ones&#39; self about what one desires out of life. If you seek to change your life, and your world- start by finding how you fit into your local community and work outwards from there.</p>

<p>No snowflake thinks it is responsible for the avalanche, but they <em>all</em> are. Same goes for good things in life too. As Tolkien said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Together we work everyday to make a better world. Stay strong out there friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Life is what we make of it. It wasn&#39;t meant to be enjoyed or to be suffered. It wasn&#39;t even &quot;meant&quot; to be, let alone to develop conscious understanding of itself. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve moved outside of the paradigm. We are the masters of our own perception because of the tools granted us by our Consciousness. This divide between Conscious and Instinct is the very thing that leads to what we call the &quot;Human Condition&quot; imo... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mars is just a trifle in the grand scheme, if we play our cards right. That would be merely a first step. TPTB don&#39;t seem to me to particularly care about Space- they want to squabble over this tiny spec of dust we already have, and reduce the population on it to boot!</p>

<p>EM Drive, Alcubierre Drive etc; is the future. We must get off of Earth and we must get out of our own Solar system. Whether this is possible is entirely within our hands- I believe that, technologically, it <em>is</em> possible (even if not possible today). But I also believe that our folly as a species has all the capabilities to destroy us and any hope of reaching the stars long before then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel that if we are to ensure the survival of Humanity then we <em>must</em> spread it. And I think this can and in fact will be peaceful- space is a big place- even if ET is abundant there will still be plenty of planets void of life and perfect for colonization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what they mean is that hedonism is not the way. indulging in what enjoys you, feeding your vices, developing deep cravings and thereinbye developing deep aversions; such pursuits will not lead you to your ultimate goal. if one wishes to do this, one should raise their conciousness, and attempt to develop a deep understanding of reality. if you&#39;re interested in the answer to your question, there is a path for you my friend. Pay attention to those moments in life where your heart comes alive: a fiery enthusiasm.  Know that the heart is the beginning of the path; ask it a question, seek the answer. Some of the biggest questions of the heart unfold as a path, not an answer. We experience the wisdom of Truth through personal experience, always. Never forget how you experience the Truth is dictated by your Paradigm. Bigger truths, longer paths. Your first steps down this path will be as a newborn, so do not berate yourself if you stumble. Grow on this path, and you will find your answer. You won&#39;t believe what happens next.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop trying so hard to find enjoyment in the system. You and every individual are born with the capability to enjoy life, and it starts with love. You have to show other people love if you don&#39;t want to become a bitter old fuck, whether or not you feel like youve received love. The barrier to this, in my opinion, is the ego. So a good starting point would be to draw the line between <em>you</em> and &quot;you&quot;.(your true self, not what you identify as in this life vs. Your ego, what you identify as). When you realize it&#39;s not about &quot;you&quot;, then the capability to give and receive love is greatly enhanced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get rid of social media. Don’t listen to the fear mongering media. Socialize with people, lend a helping hand where possible. </p>

<p>Looking at conspiracies all day can become emotionally/mentally draining. It’s easy to get sucked into a void of darkness when you read all of this negative stuff all the time. Take a break if needed. Go out to a park with some friends and enjoy nature, humanity has pushed nature away. Life can still be full of happiness, you just have to look for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Life is what we make of it. It wasn&#39;t meant to be enjoyed or to be suffered. It wasn&#39;t even &quot;meant&quot; to be, let alone to develop conscious understanding of itself. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve moved outside of the paradigm. We are the masters of our own perception because of the tools granted us by our Consciousness. This divide between Conscious and Instinct is the very thing that leads to what we call the &quot;Human Condition&quot; imo... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what they mean is that hedonism is not the way. indulging in what enjoys you, feeding your vices, developing deep cravings and thereinbye developing deep aversions; such pursuits will not lead you to your ultimate goal. if one wishes to do this, one should raise their conciousness, and attempt to develop a deep understanding of reality. if you&#39;re interested in the answer to your question, there is a path for you my friend. Pay attention to those moments in life where your heart comes alive: a fiery enthusiasm.  Know that the heart is the beginning of the path; ask it a question, seek the answer. Some of the biggest questions of the heart unfold as a path, not an answer. We experience the wisdom of Truth through personal experience, always. Never forget how you experience the Truth is dictated by your Paradigm. Bigger truths, longer paths. Your first steps down this path will be as a newborn, so do not berate yourself if you stumble. Grow on this path, and you will find your answer. You won&#39;t believe what happens next.</p>
