       I am one of the students who attended the students' movement in Bangladesh.  All we wanted was safe transportation and justice for our fellow brothers and sisters who got killed in road accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       We started our protest 5 days ago. We were attacked by police severel times. But on August 4 everything got serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some girls who were protesting got abducted by some people who works for our government known as "chatro league".  Some of them were raped.
Chatro league attacked us with guns and other weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our age was 15-18. We were unarmed.  We couldn't flee from what we were doing for last 4 days. Some of us fought back. The police force didn't help us. They were only standing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, 3-4 of  our dear classmates got killed by our own government. Many got seriously injured.  Many of us are missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The situation has gotten worse. We are getting death threats by those government people through social media. Our brothers are not safe. Our sisters are not safe. I am not safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is wanting safe transportation and justice that bad???
      </p>
      <p>
       What should we do then??
      </p>
      <p>
       We are hopeless.  You won't understand how hard we worked for this protest. Our only goal was to make our country a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that a sin??
      </p>
      <p>
       These are not my own words. These are the words of every youth of Bangladesh.
      </p>
      <p>
       WE WILL ALWAYS LOVE OUR COUNTRY.

       OP needs to just STFU and leave before I embarass them further on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were as fucking concerned as the legit student who came crying to reddit for support, you'd be taking pictures of the atrocities as well and showing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       and now, any pictures you do post will be heavily suspect, and i would encourage my fellow r/conspiracy users to make liberal use of TinEye if this guy starts throwing up photos from Bangladesh.

       A) Stop visibly protesting. Try not to get killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Put chalk everywhere. Make your slogan, "Drive safely!"' with a smiley face, or some culturally appropriate equivalent. Or, if you want to link your movement to the Koran, make your slogan something like, "Mohammad: Tie up your camel!"
      </p>
      <p>
       C) Ask everyone to chalk the slogan somewhere one time per week, when no one is watching. Try to wear clothes that will make it hard for anyone to identify you in a security camera video.
      </p>
      <p>
       D) Be safe pedestrians and drivers yourself, and ask everyone on your side to set a good example. Be the change.
      </p>
      <p>
       E) Whenever you're involved with any kind of culture, equate bad driving with weakness.

      <p>
       my answer to your following questions
      </p>
      <p>
       1)
      </p>
      <p>
       We started our protest after a serious road accident.  This accident killed 3 students and injured 12-15. Sadly the driver did not get any major punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such accidents occur in our country everyday.  Mostly because of unlicensed drivers. Those unlicensed drivers can roam freely because of our corrupt traffic police and corrupt transportation system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our protest was to put an end to this and bring justice for the students who died.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the day of that accident thousands of students gathered in some of the major roads of the capital to grab the attention of our government. We brought banners and placards. We were shouting "we want justice" "we want safe roads" all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       We,  thousands of students started doing what our police couldn't do. We stopped cars started checking license during our protest. And we found lots of unlicensed drivers and forced the police to fine them and write files. We went live on social medias. So, the police were forced to do it. We presented 9 point demand. This 9 point demand were  not that hard for our government to keep.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is funny to realize that we even found police without license. For the first 
time in our history we forced a police to fine himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       We controlled car lane too .  For the first time of our history we created imergency lane for ambulances and  others. We planned on doing this untill our demands were met.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a peaceful protest. We didn't harm any property. We stopped our protest during important times. So that our beloved country wont have to suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)
      </p>
      <p>
       In our country,  students politics exists. Students start doing politics from Universities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chatro League is such a party who works for our government. They abuse their power brutally sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it breaks our heart that they are our seniors and they are students just like us.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)
      </p>
      <p>
       We were bigger in number. We have history where similar incidents happened and we stood up for our rights against stronger force. Thus we gained our liberty and our language. If you read about our language movement that happened in 1952 you will understand.  Students like us gave their life for the language we speak now.
      </p>
      <p>
       This are the history we have been taught since we were child. These stories always motivates us. That's why student movement is big thing here.
      </p>
      <p>
       When were attacked yesterday they were abducting our sisters. They were beating our brothers with heavy weapons in groups. So we attacked them with what we had to save our brothers and sisters. We used sticks and we threw bricks and stones. But everything got bloody when they drew guns.

       A lot of the accounta cropping up to post stuff from bangladezh are behaving very strangely. Posting things like that picture of a man who supposedly had his eyes gauged out but they're covered in the pic and there's no reason to believe he doesn't have eyes. They post claiming the government is perpetrating genocide in some cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's shit going down in Bangladesh but a lot of it is unsubstantiated and people will always present information that puts their aide in good light.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know that we will ever get the real information but I'm somewhat hesitant to buy into anything 100%.

       I'm calling out OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe OP to be full of shit, and merely pretending to act like a Bangladeshi in order to reap Karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP ceased posting on any subreddits or comments as of 24 days ago and as of today, he has done nothing but ride on the back of this tragedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, OP's prior post history is inconsistent with the timeline of atrocities currently at play here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been roughly 8 days of human suffering in Bangladesh and yet this guy can't be bothered to say anything, but the dude I'd posted about had been frantic about it for days on end, and with chilling images that frankly made me vomit.
      </p>
      <p>
       your attempt at reaping karma and trying to pass yourself off as one of the affected, makes me want to vomit.

       you really think i will waste my time to reap karma on reddit after facing such horror. if you dont believe read bbc, al jazeera, foxnews.  they have already posted about yesterday's incident. but they lack lots of important facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       im only here on behalf of my fellow brothers and sisters who protested with me. im only here for the soul of my brothers and sisiters who got killed yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
       we are not getting any support from our government, our media,  our police force. I posted here to let you guys know what really happened.  Support from you guys is all we want. We are hopeless. 
 thank you

       I do think it matters. I don't think you are a fraud, I think you should verify your claims to lend credence to your voice and message. It should be easy to add a couple pictures, many people are asking for proof, you should provide it.

       what do you want me to do??  post a pic of myself here in this subreddit??
      </p>
      <p>
       i am posting this here anonymously here on reddit because of safety issue. many of us are getting arrested now for talking publicly  against our government.  If you want to know about the situation you read articles on several news source. You can use the hashtag given on Facebook to know what other youths like me are going through.

       When the pro war western MSM and the affiliated sites all scream the same tune about problems in some poor country somewhere I always look it up on the map.

      <p>
       Bangladesh is right in the middle of india and china. Hot spot of Brics and chinas silk road. Nice and coastal.
      </p>
      <p>
       US pro war media only cares about a crisis that can be sensationalised in order to sway public opinion in getting US military deplomacy involved. When there are protests, and injustices going on in other nations its all hush hush. But let there be an incident from a target country and bam. We get posts like this, on all the key subs.

       The location and timing of this, is far too convinient.

       Yup unfortunately something similar has been happening in Nicaragua for the past 3 months with over 350 people killed yet it’s not really being covered by the media here. The people doing the killing are the police/paramilitary groups payed by the government.

       i saw some youtube video, where they calculated, using a host of factors - coast, rivers, plain green land etc., and it resulted in the area around Bangladesh as being the best place to live on earth. Probably why it's the most densely populated area in the world.

       I'll also just add that these covert coups
       <em>

       start with an alleged university protest gone violent at the hands of an allegedly terrible, oppressive state. People really should learn more about color revolutions.

       Bangladesh in particular is, as you said, a CIA-controlled hotspot. Mohammed Yunus isn't the saint everyone thinks him to be, and I'd be very curious as to those actual microloan recipients. We should follow up with some and see if they still have their kidneys in tact.

       When underage/college protests happen, it's usually not peaceful and many crimes are committed by the protesters. Seriously 15-18 year olds? Tell me the full story. you kids are willing to get killed over public transport? You're crying for help but why are only the young participating? Do your parents support this?

       We started our protest after a serious road accident. A bus with unlicensed driver ran over a crowd of students who were waiting at the bus stop. This accident killed more than 3 students and injured 12-15. Sadly the driver did not get any major punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such accidents occur in our country everyday.  Mostly because of unlicensed drivers. Those unlicensed drivers can roam freely because of our corrupt traffic police and corrupt transportation system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our protest was to put an end to this and bring justice for the students who died.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the day of that accident thousands of students gathered in some of the major roads of the capital to grab the attention of our government. We brought banners and placards. We were shouting "we want justice" "we want safe roads" all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       We,  thousands of students started doing what our police couldn't do. We stopped cars started checking license during our protest. And we found lots of unlicensed drivers and forced the police to fine them and write files. We went live on social medias. So, the police were forced to do it. We presented 9 point demand. This 9 point demand were  not that hard for our government to keep.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is funny to realize that we even found police without license. For the first 
time in our history we forced a police to fine and file a report of himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       We controlled car lane too .  For the first time in our history we created immergency lane for ambulances and  others. We planned on doing this untill our demands were met.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a peaceful protest. We didn't harm any property. We stopped our protest during important times. So that our beloved country won't have to suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly we did cause suffer. Because of our movement unwanted traffic jams were created. There were less vehicles on the street because we were checking their license.
      </p>
      <p>
       But our movement could save many lives in future. Most of the citizens supported us despite being suffered.
