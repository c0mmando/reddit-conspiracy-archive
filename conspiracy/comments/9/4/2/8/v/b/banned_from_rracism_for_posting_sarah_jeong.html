       It's these kinds of comments that perpetuate this thought culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is more of a societal problem then a psychological one.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is pretty hard to go around trying to get people in trouble for racism and other prejudices when the leader of your country sets a pretty good example of a tollerable prejudice. A pretty big double standard. Racism will not stop if it is encouraged.

       Did you contact the mods and see what their reasons are?

       Ultimately, though, it's their sub and they can ban you for no reason. Reddit admins fully support this kind of behavior.

       Yeah, why would some racist chink think your an asshole for equating racism against whites the same as racism against minorities...its completely equal against both sides. Its not like our country is currently run by a racist , misogynistic prick or something....oh wait.

       You can tell it's a coordinated effort. One or two posts in r/con, oh okay this female said some stupid shit, but now people are literally shilling this information to other subreddits in an attempt to attack a news organization because Trump said they were bad.

       You are definitely not wrong. These "refugees" in Canada have a few ways they fuck the system to undermine everything. Like for example the mosques will buy semi trucks and trailers and then give them to certain guys who will then undermine every trucking company to get work since the mosque only require them to "donate" a small portion back to them. Where the actual hardworking Canadian gets fuck because he actually has bills to pay so he can't bid on jobs so low. As well as for some who want over here you need at least a certain amount of money, $25,000 I believe so you won't be a burden on our welfare, but what they do is the mosques will transfer the money into thier account so that way once they are here they take the money back to give to someone else and then they get on welfare. Its a fucking joke.

       That used to be true. It doesn't seem to be working for now. Trump is sitting at 50% approval rating despite pretty much all of media running a negative top story about him every day.

       Comment is still true. It doesn’t imply total control, just control. Elections are won by a small number in the middle. These people are certainly being manipulated by the media propaganda. Imagine what Trump’s approval, to the extent that number means anything anyway, would be if he had Obama’s media. 80%, 90%?

       Ok, so I have to be honest here. The Neo-Nazi stuff is crazy and waaaay out there - definitely.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is extensive research that there are demonstrable IQ differences between races. That doesn’t mean one race is superior or inferior, etc. but there is research on this being factual.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bell Curve by Charles Murray is pretty much a seminal work on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes I agree that white supremacism or any other ethnic/racial supremacy is not valid, but look into the IQ stuff. It’s pretty interesting

       I don’t care about that stuff lol. My original comment was only referencing that one of the mods is a known self-admitted White Nationalist. You asked how I know this and I posted the thread in which a different mod leaked a conversation he had with the racist mod.

       I first joined Reddit about 8 years ago, back then I found it pretty rich environment. Endless discussions about meaningful events and topics, and great OC.
      </p>
      <p>
       These days it really seems like it's all a coordinated political/marketing scheme. Every sub seems to have an agenda (usually liberalism/globalism), which is fine except for the censorship and denial of censorship and bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have known since the 2016 election that there were coordinated political efforts and bots everywhere. There seem to be more now. Most political threads I get on could easily be all bots. I am often accused of being a bot or a Russian spreading propaganda. Although in my mind it is the user on the other end who seems more like a paid shill.

       Not all liberals are globalists or statists. I'd say the overall bias here is much like the liberal media bias: pro-establishment, pro-elite, pro-state. Otherwise agree entirely.

       I haven't really found the best alternative yet... Steemit or Saidit are close, but sadly I don't think we'll see another site like reddit was in the beginning... it will depend on the culture of the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never liked Voat. It's like the deformed child of reddit and 4chan, it had potential when it started (whoaverse) but now it 99% sucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today you've got two kinds of sites: SJW (tumbler, reddit..) or Alt-Right (4chan, voat) ... I hate both extremes. The Obama/Hillary worshiping on this site is exactly as disgusting as the Trump worshiping on 8chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need a neutral ground where people are sensible enough to not be assholes and are able to discuss every and all points... where shill behaviour is shunned, etc.

        These days it really seems like it's all a coordinated political/marketing scheme. Every sub seems to have an agenda (usually liberalism/globalism), which is fine except for the censorship and denial of censorship and bias.

       It would probably be too hard for you to empathize with someone that is now your own kind. I can get that. It's human nature. Although I am sure it happens, there has to be black people who have discriminated against whites for things like jobs, and housing. Just the reverse is more prevalent and documented. That's just the way this country is. I accepted it a long time ago. I am as law abiding as they come, but I get nervous when a policeman looks at me. I always assume any white person I meet hates me. I'm not even bitter about it. We are you guys slaves after all. I do believe there will be a cosmic reshuffling of the game board really soon though.

       I know all whites people don’t. I just assume. It has saved me a few times.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cosmic reshuffling is from the Torah. In the book of Deuteronomy, God told Moses that his people would worship other gods and he would take them back to Egypt but this time by ships. And they would have a yoke of iron placed on their neck by a nation (means race of people) who would speak a language and worship gods their fathers have never known. They will be taken for bondmen and bondwomen for 400 years and no one will save them. But he promised to rescue them after the 400 years and they will go from being the tail to being the head. And God will punish the nation that took his people as slaves. So....slavery started in America 399 years ago....so I’m just going to wait patiently and see what happens.

       so do you think the descendants of slave masters deserve to be punished? lots of white ancestors didn't even own slaves. should we punish the children of a murderer?

       Oh man, I don't know. God told Moses he punishes to the 3rd and 4th generation. I am too much of a pushover to make those kinds of decisions. Shit I befriended a guy in the Navy who once called me nigger-spic. Last year I prayed on my hands and knees for God to show Gentiles mercy and next thing I knew my neck was broken. God did say he would punish the nation that took Hebrews as slave so that means there is still hope.

       That's the new testament god Jesus that is all about love.
The God I worship, gentiles call the devil. He is the father of Satan and he does ALL evil and good in the world, he even said he takes delight in fucking us up. So the way you feel is exactly how my family feels. My God told Moses that he is a man of war. He is terrible. And yet I praise his name everyday.

       Jews or Jewish people are converts who practice religion and use the  Talmud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hebrews especially the Levite Priest don’t practice religion. The closest thing I do to that is I keep the Sabbath holy. Holy means separate. Jews typically don’t deal with black peoples. And I am black to the ground.

       Definitely interesting, however slavery has been going on for almost the entirety of our worlds civilization. LONG before the United States was a country. Hell, there is still legal slavery in Africa to this day. Yet I never hear about people getting mad at that. Please.... Pick your battles wisely and stop focusing on an issue that is no longer relevant in the USA.

       If I am right, slavery will continue to exist. That's why I hold no grudge against any race. If God says it will happen, then white people had no choice but to take slaves.

       God gave each person free will. We all can make our own choices. Unfortunately back then, many people were highly ignorant to what they were getting put through. Some even entered into it willingly under the guise of some other opportunity. It is sad. Thankfully now, most of the world has strong education systems and people are being taught what is proper and moral. We can only hope for the best and continue to teach people how harmful slavery can be.

       I agree. But, if the Deuteronomy prophecies DO come true and the Gentile are given to the Hebrew, I would protect and treat the ones I am given really good. Its just not in my to be cruel, even to people that hate me.

       Of course. I get where you're going with that, but I am also a believer and frankly, that situation is so unlikely to happen. Like
       <em>
        bam

       somehow a group of people are dropped at your front door and you are now their slave owner. Lol Much more would have to take place before anything that drastic can happen.

       Ever heard of the Mandela Effect? I saw the stoplights shimmer like a mirage and it went from Green on top, Yellow in the middle and Red at the bottom change to the way it is now. Red on top, green on bottom. At first I thought someone slipped me drugs and I don't even take pain medicine. No one will believe me so I keep it to myself. Now I think God does that all the time. I use to live in Japan for 15 years and now it is soooo close to Korea. Maybe that is how it will happen. One instant we are in this reality and the next Israel is the capital of the world but with black people. Who knows, like I said I will just wait and see.

       Slavery lasted about 250 years in America.   There were indentured servants to begin with then the first man to officially have slaves was black. The indentured servants were white and black.  I mean, there's a lot of history that gets conveniently left out.  Let's all just agree that slavery was wrong and it's good that it ended.  America and Europe no longer have slaves but Africa still does.  I don't buy that whites are going to have to pay for the sins of our ancestors when every race on Earth has done the same terrible things... Their descendents get a free pass on paying for their sins?

       It’s not 400 years of slavery. But 400 years of captivity. When the Hebrews were originally in ancient Egypt, the forced labor was like 230 years. We got the image of slavery being like the 10 Commandments who Cecil B. DeMille based off of the treatment of black slaves. But it was more like a job that really sucks as they had quotes of bricks to make everyday. Israel did the same when David was king. He would assign one nation to dig for minerals another was responsible for providing wood, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       This is definitely Egypt. It’s on our money. We have pyramids everywhere that are called Indian Mounds. Almost every major city has a capstone or an obelisk. George Washington was presented with a gold brick from England with the word Egypt on it, that is in his memorial now. Egypt means the house of bondage. I even see evidence that the exodus was here. Everywhere Moses went has a location here in places like Utah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically if it happens it happens. No one has power to stop God. Especially me. I am even scared to pray to him. Israelites did not pray to God. Only Priest, prophets and kings did. I said earlier in this thread that if it doesn’t happen, nothing really changes for me. I will still be poor. And still a slave. No matter if Trump, MLK, or Bugs Bunny sits in the white house.

       I don't hate anyone. I am just telling the truth from my experience. Guy in this thread posting how he experienced racism from blacks. I believe him. We can be the most racist people in the world. We just don't have the power to be that effective at it. But God is racist. And he wrote those words not me. I am powerless. Even if it doesn't happen, my plight remains the same. I will still be a poor, disabled vet dying of cancer. Nothing I can do about it just wait and see. But its in the Torah, plainly. Once again I didn't write it. I'm a worm.

       you're mentality is what's holding you back, you keep talking as if you deserve it because god has put this on you. but I think most religious texts are complete shit used to keep people in line. god didn't put you in this position, thousands of years of humans succumbing to human nature is. anyways, my view is that we are god, not something disconnected from it.

       I use to think that too, I was pretty much an atheist. But I had a experience that would label me crazy. And that is what it would take for any rational person to believe. But God does things to me, like I haven't worked in months due to an amputation. Which God did to me along with the cancer. But out of nowhere I get a check from the government from overpaying a bankruptcy debt that saved me from losing my home. God has did some fucked up things to me but he has delivered me over and over again. And I don't expect anyone to believe until something supernatural happens to them. As a teenager living in Ferguson I have been shot at almost point blank but somehow the bullets didn't hit me. As a bomb builder in the Navy, I had a bomb fuse's propeller start spinning and smoking and it went off and I only lost a piece of my finger. Life is strange. I have no power or special talent. All I can do is wait.

       I used to be an atheist too, but now I. pretty sure I'm a pantheist (believing all of nature is god). I'm sorry you had to go through that amputation, but I dont think the things that happened to you were the work of a supernatural being, just the beings that already live on this planet (gov. workers who sent you the check and the doctors that helped amputate u).

       Being from St. Louis I recently found out they have been testing poisons on the blacks in the ghetto for generations so that is also true. But I believe it is my God who makes man do things like this. He keeps his promises. He said he would destroy us and bring us to naught.

       I've been around plenty of black people, played basketball together, watched games together, served in the army together, in business etc.  Never once thought I hate this person because of the their color or think they are my slave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most white people never owned slaves btw.  I can see it in many black peoples eyes when I meet them socially, they don't trust me because of my skin color, and I can't say I blame them based on history.  Just know many and I would say most white people don't harbor those views you mention.  I hold the view of live and let live.

       Fair enough mate, I appreciate that you feel that way.  The older I get, the less I trust most people anyway.  I can't know what you have been through until I have walked a mile in your shoes.  I just want you to know there are plenty of white people who respect and appreciate black people, and people of many cultures for that matter.

       That being said, nothing excuses some of the racist shit I have seen pulled on blacks by the police.  That Sterling Brown arrest in Milwaukee recently, amongst many others, was terrible and needs to be stamped out.

       You cannot say most white people owned slaves, this is because NO WHITE PEOPLE OWNED SLAVES. Everyone who owned slaves has no skin because it rotted off them as they are dead. Racism is not dead, but the more good people out there the closer we will be to that.

       You couldn't be more wrong, i am very empathetic. I would refuse to treat you any different because of your skin color. If you would rather people treat each other differently based on skin color you are a trash person. I do not agree with the notion that it is ok for anyone to treat anyone differently i assume everyone holds the same stance however i do realize there is evil in the world and my assumption is sadly far from the truth.

       I’m not in a position to judge anyone. I will say it again. I don’t hate white people I am fucking afraid of them. A small misunderstanding can lead to me being killed. I have not been made to feel welcomed here just barely tolerated. I saw that man get killed last week for pushing the white guy to the ground. Wouldn’t anyone react that way, walking out of a store and seeing your wife being yelled at by a stranger? But right here on reddit people were saying she shouldn’t have parked in a handicap spot. There is no regard for human life in this country. Sorry if that offends you. That has been my experience. I know several black people that believes racism is over. It’s human nature.

       White people will call themselves
       <em>
        liberals
       </em>
       and keep telling themselves that they know everything, but they don't really give a shit about black people. They never did, and that legacy is still strong with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They literally created the concept of racism as it exists today, having had their boot on black people's necks for centuries, but if anyone dares to express that either through cool logic or unhinged anger, the response is always the same: you pushing back means that white people are the victims now, and non-white people are the racists.
      </p>
      <p>
       It must a be a special kind of pain white people are experiencing, crying atop their pile of ill-gotten generational wealth and power.

       Except, you live in a free country that gives you every opportunity in the world to succeed.  You are given preferential treatment in getting scholarships, getting into college, and getting jobs.  The media hardly ever reports on black criminals anymore, if they do, they won't dare mention the race of the perps, even if the police is still searching for them.  White perps, they do say the race of.  Black on white violent crime is extremely high in comparison to white on black violent crimes.  Many white victims are targeted just because they're white.  We all know who George Zimmerman is and Treyvon Martin.. but there were  revenge killings in Treyvon's name that never made it to the national news.

       My God says a sign that this is the end of days, there will be riots everywhere, nation vs nation. Nation biblically means race of people. Its the reason there is so much black on black crime. Not all black people are the same nation. Each nation has a different god that the Most High assigned to the people. In the ghetto you have all these black people that are told they are the same. Some are indigenous to America, some are Amorites, Egyptian, Cushite's, etc...and they will clash. I have looked another man who had the same skin color at me and it was on. My God told Moses that he is a "man" of war. Hebrew Israelites are a nation of warriors and thieves. Everywhere we went God told us to go destroy the entire city and take all their shit. So actually racists are right. We are violent thugs. Yet that is not evil to my God unless we do it to each other. The 10 commandments that Christians hold on to so dearly doesn't belong or apply to them. That is a hard thing to be told, that the God you have worship all your life doesn't care about you. So when people find out that the God of Israel is not only black but also no one is going to Heaven and only those from the line of Adam (red dirt) has a soul.  And there is no salvation for anyone except the Hebrew, its going to collapse society. There is going to be so much killing and destruction. Once again everyone this is not my words. God didn't consult with me when he made the Torah.

       Say a POC is in a hiring postion and they chose to hire another POC because they are a POC.  Would this be racist?  They are in a position of power.

       IDK, but thats irrelevant anyway.  You cant expect 50/50 split when the population isn't a 50/50 split.  It also sounds like you think equality means there needs to be a 50/50 split.  equality means an equal opportunity

       Nope, you clearly have never played an instrument. It requires years of practice and dedication, especially violin, it doesn't even have frets. Now that aside, I meant as far as skin color. Abilities and skills are not factors of one's birth in my opinion, there must be some genetic component yes, but I believe you could raise any small child to be above average at any sport if you put them under the right conditions.

       For sure, skill is a function of hard work. Still, you cannot ignore/deny the existence of talent; in other words, for an equivalent time invested in training/exercising, people will tend to develop vastly different skill levels.

       Nobody is "equal" to the next; each human is infinitely different from every other human. That's what makes racism absurd, not that humanity is one, homogeneous, uniform blob.

       Look at crime statistics, blacks are murdering, raping and assaulting whites at much higher rates than vice versa.  Should that be addressed at all or should we keep talking about something that ended 150 years ago, that none of us were a part of?

       You're missing the point, all races of humans have enslaved and murdered others.  Do you think whites are the only ones?  You need to study history. Or pay attention to current events. But I think you're just looking for a reason to justify your own racism.

       Not what I'm talking about at all. I'm talking about racist white people killing black people violently in confirmed hate crimes and how claiming the word racist is being used as a weapon against white people is making light of the black people who actually died at the hands of racists, when all your talking about is words.

       Oh my god do you what a hate crime is? Just because one person kills another person and the killer is black and the person who is killed is white does not make it a black on white hate crime, the same goes if the roles are reversed. Hate crimes must be proven with evidence and are not inherent in the fact that the two people differ in race. Also, last I checked there are a lot more white people than black people in this country so is that statistic even adjusted for population numbers? I'm honestly at a loss as to why this statistic is so important as were you not aware that people kill people? When you cherry pick what race kills what race at what percentage/rate you can paint any picture you want. Black people are most likely to be killed by other black people, and apparently they more likely to kill white people too, guess black people are just all murderers.

       Who cares why someone is murdered? Hate crime is a made up distinction that is virtually impossible to accurately track since it involves things like mind reading, which is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it were possible, murder is murder and it doesn't make someone's death worse if it resulted from "racial hatred" or if it was gang related, or if resulted from a fight over samples at Sam's club, it's still murder and yes to answer your last statement blacks are more violent as a group and that is a fact that needs to be addressed within the black community... like yesterday, but if we as a society continue to just excuse poor behavior (which is completely predictable given the shitty self sustaining culture of the group) we can never hope to progress as a whole now can we?
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply excusing or ignoring statistical sociological and criminal trends, because they are uncomfortable, does no one any favors least of all young vulnerable black youths who are being chewed up and spit out by a culture that tells them all the wrong messages and then encourages them to blame and hate when they find themselves miserable and constantly in want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it all their fault? Of course not!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       .. but absolving then of all blame, of denying them the dignity of holding them to an equal standard is truly racist... 
It is the bigotry of low expectations played out every time someone turns a blind eye to subhuman behavior perpetuated in black neighborhoods all over the United States as if it shouldn't break our hearts just as much the awful things they do to themselves.

       Are you kidding me? So when the KKK was killing black people they weren't killing them because they were black? No one's saying one death is worth more attention than the other, which is a concept btw it's called the "less dead" which refers to people who die that no one cares about like prostitutes it's very interesting, what I am saying is statistics alone do not tell us everything and can easily be used to tell contradicting stories.

       twice as many whites are killed, but white people are 4.5 times more numerous in the US than black people.  Which means they're actually less than half as likely to be killed by the opposite race.

       2-10 I was called honkie or cracker by someone everyday. Always older people on the block. When I moved to redneck villages GA I became a n@#$er. And was called that many times a day, by cops,random pussies yelling it out the window, classmates. I had friends in school I could not talk to in public because their klansman fathers said I was a "no good yankee n$%

       Just downvote every agenda post you see. It’s not much, but I think it’s all we can do. Or just migrate to a new site, which isn’t an option right now.

       Holy shit. This is actually unbelievable. I would've expected most of the deleted comments would've been offensive or off topic, but damn, the moderators genuinely removed fair comments. It's a shame to see this in a sub that people will just follow expecting unbiased behaviour. This isn't what reddit should stand for.

       Sorry, that won't work. You'll be banned from Reddit by IP address. You can't point out racsim against white people on Reddit. It's in their unwritten ToS that they can make up and change on the fly to suit needs. I'm part of one of the smallest native minorities in the US and I still get called a Russian troll or white supremacist if I in any way defend a white victim of blatant racism.

       Snowflakes are soft and white and easily broken. So clearly "white fragility" is referencing snowflakes. But like the mighty faggot, which is far stronger than the individual sticks, an avalanche of snowflakes can cause catastrophic damage.

       O.o what? I made a Simpsons reference and pointed out how the people who are "offended" by the term white fragility are only proving it to be true. But I also left a warning that snowflakes in great numbers are a serious threat because they blanket all actual discussion of the topic.

       Can you be racist to white people? Of course. But how impacted are white people by racism compared to most minorities? Mean words vs loan denials, racial profiling, neglected communities... I could go on but if you don't already see what I'm saying, you're not likely to.

       Every time a College accepts applications based on race, everytime a company hires based on ethnic background, every time that the best candidate for the job is over looked in order to appease the diversity quotas, someone is being racially discriminated against. The West was built on meritocracy, and if that is not maintained, we can expect mediocracy to follow.

       Where I live, people never see anything even though everyone actually saw it. They never talk to police, not because they’re afraid of the police or fear retaliation, they just don’t think it’s right to “snitch”. Yet the people who refuse to be witnesses or do even the simplest thing to stop crime in their neighborhoods are the same ones always bitching about how police don’t care about them because crimes in their communities often go unsolved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well duh, of course lots of crimes are unsolved because you idiots intentionally hinder investigations in every possible way. And it’s not a race thing at all, there are people of all races in these communities. So until you offer proof that crimes go unsolved because racism, I’m going to believe my very own eyes over this tired bullshit you’re peddling here.

       So you go from talking about being in the neighborhood, how everyone behaves because of some understood agreement that has no real basis in logic or reason, and then you turn around and start talking about "you idiots." I thought you were in the 'hood bro? Shouldn't you be saying "my idiotic neighbors" or "our idiotic community"? Or were you just projecting the way you see minority communities from the outside?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for proof, there's a plethora of data here:

       Most people would acknowledge that we all have a responsibility to be good citizens or that it’s a shame when we could help prevent crime but choose not to act. Most people would agree that neighbors who help crime flourish are idiots. Doesn’t mean there’s no racism in the world, it just reminds us that not all problems are because racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you ignore all of that and go right to accusing a complete stranger of being a racist despite zero evidence of racism? So being condescending &amp; dismissive of other people’s experience then judging them despite a total lack of criteria is what? I mean, that’s not racism since you don’t know my ethnicity but it’s certainly no better. Kinda seems like you’re just projecting your own shallowness and tendency to label others.

       No mention for repeat offenses being factored in. It just shows a disproportionate number of black people vs white people based on 2010 census data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now are you looking at straight numbers for your "disproportionate crimes against white people" claim, or is the demographic's population taken into consideration? Because one would assume that the majority demographic would have a higher overall number of crimes committed against them.

       One would think that the majority population would be committing more of the violent crimes, but they are not.  While the majority is being attacked more often by minority blacks and Hispanics.  That's what I mean by disproportionate.

       Incarceration and arrest rates are higher among minority perpetrators than whites for the same crimes. So just because there is a higher percentage of a minority population is prison, it doesn't mean that demographic is committing
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       crimes. Also, most of the crimes that result in incarceration are drug offenses, so looking at the demographics of prison populations does not directly reflect the demographics of perpetrators of specific crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most violent crime in intraracial, so the demographic that represents the biggest threat to white people is white people.

       Yeah, I always forget about all Asian-American presidents and Supreme Court Justices the US has had.  I mean, surely there's been at least 10 Asian-American senators, right? (Spoiler: there's only been 9, and a third of those are in office now).  Institutional and systemic power is based off more than just SAT scores, it turns out.

       A) I'm not trying to argue that China doesn't have its own racism problems to address; nice non-sequitor, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) China's population is less than 0.5% white; if you takeout non-citizen resident foreigners, it's well under 0.1%.  China has over a dozen locally relevant ethnic groups in more urgent need of government representation than whites.
      </p>

       Why would your average Asian bother becoming a politician when they can instead get high-paying tech jobs?
      </p>
      <p>
       The median US household income has "Asians" at the top with $20,000+ more than white people. And I would assume that this includes all of your white politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I would challenge you on your implicit assumption that it's the politicians of the world that actually have institutional power.

       Not serious in the sense that I do not personally believe the premises of the argument; but I am definitely serious in the sense that I believe the conclusion follows necessarily if one makes this kind of intersectionality argument. She appears to be a bigot no matter which "popular" definition of racism one choses, given that one doesn't ignore the reality that Asians have seemingly more white privilege than white people.

       That is the thought process of many liberals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although many liberals also think that it is racist to not believe in everything other liberals believe in and to think for themselves.

       I've heard this argument made before and though I think you are not being serious I think the serious response is that both racial prejudice and power iniquity are each bad by themselves and so it is essentially redundant to try to redefine racism to also require power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also this argument of needing power doesn't work for other kinds of prejudice such as ageism, where the older people do a actually tend to have all the power yet are the ones discriminated against.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, I don't think that the right way to deal with racism is with even more racism.  So while I understand the frustration and anger people are feeling, trying to justify racism by redefining it to include power is not wise. Simply resist power, regardless of race. The powerless need to unite against the powerful, the powerful use racism as a tool to divide the powerless and prevent them from uniting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the problem with intersectionality is that it is infinitely divisible until every individual is in their own category alone, and therefore is useless.

       Basically this. I used to vote democrat, but after this racist garbage and sjw garbage, I’m probaably voting third party or republican, depending on the candidate. When the Democrats want to reject the extreme left, then maybe they can start winning elections again. Until then, I’m probable done with them.

       It’s because the left is doing NOTHING about them and not rejecting them. The right overall separates themselves from the racist groups and doesn’t run a platform based on those groups. Meanwhile you have the left that not only doesn’t say anything against the SJWs, they actively include them in the discussions and appease them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left needs to handle the SJW/racism problem or expect to loss more elections.

       isn't it abundantly clear by now that "diversity" is code for "anti-white", anti-european/western, and everything associated with that? ex. traditional morality, cultural Christianity, Euro descended individuals seeing themselves as "peoples", etc.

       I don't think so. I'm non white and I don't believe my simply being allowed to exist peacefully is code for anti white or anti western. Plenty of whites are being anti western lately by siding with Russia over NATO allies, so you don't need to browbeat people like me for being alive while not looking like you like it's some kind of intentional slight.

       Non-male eh?  You're from the dreaded and very diverse other 50%?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you trying to say that 'diverse' is precisely anything non-male, non-white, and non-Christian?  Or are you still claiming that is what 'white people' think?  Even within the group of white-male Christians I can see lots of 'diversity', but that word has a different meaning now when talking about ethnicity- doesn't it?  Why?  Who is it that is claiming white-male Christians are not diverse, white-male Christians?  'Diversity', as it has been used lately, is a propaganda term.  You seem to be upset at the people who are using the term to mock it- they are not the ones who designed what that word implies (and you seem to know well what it implies).  The term is appearing casually and unironically in media mostly pertaining to 'white'-majority societies, so it has cast down into everyday conversation.  Are you aware enough to wonder why, or are you aware why and are happy with its use?

       In
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       eyes, Ghana should not be a diverse country and Japan should not be a diverse country, but I'm not so sure you'd agree with that because they are non-white.  In
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       eyes, those countries have many small ethnic groups which together form the larger identites of Ghanaian and Japanese.  The same goes for 'white' people.  All of the races are already diverse, so why does Europe (even non-colonial countries)
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       'diversity'?  Why/how is this subject so prevalent?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to live around white people?  If so, I can understand why.  If not, I am fully in support of 'your people' having a sovereign nation exclusive to themselves.

       I don't have anything against white people, whatever that even means. I just happen to believe trying to build a homogenous white nation on a predominantly non white continent seems horribly ill conceived. Especially when Europe was right there the entire time. If white settlers had moved to Switzerland or France or Belgium you'd be a lot more at ease right now.

       History is littered with terrible circumstances brought about by people wanting more territory. What can be done about that?  Would the world be better today if Europeans had not engaged in colonial imperialism? It's tough to say. 
If everyone had simply stayed in the lands they came from and never engaged in wars of conquest, then yes that would probably be better.  But Europeans were not the only conquerers of history. People have been warring with each other since before agriculture was invented. There have been empires in every corner of the world since ancient times. There have been conquerers of every color and creed. There is nothing that distinguishes white people from the other races in that regard. It is the very definition of racism to judge the white people of today, and exclusively white people, for the crimes of (not all) white people of yesterday.

       No, it’s not clear at all.  What’s clear is that people who have been conditioned by their society, even in ways that don’t seem obvious, to believe they are superior to others, not by personal achievement, but by being part of the group that is most powerful and most mainstream in society, are very uncomfortable when it appears they might have to cede even a millimeter of their self-asumed superiority.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not trying to lay blame and guilt.  I don’t even think most people in the “elite” groups are aware of how much of their dominance is fed to them.  And I’m not even sure that most institutions deliberately try to push a narrative of superiority.  It’s more like following the well trodden road is the easiest thng to do - why would you think of plunging off, through the brambles, to parts unknown when you don’t need to?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest you pick up a newspaper - even a fairly liberal paper like the New York Times.  Now go through all the editorial pictures published in that edition and count how many people pictured are male and white and how many are not.  Overwhelmingly, those pictured, particulrly in the political and business section will be white and male.  In the international section you might have a slight bit of diversity, but even there, you’ll see mostly middle aged white guys in suits.  You will also find some faces of color and women in investigative journalism pieces, as these tend to cover negative isses in society - violence, poverty, disease, etc.  Lifestyle sections will have a few more women and people of color, but still, probably more than half of those pictured will be white and male.  Sports will invariably have the most pictures of non-whites and some females who play tennis or ice skate.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may say this proves nothing, but try to imagine a New York Times where nearly all the pictures of business people and politicians are non-white, or all female.  You’d probably feel that something was wrong, even if you couldn’t put your finger on what made you uncomfortable.  If this happened over a period of weeks, months, years where white males were the token minority - not just in newspapers but in all media - you would begin to feel just how disempowering it is to look around at images of important, glamourous, wealthy, successful, powerful people - and rarely see someone who looks like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that’s just images in media.  I’ve heard people disparge women’s studies and african-American studies.  To be truly equal and diverse we should have white male studies, they cry.  But you’ll realize nearly every book you hold, over newspaper you glance through, every film and show you see is already a study of white male history, power, and intersts - if you take the time and effort to try to find anything more than a token side role given to anyone else - and even there those images are conditioned - blacks are sporty and musical and say funny things in funny ways, women like pretty things and things that smell nice and love cleaning, asians are good in science and study alot, hispanics have big loving families.  On the extremely negative side blacks are crimlnals, women get beat up and whine about it, asians are dorky and take all the spots at top universities because their parents are so strict, hispanics are domestic servants and mow lawns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it any wonder people are interested in broadening roles?  And would it be so terrible to not carry the world on your shoulders and strive to be “alpha” at every moment?  To not feel inadequate if you can’t live up to the idealized image of “great and powerful white male”?  But the first step is to realize that someone else’s actualization is not gained at your expense.  You are not less than you were because someone else now has a voice.

       Nobody is interested in controlling anyone’s voice but YOU. You don’t see individuals, you see black people and white people and Asian people. You don’t acknowledge ideas, you acknowledge black ideas and white ideas. People like you are obsessed with race.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll tell you what else. You think white people are superior. You see, someone who isn’t a racist...they believe all people should have an equal opportunity. Just merit, nothing else. You don’t want that, you don’t believe it’s possible. You say that  minorities need a savior like you to hoist them up from their doomed existence and place them amongst Gods chosen.
      </p>
      <p>
       You hate what I’m saying but people are waking up to the truth that I speak.

       I always liked the opening monologue by Irish mobster Frank Costello (played by Jack Nicholson) in The Departed movie:
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me. Years ago we had the church. That was only a way of saying – we had each other. The Knights of Columbus were real head-breakers; true guineas. They took over their piece of the city. Twenty years after an Irishman couldn’t get a fucking job, we had the presidency. May he rest in peace. That’s what the n*****s don’t realize. If I got one thing against the black chappies, it’s this – no one gives it to you. You have to take it.

       The problem isn’t someone else of a different ethnicity having a voice. The problem is people like you who sit and whine about racism and stereotypes, but at the same time are happy to be hypocritical and use their voice to be an anti-white racist in the same breath. People like that are just as bad as the racists they claim to be fighting against.

        I suggest you pick up a newspaper - even a fairly liberal paper like the New York Times. Now go through all the editorial pictures published in that edition and count how many people pictured are male and white and how many are not. Overwhelmingly, those pictured, particulrly in the political and business section will be white and male.

       People from New York and Alabama, regardless of their race, are going to have cultural identifiers based on that location. Saying white culture is lazy, the "white culture" you're talking about goes back to specific groups of people, English, German, Irish and Scottish for example.

       No,  I said saying "White culture" is lazy. It doesn't exist as an umbrella term, well shouldn't. Food, art, music, and tradition are part of what makes a culture. German and French cuisine is obviously different, you wouldn't look at a plate of pork schnitzel and say "that's white culture", you'd just describe as German.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black culture exists and is different. Honestly I can't believe I have to explain this to you, but I can tell your pretty stubborn so it doesn't surprise me that it hasn't crossed your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       A black man with an Irish last name probably doesn't have any ancestors from Ireland. It's called "The Slavery Wall" and it's a problem many African Americans face when trying to research their ancestry. It's difficult to find out which of those "many nation's" their family comes from, since slaves were considered property and census data wasn't recorded.

       This is why black culture in America exists in it's current state. It's also why saying "black pride" is okay and "white pride" is for skin heads.

       So no, nothing blew up in my face.

       Now this is the part that pains me because I can tell you're not a troll. I've met countless people who have regurgitated almost verbatim, like it was script - what you just said.

        Redlining
       </a>
       is a well documented systematic denial of loans targeted at minorities that lasted through 60s, 70s and 80s. This resulted in landlord abandonment, lower property values and a shortage of new business opportunities. Neighborhoods were left in disrepair with vacant buildings that were haven for drugs and illegal activities. In turn generations that were victims of redlining became targets for predatory loans, resulting in low credit scores and a lack of home-ownership.

       We literally created the state that minorities find themselves in today. This was not 200 years ago.

       Its funny to think that you are so adamant about making this an issue today citing segregation from 50 years ago. Most likely happened in neither of our lifetimes. None of this is still the case today is my point. Pretty moot point to me.

       Yet poor test scores are very true, those folks cant read or write. But keep blaming something else, like whites, racism, or the best, actual tests being unfair.

       Racism does exist, and more importantly it's not always a white on black only situation that you see perpetually shoved down your throat.

       No, citing well known landmark desegregation cases does not bring anything new to the table. Its always selective information provided. Why not state as well that Massachusetts outlawed slavery in 1780?

       It's too simplistic.  It implies that a person should be limited to where they can move based on the color of their skin.  It plays into the collectivists' narritive.  Cultures change with time, but each individual is their own sovergn entity.

       Racism is a social structure. Minority’s CAN say and do things that discriminate against whites. But since racism is a social structure and whites are on the top, whites have society on their side. 
So a minority can not oppress you the same way a white person can oppress a minority.

       It’s a term anti white racists use.  Unsurprisingly, racism is yet another far left racist sub masquerading as one against it.

       Sounds like you could post a link to this post and it would be white fragility, but actual racism isn't racism when minorities do it.

       Other races get really mad because white people froth at the mouth when something negative is directed at their race, but a lot don't bat an eye when there's racism vs. others that's been going on for decades.

       They don’t actually care about racism. It’s just a sub that they can talk about whites to their detriment using a couple racism examples and self victimizing individuals who are white. Basically a second BPT

       I think they are having internal panic re this. Next step would be either acknowledging racism isn’t bad in this scenario which is sjw suicide or condemning that hog for being a trash bag.

       that it doesn't like. It is owned by Advance Publications which is one of the largest media companies in the world. It is the 5th most visited website in the US iirc. It is being used to push an agenda.

       not to mention a half dozen topics about this even though we already had a big thread for it, all to peddle the same "muh white genocide" rhetoric here.

       Notice some of the groups and key players are the same ones who are anti-immigration but suddenly want open borders when they hear white people in South Africa might be the ones in trouble.

       They have a valid problem with this crazy racist writer so they're milking it for all its worth to try and sell their brand. They've been on the move the last few months to try and build support, using the growing discontent of people to peddle their subhuman ideologies.

       make no mistake - the white nationalists in the US have lots of practice playing the long game and drumming up support (in slow, incremental steps) in internet forums. today they're just starting a new push.

       What are you talking about and what do you mean by "professional brigade"? Are you assuming that people who defended Roseanne were paid to do so but people who defended Gunn did it organically? How do you even prove that? In my opinion neither of them did anything wrong and neither should be punished.

       Can't say mean things about the white puritan shitmen in power because it's racist? So then the way to fix it is to cry louder about mean words said about those in power rather than better empathize with those without power. Because they might be white too...
      </p>

       You know, I remember pre-obama it was taboo to even talk about race so at least this is what could be considered progress. I guess.

       Mean things? No you can't leverage their race to disparage them or that's racist. Not really rocket science.

       Also, your entire narrative is retarded. You should look up the ethnicity of people that run the biggest companies. Google, Microsoft, Adobe and Blackberry, to name a few, all have Asian CEOs.

       Hello all,
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a reminder that cross-subreddit brigading is a violation of the reddit TOS. While we have not seen any calls for such behavior in this thread up until this point, we will be monitoring the thread for any such calls going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, there have been reports to modmail asking us to censor this discussion. Although we do not take an official position as to the legitimacy of the claims raised by the OP, we will most certainly not censor discussion so long as it occurs without violating the reddit TOS with regards to brigading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for your attention to this important announcement.

       As mods, we report all instances of cross-subreddit brigading targeted at
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       (we even implemented rule 9 as a way to ensure those engaging in such brigading were not able to participate in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       after doing so).
      </p>
      <p>
       On the whole, reddit admins have shown somewhat of an unwillingness to punish communities that discuss content in other subreddits (a policy most likely adopted in the interest of free and open discussion, which is perhaps for the best). In that way, some hate subreddits exploit such loopholes to not simply discuss incidents in other subreddits, but instead target those subreddits on a near 24/7 continuous loop. I suppose, in some ways, its a paradox that reddit CEO kn0thing spells out quite succinctly;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/off-the-cuff/wealthy-savvy-29-years-old-one-ceo-tale-001319794.html">
         So long as content on Reddit is legal, we will let people use it as communication platform for people to share links and have discussions... The curse side of it is sometimes those ideas are extremely offensive. I can live with that paradox.
        </a>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In that regard, while some communities may abuse the stance adopted by the reddit admins with regards discussion of content on other subreddits in order to brigade, on the whole I think reddit is better off as a platform by having that central ethos of open discussion to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when hate subrddits like the one you had mentioned above do engage in targeted behavior that crosses the line (such as daily username ping spamming) the admins will usually step in and remedy that pattern of abuse quite quickly.

       I'm not sure what it will take for the admins to put a stop to the 24/7 brgiading occurring in that hate subreddit, but I do hope they eventually choose to act based on the persistant and unending nature of the attacks.

       I'm not really following here, as my first comment above doesn't mention said hate subreddit. It was only after a user asked about that subreddit that I provided an answer. Also nothing above was copy/pasted beyond the quote from kn0thing, which further added to my confusion (and also lead me to believe you were being less than sincere in your remark).

         You're demonstrably wrong. Soros is an anti-Zionist. He funds anti-Israel NGOs such as the New Israel Fund in order to turn Israel into a Non-Jewish state. So much so that Netanyahu recently favoured Hungary over Soros when Hungary's PM was falsely accused of being "anti-semitic" for opposing Soros:

       J-street seeks to appear superficially pro-Israel when it is infact against Jewish Nationalism. Granted Zionism has evolved from its Socialist origins to its current ethno-nationalist right wing position.

       Brigading is an online harassment tactic where a group of people rally against an individual (or occasionally against a small group of people) in a coordinated, sustained and organized way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asking questions about removal of a post doesn’t seem to fall into the official definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this seems pretty Orwellian.

       It's kind of necessary to fulfill the mission of reddit as a platform. It's a platform for free discussion, but each individual subreddit is not a platform for free discussion. Each individual subreddit is designed to be an echo chamber where only a restricted range of discussion is allowed, so as to cater to a specific kind of social environment. I don't agree with it, but this is one factor that separates reddit from, say 4chan. What most of the platforms have opted to do (at the behest of whom, I don't know, probably people that have complained enough, or people with money that have a say in how reddit operates as part of reddit's revenue generation process) is create social platforms that adhere to certain ideologies which have come to characterize the platforms. Often that is political correctness. Other times that is politically or ideologically aligned science, or history, etc. you get the point, all platforms are usually aligned with leftist ideologies. The other restriction on speech in these subs, and this seems more universal to all subs, perhaps a top down decision by administration, is the restriction of speech regarding disclosing the usernames, or social media accounts, or personal identities of people or personas involved in particular kinds of speech. Reddit does not want to be responsible for causing someone to kill themselves because some tech savy people found that person's personal information and disclosed their identity, or place of living, or place of work, etc. It's probably a liability concern, I'm sure people have sued, or threatened to sue, or reddit's legal team advised this process to protect reddit from liability.

       Subs like the one you mention along with others in the site's history liek SRS) have often been rewarded hands off treatment for various reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is mostly to do with advancing a given viewpoint held by the admins (the subreddits blacklisted from the official admin slack channel are a good insight into that viewpoint), but the hands off treatment can also be a reward for solving a specific "problem" for the admins; such as when the goons from Somethingawful created
       <a href="/r/preteengirls">
        /r/preteengirls
       </a>
       , filled it with actual CP, emailed Anderson Cooper about their own subreddit, and then got CNN to run a story on "reddit's jailbait problem". That in turn resulted in doxxtober, and the admins were able to remove a "free speech problem" without compromise on their ardent commitment to the free exchange of legal ideas in the site's earlier days).
      </p>
      <p>
       In that regard, the structure of soft power on reddit is actually quite fascinating in some ways (although it is also frustrating and highly disappointing that  most folks who tend to garner standing in such an arena are often times quite corrupt and willing to sell themselves for ideological or monetary ends. In that way, the culture you see manifest on subs like tmor and others like it are actually the veiled views of most folks who operate in (and are in charge of) what's called the reddit metasphere. By way of their social/political networks (which are screened and kept highly secure) they are able to both navigate the complex set of rules on reddit in order to push the boundaries of the site wide terms of service while also having a degree of protection afforded to their actions by way of their friendships behind the scenes (as I said, certain moderators are given a direct line of access to the admins on slack, but there is a blacklist and mods from subs such as conspiracy are on it).
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, the hands off treatment is, more so than anything else, a reflection of how the systems of soft power on reddit can be manipulated and controlled by a very small social cricle able to operate effectively in the backrooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason why Yishan compared that structure on reddit to a new form of government, and I always thought it was quite distressing that many simply laughed off his insight as what he was really talking about is exactly the nuanced and subtle mechanisms of control I laid out above.

       Where does the sense of entitlement and superiority that mods all seem to possess come from? Let me be clear, you're a comment moderator of a glorified chat feature, and IN NO WAY does that equate to one iota of "power" in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the problem right there. Mods always come off as weak, bored, boring, miserable people that exercise the ONE outlet of personal power that they have in the entirety of their existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try working out, it'll give you some actual strength, and ACTUAL power. Until then, waste endless hours pouring though comments, trying to "catch" bad actors, while others live their lives fully.

       What are the exact parameters of brigading?  I don't want to create or partake in any group actions on this... but am I prohibited from personally and individually taking any actions?  I mean, I'd like to message the mod(s) and ask them "wtf".  Would that end up harming this sub?

        If you're a white person you're less likely to understand what racism really is because you've never experienced it. Also, it's not in your interest to understand it.

       How does that make any sense?  Go find a white rapper from the 90s that didn't experience racism.  Steph Curry, a superstar athlete whose father was a black nba player experiences racism for being half white...Your comment is borderline racist

        When's the last time you, white person, have been to an anti-racism protest or read anti-racism literature or joined an anti-racism forum? Don't lie. The answer is never. Because you simply are not the victim here.

       He, and I, are literally talking about it right now and it bothered you so much you felt the need to downplay what he was saying...

      <p>
       Do you think everyone who has experienced raciam goes to a protest or dwells on it so much they read books about it?  Do you think white people dont grow up in the same family and poverty situations as minorities?

       Its ok I am banned from a few subs and shadow banned on a few others because I assumed reddit was still liek the old internet, and not this sensored moderated mess of totalitarian ideologies of the few power tripping mods. Also, when freedom of speech is under threat, they weed out those who speak out first.....
      </p>
      <p>
       I spoke out and I have been moderated out of the discussion. First signs that freedom is at stake is having pressure not to speak your mind, or getting sever reprocussion for saying anything. Freedom of speech around the world and on the internet is now under threat. Before people had a choice to just ignore it and call it out. But now with bots and shills and multiple fake accounts, anyone can make anything seem popular and legitimate, and the rulers of webpages know this and mod/admin powers are one example of controlling the freedom for the safety of the community.....

       Don't you know the postmodernist agenda has redefined and reclaimed the word 'racism' for their own? The term apparently
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       means that only those "in power" are able to be racist, and since "white people" are in power, only "white people" can be racist.

       no, it’s just idiots try to apply the sociological definition of “racism,” which refers to systemic racism, to every day use, even though that’s not something individuals can commit

       It's great being part of the race that's in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that the banks, major corporations and most of the power structure is run by white men and I'm a white man all those guys in power look out for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, those in power care about everyone of their same race. When I get my "white dividend" check every year, I'm glad to be so lucky.

       Lmao. The same twisted and manipulated news stories. This type of slant piece doesn’t even deserve a reply, but I’ll help you out a little.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump’s real estate suit included numerous other real estate firms, in the govt’s attempt at correcting what they deemed an inequity for blacks in the housing market. The case settled out of court, without guilt ever being found.
      </p>
      <p>
       The craziest thing for me, however, is how you guys still can’t differentiate immigrants from illegal immigrants. It’s really not complicated. Trump, and most people with a brain, believe in merit-based,
       <em>
        legal
       </em>
       immigration. Saying Trump is racist because he does not enjoy illegal immigrants is like saying I hate pizza because I don’t like pepperoni.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weird how Trump won an Ellis Island Award, too. I hear they love giving those out to racists.

       If you can't see how Trump's actions and words are perpetuating bigotry and xenophobia in America then I don't know what to tell you. The guy has clearly made some racist remarks recently and in the past. When you've got white supremacists rallying behind you there's probably something wrong with your message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure why you brought up immigrants but it's less about how they're getting here and more about how they're being treated once they are here.

       The article in the post to which I was replying brought up immigrants. If you think Trump is equivalent to extreme hate groups, I don’t know what to tell you. Please, cite for me these “clearly” racist remarks that he’s made. You’re full of shit and deluding yourself to believe the “he’s hates brown people!” narrative.

       So much so that they refuse to acknowledge the fact that it's racism. I remember some chick on twitter (years ago) telling me there's no such thing as "reverse racism" because, apparently, it only applies to non-white people.

       How? Could you elaborate? I'd argue the BLM is the only movement that could save us from any more of a Handmaid's Tale situation we've got going from this sadsack of a white puritan congress currently molesting the dignity out of this country.

As a proud, accepting, honest, lawful white person in a white country I follow the laws of the land and respect my fellow citizens, even if they're confused and lost in a delusion I respect their human rights as a beast roaming in a strange place they don't understand due to their barbaric ways.

       Woah woah woah chillll. I'm a young black male and I feel for you guys. I think this has become a manufactured issue with the intent of divisiveness. You'd be surprised that the black community on
       <em>
        average
       </em>
       supports you as an
       <em>
        individual
       </em>
       . What I only stress is that you don't feel the need to be an 89er because of the perception of a brigade. I don't think there will be any concrete effects that will come the way of white America because of this attack on the mind. Which is all it really is. Be fed up with being accused, but dont let it turn to hate for someone in the same boat as you. Just remember who the real enemy is, which we remind you of everyday on this subreddit.

       Heyo I'm a white chick and I'm from a southern state and I have never heard race mentioned so fucking much in all my life.

       The United States doesn't have a race problem. It has a recently manufactured "race problem".

       I'm from a northern state, specifically an epicenter of hyper neo leftists.  I voted for Bernie but over the past couple years I am being super alienated by my "peers".  Most recently I was told, literally that "Logic and western science are racist in favor of white people." I shit you not.  I work in a research lab so I was especially horrified.

       I'm a straight, white, Christian male.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to work at a Fastrip on the graveyard shift and see people proudly sporting swastika and SS tattoos coming in. When I left I felt I had to warn the manager that she probably shouldn't put any of the black employees on that shift, because I wouldn't feel fucking safe if I was them. Hell, I didn't feel too safe as it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's great that in that southern state you've never heard race mentioned, race has never been a big deal, all that. I'm really happy for you. I live in California. Still racists here. I encounter them. A lot. I see their kids at the school I work at, repeating the same shit they hear at home. They're not a majority or anything, but it's still just... repetitive.
      </p>
      <p>
       To reiterate, I'm a straight, white, Christian male. I live in California and have a bunch of liberal friends. Of those, exactly one girl that I knew from college has said something bigoted about one of those things. I had a brief moment of, "Wow, that sucks, she used to be kinda cool." And then I moved on with my life, because most people aren't like that. They're just loud. Maybe people need to stop being so damn sensitive.

       Hey guys, you are doing it wrong, just go to your local government and request your white male privilige card. There is a form to fill out and bring ID just in case (the fact you are a white male is usually enough).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they issue it, head to the bank for your free money, flash it to your boss for a promotion, or better yet, head on over to the place you really want to work and show it there for your uncontested, highly paid dream job.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys have been struggling in the so-called "real world" needlessly. Time to reap all those benefits and see why everyone hates and blames you!

       But tell me. Say if whites, being the Anglo-Germanic kind here, were to become supermajority in the US again what would be your opinion of minority groups, these being traditionally Christian types like Filipinos or Spanish, and their freedoms if they seek to fully integrate with conservative American culture and value systems?

       I'm a nationalist. I believe in nations of people's. The intent of our founders was a nation of European people. 60 years ago America was still 90% white. As that homogony has ended so too has the place America was. I have no ill feelings toward the people you've mentioned, but they too should live in their homelands where possible. Japan, Iceland, Hungary, Israel- all nations that intended to keep their racial existence intact. Japan is a nation that exists because and for the people that are racially Japanese and it's a beautiful thing. People living and existing with their own people is the way the world always worked. What we see now is a browning of the once white nation's. We're mixing all of the colors to the point where all we'll have left is brown. No different than a painters pallette. Once all of the colors have been mixed there is no more diversity and there is no going back.

       I certainly agree with a chunk of what you say. The laws of the US are written in English and in the system of English Common law. I fully support the idea that English is the ur-language of the US and should be prized here.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I would think that American exceptionalism is what set America apart from Europe and the Founding Fathers wouldn't completely be set on total adherence to European customs and tradition. Americans battled their way across the heartlands and adapted to things along the way. American Manifest Destiny was certainly violent, yes, but I think it's what cemented American exceptionalism. The values of Americans are now based on actions and beliefs and individualism rather than traditions and feudalistic submissive attitudes of people without a will to power, like the Old World peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is to lead to the crux of my argument. Since exceptionalism is a keystone of the United States, would it be reasonable to amend your belief about having a minority population living in the States? Rather than mass immigration as is the case now, it would only be the highest performing people from those nations allowed to come. In some ways that's what the case was pre-1965. Exporting American democracy will always be more difficult than importng the brightest minds. Would you be opposed something like this?

       I will continue to be opposed to policies that by there very nature create an environment of white replacement. 
Why would you want merit based immigration? There are like 2 BILLION Indians &amp;  Chinese, based on sheer volume alone you could bring a million here each year of their top IQ's and then we would become a little Indo-Chinese colony.

       Ah I see. Well I suppose I was thinking in more of a quota limit. For example, in 1947 only 100 Filipinos were allowed in annually but that was because of their fighting under the American military and adoption of the English language and education. I suggested merit based immigration with quota limits because there's little to doubt about the benefits of contact with new ideas from different peoples, and keeping good relations with other nations by allowing some of their people to come live here and share our culture and ideas with theirs back home. And the limits are to prevent replacement.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to the other part of what of you said about IQs. The Indian and Chinese popolations that we have here in the US are essentially their cream of the crop. The ones too poor or dumb stayed behind. In fact the majority of their people are dumb and poor. They're not smarter than us, it's just that the smartest came here, which is why they're educated and speak English. Opposite of that of course are those crossing illegally from south of the border. There are no intelligence limits, just finding routes that allow access into the country. Which is why they are not educated and only speak Spanish.

       We probably agree more than we disagree. I believe that America should have made every effort to remain a homogenous nation. 90% European minimum, with an allowance for quality immigrants.

       It feels that way. I suppose to conclude the argument would be something of a synthesis, at least on my end. For now, total ban on all immigration. Enforcement of laws to cull illegal immigration. Strict mandatory English language use requirements in all businesses and local goverments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most Americans would agree with this while things get settled down and under control. While (other factors) still run rampant, there's little to be done from those outside forces if laws are enforced.

       Social issues mostly. Though I tend to agree with the democrats on foreign policy. I firmly believe in the rights of the individual. While I am not a big fan of tax cuts for the wealthy I think the economics of the left are insane. It is not your god given right to free everything just because we live in a modern rich country. My taxes should not pay the medical bills of anyone. Higher education should not be free for all. That is a choice for the school itself to make. Cultural diversity should not be forced upon us by anyone. Because we are different. It can does occur organically just fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I see is a country where a very large,young and tech savvy generation is being fooled and they are falling for it. Of course Trump took russian money....but so did Sanders. And plenty of others on the left have as well. The Russians have been very shrewd in their ongoing operation. The country is the most divided that I can recall in my lifetime. But we just want to fight. The gun nuts are just about to bust their nut thinking anew civil war is coming. The left is no better screaming NAZI at anyone who is right of Obama...who is very much a centrist. Because that is me they are talking about. I live in a very racily diverse neighborhood and city. Yet I see none of the evils I read about on here. Yes we have tensions but it tends to be stupid stuff.

       This is going to end in widespread violence. And we will only have ourselves to blame.

       Something like 5 people own as much wealth as the bottom 50% of the country. You can’t say everything is fine. This system being “organic” is a buzzword that doesn’t inherently mean good or bad.

       I felt I was liberal for most of my life (I’m 36 soon, so do the math, obviously the first 10-12 years maybe don’t count for much) but the last 2 years there is NO FUCKING WAY I would identify as that. Not even close. I’m pretty down the middle. Do what you want as long as it doesn’t affect me or others. I just can’t get on board with the agendas the left has been pushing.

         I’m sorta down the middle on abortion. I think it’s a viable option for some, but I think it’s a sticky situation getting the general public to pay for it. I have had the fortune of not having to decide to get one ever, and honestly I don’t think I would be able to get one - or want my partner to get one. I personally feel there is a fine line between what is a life and not. I’m not sure what that is, and again, I’m glad I haven’t and won’t have to decide to get one. But if they found one molecule of water on mars - what would we call it? “Just cells?”. I’ve had friends who have gotten them and I’ve supported them through them, but I don’t necessarily think they got them for the right reasons, but wouldn’t ever make them feel bad for having done it.

         I believe in the free market. Dollars or whatever makes the votes. And you can even apply that to say Milo speaking at a campus - he should be allowed to, and whether or not there is an audience for it will dictate it’s success. Will he do another, etc. Heck - I’m actually probably fine with a restaurant saying “no white people” if that’s what they choose - I don’t think it would last long because of the free market, but that’s their prerogative.

         there are 2 genders. It’s absolutely fine if you feel like dressing up as the other one. It’s absolutely fine to be homosexual if that’s what you want (sorta separate). But I don’t think any of those things mean you’re a different gender because of it.

         I don’t think ethnic diversity needs to be a goal. For a job for instance - the best candidate should get the job. If your criteria for best is “most diverse” I mean that’s up to you, but I doubt that’s sustainable.

         America is the most diverse country on the face of the earth, it doesn’t need to be “more” necessarily. And it would 100% be fine if it was 100% white if that so happened organically say. I’m not sure how. I’m just talking in extremes. I don’t think it’s inherently bad.

       Thanks very much for writing all this up, i'm always curious to hear a variety of what are essentially wedge issues for people who can articulate them..
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive been rattling your answer around in my head since you posted it wondering how to best respond being that I agree with a lot of what you are saying while being apathetic/neutral to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never liked self identifying labels (i'm a gun-owning, motorsport loving, skeptical yet empathetic American just like many other libs &amp; cons around me),  but certainly prefer more 'leftist' politicians/policy as I believe they represent workers better than the 'rightest' policy makers apparently more focused on owners/investors.  My primary wedge though is likely protecting our commons/env., something I feel gets sold out at any opportunity. I dont like either party and wish we had 2 different labor parties to focus on a sustainable plan for after the singularity occurs over trying to regain our strength by diminishing the strength of other nations.  I called myself libertarian until i realized how isolationist and nationalistic most are.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance I agree with your gender statement, but really dont care how people want to self identify.  At the end of the day we are just a mash of chromosomes and chemicals and some of us get the wrong ones, so I can empathize with the identity struggles of these people.  I dont have to change my language to suit anyone unless i am in their house and trying to show respect.  I don't believe people who want to dress like another gender is more likely to abuse children in a bathroom than straight people, so what do I care what bathroom they use?
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely agree with your last statement as well.  I grew up in an affluent whitebred town and quality of life was great as it was. On the same front I do really value diversity both in my new neighborhood and as a manger/leader - it brings color, conflict and with that opportunity and exposure to new ideas. I also think it makes storytime much more interesting hearing what living/growing up in other countries is like compared to us. But i dont hear left leaning politicians demanding more diversity in the US, as much as that may end up being part of the net impact of managing immigration/refugees.  I also dont hear anyone except a minority of extremists who are asking for an open boarder. Most americans dont take this seriously left or right ive talked to including bluedog members of my family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regressive news stations giving a platform to extremists doing anything to survive are causing a lot of harm misrepresenting the majority of liberal beliefs in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do disagree with your statement about white privilege having seen Asian friends get cars impounded while i get a slap on the wrist for doing the same thing (driving a lowered sports cars) literally getting pulled over right along side them.  All of us were respectful, had $ and could pay our way out no problem but they got the punishment for whatever reason. Anyway, i know that is totally anecdotal, and privilege can be very abstract as we all have varying degrees of it (i cant grow to 6 feet tall). Really $, health and education is privilege more than anything and whites can be just as poor/uneducated.  But where I really think i believe in it is from studies like this
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/10/american-kids-are-starving-for-words/381552/">
        Word Gap

       , then considering the fact whites have higher held positions/greater affluence, there is typically a greater chance for a white kid to do better in school/business, especially over a child raised by those not born here.  But whites faced the same struggles through time in waves as they moved here.  My italian family got a lot of persecution/struggled a lot dealing with irish-american nationlists in NY when they came here.  White privilege isn't applicable to all for sure - if you are raised by shit parents who molest you, you aren't privileged.

       anyway, dont know if you care about any of this, just wanted to reply with something... you would be an interesting person to have a beer with.  it seems healthy to have these talks rather than jumping to wanting to kill eachother over labels.   cheers

       Weed should be legalized. And I think you should be able to responsibly purchase guns. I don’t personally know what is all involved in owning a gun (I’m Canadian), but there SHOULD be rules to follow, and as long as you follow them, you’re good. I don’t believe responsible gun owners are the ones shooting up schools or whatever.

How will people know if the products they're buying aren't toxic and won't give them cancer in 20 years (or will label regulation laws be okay in your free market)? Likewise, how will you account for power asymmetry? Or do you truly believe that all participants within a market have equal opportunity?

       I think it's a slap in the face that America was the mastermind behind NAFTA, illegal immigration skyrocketed after its passing, now it's crying foul.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened in Mexico with NAFTA? Corn subsidies ended, corn tariffs were removed, ejidos (communally owned farms) were removed (this allowed large multinational agricultural corporations to buy the land), intellectual property rights were strengthened (so GMO corn could be patented). What happened with GMO corn you ask? It somehow found its way to smaller farms owned by mexicans and when Monsanto scientists ran test on their corn and found GMO genes in their corn, they could sue them and take their farm. Millions of farmers were forced to find new work. You can guess where they went for that work.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think you're confusing biological sex with gender. Sex is the genitals (biological) you were born with, gender is a societal role. And while it's true that what sex you were born as has a pretty large influence: career interest, empathy, grip strength, interest in casual sex, and so on, studies have shown that male to female transsexuals have, on average, more feminine traits (before they transition) than your average straight male. After undergoing hormone treatments, these traits are enhanced.

       To be honest, you don't sound remotely liberal. What liberal policies do you support?

       Yes, it has been beneficial in some areas but I think it's dubious as to how much NAFTA is playing a role in improving things there. Mexico's economy is doing much better now after some economic reforms over the last 5-10 years. This is mostly why illegal immigration has been going down quite a bit. But many economists aren't so sure NAFTA is a major reason for this and they think the internal reforms and giving more independence to its central bank are the larger influencers.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it still doesn't change my point that  NAFTA was extremely hard on Mexico's farmers. I don't think any of those farmers would have wanted to join NAFTA had they known what was coming.

       It’s a nice sentiment to think that taxpayers shouldn’t have to pay for an abortion, but it’s a lot cheaper than having a young mother raise a child she can’t afford/take care of. The burden on the taxpayer is significantly higher in that case. You’re gonna be paying for that child either way. 
A lot of pro life people are ‘pro-life’ until the actual moment of birth, then they think the baby born into poverty should pull itself up by its bootstraps. Kind of hypocritical if you ask me.

       In my book, people can identify as whatever gender they feel, since it doesn’t hurt me. You might want to check the difference between gender and sex. Sex is biological, and there are only two sexes. Gender applies more to the idea of masculine or feminine characteristics. Some people are a certain sex but feel their gender and identity don’t fit their sex. It’s not really a matter of opinion. You can have an opinion on whether or not trans people should be allowed to use their bathroom of choice or whatever, but there’s no denying how trans people feel, and that they exist.

        I personally feel there is a fine line between what is a life and not. I’m not sure what that is, and again, I’m glad I haven’t and won’t have to decide to get one. But if they found one molecule of water on mars - what would we call it? “Just cells?”

      <p>
       Yet when Beyonce announces she's pregnant suddenly its NOT just cells right? The media and people refer to her fetus as a person, an heiress, a bad bitch, ETC. Complete hipocrisy.

       Thanks very much for writing all this up, i'm always curious to hear a variety of what are essentially wedge issues for people who can articulate them..
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive been rattling your answer around in my head since you posted it wondering how to best respond being that I agree with a lot of what you are saying while being apathetic/neutral to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never liked self identifying labels (i'm a gun-owning, motorsport loving, skeptical yet empathetic American just like many other libs &amp; cons around me),  but certainly prefer more 'leftist' politicians/policy as I believe they represent workers better than the 'rightest' policy makers apparently more focused on owners/investors.  My primary wedge though is likely protecting our commons/env., something I feel gets sold out at any opportunity. I dont like either party and wish we had 2 different labor parties to focus on a sustainable plan for after the singularity occurs over trying to regain our strength by diminishing the strength of other nations.  I called myself libertarian until i realized how isolationist and nationalistic most are.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance I agree with your gender statement, but really dont care how people want to self identify.  At the end of the day we are just a mash of chromosomes and chemicals and some of us get the wrong ones, so I can empathize with the identity struggles of these people.  I dont have to change my language to suit anyone unless i am in their house and trying to show respect.  I don't believe people who want to dress like another gender is more likely to abuse children in a bathroom than straight people, so what do I care what bathroom they use?
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely agree with your last statement as well.  I grew up in an affluent whitebred town and quality of life was great as it was. On the same front I do really value diversity both in my new neighborhood and as a manger/leader - it brings color, conflict and with that opportunity and exposure to new ideas. I also think it makes storytime much more interesting hearing what living/growing up in other countries is like compared to us. But i dont hear left leaning politicians demanding more diversity in the US, as much as that may end up being part of the net impact of managing immigration/refugees.  I also dont hear anyone except a minority of extremists who are asking for an open boarder. Most americans dont take this seriously left or right ive talked to including bluedog members of my family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regressive news stations giving a platform to extremists doing anything to survive are causing a lot of harm misrepresenting the majority of liberal beliefs in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do disagree with your statement about white privilege having seen Asian friends get cars impounded while i get a slap on the wrist for doing the same thing (driving a lowered sports cars) literally getting pulled over right along side them.  All of us were respectful, had $ and could pay our way out no problem but they got the punishment for whatever reason. Anyway, i know that is totally anecdotal, and privilege can be very abstract as we all have varying degrees of it (i cant grow to 6 feet tall). Really $, health and education is privilege more than anything and whites can be just as poor/uneducated.  But where I really think i believe in it is from studies like this
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/10/american-kids-are-starving-for-words/381552/">
        Word Gap
       </a>
       , then considering the fact whites have higher held positions/greater affluence, there is typically a greater chance for a white kid to do better in school/business, especially over a child raised by those not born here.  But whites faced the same struggles through time in waves as they moved here.  My italian family got a lot of persecution/struggled a lot dealing with irish-american nationlists in NY when they came here.  White privilege isn't applicable to all for sure - if you are raised by shit parents who molest you, you aren't privileged.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, dont know if you care about any of this, just wanted to reply with something... you would be an interesting person to have a beer with.  it seems productive to have these talks rather than jumping to wanting to kill eachother over labels.   cheers

       I appreciate the thoughtful response. I’ll take a bit to absorb all that but I will quickly say - the gender thing, I actually don’t really care either. Call yourself whatever, I don’t care. I’d appreciate a person not being too sensitive if I get it wrong or something. I wouldn’t be sensitive if I was in their position. I guarantee that. What I don’t like about the gender thing is what I feel is the push by the media to normalize it, when I truly feel a very very small percentage of the population can be put under that umbrella. And then further. Actually going through with surgeries and the normalizing of that does concern me. And statistics do tend to be in my favour on that. But I mean again - to each their own. Overall, I’m on the side of do what makes you happy, and don’t worry about how it’s perceived as long as it’s not somehow affecting someone else (in an obvious way).
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah - likewise. Would be a good beer conversation with you - seems like it would be a great conversation. I guess most importantly is that I am displaying that I am open to different view points. And I think my change from feeling “liberal” to no longer sorta shows that. I am always in search of what I feel is most true. Period. And I’m okay with that.

       I agree with this. I can’t imagine you align with ALL of any other person or groups beliefs. I love my wife, but we disagree on things and that’s fine. How the fuck am I to expect to fully agree with any public official? You always just gotta pick the one that you agree with most at any given times. Or that aligns with your values most.

       Look at the polls since the D's have started their massive social media campaign. They have dropped almost 10 points since 2016 among young white males, yet establishment presence online seems to be the dominant view. All this money in controlling narratives is having the opposite effect desired. Who knew folks despised being belittled and gaslighted. ¯_(ツ)_/¯

       Letting people do what they want and be who they are is true liberalism and progressivism. That’s what I believed in and believe in and that’s what I felt the Democratic party was about for years. Hence I was a strong Democrat, supported Obama, etc.

       We need to separate economic liberalism from social. Does anyone on the left seriously suggest the state should control the means of production?

       Socialism is when workers control the means of production or at least it should have been historically and social democrats are not socialists they exist within capitalism and use socialism not to replace capitalism but to counter some of its negative effects.

       Until you realize that the "Trump is a clown" mentality was fed to you by media propaganda. I used to think the same way, and was a huge Bernie supporter.

       Bernies treatment by the media made me realize they were slandering Trump even worse. Now I'm voting Trump 2020

       How does this stuff even get associated with the left though? I vote blue because I want universal health care, environmental protection, equal rights for lgbtq, etc. I don't see how that stuff got caught up with this SJW bullshit. Every one of my liberal friends hates these SJW types just as much as anyone. I wish people didn't assume that the entire left supports this shit.

       Well the progressive left knows this as well. So they have decided to hijack a major political party hoping to win that way. Because no matter how great they think their ideas are they just do not win elections. Bernie Sanders had no intention of winning. He just wanted control of the party platform. It is now "progressives" who control the party. Do not be surprised by more losses this fall.

       No, it's still the same forces that controlled it before, those who have contributed the most money, just like the GOP. The parties have different sponsors at times and when they share the same sponsors, we get bipartisanship.

       Just vote third party or Republican and give them the middle finger. I voted democrat before, but probably not voting for them until they reject this sjw/racist part of the left. They have yet to do that and appear to be doubling down after the election. I think they need to lose another election to see that people are sick of the sjw/racism.

       Hello middle aged white guy. I'm a middle aged Indian guy (from India) and I feel for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Equality is not something that can be enforced by doing the reverse of what happened in the past generations ago. Being anti white is as racist as being anti black/asian even though there is a past where white people held black people as slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is only one way to have equality - treating everyone equally. Period.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying there are not disadvantaged families and individuals. But that there are disadvantaged families and individuals from all races and they should have equal opportunities available to them that are proportionate to the disadvantage they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if we truly want to make this an equal world, then there is no space for anyone racist. Tolerating racism like Sarah Jeong's will only lead us to a more divided world.

       Yes. I just treat others how I wish to be treated myself. Race does not play into that. I live in a western state in a very diverse area. I grew up in a rural part of the same state. Racism is real I have witnessed it all my life. And for a time when I was younger I was very racist against Mexicans. But that brought me nothing and when I had children I did not want them raised as I was. My views evolved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the past few years have worried me greatly. Division is being spread by outside actors all across America. Far to many younger people and useful idiots are falling for it. The State can not force me to love thy neighbor any more than it can force me to hate. But it can be used by all sides to further divide us. That is also a world I do not want for my children and future generations.

       I am just tired of being blamed. I am and have always been poor white trash. I grew up in a small town where not only was I a minority but English was not even the dominate language,in middle America. I get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have watched for years as my peers have have been promoted strictly due to race,gender and now sexuality. When I wanted to go to college after high school I was too poor to afford it and to white for financial aid. In 2008 when greedy white men crashed the economy I lost everything and was out of work for a year. But I was a single father not a mother so no assistance for me. I am just tired of paying the price for past wrongs committed by men who are everything I stand against.

       i've been there too. I remember once I was applying for public housing and was basically told because I didn't have a criminal record I was lower on the standing to get a house. I asked if I walk out of this building and smash your windows, will I move up? She actually said yes. It's a joke.

       I understand white men, some, a tiny minority of us, have great jobs, but for the rest of us we are expected to sit on the bottom of the ladder and let everyone else shit on us for our skin colour. There are so many levels to it all too. Like you mentioned college and uni having funding for minorities and yet not us, who paid the tax to fund that funding. Housing is the same. Jobs are the same. Media is the same. The more you notice it, the more it eats away at you and you see it everywhere. Mention it to people and they call you mad, but keep mentioning it, eventually everyone has to accept you are right because it is so blatant. I've changed so many peoples minds on this subject and its so easy with time because they can see it for themselves, they've just never noticed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you can't complain about it, because somehow that makes you racist (see Tommy Robinson). And then they have the balls to turn around and say you can't be racist to a white person. When you have Nothing and people are unwilling to help entirely based on your race and gender.

       What you just said &amp; the anti-2A stance most Democrats have adopted in order to shoot themselves in the foot are why I'm being pushed away.

       White people may be responsible for many of the ills of the world, but they're responsible for much good as well. Strangely, the good stuff, like pretty much everything we have today in this glorious, scientifically advanced society of ours, is hardly mentioned, and I have a feeling, if it was all tallied together, the good would outweigh the bad by a large margin. But we shouldn't keep score, because that's not what humanity should be about. Individuals should be judged or praised on their own merits, not as undistinguishable members of large, similar looking groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       And discrimination is discrimination. You can't condemn bigots for unjustly railing against minorities while in the same breath justify bigoted remarks against whites. Either it's all racism, or it's not racism at all. Can't have it both ways.

       The DNC is no party for white men. They don’t care about you or the things you value. That’s why the traditionally left Rust Belt went for Trump. He cares about working class issues, a traditionally leftist policy. Instead the DNC has abandoned the working class in favor of unifying various client groups in opposition to the straight white male.

       Don't let them make you abandon your values. These media outlets are not actually liberal, they're spouting the same exact filth as the far right, but with a shiny liberal coat of paint (see: horseshoe theory). You won't escape it by running to the right, you will only escape it by refusing to play their petty game.

       So I guess the NYT not firing Jeong and even defending her means they proudly stand with racism? These tweets are racist, bottom line. I ultimately think its the company's choice to fire whoever they want, but its a bit shocking the NYT is condoning such vile racism.

       Your analogy is faulty as well, since in your scenario Jeong's hateful posts would be more akin to literally raping their sister to get the point across, not simply acknowledging it hypothetically as you presented it.

       Her exact tweet was "Muslim brotherhood &amp; Planet of the Apes had a baby=vj"
      </p>
      <p>
       She is acusing her of being part of a radical religious/terrorist group. I'd say it's a small step to calling her, somebody who I'll admit doesn't look 100% black but certainly looks mixed, a ape. Knowing damn well the racial undertone behind calling a black person that.

       You are almost as lazy as Trump with your pathetic repetitive insults. I can't believe that anyone who unironically posts at T_D is capable of logical, rational or critical thought. You are exactly the fragile ego, reverse-SJW, "screw political correctness" until it becomes a convenient weapon, unjustly entitled type of asshole I'm referring to. You're the biggest snowflake in the room, crying about all of the snowflakes.

       I agree, this isn’t the same as Roseanne. These tweets are far worse than what Roseanne said. You can throw around your made up terms all you want, but this is a textbook display of racism. You don’t get to pick and choose what’s racist based on the color of the subject. You’re contributing to the exact same thing that you claim to be fighting against and it’s entertaining.

       Making jokes about white people isn’t the same as making racist jokes about black people, or Asian people, or Jews, or gay people, or any other historically oppressed minority. This is a very simple principle, but one that many aggrieved whites find difficult to accept. You can’t say, “Well, imagine if you replaced ‘white’ with ‘black’ in those tweets,” because those two things are not equally replaceable. As much as you might find it desperately oppressive to not be able to use the n-word when you sing along to rap songs, there has never been a government-endorsed legal or societal campaign of oppression against whites. White people
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be oppressed by other means, such as through gender or economics, but whites in the U.S. have never been systematically oppressed on the basis of their race alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, white people in the United States have had it comparatively super good in large part
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       of their oppression of other races; when you, a white person, express or act upon your prejudice towards oppressed groups, you are taking part in that oppression. You contribute to the project of belittling, keeping down, otherizing, and exploiting historically oppressed minorities. When a member of an oppressed community complains about white people, that is different, because it is the whites who are doing the oppression. It is just different, which things often are.

       First of all,
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       that is unfairly judged or condemned based solely on the color of their skin has a grievance, because that is the very definition of racism. Today there is no "government-endorsed legal oppression" of people based on race. There is no justification for racism towards another because of events that happened decades ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, you're generalization and assumption that all white people are somehow benefiting from historical events, is inherently racist. You're argument is absolutely ignorant and absurd.

Nevermind about trying to progress society as a whole, this is about my personal vendetta against you and everyone like you because of the color of your skin.

       So in short it's another one of those old fashioned cases of a guy too (willfully?) ignorant to get the differencies between racism directed towards whites and other races quarreling with some other dudes who are too (willfully?) ignorant to understand the relevance of anti-white racism, both of whom are being tightly mentally restrained by crippling ideology?

       I suppose so, yes. Actual racism benefits from the choices of both contrahents here. If we truly want to work against racism we need to seriously try to avoid being more stupid then necessary.

       White people is a socio-economic term when used in these types of contexts. PoC can be wypipo. Looking this defensive isn't certainly helping stereotypes. I don't know why I subscribed to this sub, I expected better.

       i know that racism from blacks tends to be more openly tolerated in high population centers, but that doesn't really reflect on which group has more racists or worse racists overall.  for the latter, it almost suggests the opposite, even

       I agreed because of twitter. I have no actual numbers. 
On twitter there is plenty of incredibly racist blacks there and nobody complains, while as soon as some kid like Milo trolls some e celeb, everyone calls racism and people get suspended no questions asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its just another example of hypocrisy and double standards. Nothing to do with blacks actually, its all fueled with left partisanship. Whoever white liberals chose as their pet, is allowed to do bad things to evil nazis.

       Very true i think most people tend to think of it in that traditional prejudice sense. Like there's nowhere near the level of outward racial prejudice there was in the 60's. People should focus on the fact that we're still using laws from questionable eras that were concieved/implemented by people who thought they were superior

       i think people should focus on those as well, but use the adjectives "systemic" or "institutional" when discussing such racism outside of an academic discussion, and not try to push a simplified, memeified version of the sociological definition as the only correct one.

       I don't want to concede the territory of reddit to hypocritical Marxists but I also hate rewarding a platform that doesn't value free speech. I was banned the other day from r/videos for saying "Why? He dindunuffin." I realize that may be considered a low energy, brainless comment... but I don't see that as hate speech. I hate that I constantly feel the desire to qualify factual statements with, "I'm not trying to sound racist but..."

       we all get banned from subs. It's usually fine if you get downvoted for your controversial opinion but if you post something that goes against the grain that gets upvoted, you are out.

       There should be a
       <a href="/r/bannedfrom">
        /r/bannedfrom

       sub for people to moan about within rather than constantly coming to conspiracy though. its not a conspiracy. mods are just bellends and reddits full of edgy teens who cant have their feelings hurt. its tragic.

       She was being trolled by right wingers on Twitter, so she thought it would be funny to reverse it on them and post some hateful memes in retaliation. These tweets taken out of context are what you're looking at here. Insterestingly if you look at Edwars Snowdens twitter he's been defending her against these accusations. Theres more than meets the eye to this story, someone wanted to ruin this womans reputation and this is how they are doing it.

       It seems like that r/racism is full of white hate and that’s about it. A subreddit made “to end racism” is all about bashing whites and encouraging other races to be racist

       Your first problem was going to R/Racism. Imagine living in 2018 and still believes R/Racism isn't a hate sub, much like ADL and SPLC, which are both the biggest hate groups in the US under the guise of tolerance combating "nazis".

       1) It's typically RICH leftistists that shout "BUT WHITE PRIVILEGEEE11!" the loudest. Seriously, go lookup debates with these people and you'll start to see a pattern of coming from rich families where they went to private schools and such WITH the white people they are against. The SJW leftists NEVER recognize their own "privilege".
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I don't see why places like Europe need diversity--especially with all the refugees. Would you say the same thing about Japan?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) You CAN be racist against whites. I don't get this whole mentality of "I want to be in white spaces" yet take jabs at all the white people once you are in that space? Makes no sense. Instead, go empower spaces of your own race. The ironic thing is that MLK wanted INTEGRATION and NOT SEGREGATION yet all these new wave SJWs are all about segregation....sad actually.

       The majority of comments agreed with me.

       I was banned from r/racism for posting about how the black kids in my school were more racist than the white people there. It’s obviously pushing there own agenda and the reddit isn’t about discussing racism. As long as it’s against white people it’s ok tho.

       Let's not get things slanted. This wasn't some harmless gobbledygook. It was racism of celestial proportions. We need to nip this racism in the bud. Otherwise we risk exposing a chink in our collective armor of cultural cohesion.

       Woah woah woah chillll. I'm a young black male and I feel for you guys. I think this has become a manufactured issue with the intent of divisiveness. You'd be surprised that the black community on
       <em>
        average
       </em>
       supports you as an
       <em>
        individual
       </em>
       . What I only stress is that you don't feel the need to be an 89er because of the perception of a brigade. I don't think there will be any concrete effects that will come the way of white America because of this attack on the mind. Which is all it really is. Be fed up with being accused, but dont let it turn to hate for someone in the same boat as you. Just remember who the real enemy is, which we remind you of everyday on this subreddit.

       Fair enough mate, I appreciate that you feel that way.  The older I get, the less I trust most people anyway.  I can't know what you have been through until I have walked a mile in your shoes.  I just want you to know there are plenty of white people who respect and appreciate black people, and people of many cultures for that matter.

       That being said, nothing excuses some of the racist shit I have seen pulled on blacks by the police.  That Sterling Brown arrest in Milwaukee recently, amongst many others, was terrible and needs to be stamped out.

       Nobody is interested in controlling anyone’s voice but YOU. You don’t see individuals, you see black people and white people and Asian people. You don’t acknowledge ideas, you acknowledge black ideas and white ideas. People like you are obsessed with race.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll tell you what else. You think white people are superior. You see, someone who isn’t a racist...they believe all people should have an equal opportunity. Just merit, nothing else. You don’t want that, you don’t believe it’s possible. You say that  minorities need a savior like you to hoist them up from their doomed existence and place them amongst Gods chosen.

       I always liked the opening monologue by Irish mobster Frank Costello (played by Jack Nicholson) in The Departed movie:
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me. Years ago we had the church. That was only a way of saying – we had each other. The Knights of Columbus were real head-breakers; true guineas. They took over their piece of the city. Twenty years after an Irishman couldn’t get a fucking job, we had the presidency. May he rest in peace. That’s what the n*****s don’t realize. If I got one thing against the black chappies, it’s this – no one gives it to you. You have to take it.

       The problem isn’t someone else of a different ethnicity having a voice. The problem is people like you who sit and whine about racism and stereotypes, but at the same time are happy to be hypocritical and use their voice to be an anti-white racist in the same breath. People like that are just as bad as the racists they claim to be fighting against.

       Black Lives Matter movement is just anti white racism guised as social activism disrupting modern life because they are clinging to the failed Black Panther movement of the 60's.

       Sharia Law which is possibly the most anti female movement in the world is SUPPORTED by liberal feminists.

        Redlining
       </a>
       is a well documented systematic denial of loans targeted at minorities that lasted through 60s, 70s and 80s. This resulted in landlord abandonment, lower property values and a shortage of new business opportunities. Neighborhoods were left in disrepair with vacant buildings that were haven for drugs and illegal activities. In turn generations that were victims of redlining became targets for predatory loans, resulting in low credit scores and a lack of home-ownership.
      </p>

       We literally created the state that minorities find themselves in today. This was not 200 years ago.

        I suggest you pick up a newspaper - even a fairly liberal paper like the New York Times. Now go through all the editorial pictures published in that edition and count how many people pictured are male and white and how many are not. Overwhelmingly, those pictured, particulrly in the political and business section will be white and male.

       More telling is to

       on staff, in management, and ownership of MSM and lesser media outlets. I assure you, they're far more represented than the 2-3% of the population of the U.S. they make up. Including many of the people you're calling "white."

       The article in the post to which I was replying brought up immigrants. If you think Trump is equivalent to extreme hate groups, I don’t know what to tell you. Please, cite for me these “clearly” racist remarks that he’s made. You’re full of shit and deluding yourself to believe the “he’s hates brown people!” narrative.

       Letting people do what they want and be who they are is true liberalism and progressivism. That’s what I believed in and believe in and that’s what I felt the Democratic party was about for years. Hence I was a strong Democrat, supported Obama, etc.
