       There is a silver lining to the bigot Jeong getting a position at the NY Times. I'm not upset, she is essentially harmless. What I'm glad about is that it's waking people up to the fact that there is an active campaign to eliminate the white race. This is done mainly via politics and media. They shove pornography down our throats, especially black on white cuckold pornography to normalize interracial sex. They have men who look like women to distract us from reproducing with women. Even in commercials they try to normalize interracial breeding. This stuff actually happens my ex girlfriend left me last year because she was suddenly "interested in black guys". Everything white people do are demonized, to make us less of a person. We are branded racists and bigots, and are voices are left unheard. In intellectual circles our speech is chilled, remember James Damore from Google? The fact is, any attempt at white genocide is futile because white people are the creators (and keepers) of civilization. We will not be replaced.

       Man, do you really think that there are that many people out there that they can outpopulate Europe and then NA and AU?

      <p>
       Like that has to be a massive number to accomplish that even over a long time. It would have to be more than the population of Europe now to start and like, there is just not enough "brainwashed ones" to do that.

       By that logic it also has the potential to eliminate the black race. Each child would be at least half black/half white, right?

       It’s the one drop rule, and everybody recognizes it. It’s why Obama (black father, white mother) was called “the first black president” and not “the next white president.” Half-black is barely different from all-black

       Genocide refers to killing. So with that in mind it's hard to take this seriously when it's done by people choosing who they love.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're literally calling people who are half white and brown a product of "genocide". Which is absurd.

       In that way it is a "soft" killing by replacing white gene pool with non-white. That is not to mention the mass rapes by immigrants leading to pregnancies in places like Sweeden. Regardless there is actual killing to, look at SA farmers.

       The world is actually a small place. Why don't you think of it in terms of white DNA polluting a pure black person's race? OR white skin destroying Asian race.

      <p>
       You don't because your race is your identity. You are no individual. You'd only feel comfortable if people who look like you, herd around you.

       being called racist. Had a guy tell me that black people had it better before the civil rights movement and were terrible decision makers and then turned around acted offended that I even dare suggest that he might be racist

        This is true humanity
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Tribes and nations across the world and across history have cared for those injured, weaker than themselves, less fortunate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is only "human nature" to allow the weak to suffer if you also believe it is "human nature" to be completely selfish and isolationist in all respects. To hunt only for onesself, and to hoard their belongings like a dragon.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to run off and live in the woods like a "predatory man" and die alone in the cold when you fail to succeed in hunting, or you're injured thus that you cannot hunt and feed yourself, I will still wish to feed you, to heal you, because humankind in its entirety ought to be brothers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to talk about family units, then speak of them - they help each other to survive. The same altruism extends to friends and friends of friends, and familiarity breeds fondness, which breeds a desire to protect and nurture. And thus, we have a tribal unit. Then tribes make alliances and help each other, and we have nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human nature is to find other humans and protect each other, and provide for each other. To deny the human power of empathy and desire to protect is... well, frankly, ridiculous. We have artefacts and graves and remains of people throughout history showing that humans cared deeply for the "useless" members of their tribe - buried with honors, recorded with fondness, protected and supported even when they could not 'provide' for the tribe.
      </p>
      <p>
       People help those around them, at the cost of themselves. Humans will throw themselves into floods and flames to help a stranger - often killing themselves in the process. Humans will refuse to leave the site of a cave in, refuse to rest in favor of helping to shift the rubble until everyone inside has been taken out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the difference is that I believe humans are good, and at their cores DO want to be happy with their fellows, while you think they are inherently selfish and isolationist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we should provide safety and comfort to those without.
      </p>
      <p>
       because THAT is human nature."

       I mean, what did you expect with that OP? That's racism 101. And does it count as a personal attack if it's true? All those non-white people that are dating white people, aren't you personally attacking them with what you are saying? So it's okay to do it to others, but it's a problem when it's being done to you?

       I sure do. I have no bias, I have no side, I have no agenda to promote. My agenda is to push people to start acting like HUMAN BEINGS and stop allowing those in power to determine their thoughts and allow them to imprint such idiotic ideas, like what you've said. I don't care about your skin color, I don't care about your gender, I don't care about your sexuality. Just be a fucking decent human being. Is that so hard?

       Yes, you've blamed whites for dating outside the white race which can potentially eliminate whiteness. You also blamed them for feeling guilty for previous vile acts committed by 'whites' that you so proudly celebrate. Now you want to blame people for SYMPATHIZING with a race that has gone through HELL in the hands of 'white' people? I'm sorry, but you keep exposing yourself as an extremely bigoted person. You think you are making sense and stating facts, when all you do is dig yourself a bigger hole. If you HONESTLY don't see how what you are saying is bullshit and rooted in racism, then I feel sorry for you. Maybe you should try and inject some love and positivity in your life.

       You must be a real delusional and self-absorbed person to think that the only reason your girlfriend left you is because of a master scheme against white people, which brainwashed your girlfriend into preferring 'black guys'. How about you do some self evaluation and find the REAL reasons she left you for someone else? Regardless of who that is and what color their skin is.

       Listen man, I’m sorry that your gf left you. I just got over a relationship myself that I thought was genuine. In my case, she made some mistakes but there were definitely things I could have done differently in attempting to save it, which I did not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what the others are trying to tell you is that maybe there’s something
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       could have done differently, something that doesn’t involve blaming a fabrication, one created by deceptive people in order to manipulate you by pulling at your emotions. You’re better than that.

       I live outside the US now and it took lots of education for me to understand just how homogeneous Americans are. Most nations in the world are this way as well yet some of us back stateside tend to believe there’s more depth to our culture than what’s perceived. It’s created a lot of cynicism but let me tell you, being away made me quickly realize how similar most of us Americans really are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t expect you to agree with every discussion here. But please, don’t allow yourself to be so easily exploited. It’s how innocent people get hurt.

       Just look at the absurd number of commercials that are pushing interracial marriage. There’s nothing inherently wrong with interracial couples of course, but it’s an obvious agenda to destroy the white race.

       The reason I post this is not because it is 100% dead on to your post here but because it remarks on a truism these days among the young folks that does speak to this 'white genocide' nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many young folks these days have no cross to die on like maybe black Americans do (racism) or women (patriarchy) or gay people (literal rights) and find themselves so bored with existence and in such an existential malaise that they invent literal fucking crosses to bear or pick up shitty racist tropes like 'my race is being genocided'.  Young folks literally grasping at straws to have something that adds meaning to their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well my friends, this nonsense is not it.  This is old school racist baloney.  All the alt-right tropes are just rehashed racist nonsense you've grasped to feel better about your existential dread.

       Here is the truth:  All humans are going to die in the not too distant future because of out of control global warming and their positive feed back loops that will make the planet uninhabitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, right when the "minorities" that outnumber white people finally get around to wiping out the white minority, the whites will have the last laugh because we pretty much single handedly fucked this planet to the point where no one will be able to live on it!
      </p>
      <p>
       It will be our last "fuck you" to everyone.

       I guarantee op would not be talking about all this white race bs back when the Irish immigrants were sub human trash, that were slightly better than African Americans. Where was all this white pride then ? Nadda

       And it's  the girls who want to have babies, we don't even care!. Your white women are the true culprits of the mayocide.

       I mean, what did you expect with that OP? That's racism 101. And does it count as a personal attack if it's true? All those non-white people that are dating white people, aren't you personally attacking them with what you are saying? So it's okay to do it to others, but it's a problem when it's being done to you?

       The world is actually a small place. Why don't you think of it in terms of white DNA polluting a pure black person's race? OR white skin destroying Asian race.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't because your race is your identity. You are no individual. You'd only feel comfortable if people who look like you, herd around you.
