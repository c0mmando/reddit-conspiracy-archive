        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What do people think? 
I’ve been fascinated with aliens/ufos/higher dimensional beings for years. 
There’s a lot of information out there. We all know the story of Roswell, aliens supposed interest in nuclear weapons. People channeling aliens (AFFA, Dolores cannon). The greys, the nordics, the reptilians. People mediating into higher dimensions and meeting entities. Cosmic indifference (the idea that there are massive entities but they don’t care about us just like we don’t care about ants) 
It’s hard to separate fact from fiction. </p>

<p>My question is not really, do we believe aliens are here or not, but rather, do we think that aliens are all good, all evil, or some mix in between? </p>

<p>Personally I was always in the benevolent aliens/beings camp but I’m interested in what other people say. </p>

<p>Good vs evil
God vs Satan 
Humans vs their self destructive tendencies </p>

<p>What a time to be alive</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re both incorrect in that they lie on opposite extremes of a spectrum that is much more wide and variegated than they let on.  Non-Earth based beings are not &quot;all good&quot; as Greer asserts, and they&#39;re no &quot;all bad&quot; as DeLonge does.  They&#39;re just like humans - some are good, some are bad, most don&#39;t give af.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all over the place - just like everything is.</p>

<p>Anyone that tries to think about this dynamic in only one &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; way is just doing it way wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah no I totally agree, I just think it’s interesting that this “evil alien” narrative could become the predominant one (if Tom DeLonge gets the exposure he wants) 
I don’t think it’s all one or the other, though I would think in highly advanced beings that the need for “bad” or nefarious behavior could be less than humans. But you’re right it’s a massive spectrum.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Oh totally.  Agreed.  DeLonge is a damn psyop and he might very well not even know it.  He might think he’s on to something and is actually telling the truth, so he’s perhaps being honest and is going to keep going with his particular imbalanced perspective.  Meanwhile, TPTB -<em>hearing</em> his imbalanced perspective - will think “Oh shit.  This is <em>perfect</em> for us to keep the stupid public dumbed down, scared, and confused!  All we have to do is covertly promote and support this DeLonge dumbass, give him all the airtime he wants, and get everyone to believe the horse shit he peddles thinking that ETs are all bad.  We’ll make sure and keep the dumb masses scared and stupid as always that way and maintain our control over them.  Holy shit this is great!  Let’s keep covertly supporting this DeLonge dude!”</p>

<p>Smh</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think it’s all one or the other</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s definitely not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>though I would think in highly advanced beings that the need for “bad” or nefarious behavior could be less than humans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a good perspective, but I also strongly feel that some ETs can be rather advanced and still have an agenda that, while not necessarily “bad” or “evil” from <em>their</em> particular perspective, just so happens to be very against the Earth human agenda, so it would be seen as “bad” or “evil” by Earth humans.  Take reptilians as an example.  They have a pretty bad reputation generally speaking where it regards how Earth humans perceive them.  I would imagine that although they may very well be in the dark, service-to-self mindset or way of being, they are likely “A-Okay” to each other and possibly to whoever or whatever other species they might be aligned with.  As such, that’s one species in particular that can be considered A) advanced, but B) not very good or nice…at least, again, as far as Earth humans are concerned anyway.</p>

<p>I do imagine that the more advanced a species gets, however, the more…”nice” (for lack of a better word) they get; the more service-to-others they may get.  It would seem to make sense that one generally can’t get too evolved spiritually, emotionally, intellectually, and/or technologically without beginning to evolve also in a manner that has a greater, wider perspective toward all other forms of life as well - and this in turn seems to lend itself toward being more service-to-others.  As such, the older a species gets and the longer they’ve been around, it would (again) seem that becoming more service-to-others <em>would</em> in fact be the order of the day.</p>

<p>This, of course, seems to lend itself toward Dr. Steven Greer’s point of view.  I would definitely at least <em>lean</em> a bit more toward his perspective than toward DeLonge’s, but I also know that there are species that are on a cusp of sorts where they have developed technologically to a significant extent, but still haven’t quite gotten it together yet where it regards being more evolved, so they still do a lot of dumb shit and might be confused or ignorant or even violent at times.</p>

<p>Perhaps humanity as a whole is somewhere in the area of this very type of categorization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  Listen to Whitely Strieber.  Listen to Alex Collier.  Listen to Marine Captain Randy Cramer and Tony Rodriguez.  They didn&#39;t need any hypnosis whatsoever, making their recollections far more reliable than anything under hypnosis, and what they said goes completely against the shallow, insular, closed-minded perspective you just demonstrated here.</p>

<p>And who are &quot;these creatures&quot;?  Who are you referring to?  Unsurprisingly, you&#39;re painting everything with one single brush - which is the hallmark of a simple, remedial mindset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When interviewed by Joe Rogan he says &quot;my body is changing.&quot; He was not kidding about that. They have the technology to eat your muscles or make them bigger in an instant. They can change your bone structure and muscles... Everything. That&#39;s what he was saying. How do I know? They&#39;ve done it to me? Can I prove it? Don&#39;t have too. I saw it with my own eyes.</p>

<p>I used to lay in the shower and one of the voices I hear would say &quot;the waters too hot&quot; and suddenly my leg would double in size in comparison to the other one (the one getting hit most by the water.) </p>

<p>One night I woke up and my penis was like triple the size it usually is and all thick flaccid. Another time the head of my penis changed into a smaller head with a different shape and they said they &quot;claimed my dick head&quot; because it turned someone on that was watching through my eyes.</p>

<p>Im not lying about any of this and neither is Tom Delonge when he says his body is changing. </p>

<p>Makes me wonder if its aliens doing this to me or aliens are a cover up for the actual Devil and his children.</p>

<p>You wont believe this but I once had a sudden suntan on my leg in the shape of a credit card. They said they stored it in my arm &quot;a digital copy&quot; and moved it to my leg or something and they marked it with a suntan. This is how crazy this stuff is. Gang stalking is nothing. That&#39;s just to measure and digitize your fear. Also to look at your aura. </p>

<p>Could be aliens or it could be witchcraft that is of the Devil. </p>

<p>Anyways Ill stop story time now and count how many people call me schizophrenic this time.</p>
