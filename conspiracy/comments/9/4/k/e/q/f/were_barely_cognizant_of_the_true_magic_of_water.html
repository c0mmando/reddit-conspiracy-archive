       Prereq: The background to understanding this perspective is a holographic Universe, one where morphic fields play a role in understanding cosmological evolution and creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we think about water, the first thing we think of is it's vital to life. However, we also think of it as just an inert liquid that just so happens to be vitally important for chemistry - thus biology makes use of it. But really, why is it so important and ubiquitous in biology?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not an 'accident of chemistry' that it just so happens to work for what the body needs, and unified physics is beginning to help us understand the true magic of water.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that 70+% of the brain is water, and &gt;60% of the body is water.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also know the body doesn't 'process' water, we don't break it down, we just 'use it' for vitally important processes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're just starting to realize just how fundamental water is. For example, when water is
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23567633">
        evacuated from microtubules
       </a>
       - the biomolecule loses it's ability to cohere and stay organized, it essentially falls apart. The water allows for a single protein to coordinate to it's larger molecule assembly.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're also starting to realize that water is the actual mechanism in which
       <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/422605/water-solves-protein-folding-problem/">
        <em>
         folds proteins
        </em>
       </a>
       - remember protein is surrounded by water, as are most biomolecules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water is tetrahedral and the vacuum is tetrahedral.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're starting to speculate that the tetrahedral molecules can organize into immensely complex geometries, called
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cluster">
        water clusters
       </a>
       like an
       <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ralf_Ludwig3/publication/11952815/figure/fig19/AS:267982874083377@1440903504700/Figure-19-An-expanded-icosahedral-water-cluster-consisting-of-280-water-molecules-with-a.png">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The electromagnetic vacuum's information can be amplified, and transduced by water, it is essentially an antennae, a geometric repeater of electromagnetic fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have to reverse our thinking. Our body isn't utilizing water, water is forming and sustaining our body. Water is the electromagnetic field organizer that coheres and organizes basic molecules into biomolecules by resonating with the information in the holofield.  Imagine it like
       <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/XWDb8PSIv5EWc/giphy.gif">
        ferrofluid
       </a>
       and the holofield like the underlying complex electromagnetic field of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water is the physical fluid that encompasses, entrains, and shares/resonates the electromagnetic field of our bodies from the morphic fields of space.
      </p>
      <p>
       All matter is merely an organization of space, as space is electromagnetic field at ground state, matter is space in a coherent geometric state, all geometries of electromagnetic fields. Water is the extension of this organization into biology.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been astonishing experiments from a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_teleportation">
        Nobel Prize winner
       </a>
       regarding water and DNA.
      </p>
      <p>
       First -
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21457072">
        DNA acts as a fractal antennae in EM fields
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, you take two glasses of water, one with extremely diluted DNA, and one with just water. An electromagnetic pulse was induced over the two samples, and DNA was then detectable in the second glass. The EM wave was 7hz, which is close to Earth's Schumann Resonance.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we start thinking of DNA as an electromagnetic wave itself (remember, protons are electromagnetic vacuum spinning), and we pulse an electromagnetic field surrounding it - this probably allows for the water in the other glass to 'resonate' with the information in the first glass. The EM wave acts as an entrainment carrier that turns the second glass into a tuning fork ready to accept imprinting of information, entraining it in the same field the DNA exists in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The water is now ready to accept the information from the first glass and duplicate it, through reformation of the geometries of the field in the first cup through sympathetic resonance.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Here's the kicker
       </strong>
       - this experiment worked non-locally. They've recorded the EM waveform, e-mailed it somewhere, and repeated the duplication. It worked. This only makes sense if this is happening
       <em>
        non-locally
       </em>
       - i.e. when you use that waveform you are resonating with the holographic information no matter how far you are physically. The specific EM waveform is like an address that dials the water to the morphic information of the DNA that emitted the EM waveform.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's probably important that the pulse was at 7hz, as this is Earth's magnetic field average - as such, it is most probable that the origin of life
       <em>
        on Earth
       </em>
       had a similar start - that is, an electromagnetic field + water turns the Earth into a sort of 'tuning fork' ready to duplicate the holofield information on biomolecules. The more life has formed across the Universe, the easier it is for life to spontaneously cohere in a suitable environment.

       also water is

       .  it can transport a charge.  it can be bent by charge.

      <p>
       and it has distinct geometries in different states.  as a solid it's crystalline/hierarchical.  as a gel it's both crystalline and fluid, and has some weird properties around 0.  as a fluid and gas it's laminar and turbulent.  note the fractal nature of phi vs hierarchy AT EACH FUCKING STATE!.

       I didn't get into this much - but microtubules are known to have atomic water channels. Microtubules make up all cellular structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fast switching dipole oscillation of the water molecule within a microtubule very likely causes biophoton emission, something called superradience in quantum mind circles (Orch OR).
      </p>
      <p>
       So your body is very likely made up of tubes filled with water that are firing coherent laser-light emissions used for the body to communicate.

       Recent advancements have enabled us to finally see this fine grained communication structure in the brain, and they've discovered that thoughts, feelings, and memories are temporary phantasms that arise out of its startling complex order. The brains synaptic connections are ordered in up to 11 dimensions, and this sea of complex connections is constantly shifting and churning as it creates new geometries in reaction to stimulus, or thoughts.

       I've seen some vids about water... I really wanna try one of those vortex spouts that make the water swirl around and "imprint" it with a spiral shape. I have no idea if it actually works or how beneficial it is but sounds interesting and of potential. Nature does love spirals... prob why river water is supposed to be good for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in Hinduism they often show gods holding a pot of water in one of their hands. A lot of Indians use copper pots (copper is basically magic, useful for elemag but also antibacterial) and keep water in it overnight, then say some mantras in the morning and  drink the water after, supposed to be very good for u.

       How exactly does this 'spiral imprinting' work and how is that connected to river water? While I will admit river water is turbulent, you hardly find any distinct spirals in it?

       Okay, again, how exactly does this spiral imprinting work, first of all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, surely spiral eddies are not frequent enough to be synonymous with rivers? Rivers have plenty of other current types and shapes that make them different from just spiral eddies.

       A video will prob show/explain it better, but I think it happens during certain situations, tho short durations... like when two waves going in different dirrections, or as waves hit rocks they form small swirls/vortexes esp if there are several stones around.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the imprinting, not sure... again a video will show the device and tech, they had a demonstration where they tested normal and their spiral water, used like a color dye and spun it and the spiral water kept spinning... it also apparently made plants grow much better. Water just does a lot of weird, interesting things.... I thought the idea was cool and while you can build your own fountain type deal to churn the water the little filter kit the dude made and sells was cheap and simple ot use.

       As for the first part, you're simply describing a situation of fluid dynamics and potentially a constructive interference from waves colliding at an angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the imprinting, you're going to have to stack up some peer reviewed, published research that provides evidence of not only the concept of this but the actual effects it has on plants. Most certainly if it was this useful to crops it would be more widely known and understood.

       Well as I said, its just what I saw in the video... but don't know if its true, with water taking diff shapes tho it seems just as possible. As for it being more well known... not so sure about that, only if you were searching for it do u find all the answers otherwise u just know whatever common knowledge or media wants to suggest. Take Tesla energy... can see plenty of videos online of people using it successfully, rodin coils and all that... but not well known, and even censored as certain groups do by buying up and covering patents.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is other tech regarding plant growth too... organite, those pyramid shaped layered stone constructions which are supposed to channel the natural energy of the earth (apparently they "bust clouds" too and make em dissipate above you), as well as certain sigils that can be placed on the ground with specific shapes/angles that attract certain type of energy. There are a lot of accounts regarding the organite esp. that says it works, but not well known unless u find a video yourself.

       Plenty of related videos on it, like on the vortex/ helical structure, people using it in greenhouses, the tools to make spiralized water. There are reports and evidence out there, just look around.  Its very interesting stuff. I dunno how accurate it is, or how much an improvement it makes, seems to have positive remarks and of all the things to test and put in our body, "structured/helical" water seems relatively safe and easy to do.

       First of all, nothing in that video supported the existence of vortex/helical structured water. Secondly, none of it supported the idea of imprinting spirals into water. Thirdly, TEDx talks, while interesting, are not research articles with quantifiable data and conclusions drawn directly from linked evidence.

       Laminar is a condition of flow and can be changed by things such as flow speed and pipe size. Your shower faucet probably has turbulent flow and it is still water, so I feel like that's pretty well false.

       dude, he's right and you're wrong.  This would require the breaking off of hydrogen from a water molecule which requires a powerful electric current and can hardly be seen anywhere in nature.. certainly not in the human body.

       Natural peroxide production in cells is done by breaking down amino acids.  Not by synthesizing it out of hydrogen and oxygen.  Unless you have a source that proves otherwise...

       Are you serious?  A hydroxyl ion is the actual name for an OH(-) ion pair.

       I work in radiation biology, and I focus on cellular damage and repair.  One of the mechanisms of cell death through irradiation is the production of hydrogen peroxide.  Which means we need to also know the other ways it is produced in the body.

       This is simply wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The name for OH- is HYDOXIDE (ion). HYDROXYL refers to OH. (In my 15+ year career I have never once heard someone use the phrase hydroxyl ion in the context that you are trying to.) I work on and am expert on enzymes that have tyrosine active sites, making specific nomenclature important.

       Did you even read and understand that paper? That paper has absolutely nothing to do with hydrogen peroxide formation in biological systems. When you can explain to me how the conditions in that experiment are applicable to anything that life faces I would appreciate it. The fact that you've linked it is a joke.

       Google water of crystallization. Or better yet, heat up a crystal or any solid matter and observe the emergence of water from it. And observe how once the water is gone the structure loses it structural integrity.

       Aside the fact that what you just said completely dodges my fact, I'll continue with more proof that what you said about NaCl is impossible, for my own amusement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bond length of Na and Cl is roughly 0.2 nm whereas, according to the Wikipedia of the properties of water, the RADIUS of a water molecule is roughly 0.2 nm. Even if you make a perfect cubic crystalline strcuture of NaCl AND assume absolutely NO electronic interactions, the molecule of water almost two times larger than the largest diagnol distance of the square from one of the perfectly cubic, idealistic sodium chloride crystal.

       The above link is an SEM image of sodium chloride. I have worked on Scanning Electron Microscopes for two years now and have a vast amount of experience with their operation as well as what they demonstrate. This is a physical photograph supporting my understanding (and the world's understanding of) the structure of sodium chloride on an Angstrom level.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the bond length, I can Google the XRD pattern for sodium chloride. X-ray Diffraction can be used to measure every single bond length in a sample and can be used to determine the literal bond length. The following is a link to said evidentiary claim:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I could go into lab tomorrow, toss up sodium chloride from Fischer Scientific and get these exact same results.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about atoms, he says? The link after this demonstrates what is called TEM or Transmission Electron Microscopy. TEM imaging is even higher resolution than that of SEM and in the pictures you can actually see
       <em>
        physical fucking atoms
       </em>
       which are demonstrated by each dot.

       The ideas that were "fed to me" and that I "regurgitated" to you actually have one thing that's different than anything you have claimed thus far:
They are verifiable. 
They are repeatable. 
They are the foundational points of science itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you choose to do, however, is deflect away and
       <em>
        still

       continue to provide not a but of amount of evidentiary body supporting your stance.

       the problem with SEM images is that they only measure surface topography, or in TEM's case, only extremely thin layers are measured. Rather difficult to examine a 3d structure with such imaging technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can't see atoms.(if they even existed they would be too small anyway). Any images of so called real atoms only ever show blurry dots or clouds. These blurry dot images are extrapolated from simple reflection data captured by the electron microscope.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are no bond lengths. interpretation of x-ray diffraction patterns is open ended. all we know is that energy vibrations of differing frequencies interacted and resultant effects were measured. that's not proof of bond lengths, or atomic structure, or even the existence of atoms.

       At the first part, while we only see a "2D image" of these materials, note we can use the fact that they still demonstrate squares with our understanding of how crystals form to know that clearly there must be a cubic shape there.

      <p>
       As for not seeing atoms, I'd recommend checking out the link below. If you ask me, that most certainly seems to be an atom.

      </p>
      <p>
       Explain how SEM and/or TEM work without the modern atomic structure being correct? (I'll give you a hint, it's not possible. Please feel free to stop picking and choosing what you want to agree to and not agree to.)

       how does SEM work? it's simple. vibration. And I'll give you a hint, there are only vibrations and frequency. every fucking thing in the universe is frequency and vibration. sound, temperature, light, UV, etc. all energy(and thus matter) we experience is on a gradient of vibration from stillness to the limits of perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       particle science dogma cannot not even resolve the atomic theory regarding the behavior of light. they say that matter emits excited "electrons" that become wave-particle duality photons? lol. The electron is a "real" thing they say, it's a particle, but it's also a probability cloud so you can't ever find it. it's fucking absurd. modern science is lost in fantasy land.

        If there are no bond lengths, that would mean that NaCl would be a compact solid with NO space in between the atoms (that in your mind don't exist).

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       it's ALL empty space. vibration field effects create an illusion of solidity. your "photo of an atom" doesn't show an atom at all. it is a photograph of affected laser light, which again, is a vibration.

       Would you care to speak to any evidence of any of this work or provide scholarly sources to back it up? All I see here is a lot of conjecture without any support. I won't even go into what you said that was wrong in this reply, rather I simply want to see your support for these claims.

       the great thing about proof here is that you provide your own. No appeals to authority or scholarly sources needed. Use your five senses, perceive the vibrations, and notice the patterns. simple observation and logic. (the patterns, oh the patterns!)

       Okay, ready? (inhale, exhale)

       vibration is duality. in and out. duality is everything. all of existence is made up of duality.
      </p>
      <p>
       your own perception is a vibration. there is the created world, and you the awareness perceiving it. give and a take. vibration. there is the mind thoughts and the emotional reactions to them. give and take. vibration.

      <p>
       male, female. positive, negative. north, south.
      </p>
      <p>
       without vibration there's stillness. without vibration "things" don't "happen". either you have duality or you have stillness. in and out. vibration.(starting to notice the patterns?)

       I don't see the proof. The nice thing about repeatability, one of the key tenants of science, is that you can do something and I can do the exact same thing and come to the same results.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not getting the same results here following your wonderful breathing exercises. It's funny you also pointing out not needing to appeal to authority even though you literally used it erroneously earlier to try and support something you don't (?) believe in.

       That is the pivotal flaw with modern science. It is objective. It presents repeatable experiments, but only on the side of objective observation. A subjective reality is not compatible with it, because you cant "prove" it. So they ignore it. You ignore it.
You couldn't repeat what another experienced. Does that mean that what they experience isn't real? The "real truth" of the world is not the reduction into quantaties, names and concepts which your modern science says it is. There is a whole other side of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The past is no more real than the future. Reality is no more real than the observing mechanisms to experience it. Past and future are experienced now. And reality is experienced in you. Who are you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not just mainstream science, but the entirety of reality built up in your mind prevents you from knowing the truth. You trained yourself. You confused yourself. Have fun.

      <p>
       Male and female? It is polarity, circling equilibrium. As all vibration is.

When we think about water, the first thing we think of is it's vital to life. However, we also think of it as just an inert liquid that just so happens to be vitally important for chemistry - thus biology makes use of it. But really, why is it so important and ubiquitous in biology?
It's not an 'accident of chemistry' that it just so happens to work for what the body needs, and unified physics is beginning to help us understand the true magic of water.
We know that 70+% of the brain is water, and &gt;60% of the body is water.

       Come on, mate. You've cherry-picked the one part of that brain-fart that actually seems like it's saying something, but all it's saying is "water makes our bodies work, but WHYYYYY it must be

       The following has nothing to do with the subject matter. It is friendly advice.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will find much, much less resistance to your ideas and posts if you take a few simple pieces of advice - namely, don't swear (it's aggressive, suggesting you're trying to hold on to control of a situation), don't condescend (your paraphrased quote is the same thing as, mid-argument, choosing to poorly imitate a person's voice, which never does anything but irritate the person you're apparently trying to convince of something; also, beginning the whole thing by dismissing OP's entire post as word salad is just a fancier way of saying, "No, that's stupid," and that is also not productive), and you provide sources with your claim as opposed to making blanket statements without showing evidence ("The rest is quoting bullshit "experiments" which have been debunked and discredited"; you can scroll through the comments here yourself and see that no time or words had to be wasted asking OP to provide sources, he provided plenty).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know the truth. I do know that the OP posted something interesting, well written, with sources. I know you replied to it with an equal but opposite passion, and that if you'd gone about it a little differently you could have sparked actual discourse on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's one decent argument against all of this, which is that you could claim you weren't trying to convince anyone of anything. But if that's the case, what are you even doing here, man?

       Pun should be intended, it made me laugh and that
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       good debate strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway the ideas and concepts behind water being somehow magical go all the way back through modern fringe physicists, witches, medieval alchemists, ancient Greek philosophers... The place to put a stop to the actual theory and idea was, I don't know (help me out google: "Greek philosopher everything is water") , around 600 BC when Thales of Miletus began preaching that water was the origin of and main building block of literally all matter and life.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no, you're not gonna kill this concept at its source, with or without swearing. You gotta try to convince people it's wrong. You don't go up to Christians saying, hey, God isn't real and it's all bullshit and you're stupid for believing in it. You don't say it to the family walking out of church on sunday, and you don't go to Vatican City and say it to the pope. Neither maneuver gains you anything, mostly just makes you look bad. Insecure, maybe, or afraid? Idk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again - I don't have a horse in this race. I've read some of these theories and experiments over the years, and I'm open to either possibility. All I'm taking a stand against here is intelligent people (you) using poor debate tactics. End result for me is a little less raw negativity in the world, a little more intelligent discourse amongst people.

       The first time I typed it out I said I was Scottish, then re-worded it because it wasn't strictly true and I knew someone would point that out. So yeah when I say Scottish in name (on liquor bottles across the world, even if it's kinda shitty scotch) and blood (over half), I mean that.
      </p>
      <p>
       "American heritage wankery" lol. So as soon as we hit second generation over here, our genetics stop mattering? I sincerely wish we could convince all my countrymen of that, sounds like a good way to end racism. "What's that you say? Your family is from Nigeria but were born in Brooklyn? Shut up, you're American." Then we all crack open some ice cold brewskies and sing the national anthem and applaud each other, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk. Sounds kinda lame. American culture taken on its own is kinda shitty, I'm not into sports or most movies, and I think Drake is awful. I'd rather have some pride that my ancestors (i am 3rd generation fwiw) came from such an awesome place full of such awesome people. I'm not walking around introducing myself as Scottish, I don't affect an accent, I just identify 8% more with where my family came from than from the cruddy Midwestern suburb where I was born. Because those people have a rich and colorful history of being racist, misogynist, yuppie snobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you think America needs one more racist misogynist yuppie snob. I mean, I don't. I feel like we have enough of those.

       It’s just annoying as hell to hear from American tourists that their great great grandads came from New Lanarkshire and that makes them Scottish.

       You are probably more English than you are Scottish. It’s sort of insulting that American’s prance about trying to wear our culture as a patch on their lapel while still going home and singing the Star Spangled Banner.

       Yeah I've never been that tourist nor will I be. And if my general description of other Americans didn't tip you off, I'm not singing the national anthem for shits and giggles either. I do get where you're coming from, 100%, but that just ain't me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk tho I'd think most of the world would be pretty happy to hear that many Americans don't identify as strictly American. It's kinda a fucked up place to be these days. Most of the "Americans" I've met in my life have been terrifying, closed minded, misguided, and just... Ugh. Just no. Flag waving rednecks and truck driving NASCAR fans. There's gotta be something inbetween that and being the entitled tourist who's scouring the highlands looking for his great (x6) grandfather's moldy bones, right?

       And I should note, I mean this wacky ideas thing as a compliment. New ways of thought are the greatest gift we can give each other. I may not immediately agree with them, but they make the world a more fun place and force us all to view the world through a critical thinking lens.

       Aside from the first, op’s sentences make sense and aren’t run on goop.  I don’t really understand his point but it’s not some guy talking about cosmic machine elves dancing in his head.  As far as loopy conspiracy this is really tame.  All he’s saying is that you can somehow duplicate dna in water using resonant frequencies.  Is that so hard?  Don’t know if it’s true but sheesh save it for the David Icke believers.  I kinda wish there were more top posts about lizard people living in rock formations around Utah.

       There's three reasons why someone would call the original post a word salad, as it's far from being such:

      <p>
       1) Insufficient lexicon.
2) Insufficient comprehension.

       The theory is that the earths electromagnetic field vibrates complexity into existence.  See cymatics for more information.  Its a type of intelligent design based on resonance of DNA and other complex molecules.

       He linked the wiki article on DNA teleportation, and it says that it is a pseudoscientific theory that and that "no independent research has supported the claim, and established science does not support this theory, or provide any plausible mechanism by which it might work."
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of "morphic fields of space" is similarly pseudoscience.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, the idea that you can create DNA in a glass of water by "resonating" it with a glass of water with DNA already in it is pseudoscience as well.

       I thought the whole point of science was to be proven wrong and throughout history the science status quo has been shattered.
      </p>
      <p>
       You talk like we've figured it all out and our current science won't be found to be misinformed in someway. Reminds me of something... Why is the current status quote enforced like it is the one true law?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when we thought the world was flat? When the atom was the smallest thing in the universe? Why so quick to write stuff like this odd and assert it as pseudo science when a lot of it is emerging and pieces are starting to come together.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a bunch of scientists, they are so quick to say no that cant be possible... When all you know is what is possible so far.

       Because there is no evidence. There is a difference between finding evidence that leads to new knowledge and just thinking up a possibility without supporting evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the flat earth, that "knowledge" wasn't the result of science. It was a superstition. Several different cultures independently found that the world was round. Modern flat earth theories
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       pseudoscience, because they rely on discarding well-validated evidence and proposing theories with little to no backing evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNA transportation experiment the poster mentioned has not been successfully reproduced at all. Researchers carefully write down instructions to their experiments so they can be validated. If an experiment can't be reproduced, it is either because the initial experimenters fabricated their results, or botched/contaminated their experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The onus of proof is on the person making a claim. If they can produce evidence, then people evaluate that evidence and either adopt or reject that claim based on it.

       How does one recognize a legitimate source?  Like this one for example, from Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/15368378.2015.1036072?src=recsys">
        https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/15368378.2015.1036072?src=recsys
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Your link and my link have the same veneer of being scientific, so how do I know one is reviewed and not the other, or neither are reviewed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Abstract:
The experimental conditions by which electromagnetic signals (EMS) of low frequency can be emitted by diluted aqueous solutions of some bacterial and viral DNAs are described. That the recorded EMS and nanostructures induced in water carry the DNA information (sequence) is shown by retrieval of that same DNA by classical PCR amplification using the TAQ polymerase, including both primers and nucleotides. Moreover, such a transduction process has also been observed in living human cells exposed to EMS irradiation. These experiments suggest that coherent long-range molecular interaction must be present in water to observe the above-mentioned features. The quantum field theory analysis of the phenomenon is presented in this article.

       True, but at least I learned that the Earth's Schumann Resonance is near 7hz.  If that's even real, would help to explain Coral Castle in South Florida or levitating objects.

       If u can counter that 7hz frequency, heavy objects like stones become weightless.  The guy at coral castle had some sort of wooden box that was pointed over any block he wanted to move.  Teens from that time also said they snuck in and heard the one guy singing or humming or something.  I read up on that Schumann Resonance thing and it seems to be generated by lightning.  They can currently levitate a frog with sound.  There's even a tractor beam using sound that pick up and hold small plastic beads in mid air.

       That's just one facet.  You would wanna find the resonance or frequency (something similar) of limestone or other rocks and go from there.  The frog was mostly water so that's what they focused on and tuned the sonic waves to in order to levitate the frog.  The handheld tractor beam is a huge heavy flashlight like device.

       There's just a lot of different historical stories or myths involving sound and moving stone.  No clue about sound, but I'm sure it acts like electricity in the way there's voltage, wattage, and current.  A sound engineer would know tons more than I do.

       Water is versatile because it's a universal solvent. Literally none of this electromagnetic and quantum alphabet soup is needed to explain it. As well, be careful with the use of quantum in relation to electrons and protons because the quantum world is not on the same size and scale of subatomic particles as such. Quarks are literally 2000x smaller than protons, for example.

       It’s not, take some cooking oil and pour into a cup of water... and they are not miscible. Hence, you can clearly see that it’s not a universal solvent... which is why you use soap to do dishes. Literally any chemist knows water does not dissolve organic compounds while it is more effective in dissolving polar compounds.

       So if it won’t dissolve oils and pretty much most non polar compounds, including many organics which have large none polar carbon groups then it’s not really universal. Sure it dissolves many things... but not universal, is it?

       Well, it is periodically referred to as that because it dissolves more substances than any other solvent but it’s not actually a universal solvent and pretty sure lost biologist, biochemist or chemists believe it has some magical resonance or that DNA acts as a fractal antennae in EM fields, or the other word salad of this post.

       Erm. One, what theory are we talking about explicitly. Second, some sub atomic particles, such as protons and electrons, haven't been shown to follow quantum entanglement, tunneling, etc., So there are clearly some exceptions. Third, a sizeable portion of this 'quantum theory' you speak of, assuming you mean the body of all of the work done in this field, have yet to have any evidence based backing and relying solely on mathematics, so far as I know. I'm welcome to reading more papers tonight if anyone has some good ones.

       I never claimed it's not an accurate model. I'm just saying it's a model lacking physically observable examples for some of the big fancy things people talk about. Quantum Tunneling, Quantum Entanglement, both ends of Heisenberg's Uncertainty at the same time, and several other theories are strong models both by physical description and mathematics. That being said, though, they have yet to be

       At Edit 2:
I did take Organics I and II and aced them both. Currently am finishing undergraduate while doing research. May I ask where you got your degree from in Chemistry? Also, for someone who is supposedly a 'post grad' (even though that's not a term I've ever heard used?) That explanation of your work does not make sense.  Could you link me to your PI or a review article if you're working in research, or explain to somebody who does have a background?

       It’s not, take some cooking oil and pour into a cup of water... and they are not miscible. Hence, you can clearly see that it’s not a universal solvent... which is why you use soap to do dishes.

       Well, soap is actually a complex molecule that dissolves partly into water and partly into things such as oil which are nonpolar, typically, in order to act as a binding agent to the dirt or buildup and to remove them. As for the term 'universal', it's not uncommon for science to have exceptions to everything, though the name is slightly misleading as it is used because water is such a good solvent. Sceince has never claimed it can dissolve
       <em>
        everything

       Yea that’s what it means. My interpretation is correct because he was found guilty of including the HTLV genome is his hiv genome.

       That is from compiled research; it’s somewhere around here. Hold on.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Because Robert Gallo and Montagnier still have the patent for HIV from 1984.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Gallo owns a patent to an HIV test, not to HIV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        IF the genome changed the patent holders and date would be different.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is completely irrelevant and meaningless, since he patented the test, not the genome.
      </p>
      <p>
       The HIV test reacts to antibodies against HIV -- these are antibodies against an expressed protein on HIV's surface. This wouldn't be effected by what he thought the genome contained: he grew the virus and obtained the corresponding protein from the source, and then reproduced it on test strip.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, nothing in the supplied article suggests their test would be positive for anything but HIV, and it never mentioned HTLV, which you seem to have invoked from no where. In fact, the article you gave me lines up with anything you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        To be an HIV test it has to react to the patented HIV from 1984 or else it cannot be termed that.
       </p>

      <p>
       There is no patent for the HIV virus -- in fact, you can't patent a virus out of the box; but you can patent a modified genetic organism. However, that's not what Gallo owns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gallo owns a patent for an HIV blood test. The article you cited was a dispute over whether he shares ownership because he used a blood sample obtained from another lab -- a blood sample which they proved belonged to them because it also contained HTLV, which was also in his cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this has nothing to do with the virus or the test's accuracy, as HIV could be isolated from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're buying into some really dangerous bullshit, and calling it fact.

       There's a stark mathematical basis for it
       <em>
        to
       </em>
       work - we call them impulse responses.
       <br/>
       If you "zoomed in" to a HIV virus in an otherwise pristine (all pure water) environment and hit it with a sound-pulse and recorded the result then played it back in the exact same cavity with just pure water in it you would create an echo of HIV virus.

       Okay, well first of all, I apologize as I thought you were talking about atoms since there is two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom per water molecule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, you actually only need to technically react one hydrogen molecule and one oxygen molecule to form one water as they both naturally exist in diatomic form (H2 and O2).
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly, what you're confusing here is molecular formation with states of matter. When molecules form from other atoms, they do such by forming or breaking chemical bonds. In this instance the bonds between their respective molecules breaks in hydrogen and oxygen (this is where energy input comes in) and then two hydrogens bond in a bent electronic geometry with water. This bond formation is where energy is released. (In other reactions this is where explosions happen.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Now as for states of matter such as gas, liquid, and solid, these are functions of a bunch of molecules together and are due to a couple things such as molecular speed and spacing. In a gas, which for most substances is found at the higher temperature range, the particles have a lot of energy to move around with and do so frequently causing them to spread out. Since they move so fast past each other, it's hard for them to interact. As you cool temperature, the molecules slow down and thus coincidentally move closer together (liquid). At the lowest relative temperatures, a solid forms as the molecules hardly have energy from the environment to move around a lot and instead interact fully with the others around them by electronic interactions and group together.
      </p>
      <p>
       While water vapor can be synthesized using hydrogen and oxygen gas, and then cooled to form water, it is also possible to form liquid water from liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The reason you don't see this, however, is that it's extremely expensive and requires lots of equipment to hold liquid oxygen AND it's very very dangerous.

       In a completely non-asshole kind of way, if you're curious about a lot of stuff like this is highly recommend picking up an entry level chemistry book from a nearby college bookstore. While some of it may seem slightly derivative, there are some really good chapters that explain a lot of fundamental qualities amd properties of subtances. Even though I'm way past it, I still tend to use it now and then as a refresher.

       This part is not hard to understand. Gassed are molecules with high enough kinetic energy to flow freely and separately. When a water molecule forms it’s combined mass is heavier and the kinetic energy is lower. Also water self assembles via van der walls forces making the liquid state that much more possible.

       Mainstream science is the sociopolitical hierarchy that governs not theories but individuals and their resources. This is why evolutionary theory is regarded as canon instead of theory or, why 90% of textbook material is dogma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it appears right, a good scientist questions everything and is never fully convinced. But governing scientific communities always have agendas and are set on capitalizing knowledge. This is why they never tell you to contact an author, but instead subscribe to a paid site.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is, in fact, mainstream science.

       I love water. I live taking showers for long periods of time and allow water to I'm essence put me in sensory depravation. I close my eyes, the water runs over my ears. I start to hear music. Beats and I get a sensation of words. So I'll sing. But the best is when I have my eyes closed, I see waved of yellow and purple. It comes at me. So purple comes at me, encompasses my field of none vision, and then yellow / green comes at me until it fills my non vision. I say non vision because I don't see it with my eyes. I see it 90% of the time when I'm in water. Only under certain circumstances do I experience it elsewhere.

       It centrilizes in my vision and forms a sort of doughnut shape. Super white with bright green and orange outlines. All negative space in my "non vision" becomes a stary night sky as the image sharpens. I get the physical sensation of seeing the Sun through a cloud. I've only ever gotten it while in the shower. Noticed it while shampooing, closing my eyes to not get soap in them. Its fascinatingly enchanting. 
Thank you for sharing your experience. Yours is the only admittance of this experience that I've seen someone else confess.

       It's funny you say that. I swear most of us experience many odd things and may ponder on them, but rarely do people discuss outside of their select close people , the odd things they experience and ponder. I thought after posting I'd get a response, "you're crazy". And I know I am not crazy. It's just something I have noticed and am willing to discuss. Though I imagine there's many things people feel they just can't discuss.

       Montagnier's experiment can be summarised as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       A known water sample with 2 ng/ml of 104 bases DNA from an HIV infected patient is diluted by 10 into water and agitated for 15 seconds. After filtration (to physically remove the DNA), the dilution and agitation steps are repeated 10 times, reaching high dilution levels (10−10).
The highly diluted sample emits electromagnetic signals (EMS) of low frequencies.
This EMS is recorded by a microphone coil and saved as a 6-second WAV file at the lab in Paris.
The WAV file is emailed to a partner team at the university of Benevento in Italy.
The Italian team emits in loop the EMS of the WAV file on a sample of distilled water with a coil in a sealed metal tube for 1 hour.
The water sample is then placed in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machine.
The PCR in Italy produces DNA, 98% identical to the initial DNA in Paris.

       It's funny how the Wikipedia article is cited almost entirely by sources that are not research journals. If you wish to cite real research to back up your claim, that would make the stance much more strong, regardless of the fact that if you scroll through these comments you can find bodies of work disproving this exact thing.

       One, not calling you a pleb or anyone a pleb. Secondly, if the work an independent researcher provides is compelling enough, someone in academia will for sure pick it up. Third, you are sorely mistaken about the research process, as I both am an undergraduate and know several undergraduates who have published a research paper to a respectable journal before ever finishing a Bachelor's degree. Then there is graduate school where it's typically common in my field to publish about 5 before your PhD. Before applying to be a professor, most of academia requires one or two post docs which could have a couple of papers published before they are finished. Then there is the tenure track at most research based universities that require (I'm not quite sure on exact #) like 5 years of research produced for a portfolio to even APPLY for tenure.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: You can easily publish a plethora of papers and get over thousands of citations before even thinking about tenure.

       They've actually done studies and shown that dolphins have been able to encrypt certain messages into waves, and let the water travel through the ocean for miles upon miles until it eventually reaches the intended animal. Fascinating stuff.

       Wouldn’t it depend on the type of “water” you’re using? In the biotech world we use deionized water because depending on what we are doing, we may want to positively charge the protein to bond or break bonds with cells. We use purified water too but not that often in my line of work though. If you think about it sea water is full of salt so it’s going to have a higher conductivity compared to your typical lake water. Ph I would think would remain the same. Water is pretty damn magical if you really think about it though. With the higher conductivity in the water it may be helping the electromagnetic properties of the earth. I’m probably wrong but great post!

       I think you are confusing encoded protein strands with reproduction and there is a difference between the genesis of life and the conception of a life.

       No, I'm not confusing that. If you read David Wilcock's second book, "The Sourcefield Investigations", he connects the above type of experiments with reproductive experiments where interspecies hybrids are created without interspecies sex. I'm not saying its factually wrong - but it seems to open the door to a whole host of pseudoreligious/pseudoscientific ideas related to reproduction. Knowing those connections are already established, that there is a new, multifacetted reproductive theory in the works, I'm sure we're being lied to. I just don't know whether the lie is that these thing don't happen - or that they do.

       Excellent post, OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       The  chemistry of life is water chemistry. Without water's capacity to store  and share information as different vibrating frequencies in an extraordinary manner,living cells would not be able to communicate with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sonoluminescence  -- or spectacular conversion of sound to light , happens when water is  bombarded by intense light waves creating air bubbles which rapidly  contract and implode with a flash of light.
      </p>
      <p>
       This light comes from ZERO POINT FIELD.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, the 7Hz is the frequency Hindu King Mantra, OM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since life began, the Earth has been  surrounding and protecting all living things with a natural frequency  pulsation of 7.83 HZ—the ancient Indian Rishis called OM.
      </p>
      <p>
       OM mantra was uttered by the vedic sages who stayed on the banks of the  river Saraswati in 9000 BC. Vedic civilization of Saraswati flourished  till 4000 BC, till the river became non-perennial due to tectonic shifts  blocking the Himalayan Glacier mouth. The elite then migrated all over  including Western coast of India, Mesopotamia, Europe and Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       In deep meditation, when waves of alpha and  theta rhythms cascade across the entire brain, a resonance is possible  between the human being and the planet. Energy and information which are  embedded in the zero point field or aether field are transferred. The  planet communicates with us in this primal language of frequencies. A  living being is a  EMF field embedded within the EMF field of the earth. Each cell's DNA as a vibrating transmitter/receiver of information.

       Hi, d8_thc !
      </p>
      <p>
       The world at present is just beginning to understand the ramifications of Quantum Physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would take more than 500 yrs for modern scientists to figure out Vedanta, written down in 5000 BC (after being passed down for 30000 years by oral route).
      </p>
      <p>
       Some points to ponder upon : -
      </p>
      <p>
       VEDAS CONFIRM THAT COMMUNICATIONS CAN HAPPEN FASTER THAN LIGHT--AND VEDAS HAVE NOT BEEN PROVED WRONG YET .
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet since the advent of quantum physics has revealed that Vedanta is beyond the cutting edge of physics, which is only now, discovering the illusory nature of physical reality and the existence of subtler energy and information currents behind all that we see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vedanta is the unitary philosophy explaining the oneness of the individual soul with the universal consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       To a Vedantic every part of this universe is dynamic, it is vibrating, it is listening and can respond according to ones KARMA, It can be by action and can be purely thought. The universe listens to our action as well as thought and gives in return what exactly we want either knowingly or unknowingly, weather it is bad or good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quantum Teleportation ( mentioned in Vedas ) has been achieved. Scientists from China recently set the record for the farthest quantum teleportation ever, when they beamed a photon in its quantum state into orbit. This brings several quantum mechanical concepts into the equation, including quantum entanglement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Teleportation is a verification of Quantum Entanglement
      </p>
      <p>
       Action at a distance implies that a physical object can be moved by non-physical means, so not by touch or physical force. With entanglement, it means that either information is travelling FAR FAR faster than the speed of light ( VEDAS SAYS IT IS INSTANTANEOUS )
      </p>
      <p>
       Worldview paradigms are changing, yet old scientific dogma ( THANKS TO THE KUNT POP ) still sticks around and dominates.

For those who don't know, they took water from waterfalls, streams and tap and found the former two had completely different electromagnetic properties.  They mimicked this by making a hexagonal cone distorted such that the apexes formed a spiral.  No human experiments I know of, but plants given the same amount of nutrients grew phenomenally better if watered with structured water.  This relates to why hexagons are so prevalent in nature.  They are the most structurally sound shape, able to interlock, and most efficient at promoting flow.  This last part is key.  It allows water to adopted the most electromagnetically harmonious configuration. By subjecting water to a stronger, implosive electromagnetic field you can even initiate hydrolysis with petty amounts of electricity, basically creating a self contained hydrogen cell.

       dude, he's right and you're wrong.  This would require the breaking off of hydrogen from a water molecule which requires a powerful electric current and can hardly be seen anywhere in nature.. certainly not in the human body.

       Um, take some oil... add it to water... clear phase separation... it’s actually used in organic synthesis to do extractions and other techniques....
      </p>
      <p>
       The long hydrocarbon chains on the fatty acids do not like being in water, hence we use soap which is a surfactant and creates micelles to trap non polar organics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life depends on the non solubility of non polar organics by using that to create cell membranes by creating phospholipid bilateral where the outside is hydrophilic and the inside is hydrophobic.

       It is a crystalline solid. More so, by what you have provided it is a crystalline solid with no water in it's formula. Ergo, water is not a 'must' in forming crystals, as you have said at the top of this comment tree.

       A video will prob show/explain it better, but I think it happens during certain situations, tho short durations... like when two waves going in different dirrections, or as waves hit rocks they form small swirls/vortexes esp if there are several stones around.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the imprinting, not sure... again a video will show the device and tech, they had a demonstration where they tested normal and their spiral water, used like a color dye and spun it and the spiral water kept spinning... it also apparently made plants grow much better. Water just does a lot of weird, interesting things.... I thought the idea was cool and while you can build your own fountain type deal to churn the water the little filter kit the dude made and sells was cheap and simple ot use.

       First of all, nothing in that video supported the existence of vortex/helical structured water. Secondly, none of it supported the idea of imprinting spirals into water. Thirdly, TEDx talks, while interesting, are not research articles with quantifiable data and conclusions drawn directly from linked evidence.
