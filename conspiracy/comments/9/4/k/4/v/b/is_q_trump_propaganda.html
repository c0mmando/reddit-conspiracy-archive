       I've just recently started digging into this Qanon explosion, and it seems more like a booster for Trump supporters. Is Trump changing the world or making a conspiracy about himself to boost moral of the far right?

       Nunes and members of the “Gang of Eight,” were briefed by DOJ and intelligence officials on the documents.

       Gowdy "backs" Mueller because he is a law professional and believe in the process of the law. Not because he believes the media narrative that is being spun about the investigation. Gowdy is currently battling  Rod Rosenstein about his withholding of parts of the OIG report.

       While that anecdote is holds truth, potentially it's also not why. It's partly because Qanon could very easily be a  rabbit chase, that wastes productive energy. If for any reason, you should be suspicious for that one reason alone. Lot's of bold claims are made, however few if any materialize.

       Government has serious issues, and a LARP like that may satiate the masses just enough so that they remain passive.

       Actually, that's less of a waste than it might seem. I'm certainly no baby boomer creating signs, attire, and creating billboards for hours on end. I'd prefer "giving warning those potentially transfixed with tunnel vision on a public forum."

       You actually mean spending hours arguing with what are mostly very good bots, paid propagandists, and MSN talking point parrots. If you want to warn people with tunnel vision go try and drop some truth on the r/politics circle jerk.

       The teams of people working on or following QANON are diggers. The breadcrumbs dropped by Q are picked up and dig into in every possible way. The facts are then laid out and it is up to you to do your own research to choose if you want to know the truth or not. It’s not a conspiracy theory. It is the public working together to find out the truth. The MSM has used their platforms to deceive the public for decades. I’m with Q simply because it is not an opinionated source of news. Also, doing my own research on this stuff has made me WAYY MORE AWARE of what is actually going on day to day in our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe it or not, the choice is yours. If you believe it, great! If not, that’s okay too. All that anybody asks of any other person is to do your own research and choose for yourself if this is or is not for you.

       Definitely gotta disagree with that. Q posts, the board, and the sub are
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       opinionated and those opinions are constantly presented as fact. Usually it starts with a very vague claim, like: something BIG is coming. then anything that makes the news can be used as “see this is what Q was alluding to in this post”. it can’t be proven wrong, because the original claim doesn’t have any specifics to it. then the post will be parroted as proof of his credibility. this way when more specific or exaggerated claims are made and shown to be false, it can be dismissed because “disinfo is necessary”, and claims that are unverified or unverifiable become facts that are used as the foundation of future claims.

       That same thing can be said about anything.  If you don't like CNN because you think they are fake news and so you started reading more news from other sources then CNN has had a positive effect on you therefor CNN is good.

       Person A finds out Person B murdered Person C and got sentenced to years in prison.

      <p>
       Person A no longer wants to murder Person D.

       Which is exactly the point I was making... The guy I was responding to was saying Q is good regardless of if it's a real person with real information or not because Q is, if nothing else, getting people to research things therefor Q is having a positive effect on people.  I was pointing out how that is stupid thinking.  You agree with me.

       had the mindset of being conscious of what is going on and questioning what you read. in fact, the q movement attempts to co-opt people that think this way, and encourages them to trust a small group of unknown government and military officials? hmmmm....

       I personally concluded that Q is sincere, not a LARP, and has inside knowledge of anti-corruption efforts being taken by the current administration.

       I feel even more sure now that the MSM has been frantically painting QAnon as a deranged cult of violent Trump fans, which has no basis in fact.

       Im not u/THAD_K_CUNDERTHOCK...but I have read every Q drop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q is NOT a larp...but Q may be a psyop.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing for sure...Q has access to inside intel like I have never seen, and what Q seems to predict...Saudi Arabia arrests, North Korea...pics swiped from other people’s  cameras..the Avanetti swipe being the most recent. (Thats a good read.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you paid attention to the stats on the human trafficking arrests...Hollyweird being exposed, all of the CEO world wide resignations...dems and republicans suddenly “retiring or resigning”. The 40,000 + sealed inditements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q is “something” BIG....only a fool would dismiss it without research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t believe what someone else tells you, esp. on an anonymous board for Gods sake...DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a govt worker/researcher ...So I don't understand how anyone would ever take someone else’s word for something that could easily be researched for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was rocket science or brain surgery...then of course I defer to the experts...but this is easily searchable...all the posts and links are there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop being a sheeple and do your own research ...then come back with an informed opinion.

       Yes. Qanon, among other notable anons, are part of an ongoing agency effort to keep Trump supporters fixated on Trump while the establishment continues their operations. If you take a look at our GDP growth, you'll notice it has still been 2-3% since 2008 meaning that we've had no real growth at all (and further than that too) during Obama's run and currently with Trump.

       Does it even matter who's in office? Or are stings still pulled from people above government, and above the rothschilds ( Or any other family name normally contributing to conspiracies). I would think that the powers at be wouldn't be so easily found out or uncovered.

       Yes and no. It doesn't matter if whoever is in office is Black, White, Old, Young, etc. as long as the person is genuinely working for the people. That isn't the case with how things currently are as the last presidents we've had since JFK have been of CIA origin, with

       There is constant deceptions being pulled onto the people. One big con that our government has going on is that the position of President can't effectively bring about needed change. Congress has made the president a de facto dictatorial position with emergency measure laws. Trump can declare anything he wants an emergency and say he has to spend Billions/Trillions to fix it via construction of a profitable infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other ways a President can enforce power and make Congress work for the people. Trump could send marines to Jerome's office and say you're going to print billions of dollars to build our infrastructure. Or he could make a big speech on our infrastructure, increasing our wealth and eliminate taxes, and explaining how we can do it. That would result in 90% approval ratings and back Congress to the wall because it isn't Trump v. Government but now a People v. Government within days.

       And who is telling the president what to do? Operations from Obama era is still being run now so you can't determine that Trump is his own man. If he doesn't call the shots then he should therefore resign from office as he deserves no respect for being a puppet.

       While society needs a baseline of order to properly run, it doesn't stop people from trying to improve the government from it's current degrading state. Also, you're generalizing the unconscious people with conscious individuals. Individuals who aren't with the OWO don't submit to it, or else humanity would be further down the drain.

       Whoever is in office makes very little difference besides the manner by which the oligarchy delivers it's edicts. The neo-cons are always gleeful and happy whenever they announce some new way to screw the ordinary people over while the neo-liberals pull a long sad face and say "We're awful sorry about this but it's for your own good." and of course it never is.

       IMO, if Q is a disinfo source, the best thing "they" could do is have the MSM start discrediting him--because they most definitely know that there are people who are willing to leap to the idea that "because the MSM hates him, he must be real."
      </p>
      <p>
       So IMO, that's a pretty dangerous sort of leap of logic to make. Things are not black and white. Q -could- be real. And the MSM could be attacking him. Or he could be completely false and the MSM is attacking him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of taking the 180 degree opposite view of -anything- just because the MSM says something is not IMO at best being reactionary without thinking about things and at worst opening yourself up to being even more manipulated than otherwise because people can use your reaction against you.

       I don't think Q is, like, something team Trump came up with. It's a dude on 4chan who posts vague stuff that you can interpret as meaning anything, and a lot of the more hardcore Trump supporters have glommed onto it because "Trump and Meuller are secretly working together to destroy HYDRA" is a more appealing narrative than "Trump is an unpopular president buoyed by a good economy who hasn't built the wall yet and probably isn't going to".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think QAnon, like a lot of conspiracy-like things, is a bottom up phenomenon, not a top-down one.

       I 100% think they(Bannon, Roger Stone, Assange) created him. I think Assange was Q until his internet was cut. Then whoever he was working with took over after it. Assange was a part of getting Trump elected and I think he cut a deal with them. He will help them in the election and create Q to continue Trumps policies online. Then wanted Trump to lobby for a shortened prison term or none at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a number of reasons why I feel this way but the main one is that the day before his internet was cut, Q posted, WILL BE OFFLINE. Then, the day after it was cut, Q is posting on a different board. Now, I find it very strange that someone who only communicates online wouldn't say, "I am moving my board to this place". Why would it matter if they did that? I don't think Assange would dare give out his password or log-in info to someone so they had to move it. There are other very solid reasons I have but the timing of all of that sold me on my theory.

       The idea that Q is (or rather, was) Assange hadn't occurred to me before, but it makes immediate sense. Have an upvote.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was that weird period just before Q got started, when @Wikileaks was posting tweets that contained cryptic references to classic chess strategies, with obscure comments underneath.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was so much other crap going on that this little hobby of the person operating WL's account didn't get much traction, and it sort of fizzled out. A month or two later, Q pitches up with a souped-up version of the same schtick.

       (Those old Wikileaks tweets might be worth digging out, although you'd have to pay me good money to bother.)

       Lol. The first thing that made me think it was the way that Q and Assange communicated online. Very similar, very cryptic and really, the way he kept saying that "it's in there, you just have to look" with Podestas emails. He never just came out and said, look, here is this, here is this, etc... Those emails started a life of their own by him doing it.

       My theory: QAnon is another Alex Jones-style psyop. A government operation to corral conspiracy theorists together, tie them to the right wing / make them choose a team between the left-right divide, and make them look crazy to the rest of the public — all while distracting them from what's really going on, keeping them from digging into and doing something about the root issues of our nation’s problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I still kinda hope those sealed indictments put a gigantic elite pedo ring behind bars, like Q promised.

       Its not a 'far right' thing. Its a patriot thing. Its more of a middle ground thing really. The followers want freedom of speech and world peace rather than ongoing wars and censorship.

       It seems to tell the story of an internal takedown of the deep state, including the floor 7 group and child / sex trafficking rings.
      </p>
      <p>
       It suggests deep rooted corruption of the DOJ, FBI and CIA and collusion between key members of these agencies and the dems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unirock did a video on youtube to say it was all a LARP, and it was him and a couple of others that started Q. But he left after the others seemed to be attempting to monetise the movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, the questions Q puts forward and the way he gets people to think about current events seems to be important, and more importantly REAL things that are happening, that the MSM tends not to report on much.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesnt seem to be dangerous, in fact it seems to be creating a community spirit and a feeling that the people are taking back America. It gives people hope, if anything.

       It is true that it is mostly MAGA/right wing people, but surprisingly there are actually a lot more independents than you might think. There are even people who don’t like Trump who think he was chosen for this role.

       Whoever or whatever Q is, the MSM is losing whatever credibility it had left suddenly losing it's shit over it on it's downward slide into complete irrelevance.
      </p>
      <p>
       And whoever or whatever else DJT is, he was the handy monkey wrench that the public managed to throw into the corrupt DC machinery that's grinding it's gears away trying to carry out business as usual in spite of him with more and more eyes focussed on them, what they're doing, and their past history than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one has any credibility left in that scenario and it scarcely matters if DJT doesn't either in what the Bilderbergers referred to in their last meeting as the "post-truth era" that we are now presently living in, as if we really knew the truth in the past and don't now, unless it's "their truth" that's well past it's best before date.

       Well, the MSM has literally nothing positive to say any more.  So you are right, why would it be positive?  Of course, the MSM saying things like the Q conspiracy theory is "for losers" shows you that they are scared of the situation, and rightly so.  They show weakness at every turn.

       The Q garbage as Trump propaganda? NO. Trump appearing on the Alex Jones show to possibly get non-voters to vote, YES.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Q phenomenon reminds me of Carl Sagan's book The Demon-Haunted World in which he alludes to the fact that less intelligent people lean toward the vague and "Crystal Ball" type of nonsense that actually reverts the world back into superstitious garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       When "Q" manages to give some truly detailed and predictive foresight and not vague nonsense, I'll pay attention and rethink my position. Until then, it's a waste of time and quite frankly, embarrassing.

       Why would Trump supporters need a boost?  Trump soundly won the election, and most people support him.  The ones against Trump are in the minority, but they do not realize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is against the NWO, and many people support him for that reason.  Same with Putin.  People say I am pro-Trump, but nobody has ever said that I am anti-NWO.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NWO people own and control the MSM.  This is why it appears that a lot of people are against Trump.  The MSM gets its instructions from the CIA, which is why Trump calls the MSM fake news and he has his own intelligence people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Qanon explosion" has been going on since last Fall.  Why has the MSM ignored it since then?  A lot of people did not know about Qanon until the past week or so.  This is because the NWO people own and control the MSM so they control the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       What else do people not know?  Why do I know certain things, but others do not?
      </p>
      <p>
       You should consider that Qanon is a way of changing this.  Qanon is about taking control of the narrative so that people can understand what is going on without relying on the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are independent news sources, such as Patriots Soapbox, that keep people informed.  They have a live chat so people can feed them information and ask questions.  They get called out if they say something that is incorrect.  They debate information whe determining what is true and false.  This needs to be the way we get information.
      </p>
      <p>
       We cannot rely on the CIA controlled MSM to feed us lies.

       You're wrong though. Trump won because of Seth Rich, and the screwing of Bernie Sanders. MSM used Russia as the scapegoat when in reality, it was Rich that did the Democrats in. Democrats knew this, people aren't stupid.... and they did not go out to vote, unlike in the primaries. Trump is Bilderberg, Trilateral commission, etc controlled. Trump is playing his card, he passed the tax cuts for the rich. Let's see how it plays out for the elections.

       Hillary fell on 9/11/2016 and pizzagate broke in early October of 2016.  There are many reasons why Trump won, but he did win fairly.

       Both parties?  There is only one party.  Trump is not a member of either one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you say that the Democrats will win big, you mean the New World Order.  The Republicans will throw the election because they are also New World Order.

      <p>
       The problem for the New World Order is that it is much more difficult for them to commit election fraud.

       Back in 2013, the US repealed, and legalized propaganda use against it's own citizens. They understand that distrust in the media is at record highs, so they artificially create the narratives they want to now, and stick to them. They took that most popular candidate (Bernie Sanders), and flipped it into Trump.

       "They understand that distrust in the media is at record highs, so they artificially create the narratives they want to now, and stick to them.

      <p>
       Between July 2016 and the election, the MSM was overwhelmingly pro-Hillary. This was part of the plan, too?  Maybe Hillary falling on 9/11/2016 was staged.
      </p>
      <p>
       OR, maybe the American people saw through all the bullshit and voted for Trump.  Trump is pro-American and anti-NWO.  The American people reject the NWO.

       Trump has appointed the same old bankers, has done huge things for Israel, and has continued the Bush and Obama foreign policy. We're still in Afganistan and helping to starve Yemenis for our terror ally Saudi Arabia. Seems like business as usual to me.

       Yes Trump appointed these people unless you are saying he was pressured to, which means he's not in control and is another NWO stooge. Yes I've noticed some of the resignations, but I haven't noticed anything significantly different with their replacements.

       I don't see what Trump has to do with the SA coup, how that impacts the NWO, or why Trump deserves any kudos for it.

       Trump is doing good things in N Korea, but nothing is finalized and I fail to see how that is evidence that he's not part of the NWO. Trump's actions in Syria speak more toward the NWO affiliations imo.

       No, I'm an anti-NWO anti-Zionist. Imo there's no such thing as a globalist, it's a party trick Alex Jones invented because he clearly can't call out Zionists. For example George Soros is supposedly a globalist but he's built on Rothschild money and hangs out with tons of Zionists like Trump's Kushner.

       I checked before and I could not link Trump to any NWO organization.  It could be well hidden, but I am going by what I found.  It is easy to link the Clintons to the CFR, Bilderberg, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       My understanding is the the incoming President is given a list of people to appoint.  For example, Obama was given a list by Chase bank, if I remember correctly.  It was one of those banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that got my attention is that, in January 2017, Trump was already fighting with the CIA.  This was before the inauguration.  I was watching to see how he would transition into the White House and it was anything but smooth.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I don't see what Trump has to do with the SA coup, how that impacts the NWO, or why Trump deserves any kudos for it."  Fair enough.  I see it differently, but that is fine.  I think that SA and Israel where involved in 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Trump is doing good things in N Korea, but nothing is finalized and I fail to see how that is evidence that he's not part of the NWO. Trump's actions in Syria speak more toward the NWO affiliations imo."  I am hoping for the best on this one.  I think that the American taxpayers have been taken for a ride on all this.  They have been making us pay for these wars that could have been resolved a long time ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rumor is that Jacob Rothschild was killed last November.  I still do not know if it is true, but I have not heard anything about him since then.
      </p>
      <p>
       "No, I'm an anti-NWO anti-Zionist. Imo there's no such thing as a globalist, it's a party trick Alex Jones invented because he clearly can't call out Zionists. For example George Soros is supposedly a globalist but he's built on Rothschild money and hangs out with tons of Zionists like Trump's Kushner."  I am also anti-NWO and anti-Zionist, so we agree there.  It seems that we interpret events differently, but we both want the same outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Trump is pushing for war with Iran. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss."  We will see what happens with Iran.  Trump alluded that Iran has changed a lot in the last four months.  I hope this is a positive sign.  If I see Rothschild controlled central banks pop up in North Korea and Iran, then that is not a good sign.

       Its the same sort of 4chan-meme culture that built a lot of what the r/the_donald was before it became the solid bedrock of unwielding consevatism it is now. Something starts as a joke/troll/fake and it slowly morphs into reality as more people jump onto the wagon, until it becomes consumed by the next group of followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with r/murica, it began as a satirization then morphed into a quasi propaganda sub that hid its negatives by claiming satire/irony.

       It's propaganda meant to satiate the right as no real justice has come to fruition following Clinton's indiscretions. Too many know disinfo agents like Alex Jones and others have claimed to know who Q is for it to be some nobody. I think it's a psyop.

      <p>
       As people wake up to the corruption and begin to identify who the real culprits are, we will see more complex forms of disinfo IMO.

       "Conspiracies -- this one in particular -- give their devotees a sense of coherence that is lacking in everything Trump does. QAnon presents Donald Trump as the character he plays on TV; bold, commanding, strategic, and brilliant...as opposed to the real Donald Trump, who displays the dignity, intelligence, and honesty of a strip-club tout with tertiary syphilis."

       Yes and no. It doesn't matter if whoever is in office is Black, White, Old, Young, etc. as long as the person is genuinely working for the people. That isn't the case with how things currently are as the last presidents we've had since JFK have been of CIA origin, with

      <p>
       There is constant deceptions being pulled onto the people. One big con that our government has going on is that the position of President can't effectively bring about needed change. Congress has made the president a de facto dictatorial position with emergency measure laws. Trump can declare anything he wants an emergency and say he has to spend Billions/Trillions to fix it via construction of a profitable infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other ways a President can enforce power and make Congress work for the people. Trump could send marines to Jerome's office and say you're going to print billions of dollars to build our infrastructure. Or he could make a big speech on our infrastructure, increasing our wealth and eliminate taxes, and explaining how we can do it. That would result in 90% approval ratings and back Congress to the wall because it isn't Trump v. Government but now a People v. Government within days.

       Whoever is in office makes very little difference besides the manner by which the oligarchy delivers it's edicts. The neo-cons are always gleeful and happy whenever they announce some new way to screw the ordinary people over while the neo-liberals pull a long sad face and say "We're awful sorry about this but it's for your own good." and of course it never is.
