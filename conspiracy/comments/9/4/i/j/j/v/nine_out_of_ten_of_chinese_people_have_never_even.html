       A very similar concept of democracy suppression (but in the US) espoused in Chomsky's,

       In China (as with totalitarian regimes) it's done with direct enforcement from the state. In the US it's done with propaganda.  This is discussed in the documentary.

       I'm a Brit living in China, and I've got to say, I reckon they're doing an ok job here. Of course, coming from England I've got a desire for freedom of speech and a democratic system but I think I get where they're coming. I compare it to parenting, I won't let my boys use bad language or badmouth me or my wife, particularly in public, a parent has to be firm or they lose the influence that they hope to guide the growth of their children with. Similarly, things like pornography, which is basically illegal here, I beleve has a negative influence on society as a whole. As an adult I would appreciate having more personal choice as to whether a movie has scenes deleted because of sexual content, but many grown ups aren't adults, maybe in terms of the greater good these examples of censorship have more positive results on society than negative ones. I can only judge by my experience of Chinese society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coming from 35 years of living in London I have personally experienced major violence and major drug problems. I've been attacked by people with bottles, I've been exposed to heroin and crack cocaine, but in the thirteen years I've lived here, in numerous cities, I have experienced zero violence or threat of, and next to no temptation to use drugs. I have found time and time again that Chinese society is kinder and healthier than that which I have been used to back in England. Plus I have almost no faith in the democratic system in the west anyway, it is more an illusion of freedom than anything close to freedom itself. I'm not saying this place is perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but as a parent choosing a society in which to raise children, I find this one undoubtedly preferable.

       The parts of China I've seen certainly weren't shitholes like most of Britain, but if the only way they can keep order is through lies, authoritarianism, and censorship then fuck them.  I'd much rather live in Canada than China or the UK, and here we have free speech, internet, porn, drugs, peace, high wages, and stability, witbout having cameras on every fucking corner.

       Dude fuck safety, freedom over "safety." Yeah I've seen drug addicts and crime too in America, that's life. You really think they're "doing an ok job" in China? You think porn is alright to be illegal because it generally effects people badly?

       The deep state is churning up its anti-China propaganda like never before, and I get it - some of you guys just hate Chinese people and don't care if it's fake or not.  But 9/10?  You gotta draw a line between the crap you're willing to believe.

       Donâ€™t confuse anti communist with anti Chinese!  With the Soviet Union gone, they are the largest and most powerful communist country on earth.  And anti communists who like and support Chinese culture need only look to be Republic of China on Taiwan.  Once called â€˜fascist â€˜, the KMT and its descendants have created a country that preserves traditional Chinese culture, has regular, free and fair elections, a female president, universal health care, legal gay marriage.  a strong economy , I could go on.  Meanwhile, across the Taiwan Strait, the people, so traumatized by the globalists, sacrificed their freedom for security, and in the end, got neither.  Communism failed, so they brought in capitalism without democracy, and the people are simply beyond politics.  Thereâ€™s no point in discussion because there is no election, youâ€™ll only get yourself in trouble talking about that.  Now they are the worldâ€™s slave labor force.  I would rather be a beggar on the streets of India, at least Iâ€™d be free.

       It sounds a little hyperbolic, but isn't it true? Whatever you think of the current state of democracy is, 9/10 probably think we live in a democracy, whether they are right or wrong isn't really relevant.

       a democracy would be a horrible idea and the founders knew that.  people just think we are a democracy because we took some ideals fro the model, such as voting, but voting in a democracy and voting in a republic is a very different thing

       The Chinese people have democracy in the Republic of China on Taiwan.  Itâ€™s imperfect there as it is here. However, to compare our system with the People â€˜s Republic of China would be like saying that a sick person is the same as a dead person.  And thatâ€™s hyperbolic.

       The Chinese are some of the most isolated and "brainwashed" people in the world by their government.. I've sometimes wondered if the "Powers that be" (Federal reserve banking system) may pull the rug out from under the US and move operations over to China/Russia sense their peoples are much more controlled and less informed.

       I know China has a bigger "middle class" then the USA but that is only because they have about 1.5 billion people within its borders. So compared to the USA's about 330 million people, but China also has more poor people in its country because they have more people.. But I hear you, there may or may not be more percentage of poor people in America compared to middle class percentage. China might have a better ratio of poor to middle class? I know the park I go hiking/walking/jogging at by my house, I always see Chinese people walking around it and you can tell they are Chinese citizens.. I think they come here to have kids because I always see them with babies and you can just tell they are like a group of Chinese citizens by the way they dress and I hear them speaking Chinese/mandarin when I walk by them. I always wonder to myself, "Why are all these Chinese people coming to this part of the country and why do I always see them walking around this park?" Its not like its some super popular park or anything, its just a park where some battles were fought at during the civil war.. I am guessing there is some big operation around here where Chinese nationals come here to have kids so their kids can be American and Chinese citizens (dual citizenship).. I know that is a BIG business in China.. Seriously I am so good at coming to logical conclusions by the littlest of detail that I seriously amaze myself sometimes. I have no idea why I am even telling you this, but yeah, its not right what they are doing.. And they always walk around this park in big groups and you can just tell theses groups of Chinese nationals are brought to this certain park by the people running the "anchor baby" operation because its always a bunch of men/grandparents (basically the family besides the pregnant wife) going out "site seeing" or whatever while their wife have the baby here within the USA for FREE! Seriously I am amazed and overwhelmed sometimes by intuition.. anyways yeah, i think we agree. I just went off on a crazy tangent.. sorry.

      </p>
      <p>
       I'll try to get this concise because there's a lot of things going on in your reply :p
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, first, it's amazing how your biased view of the world as an american dictates your line of thinking :) The whole chinese conspiracy you exposed here is based on the fact that they want to be in the USA for free. I don't know how to say it without sounding rude or rough... but we're not in the 50's or 60's anymore. Nobody especially wants to live in the USA more than any other place on earth like it used to. The premise you go for is false to start with.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's "funny", it's not you in particular. That's something I can really feel as I'm not from the US, you guys act like you're the center of the world. As you said, you're only 330 millions... There's a lot of things happening in the world that you're not even aware of :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing that alerted me, but is not easy to say either...
"Seriously I am so good at coming to logical conclusions by the littlest of detail that I seriously amaze myself sometimes." -&gt; this sentence in particular, associated with the fact that you're building conspiracy theories from your everyday encounters (the chinese in your park) could actually indicate some mental health problems (usualy mild paranoÃ¯a/schizophrenia, nothing too scary either)
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I'm on this sub because I'm open to conspiracy theories and thus I don't condemn a weird theory, should I agree with it or not. I'm more of concerned by the way you're building your negative-tainted "logical" conclusions.

       I've been to China and talked to many people about democracy. None of them seemed to be shocked about its existence. Idk maybe I was in the part of the country where people know about democracy. That or op is full of shit

       China is a democracy. It's a different form of democracy from the US or other western nations, but it is still a democracy.

       Chinese courts convict more than 99.9% of those arrested.  Does that seem like a social justice paradise?

       Donâ€™t confuse anti communist with anti Chinese!  With the Soviet Union gone, they are the largest and most powerful communist country on earth.  And anti communists who like and support Chinese culture need only look to be Republic of China on Taiwan.  Once called â€˜fascist â€˜, the KMT and its descendants have created a country that preserves traditional Chinese culture, has regular, free and fair elections, a female president, universal health care, legal gay marriage.  a strong economy , I could go on.  Meanwhile, across the Taiwan Strait, the people, so traumatized by the globalists, sacrificed their freedom for security, and in the end, got neither.  Communism failed, so they brought in capitalism without democracy, and the people are simply beyond politics.  Thereâ€™s no point in discussion because there is no election, youâ€™ll only get yourself in trouble talking about that.  Now they are the worldâ€™s slave labor force.  I would rather be a beggar on the streets of India, at least Iâ€™d be free.

       the chinese government probably censors stuff to prevent people from getting brainwashed by propaganda.

       that's it. There isn't a conspiracy. It's so they can win a culture war.
