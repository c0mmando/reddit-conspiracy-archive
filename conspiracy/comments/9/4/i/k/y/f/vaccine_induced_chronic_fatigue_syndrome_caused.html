        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong><em>Every two years, for the past twenty years, a group of approximately 70  scientists have met at different locations around the world to discuss the effects that</em></strong> <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/toxic-ingredient/aluminum"><strong><em>aluminum</em></strong></a> <strong><em>has had on living things.</em></strong></p>

<p>In March 2017, they met in Vancouver, Canada, for this year’s meeting, titled <a href="https://healthimpactnews.com/2017/conference-exposes-health-impact-of-aluminum-todays-most-prevalent-environmental-toxin/"><strong>The 12th Annual Keele Meeting on Aluminum</strong></a>,which was sponsored by the <a href="http://info.cmsr/"><strong>Children’s Medical Safety Research Institute</strong></a> (CMRSI). </p>

<p>One of the scientists who spoke at the conference this year was keynote speaker Dr. Romain Gherardi, from the Neuromuscular Pathology Expert Centre at Paris-Est Créteil University (UPEC). </p>

<p>According to Ms. Celeste McGovern, who reported on the conference and the presentations, Dr. Gherardi had given an extremely frightening overview of the most novel and profound aluminum research related to  vaccination.</p>

<p>She wrote:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Aluminum oxyhydroxide (Alhydrogel) and aluminium hydroxyphosphate (Adjuphos), are nanomaterials widely used as  immune stimulants or “adjuvants” of vaccines. Children have received them in increasing doses from the hepatitis B shot on their day of  birth, in diphtheria-tetanus shots given repeatedly in their first six months of life and in pneumococcal, meningitis, HPV vaccines and more.</em>  </p>

<p><em>In at least seven different countries, patients with myalgic chronic fatigue syndrome have been described after they received one of these aluminum-containing vaccines. In France in the late ’90s, Gherardi began taking biopsies of the deltoid muscle of these patients and he discovered lesions in these – clumps of aggregated aluminium hydroxide  engulfed in white blood cells called macrophages — at the injection site.</em> <strong><em>Subsequent studies in mice found that aluminum in these cells slowly migrates to their brains where it seems to prefer to settle, permanently. He called the phenomenon Macrophagic Myofasciitis (MMF).”</em></strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Continuing on the subject of MMF, she explained that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>“MMF mainly manifests as joint and muscle pain, fatigue and weakness, cognitive dysfunction, including attention and memory impairment and sleep disturbances.</em></strong> <em>And many MMF sufferers eventually  develop one of more than 100 different autoimmune disorders from alopecia to multiple sclerosis, sometimes years after the initial illness. So MMF is described as a facet of “autoimmune/inflammatory  syndrome induced by adjuvants” (ASIA) identified by leading Israeli  immunologist Yehuda Shoenfeld in</em> 2011<em>.”</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>She stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“But the MMF picture is still developing. Another French researcher, Jérôme Authier, presented his group’s findings published in the</em> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27765861/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><strong>Journal of Nuclear Medicine</strong></a> <em>this  year showing that neuroimaging of MMF patients’ brains by PET-scan reveals distinct patterns of impaired glucose metabolism in multiple  regions of their brains.</em>  </p>

<p><em>New research presented by Housam Eidi of the University of  British Columbia also looked at mouse brain function and aluminium (Al) concentration long after injections. Surprisingly,</em> <strong><em>the researchers found the lowest dose of Alhydrogel exerts the greatest neurotoxic effects. And small particle size seems to be critical for this brain  damage, Eidi explained”</em></strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Toxic Amounts of Aluminum in Vaccinations</h2>

<p>Dr. Robert Sears is another professional who is exceptionally worried  about the effect aluminum is having on our health. In his paper, titled  <a href="http://www.verontrustemoeders.nl/Is%20Aluminum%20the%20New%20Thimerosal.pdf"><strong>Is Aluminum The New Thimerosal?</strong></a>, Dr. Sears explained that aluminum is added to vaccinations to help them work more efficiently.</p>

<p>During his research, he came across a number of extremely worrying  documents, including one written by the American Society for Parenteral  and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN). Describing the document in depth, Sears  wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The source of the daily limit of 4 to 5 mcg of aluminum per kilogram of body weight quoted by the ASPEN statement seems to be a study that compared the neurologic development of about 100 premature babies who were fed a standard IV solution that contained aluminum, with the development of 100 premature babies who were fed the same solution with almost all aluminum filtered out.</em> <strong><em>The study was prompted by a number of established facts: that injected aluminum can build up to toxic levels in the bloodstream, bones, and brain; that preemies have decreased kidney function and thus a higher risk of toxicity; that an autopsy performed on one preemie whose sudden death was otherwise unexplained revealed high aluminum concentrations in the brain; and that aluminum toxicity can cause progressive dementia.”</em></strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>“However, none of these documents or studies mentions vaccines; they look only at IV solutions and injectable medications</em></strong><em>.</em> <strong><em>Nor does the FDA require labels on vaccines warning about the dangers of aluminum toxicity, although such labels are required for all other injectable medications. All of these studies and label warnings seem to apply mainly to premature babies and kidney patients. What about larger, full-term babies with healthy kidneys?”</em></strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He explained:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“However, these documents don’t tell us what the maximum safe dose would be for a healthy baby or child, and I can’t find such  information anywhere. This is probably why the ASPEN group suggests, and  the FDA requires, that all injectable solutions be limited to</em> <strong><em>25 mcg</em></strong><em>;  we at least know that that level is safe.”</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this information is correct, then why do so many of the  recommended childhood vaccinations include far above the recommended  amounts of aluminum?  </p>

<pre><code>According to Dr. Sears, the levels of aluminum included in childhood vaccinations are as follows:
</code></pre>

<p>• <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/pincushion-pregnancy-new-data-dtap-vaccine"><strong>DTaP</strong></a> (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis): <strong>170–625 mcg</strong>, depending on<br/>
    manufacturer</p>

<p>• hepatitis A: <strong>250 mcg</strong></p>

<p>• hepatitis B: <strong>250 mcg</strong></p>

<p>• Hib (for meningitis; PedVaxHib brand only): <strong>225 mcg</strong></p>

<p>• HPV: <strong>225 mcg</strong></p>

<p>• Pediarix (DTaP–hepatitis B–polio combination): <strong>850 mcg</strong></p>

<p>• Pentacel (DTaP–Hib–polio combination): <strong>330 mcg</strong></p>

<p>• pneumococcus: <strong>125 mcg</strong> (emphasis added)</p>

<p>These levels far exceed the safe levels recommended by ASPEN,  especially when you consider that a newborn baby is vaccinated with the  hepatitis B vaccine, containing 250 mcg of aluminum, at birth!</p>

<p>In fact, according to <a href="https://sarahjmuma.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/aluminum-new-thimerosal-sears.pdf"><strong>Dr. Sears</strong></a>, the FDA stated that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>“Although aluminum toxicity is not commonly detected clinically, it can be serious in selected patient populations, such as</em></strong> <strong><em>neonates (newborns)</em></strong><strong><em>, and may be more common than is recognized.”</em></strong> (emphasis added)  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since his paper, which was written in 2008, there are even more vaccinations containing aluminum.</p>

<h2>Terrifying Neurodegenerative Plague Expected to Affect One in Two Americans</h2>

<p>According to Ms. McGovern, no one can say how many of the one to four  million Americans and millions more globally are suffering from serious  chronic fatigue due to aluminum poisoning. </p>

<p>She continued with the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“No one can say how many of the current 50 million cases of  autoimmune disease in America are a long-term fallout from shots taken  years ago.</em><br/>
<em>Terrifying as that is, there were two more days of this research presented.  A 2017 study in the</em> <a href="http://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/"><strong><em>Journal of Translational Medicine</em></strong></a> <em>from Exley’s lab demonstrated the presence of some of the highest contents of aluminum ever observed in brain tissue in every section of tissue sampled from brains of patients with familial early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. So, could it be that when aluminum migrates from vaccines to brains it is somehow associated with Alzheimer’s disease, the terrifying neurodegenerative plague that is expected to affect one in two Americans by 2050?</em>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: Long-lasting itching vaccination granulomas are poorly understood but more frequent than previously known after infant vaccination with commonly used diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-polio-Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. The risk increases with the number of vaccines given. Most children with itching granulomas become contact allergic to aluminium. Itching vaccination granulomas are benign but may be troublesome and should be recognised early in primary health care to avoid unnecessary investigations, anxiety and mistrust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So 0.83% of recipients have an allergic reaction to the aluminum. Peanut allergy affects 1.4% of the population, the point being that yes, people are allergic to things and while it would be better to improve the number, you don&#39;t deny the benefits to the vast majority because of the few. It&#39;s the pediatrician&#39;s job to note that first reaction and consider the best option for future treatments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My cousin, since the 1950s, is in a wheel chair because of polio. He wouldn&#39;t have minded an allergic reaction to the vaccine, had it been available in time for him. Vaccines do an immense amount of good and don&#39;t deserve the histrionics against them. They get improved incrementally through research and it&#39;s good to stay informed. If 1% get a rash, it&#39;s no big woo, we find something different for next time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering the amount of testing done before they&#39;re introduced and the ongoing testing after, such as the study mentioned above, plus the cumulative experience that the industry has with vaccines in general, I do expect very few problems with them.</p>

<p>Listen to the multiple TV commercials for the various wonder drugs they&#39;re promoting. In particular, hear some of the awful side effects they are required to declare. Like with vaccines, only a tiny number of people will have those problems, but it shows that no medical product or procedure is ever risk-free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the 1960&#39;s an inactivated-virus measles vaccine was introduced in the United States after extensive testing and FDA approval.  The vaccine was 100% ineffective and did nothing to stop measles. In addition, it had adverse side effects and injured numerous victims.</p>

<p>Questions:  (1) Do you accept the above brief synopsis of the 1960&#39;s inactivated-virus measles vaccine as accurate? (You can go do some research to verify it).  If not, can you provide your own brief synopsis of the 1960&#39;s inactivated-virus measles vaccine (sometimes called killed-virus)?  </p>

<p>(2) Were you previously aware that a vaccine was approved by the FDA in 1963 that was proven to be ineffective and also cause injuries? </p>

<p>(3) Why was an ineffective vaccine administered from 1963-1967? <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>People who were vaccinated prior to 1968 with either inactivated (killed) measles vaccine or measles vaccine of unknown type should be revaccinated with at least one dose of live attenuated measles vaccine. This recommendation is intended to protect those who may have received killed measles vaccine, which was available in 1963-1967 and was not effective. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(4) What changes to the clinical approval process were implemented in response to the approval of a harmful and ineffective vaccine?</p>

<p>Also, see this 1967 publication describing how 10 children who received the FDA approved inactivated-virus measles vaccine not only contracted measles, but the symptoms were far worse than if they were never vaccinated:</p>

<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/336928">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/336928</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>An atypical measles illness occurred in ten children who had received  inactivated (killed) measles virus vaccine five to six years earlier.  The illness is characterized by a two- to three-day prodrome of fever  and complaints of pain (head, muscle, and abdomen, or both muscle and  abdomen) followed by the development of a maculopapular rash with  petechial, vesicular, and urticarial components. Peripheral edema and  pneumonia occurred in almost all the children. In three instances,  significant pleural effusions were noted. Serologic determinations  established the diagnosis in all ten children, but measles virus was  recovered from none of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a good link that sums it up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Measles virus was first isolated by John Enders in 1954. The first  measles vaccines were licensed in 1963. In that year, both an  inactivated (“killed”) and a live attenuated vaccine (Edmonston B  strain) were licensed for use in the United States. <strong>The inactivated  vaccine was withdrawn in 1967 because it did not protect against measles  virus infection</strong>. Furthermore, recipients of inactivated measles vaccine  frequently developed a unique syndrome, atypical measles, if they were  infected with wild-type measles virus (see <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html#atypical">Atypical Measles</a>, in the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html#complications">Complications section</a>). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html#vaccines">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html#vaccines</a></p>

<p>The difference between vaccines and other drugs with side-effects are that people can read about the side-effects and make up their own mind as to whether the risk is worth the reward.  With vaccines, you are forcing people to take a drug that may kill them.  While the risk of death is small, why do you give people the choice in taking other drugs but not vaccines?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah what a surprise people downvoting actual conspiracies that should be posted on the sub. Meanwhile the daily drumpf articles are 90% upvoted. Reposting my own Aluminum research from an earlier thread:</p>

<p>Aluminum in vaccines:</p>

<p><a href="http://vaccinepapers.org/wp-content/uploads/FDA-aluminum-paper.pdf">http://vaccinepapers.org/wp-content/uploads/FDA-aluminum-paper.pdf</a></p>

<p>This is <strong>the paper cited by the FDA claiming aluminum hydroxide is safe to inject into infants and gone within a few days after vaccinating</strong>. Read the below passage for yourself and decide whether you think this is hard proof of aluminum being safe to use, or if the FDA is misleading you.</p>

<p>Although based on the most recent data available, there are several uncertainties in our analysis. First, the published retention function for aluminum (Eq. (1)) is based on results for only one person, albeit data have been acquired from this adult for twelve years [5]. Ideally, the retention function would have been derived relative to current MRL level intake in new born infants from pharmacokinetic data in infants or in more than one adult; however, an expansion of this analysis is unlikely. <strong>An infant monkey study could provide these data, however, given the present lack of evidence of harm due to the current aluminum levels, such studies may be a low priority.</strong> </p>

<p>Second, the results of Flarend et al. [27], from which we obtained our estimate of the rate and extent of absorption of aluminum hydroxide and phosphate following intramuscular injection, are based on data from only two rabbits per adjuvant tested. The low number of animals in that study is not surprising, given that it was primarily an exploratory investigation into the disposition of injected aluminum, utilizing, at that time, a new method for detecting radioactive Al in the body (accelerator mass spectrometry). <strong>Ideally, the results of that study should be confirmed using a larger number of animals, in order to increase our confidence in the results. Nevertheless, the study clearly showed that the absorption of aluminum, at least in rabbits, is neither instantaneous nor complete up to one month following intramuscular injection [27].</strong> </p>

<p><em>We consider this behavior to be more biologically plausible than complete and instantaneous absorption from the site of injection, and more consistent with the view of muscle tissue being a storage depot for aluminum adjuvant following intramuscular vaccination.</em></p>

<p>tl;dr and conclusion</p>

<p>a. They base aluminum retention levels off only one adult human. Not been tested on infants, the primary concern with early vaccines.</p>

<p>b. They base aluminum absorption rates off a study using rabbits, this rabbit study was actually completely unrelated to vaccine testing, but was about testing a new method for detecting radioactive Al in the body, but don&#39;t let that get in the way /s. Furthermore, rodent studies have been proven irrelevant to human studies in many cases.</p>

<p>c. The article literally admits that in the rabbit study, aluminum was still present in the body after a whole month following intramuscular injections. The general consensus you&#39;d find though, would claim its gone within a few days after vaccinating. This is clearly some sort of misconception.</p>

<p>d. The general uncertain tone of the paper, and even request for more studies to be sure, ideally using an infant monkey, though they admit its unlikely for whatever reason (saying theres no prior evidence of aluminum being harmful? Is it unlikely to be funded by vaccine producers or FDA, for what reason? Wouldn&#39;t it be better to just confirm?) Assumptions are NOT science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients">http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients</a></p>

<p>The claim:  A study from 2011  modelled the impact of aluminium from diet and vaccines in infants, and concluded that the total amount of aluminium absorbed from both sources was <strong>likely to be less than the weekly safe intake level.</strong></p>

<p>The 2011 study is what my above link is referring to. Even they (Oxford University..) know it&#39;s bullshit and can only safely put &#39;likely&#39;. The study itself obviously seems very uncertain and poorly done.</p>

<p>The claim:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rarely, aluminium adjuvants may cause small itchy lumps (granulomas) to form at the injection site. A 2014 Swedish study  found that this happened in a small number of children (fewer than 1 in 100) after vaccination with the 5-in-1 vaccine (Infanrix) and pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar). Granulomas are not dangerous but can be irritating and last for months or even years. The study found that children with granulomas often developed an aluminium contact allergy. However, most children recovered from their symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The actual study says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: Long-lasting itching vaccination granulomas are <strong>poorly understood but more frequent than previously known after infant vaccination with commonly used diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-polio-Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. The risk increases with the number of vaccines given. Most children with itching granulomas become contact allergic to aluminium.</strong> Itching vaccination granulomas are benign but may be troublesome and should be recognised early in primary health care to avoid unnecessary investigations, anxiety and mistrust.</p>

<p>From above link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Current research on pharmacokinetics of aluminium in vaccines is ongoing and should be encouraged as a means of further validating and improving this model.</p>
