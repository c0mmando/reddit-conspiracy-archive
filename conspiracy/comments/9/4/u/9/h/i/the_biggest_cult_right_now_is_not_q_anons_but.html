<p>You can oppose Trump, his administration, his policies, etc., but when it gets to a point of devotion where the carriers of those narratives become infallible and all facts to the contrary are discarded with haste, well...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I felt compelled to respond to your comment. While I disagree with your conclusion, I can certainly appreciate your stance. Instead of spouting off nonsense that media outlets tell us like a lot of other people on here, you rely more on intuition and circumstance in forming your opinion. I can respect that. The problem with our media is that a large portion of our population believes everything they read or hear as fact while paying no attention to the agendas these outlets are clearly pushing. </p>

<p>Trump is right - the fakestream media (CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, Breitbart, etc etc etc) IS our biggest enemy. We can no longer have rational debate in this country because noone has a clue what the real facts are anymore. Journalism really is dead in this country; there seems to be only agendas now. One side is arguing one set of &quot;facts&quot;, and the other side is arguing completely different &quot;facts.&quot; Common ground can never be reached this way. So, the only way to reach a conclusion is to discount all of the noise and instead rely on ones intuition as to what is real or not. </p>

<p>Nothing illegal took place at that meeting unless you start looking into who approved the Russian attorney’s VISA at the State Department. Her VISA was restricted but someone vouched for her.</p>

<p>She met with Glen Simpson the day before the meeting and the day after.</p>

<p>Nothing was exchanged at the meeting. Trump Jr. characterized it as “a waste of time”. Lying about a meeting that wasn’t illegal in the first place, isn’t a crime.</p>

<p>Ok, but the trump or accepted the meeting, had a pre-meeting planning session, attended the meeting. </p>

<p>Then lied about the meeting (to the American people and congress), it’s attendees, it’s subject, and who knew about it over and over as the story slowly came to light. </p>

<p>Was that all a fusion/fbi set up too?</p>

<p>No they didn&#39;t, Trump and his campaign willingly met with them on the expectations of opposition dirt (illegal) and then Jr lied under oath to cover it up (also illegal). It&#39;s no coincidence that Trump promised new Hilary dirt the day they got that email, they didn&#39;t give them the dirt but told them they have it and will make it public when it&#39;s most impactful </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So youd rather talk about the same shit everyone talks about? God damn talk about beating a dead horse. Who gives a fuck? Neither of us will bring up new information about Trump and Co.  ?</p>

<p>But I do find it funny considering the alternative of discussion proposed, of actually  talking 
about spying on a senate intelligence committee member.</p>

<p>And funny that you choose the deadhorse.</p>

<p>Makes me question whether you want to discuss, or just spew some more of your Trump hate speech? I vote the latter. You seem to have no interest in a real discussion. Be ashamed because thats pathetic. </p>

<p>The person who wants to project their &quot;Trump is the Boogeyman&quot; ideal gets to determine the discussion? I believe there is one of those aforementioned buzzword terms for this. </p>

<p>You listed slogans, like &quot;Im with Her&quot; that went over so well. But clearly, missed the meaning of my statement. </p>

<p>You avoid my questions, to simply paint trump in a negative light? I wonder why. Then accuse me of glossing over &#39;treason&#39; and not wanting to discuss. Correct. I do not want to repeat the same tired talk. You can go read my comments if you want my thoughts on this half cooked russian influence shame. The plot has sp many holes it&#39;s laughable. But keep drinking up the koolaid. Im out</p>

<p>But for real, if youd like to continue participating in the great russian circle jerk, please go to r/worldnews or r/poltics, you will find many like minded individuals. </p>

<p>But come in here with your bullshit, accuse me of nonsense and then dodge my legitimate questions, all the while completing your Trump bingo card.. Nah thats not flying. Do you folks get a gold star for the number of times you associate Trump with racists?</p>

<p>That fall from your high horse will hurt so bad. I can now fathom why the left wants free healthcare so bad, they will truly need it.</p>

<p>And again, still wondering what a fake billionaire is? You sound so angsty, like a lost teenager. But that kind of makes sense from my perspective. </p>

<p>You likely are lost. Looking for something to call your own. You found hating Trump. Congratulations.  </p>

<p>Fienstein is the only thing I replied about in our discussion, somebody you brought up. Yet youd still prefer to discuss Trump. Id like to discuss something that is new to me, not something you talk about daily. </p>

<p>Infuriating part is you have not answered any question or brought anything of valuable substance to this discussion. Just the same tired racist blah blah bullshit.</p>

<p>Most likely included is your own existence too, based solely off this interaction, and it&#39;s inclusion of wild accusations and down right lies.</p>

<p>Her spy was employed by her for 20 years, while acting as a gopher shuttling documents, while she was chair of Senate Intelligence Committee. She let a stranger into our house. But this old bat is your beacon of light. LOL dust her off and have her run
 Good luck if shes the best you got</p>

<p>You folks are insufferable and delusional. </p>

<p>Your base or lack thereof is the only reason democrats lost. That truly sucks and points me towards why you are so upset.  We all know, there will still be no core to run on in 2020, hence overdrive push. </p>

<p>Oh joy!</p>

<p>Brookings states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is commonly said that a President deserves some credit or blame for the economy’s performance only after he’s been in office about six months. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disagree with them not me, but clearly says to me since July 2017. Obama didnt do this. GOP policy did this. Like 14% in SP500 </p>

<p>Was waiting for one of this incorrect MSM statements to pop up. </p>

<p>Stocks exploded on election night when Trump won. This had zero to do with Obama. It centered around the fact that our antiquated tax code would be modernized. Economic growth is sustained, and real gdp is growing. </p>

<p>The boom bust cycle plays out regardless of president. The funny part to me is this, its not Obama policy that caused explosive growth. Yet you give him false credit. When the recessiom inevitably comes, you&#39;ll have no problem placing the blame squarely at his feet after a historic 10 year run up. </p>

<p>Any proof that it&#39;s a LARP?</p>

<p>Yes. It is written as a LARP. The content is a LARP and the intention is obvious trolling. The entire &quot;Q&quot; character and presentation is a textbook example of 4chan trolling. It would take a complete idiot with zero social skills or life experience to fall for such obvious bullshit. Hence, the entire &quot;Q&quot; cult and the idiocy around the LARP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who&#39;s the real dumbass?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People who fall for 4chan trolling and support Donald Trump seem to have already wrapped up the &quot;real dumbass&quot; award for the decade.</p>

<p>I also noticed you forgot all about Trump&#39;s admission to treason and tried to focus on the Q LARP. Even Trump&#39;s most ignorant fan boys seem to know he is illegitimately in office.</p>

<p>Any proof that this obvious LARP is real?</p>

<p>Putin Pedik was asked a question and he responded positively. Trump has already admitted openly that his campaign conspired with Russian agents to influence the election. So this is no longer a question of doubt.</p>

<p>when did Trump himself admit that he &quot;conspired with agents of Putin to affect the 2016 election?&quot;</p>

<p>Multiple occasions. The first publicly known case was inviting Russian government officials and a Putin-controlled media representative into the Oval Office to brag about firing Comey to stop the investigation into Trump&#39;s treason. Trump Jr. admitted the conspiracy and presented email evidence of the conspiracy. And Trump just admitted to the entire conspiracy on Twitter.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see what&#39;s right in front of you, there is nothing that can help you unfortunately. The methods, communication and what is being communicated is textbook trolling.

<p>Some things are ancillary, like stronger borders, im ok with. But dont give me some sob story on children, I dont care. Fuck em.</p>

<p>The tweets I could definitely live without. There is no need for 90% of them</p>

<p>But a big one is he actually sat down with NK, that should be applauded with concessions made or not. No president has done this, its unprecedented.</p>

<p>Plenty of good has came out of this admin. You just refuse to accept it. I have no qualms about my vote. And your anonymous internet chastising wont change anybody&#39;s opinion.

<p>If you honestly think Trump goes down, im very sorry for you. They would have spilled the beans by now. Why would the IC allow a traitor to keep sitting in the office?? Hint, they wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>From my end, it appears you are the lost one, clutching to fantasies and holding rage, leaving you only to throw out accusations and insults. Must be tough, and explains your bitterness well. </p>

<p>Send my regards to your fellow losers!</p>

<p><strong><em>Plus free center peice</em></strong></p>

<p>Congratulations!!! You won r/conspiracy Trump accusation bingo. You&#39;ve accomplished nothing! Please try again.</p>

<p>Everything I said to you was coherent, logical, and can be independently non partisan sourced. Please stop resorting to insults. It only screams, I have no other cards left. </p>

<p>And my final thought:</p>

<p>You were the one unwilling to discuss and behaving like a 6 year old at bedtime. Your party will go far with you in their ranks. </p>

<p>Salud.</p>

<p>Did you write anything about how wonderful it is that Trump inherited Obama&#39;s economy? That&#39;s always the funny part to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh joy!</p>

<p>Brookings states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is commonly said that a President deserves some credit or blame for the economy’s performance only after he’s been in office about six months. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disagree with them not me, but clearly says to me since July 2017. Obama didnt do this. GOP policy did this. Like 14% in SP500 </p>

<p>Was waiting for one of this incorrect MSM statements to pop up. </p>

<p>Stocks exploded on election night when Trump won. This had zero to do with Obama. It centered around the fact that our antiquated tax code would be modernized. Economic growth is sustained, and real gdp is growing. </p>

<p>The boom bust cycle plays out regardless of president. The funny part to me is this, its not Obama policy that caused explosive growth. Yet you give him false credit. When the recessiom inevitably comes, you&#39;ll have no problem placing the blame squarely at his feet after a historic 10 year run up. </p>
