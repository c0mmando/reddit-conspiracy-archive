       Over the years I've got to know many self described "conspiracy theorists" both online and in real life. A commonalty I found among these people are that their religious intentions drive home many of their conspiracy ideas. Whether it be the flat earth, NWO, satanists, Islam, whatever, it all seems to have a religious undertone to it, especially for non-hierarchical christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm curious, do you or do you not describe yourselves as religious? How do your religious views effect your worldview?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm an atheist admittably, and I'm curious how you guys view the "conspiracy" that religion is really not what it says to be and the possibility that the existence of god isn't really all that supported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honesty I do not believe in many conspiracy theories in my day to day life, but I wholeheartedly believe, from a good place in my heart, that such belief and devotion for the supernatural is really not supported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion is the ultimate conspiracy, used to control the masses, use to instigate wars, used to acquire wealth. Religion is a rulers tool, a priests excuse, and a tyrants delight. I'm actually surprised to the lack of skepticism regarding religious topics on a subreddit such as r/conspiracy, or perhaps I'm just fulfilling my own stereotypes of such people.

       I think everything you mentioned as a control mechanism fits money better than religion.

       I mean, when the peasants don't have money, and will never get money in their life time, telling tales of untold riches in the afterlife as long as you follow the authority seems like a pretty good deal from a rulers standpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty much how much of early civilization ran. The ruler class, the priest class, the warrior class, and then the uneducated majority peasants.

       I am broadly in agreement, however, framing religion in this manner, is highly redactive at an expanse of tendencies that counteract these facts.    I mean it goes without saying that institutions which promise  results in the supernatural realm as payment for actions in the material is going to full of grift and manipulation. But the tendency of human beings to produce religion can't be reduced to this.

       It is interesting as to why so many humans lie to themselves.  For years growing up I knew there probably wasn't an afterlife, but I couldn't bear the thought of losing everyone.  Of being born alone and dying alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion is a drug.  It helped me delude myself until I was old enough and strong enough to accept my mortality and the mortality of those I love.
      </p>
      <p>
       But perhaps I could have "grown up" faster if that crutch wasn't provided to me so willingly by so many adults and superiors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I just feel bitterness towards those humans that allowed me to delude myself. Why haven't they faced life's harsh realities?  Why didn't they grow up? Why don't they emphasize actual reasons to live a good life as opposed to fictitious ones?

       Contemplation and fear of death are a big reason why human beings produce religion, but it also ordering activity for beings which faced an unknown world.  It explained regularity and chaotic occurrences in natural cycles.  It also belonged to a stage where humans are figuring out how to influence the natural world around them.   The idea that one can perform acts and chant incantations, and in turn nature would respond is a normal outgrowth of the ability of human beings do produce material objects and make things happen with words.

       This is a description of a scaffold, and perhaps it is a net benefit, in the sense that maybe there is a right time for a person to accept their mortality; until that time is reached perhaps a scaffold is not a bad idea.

       Perhaps! I am of the opinion that in this subject we try to be as clear as to our limits of knowledge, but also share what we do know about anthropological findings considering religious production.

       From one stranger on the internet to another this is a normal stage to go through when loosing ones religion, but try to get out of that negative space fast.  There are people who encouraged religiosity out of love and care, and that is important, those who viewed your 'soul' as a currency with which they will purchase a nice house in the clouds, you should be weary of.

       This can't be reduced to a single reason.  Some just go through the motions because of social pressures.   Some need the world to be just.  Some don't believe but pretend they do.  Some are really intelligent and have good reasons and arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was exiting a fundamentalist religion it helped  to read widely concerning religious texts especially the texts that were presented as leading to damnation.  There are great and powerful intellects in theology wrestling with existential questions, and even if they are wrong about some fundamental issues, they make powerful and valuable insights, and those insights are worth it.

       I am prepared for the down votes again lol. But yes I am a Christian. Believing there is a God is easy for me because it is very easy to see the opposite of God in many of the evil, wicked, disgusting things people with power do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things like mind control, pedophilia, starting wars and murdering millions just to make a buck are far to sinister to be human nature to me. So there must be a great evil in this world to get people to do the things they do.

       So you haven't read your Bible?  Your religion is based on genocide, murder, theft, hyper-racism, and a psychotic god who murders people as often as he can.  Just read Genesis, Exodus, Joshua, Judges, Job, and plenty more to see what a disgusting bloodthirsty "god" you worship.

       This "modern evil" is exactly the kind of crap your god just loooved doing throughout history.

       You should just
       <em>
        read
       </em>
       those parts of the Bible again.  Not "interpret", not interjecting your own presumptions, not listening to the other interpretations of your teachers.  Simply
       <em>
        read
       </em>
       it.  Those excuses simply aren't there, for almost all of the atrocities of this god.  The book of Job by itself will show how sadistic god is, even toward his most devout followers.  All of his family, servants, and animals were murdered over a petty bet with Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your excuses and handwavings for those atrocities don't hold up.  They're excuses people make up to clear away the cognitive dissonance of seeing the disgusting things their "god" enjoys.  And it never stopped.  The new testament of Titus paved the way for 1500 years of feudalistic slavery, and the wars and hatred never stopped either.

       The god of your bible is either an evil deity, an imposter (i.e. Satan), or a fictional tool, created and used by evil people to do evil things.  There's no scenario where a "good" god does any one of the many genocides he claims to be responsible for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you think that a god who could create a world in 7 days had no choice but to wander "his people" around Canaan for 40 years, slaughtering millions of men, women, and children simply because they lived somewhere the Hebrews wanted to steal.  Sure.  Totally believable.  I guess he just exhausted all of his super powers after creation, and needed the blood of innocent humans and animals to keep himself going, afterward...

       I hope "God" doesn't tell you to slaughter me, my family, my entire town, and the rest of my state for this abhorrent lack of faith in a genocidal maniac.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it wasn't any "lack of faith" that got them genocided.  They simply lived on land that the "Hebrews" wanted to steal.  The "slaughtering faithless idolaters" excuse is one that people add to their "interpretations", so it feels less evilicky.

       But Jews and Christians don't seem capable of simple reading.  They have add their own meanings to everything, to gloss over the evil written on the pages.

       Don't worry I live under a new covenant with Jesus Christ as my Lord and saviour. He tells me to love my neighbors, turn the other cheek and to let other men know they have the opportunity to live by this law. By accepting we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus expects me to merely plant this seed. You are apparently a smart guy just misguided. Instead of attacking real Christians that believe in doing good works for people and living by the golden rule, you should spend your time and energy attacking and exposing the real injustice and evils in this world.

       The ptb want you meek.  Poor.  Turn the other cheek.  Give them even the clothes on your back.  Submit.  Wait for "heaven" to reward you.  With your compliance (along with the other billions of brainwashed believers), you've been turned into a sheep.  An obedient member of the herd who will do exactly what your rulers want you to do.  Nothing.  Submit.  Pay your taxes.  Don't forget to tithe!  God needs money!
      </p>
      <p>
       They use our compliance to do whatever they want.  We spent 1500 years under feudalistic dark ages because of this crap.  Even now,I they coax into embracing the murder of millions in wars.  Inject us with disgusting diseases.  Poison our water and food.  Make us hate our neighbors.  But keep on turning that cheek.  That'll show 'em.

       I think you're completely wrong that TPTB are pushing religion. In fact it's the opposite and if you can't see that you're blind. Evidence only points to the higher ups pushing socialized oligarchies, stronger federal (ultimately world) government (the end game of feudalism), and completely discrediting religion based upon "science".
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you could provide actual thoughtful evidence for your arguments instead of unrealistic projections. I agree there are lots of people who fit in the box you're describing but that's like equating every liberal with ANTIFA. You're either apart of the problem or part of the solution. Meaningful discussion and empathetical arguments are how divides are bridged.

       You seem to think our history only goes back ~100 years, with the modern shift toward Sciencism.  I'm talking about thousands of years.  2500 years, at the very least.  All of Western civilization is infected with the abrahamic cancer, and it wasn't an accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no way to "convince" the brainwashed of anything.  They have to see something for themselves, to break out of the cult.  I know that through my own experience, also.  But I still speak against them, because the cancerous abrahamic religions are very much
       <em>
        the primary tool
       </em>
       for mind controlling the unwashed masses.

       I agree it wasn't an accident! But equating the actions of people with a spiritual belief is wrong. People are the problem not a belief system. If you want to talk about how certain authorities use religion as a tool to control and manipulate then that is a totally separate conversation than arguing that the religion is completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you should think about why Hebrews were able to make such fantastical claims in the ancient world and no one called them on it? Same on the Christians but even 100x more. D
You already know how crazy it sounds that people were going around talking about this Jesus guy feeding all these people, preforming miracles, and His disciples doing the same after He died. Yet the people in that area did not deny what they were saying and in fact believed it to be true.

       Uhhh no, the vast majority of people did not believe it, considering Jesus was executed, and followers were persecuted for the next 300 years.  that’s the problem with using religious texts for historical accuracy.

       Well considering I'm not using religious texts to get this information I would like your source for people in the region claiming Christians to be incorrect or lying. I would consider 40 churches along 3 continents by the year 100 as being fairly accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being persecuted does not mean they were wrong. I understand it's hard to have a grasp on what ancient religion looked liked but it's very different than today. As this discussion clearly indicates just because we have different belief systems and one is persecuted does not make it any less valid.

       The fact that judaism remained the more popular religion in the region says that a lot more people did not believe than people that did. I never said being persecuted means they were wrong, but being persecuted is definitely evidence of disbelief by others

       It's still the same "god".  And thinking that he just "changed his mind", after slaughtering gentiles (and hebrews) for thousands of years is just silly.  Even if he
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       change his mind, fuck that guy.  I don't listen to genocidal psychopaths, especially when they pretend to be nice for 3 years, then get right back to slaughterings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you want to go "extra-biblical", and say that this fictional Jesus character had nothing to do with this Yahweh, that's fine, but it's not christianity.  It doesn't even match the words of this jesus himself, who said that he came to fulfill the law (of yahweh), and not to abolish one word.  But when people can just make up and pretend to believe whatever they want to believe, what's the point in arguing.

       Alright to speak about this requires much complexity. The Hebrews did not want to steal the land it was "promised" to them (you're allowed to interpret this however you want). The Bible also says that the people who lived in those lands were giants, do you believe that? Because if you don't then the conversation cannot move forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       God punished the Hebrews consistently for their disobedience. One of the prophets was instructed to sleep with a prostitute in order to be able relate to Gods feelings about the Hebrews being unfaithful to Him. I think it's fairly obvious that if a "lack of faith" made the God of the Bible murderous then there would be less than 7 billion people on the planet.

       You obviously don't understand the point of Job. Any so called "atrocity" can be easily explained in Biblical context. I agree that people have a hard time understanding these concepts but that does not make them untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think that a story like the Gospels could have gotten through all of the criticism it has without having truth? Don't you feel if someone could debunk the entire bible it would've been done by now?
      </p>
      <p>
       People use the Bible, the constitution, their feelings, their beliefs, and even science to justify negative behavior so using the argument that people used Titus to justify slavery means nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways Job is one of my favorite books to read. It's an example of how faith does not determine our physical reality. There's smart, dumb, tall, short, rich, poor, physically handicapped, physically superior, and a infinite number of people in this world. God loves each and every one of us; He put each of us here for a specific purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I know God exists and no one indoctrinated me to believing so. There a too many coincidences, too much beauty, and too much of a public push to discredit Christianity for me to believe this is a randomly created universe. Have some cognitive dissonance and study people who believe differently than yourself. I understand if you've had bad experiences with Christians because there a millions out there but that doesn't mean the God they claim to believe in supports anything they do.

       Not at all.  This is very clearly disproven by a simple reading of the Bible.  And your book of Job, as well.  Countless millions slaughtered for no reason, in the name of a god.  And do you think that all of Job's family and his servants/slaves weren't people...  because they got kinda...  murdered...  during that pointless, petty bet with the devil.  All to "test" job, who followed a supposedly omniscient God who already knew how devoted he was...

       I think it was stated earlier but you need to do some more research on the nephilim and giants. You will have a better understanding that the seed of man has been corrupted.

       In Job his children and servants die in a variety of ways that I would hardly consider slaughtered. This does not means they're loved any less. If Jesus, His Son, was subject to crucifixion I feel those who were sacrificed in Job were justly rewarded. God wasn't testing Job it was Satan. God allowed it yes and it's fairly obvious He allows quite a bit from everything that has happened in this world.

       You can call what I'm saying apologetics but it's you that fails to counter the points I'm making. Give me some more "senseless murders" and we'll see how "senseless" they really are.

       I feel they are liars and will have to face God's judgement for that. The bible does teach us you will know a true Christian by the fruit they produce. If their works and deeds do not align with Christ then they are not really Christian.

       2 Corinthians 11:13-15 (KJV)  For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.

       Eventually those stars won't be visible since the universe is expanding.  Presumably another universe will eventually form somewhere. With infinite space and time, life is less a miracle and more an anomoly.  I'm glad I'm around for it though!

       Yes, but I assume you realize that Christianity like any other religion has its fair share of brainwashing, pedophilia, warfare, and murdering millions.

       You're going to have to be a little more specific. Are you talking prosperity preachers? Cult leaders like David Koresh and Jim Jones?  Liars like Pat Robertson?  I could go on naming the people who pervert Christianity and use Christ for their own personal gain.  I am not the judge of their souls, but their works are obviously not what Jesus Christ had intended.

       I agree wholeheartedly, and am baffled at people who see conspiracies around every corner, but can't possibly fathom how an institutionalized religion of obedience, xenophobia, self-loathing, and financial/spiritual debt couldn't possibly be a tool of ruling families.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with that being said, most atheists aren't "out of the woods" either.  Sciencism is being pushed as the new religion, complete with its own set of dogmas, institutions, priesthoods, and forcefully imposing its will on blasphemous "unbelievers".
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing wrong with the scientific method, as a tool, but most of what people call "science" nowadays isn't scientific at all.  It's just the Church of Sciencism, spreading its gospel of the Lord and savior Sciencism, with its white robed priest class.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just ask any super-pro-vaxxer what he thinks about "heretics", and you'll see a psychotic, brainwashed, militant believer, every bit as bad as a fundamentalist christian.

       You are spot on regarding organized religion, and science's usurpation of its role in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       My parents inherited religion from their parents, and tried to pass it down to me. Church every Sunday growing up. I distinctly remember being around 5-7 years old and watching all the adults around me chant their prayers, stand up in unison to sing, etc, and thinking it was just so... silly and borderline creepy. I also couldn't come to terms with the fact that all the grown-up adherents to all the other religions in the world were just as sure that their god was the "true" god as the grown-ups standing beside me. Someone had to be wrong. I decided they all were.
      </p>
      <p>
       But maybe they're not all wrong. Maybe they're all partially right, containing various snippets of the original ancient story, which may be worse. "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing," after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a conspiracy theorist, naturally repelled by authority, and a firm adherent to the Socratic paradox. I simply don't know, and have no problem admitting it. But I want to know. I try to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lately, I tend to believe that there is a "god" or "gods." As for its true nature, you got me. Zeus? Jesus? Aliens? AI? Future humans? Source?

       First Let's define religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your definition as i take it, is the the belief in the supernatural, than there are articles in science mags that will back up a "6th scene" or the feeling of someone watching you. Or how when you think of a person and the you met them in public with on prior notice, or they call you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you want to define religion as a set of ideas forced upon a person, or group of person, with no open and honest dissuasions, blindly flowing what the perceived pension in the position of authority is telling to be the the truth, than that is what I understand religion to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Definition of religion
1 a : the state of a religious a nun in her 20th year of religion
b (1) : the service and worship of God or the supernatural (2) : commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance
2 : a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices
3 archaic : scrupulous conformity : conscientiousness
4 : a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith

       This does a better job explaining why and how we perceived people looking at us.  But if you don't believe me go to a ball game and bring binoculars.  Stare at someone straight ahead of you but far away through the binoculars.  I'm guessing God won't let him know you are looking at him.

      <p>
       I think you have to shed the most obvious conspiracies first to be taken seriously.  Organized religions are some of the most blatant conspiracies around.  Worship reason and logic.  Reason and logic still command you to be a good person for the sake of your species and even yourself.  Hurting others might cause harm to fall back on you.  You don't need to reward people for being gullible by giving them religion.

       <em>

       Satanism is about worshipping oneself, or man in general as god.
Period.
Regardless of whether you believe in god or satan or not, you believe in yourselves and your will.
Some don't take that to the extreme and fuck people over, but at the end of the day it is still worshipping the creation rather than the creator.
Not saying its a dude in the clouds, or anything like what most people who don't even have a grasp as to what a higher power/consciousness is, just saying that Satanism is worshipping oneself.

       Religion is a dangerous conspiracy. It rewards it's followers for failing to think critically.  What evidence is there of Jesus being immaculately conceived? None.  Yet we tell millions of children to take him at his word?  This is how you prep people for brainwashing.  Teach them at a young age not to ask questions.  Don't question fanciful tales.  It's too bad we can't be like Scandinavia and worship reason and logic.  If society was set up like that, more people would question politicians instead of just assuming they are good, like minded, faithful Christians.

       I was an atheist for a long time , conspiracy actually was perhaps what broke down the atheism , because it cast gigantic doubts on scientific credibility at all scales.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example the removal of certain aspects of Maxwell's quaternion physics equations which fixes gigantic holes in modern physics ( when Maxwell's equations were converted to their vector equivalents for speedy use , they dropped a dimension , and quaternion math is hard )
      </p>
      <p>
       Wilhelm Reich 's research into health as it relates to Orgone energy \ dorgone energy , which eventually resulted in his lab being torn down, his works  and devices being banned and burned across multiple states, his eventual jailing under a secret court ruling, and death 6 months later in prison
      </p>
      <p>
       I could to on all say about suppressed\ignores scientists ,  but I won't , point being they all have a theme , and that is that their science proves the inherent oneness or the universe, the interconnectedness of it all , the feedback and feedforward systems all come together to prove a unifying spirit, I don't call it a god, it's a force and we are all part of it . Nassim haramein's unified space memory network paper explains it well in modern physics terms , but that same truth litters history in hermetic texts, Rosicrucian texts , kabbalistic , Sufi, esoteric Christians, daoism, Freemasonry , etc. They all also have another trait in common, they recognize a greater energy body , typically untapped

       " • In the Judeo-Christian tradition it is called “the resurrection body” and “the glorified body.” The prophet Isaiah said, “The dead shall live, their bodies shall rise.” St. Paul also called it “the celestial body” or “spiritual body.” • In Sufism it is called “the most sacred body” and “supracelestial body.” • In Taoism it is called “the diamond body” and those who have attained it are called “the immortals” and “the cloudwalkers.” • In Tibetan Buddhism it is called “the light body.” • In Rosicrucianism it is called “the diamond body of the temple of God.” • In some mystery schools it is called “the solar body.” • In Tantrism and various yogas it is called the “the vajra body,” “the adamantine body” and “the divine body.” • In Vedanta it is called “the superconductive body.” • In Kriya yoga it is called “the body of bliss.” • In Gnosticism and Neoplatonism it is called “the radiant body.” • In the alchemical tradition, the Emerald Tablet calls it “the Glory of the Whole Universe” and the “golden body.” The alchemist Paracelsus called it “the astral body.” • In ancient Egypt it was called “the luminous body or being.” • In Old Persia it was called “the indwelling divine potential.” • In the Mithraic liturgy it was called “the perfect body.” • In the philosophy of Sri Aurobindo it is called “the divine body” composed of supramental substance. As I see it, these are different terms for the same condition, what is certainly the ultimate stage of human evolution—the condition in which a human being, by a combination of personal effort and divine grace, attains a deathless condition through the transubstantiation or alchemical transmutation of the ordinary fleshly body."

       The world is ripe with good stuff on this if one is so inclined to look! Law or one is a good start, perennial philosophy by Aldous Huxley also , the vedic texts , the Bhagavad-Gita  probably being the simplest, Christian mystics like st Thomas ,  suppressed Christian texts like the nag hammadii , daoist stuff as well , what's your flavour?

       You are right in some kind of way but in my opinion, religion itself is missunderstood. 
As i understand it, the world religions were founded in different places on earth in order to build the christ-conscioussness-grid around the earth. They are similar but developed differently. The aim was to unite humanity not divide it. I think believing should be seen different from „believing in xy-god“ it is moreover an active act in your mind, and if everyone combines their spiritual force, everyone can ascend, otherwise its pretty hard.

       I think there's a pretty diverse world of opinion in the conspiracy community. That being said I do find the percentage of "religious" people, in this thread particularly, is higher than the average in the United Sates. Do you not believe that there exists a power structure that worships the devil? Only a tiny bit of research would allow you to know that Freemasonry is Luciferian worship and every president we have has been one. Look of the original 007, John Dee, and tell me what you think about his crazy research.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was born and raised agnostic but it was through my research into conspiracies that established my faith. I'd be happy to speak more if you would like but I never thought I'd be a Christian and now I don't think I'd ever go back. I think it's obvious how hard TPTB push to discredit Christianity. This, by itself, should be a strong enough argument to at least look into it before completely disregarding it.

       I personally have a fairly weird view on religion somewhere between athiesm and deism.  I'm not hostile to religion, but I'm more philosophical than spiritual.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think religion is a conspiracy, though there are quite a number of conspiracies borne out by religious institutions.  For example, the Catholic Church -- From wrongly portraying Mary Magdeline as a whore for over a thousand years, to selling indulgences, to the Knight's Templar, to their silence during the Holocaust, to Opus Dei, to the current pedophilia scandal.  And while I personally don't buy into many of the current conspiracy theories about the Jews, I'm not being honest if I didn't acknowledge that they exist.  There's also the conspiracy that a lot of the far-right evangelicals are secretly working to help speed Armageddon along.  Then Scientology is this whole other thing that I don't even want to fuck with.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, religion, overall, helps more than it hurts.  You don't hear all the stories about people who changed their lives for the better after finding religion.  You don't hear about all the charity religions provide.  Hell, you don't hear about religion helping to provide us with pretty much every great soul singer who ever lived.  Thank you religion, for having a choir where Beyonce' could hone her craft and gift me her voice years later!
      </p>
      <p>
       Should, we as a species, try to grow beyond religion?  Perhaps, but would you be willing to compromise at trying to just get them to get along first?  Is the damage they've done and continue to do worth risking losing a portion of the extremely numerous good things they do?  Is it worth possibly depriving future generations of great soul singers?

       What if the church worshipped reason and logic? If it taught people to do good, not for a fictitious reward, but instead for a dopamine release that comes from helping others.  If it taught that good deeds do more often than not beget more good deeds.  That harming others is dangerous.  That humans are inherently cooperative, and violating that by doing wrong is dangerous to yourself
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a way to have all the truly good parts of religion without having to lie to people.

       Get people to study modern philosophy and psychology as opposed to myths and legends.

       Religion is holding back society while creating millions of non questioning droned.

       Spirituality and religion are two very different things.
I was an atheist for a long time, but i never denied the existance of god completely, just the definitions o god others would give me.
Just as with everything else, you have to sift through the bullshit and find your own truth.
That info exists for a reason, it has just been corrupted for the exact opposite of that said reason.
Love and truth are god. Consciousness.
They want to divide you and separate you from your connection to All that is, make you worship their false idols, and so forth. But if you look at the actual spiritual teachings, not the corrupted laws(think Jesus new testament, Buddha, The Vedas, so forth) they all speak of freedom for the soul.
Anyone that tries to tell you otherwise is full of shit, whether they mean it or not. 
You create your own reality to an extent, so if you refuse to see the truth in it, or only look for the bullshit to rub in the well meaning truth speakers faces, then you probably won't find the truth yourself.
I suggest if OP, or anyone else for that matter truly wants to know the answer to whether or not it is bullshit, is to take the time and study these religions with an open mind.
Maybe take a fat hit of DMT and then tell us there is no god. 
I hope you all find what you are seeking.

       Use Logic, Appoach with the same respect you do science.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I tell you a book is a true story, you either read it as true or fantasy
      </p>
      <p>
       If you decide you want to test it as true, then remember that its your word against a God for the time being.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for that time, do not assume anything about God too easily and most likely he's at least as smart and just as you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when something doesn't make sense, it's like math in that it will make sense once YOU gain understanding or maybe compassion, respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no shame is saying I don't know like in science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway I know the Bible is pretty boring, but so is math but we learn all of it and not parts.
