I want to use the flat earthers as the target for this discussion by interviewing some and analyzing their claims,  evidence, and logical arguments then testing them and exploring what this means when applied to our political and religious views.  To get the project off the ground the plan is to create interest and build an audience before launching a Kickstarter campaign for funding.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted about this before in some other subreddits, and I&#39;m trying to figure out who all would be interested in this project.  Let me know what you think of it or if you have any advice, and if you want to get involved you can sign up at the link.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m sure that with enough digging you could find the answer to anything about the model, but I&#39;m less interested in the belief and more interested in what drove them to believe and why they are so convinced.  I&#39;m interested in how they view the name calling and teasing, do they feel like white knights, etc.  I&#39;m also curious what evidence they would need to change their mind, and if it is even possible to hit that standard. 
 I.E. &quot;I want to see a picture of the round earth.&quot; You show a satellite photo. &quot;that&#39;s fake. NASA fakes those.&quot;  You show video from the cockpit of a U2 plane. &quot;that&#39;s a fish eye lens&quot;..... does this process have a stopping point that&#39;s reasonable?  And why is it so difficult to accept conflicting evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great question. Since the flat earth model relies on the conspiracy theory aspect to discredit conflicting evidence I want to only use expirements that the viewers can recreate themselves.  Peer review is an important process of the scientific method. I&#39;m also hoping that, when the Kickstarter launches, those involved will give suggestions on what kind of tests they would like to see.  Some that I have lined up already are:</p>

<p>Make a level platform to shine a laser across lake Powell.  Measure the height from the ground at the laser start point, and measure the height of the dot miles away. Any curvature should be apparent by the deviation of the laser.  </p>

<p>Measure the lengths of Shadows at noon, 3, and 6 on the same day of poles that are equal height from various points running north and south along the same line of longitude. The further north you go, the longer the shadow should become on a round earth.   Then use geometry to determine if the angles match the declared distances the sun is from the earth with both models. </p>

<p>Take a weight of about 1-10 kilogrammes.  Measure its weight at various degrees of latitude. The closer to the equator, the lighter it should become of the earth is spinning.  (I still have math to do on this one.  The effect is quite small and I don&#39;t know how heavy the object would need to be in order to physically measure the effect outside of the margin of error.)</p>

<p>Just recommendation here. Perform multiple iterations of this experiment. </p>

<p>Once an hour for 24 hours with information on temp, humidity, light levels etc. Refraction is a bitch and you want to be able to show how light will follow a bend. </p>

<p>Second test is a good test. How far apart will the measurements be?</p>

<p>Do it large enough (Crowdsource redditors?) and you could generate an estimate of the size of the globe</p>

<p>Third test isnt bad but its going to require very sensitive instruments. </p>

<p>You could also get or rent a theodolite for pretty cheap. </p>

<p>Measure at ground level, mountain top and if the funds are there charter a little plane and have it fly as level as possible. </p>

<p>Build your own focault would be an interesting test. One without power (The really hate the motorized ones) use the results of that to calculate your longitude. </p>

<p>I can go down to my basement, it&#39;s a flat concrete floor with one light bulb hanging from the center of the ceiling, and do this &quot;experiment&quot;.</p>

<p>I can place a stick under the light bulb, measure it&#39;s shadow length. Then move the stick a few feet away from the light bulb and measure the length of the shadow at that location. I could do this all over my basement and the further away from the bulb the longer the shadow would be. </p>

<p>Then I can punch all these shadow lengths into a computer and determine the curvature of my basement floor. Because, to repeat what you said &quot;The further north you go, the longer the shadow should become on a round earth&quot;.</p>

<p>The experiment will provide differing shadow lengths on a ball Earth with a sun 93 million miles away, or on a flat Earth with a sun that is low and directly above head. <a href="http://i39.tinypic.com/2z8x75f.gif">http://i39.tinypic.com/2z8x75f.gif</a></p>

<p>If you do this experiment assuming you are on a ball Earth and then the resulting shadow lengths are proof of the curvature then you&#39;ve just proved your cognitive biases and nothing else.</p>

<p>Are you aware of how biased you are before even starting this experiment and how ironic the above statement is on your website? You are clearly slanted against flat earthers before even starting, calling them weird (appealing to groupthink/bandwagon), appealing to authority by calling their experiments pseudoscience (mainstream science is <em>always</em> right!). By concluding that they are wrong before asking a single question, this is a glaring example of confirmation bias. You are uninterested in anything they say to convince you of the Earth&#39;s shape. You are merely running a freak show. </p>

When I use words like &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;weird&quot; I&#39;m referring to how common the belief is.  The majority of people think the earth is round.  If that is &quot;normal&quot; then I think it follows that the opposite is &quot;weird&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>A group isn&#39;t wrong <em>just</em> because they are in the minority. You&#39;re on the bandwagon. That&#39;s a bias. It&#39;s an appeal to groupthink: &quot;Most people believe Opinion A, therefore Opinion A is correct, and opinion B is incorrect.&quot;</p>

<p>Similarly, their conclusions being strange because most scientists disagree, does not make their conclusions wrong <em>just</em> because most authority figures disagree. That&#39;s an appeal to authority bias.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not coming across as a neutral 3rd party if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking to do. It appears you&#39;re setting off to show how wrong this group is without even taking a look at the opposing viewpoints with an unbiased view, or objectively trying to even see why you think they aren&#39;t correct (that the Earth isn&#39;t a globe). Your project will get a bunch of views and clicks of people who agree with you but you won&#39;t change anyone&#39;s minds. The flat earthers will look like freaks and everyone will have a good laugh, but scientifically, the results will be biased and therefore of little value. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking if you weren&#39;t careful that&#39;s how the end result would appear, ironically, if the project itself is biased. It all depends on the objectivity of the researcher. If you can see that real science is about actually challenging prior results and doing real experiments with the scientific method then you might find out that it&#39;s the flat earthers who are doing real science. You may find that it&#39;s round earth believers who are masters of memorization, and can tell you everything they&#39;ve ever read in a science book, and can quote the cosmologists all from the comfort of their armchairs while keeping their hands clean, never doing any science themselves at all. It won&#39;t be easy to show objectivity let alone keep an open mind, and I can only wish you luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, man, what are you even talking about? </p>

<p>The whole point of the experiment is to take a look at the point of view of people convinced about the flat earth theory and here you are claiming that OP isn&#39;t willing to take a look at the very same thing.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t the point to change anyone&#39;s mind and that&#39;ve been pretty clearly worded in the post.</p>

<p>&quot;<em>to explore the cognitive biases and propensity for conspiratorial thinking that leads</em> <strong>US</strong> *to believe in weird things.&quot;</p>

<p>Your comment replies feel like you wouldn&#39;t have even read the same post as I did that&#39;d suggest to me that you view it through the distortion of looking for something to be offended about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all fairness, for someone growing up with the globe earth concept, regardless of how open or closed minded he is to any other theory, the flat earth idea IS weird, just the same as for someone raised with the flat earth concept the globe earth theory would be weird.</p>

<p>At least give the guy some props for even trying to understand the perspective of others. </p>

<p>As for the tone of his post, I could easily turn this around on you and say that you&#39;re projecting your own perception of hostility on OP, because you already decided that he only wants a &quot;freak show&quot; without considering my point above about his perspective, and without actually seeing where he&#39;ll end up with the experiment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;ve been done already BTW.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember from top of my head but there is a guy on YouTube who had an outstanding reward of 5000 USD$ to anyone willing to conclusively prove that the Earth is indeed flat, preferably with measurements that can be verified by &quot;globe earthers&quot;.</p>

<p>The man usually invites anyone who&#39;d be willing to attempt this on a google hangouts session and the whole conversation is going up on YouTube afterwards and its highly entertaining to watch.</p>

<p>However usually the way it goes is flat-earthers either start cutting off the people trying to counter an argument, or saying flat out that &quot;you&#39;re wrong&quot; and consider that a valid argument for some reason, or enter into an endless personal attack toward anyone who isn&#39;t a flat earther.</p>

<p>Over the ten or so hours worth of this that I watched/listened to, I&#39;ve yet to hear any argument that&#39;d be even remotely close to something like a scientific approach.</p>

<p>(maybe its been called &quot;Red&#39;s Rhetoric&quot;? Can&#39;t search for it on mobile now but its worth a watch if you planning on interviewing anyone in this topic just to see the most common approaches)</p>

<p>Problem is with most flat earthers I&#39;ve seen so far is that either they declare you a liar spreading &quot;the official narrative&quot; or they talk to you in a condescending tone unless you blindly accept the flat earth theory without being convinced.</p>

<p>Being skeptical or unconvinced is like a sin from their point of view and it makes you the &quot;one of them&quot; kinda enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I support skepticism &#39;cause its healthy (or a better option rather than to just take the spoon-fed answers out of habit) and I&#39;m willing to follow someone down the rabbit hole just to understand the perspective they have as long as they can respect a disagreement.</p>

<p>Problem is with most flat earthers I&#39;ve seen so far is that either they declare you a liar spreading &quot;the official narrative&quot; or they talk to you in a condescending tone unless you blindly accept the flat earth theory without being convinced.</p>

<p>Being skeptical or unconvinced is like a sin from their point of view and it makes you the &quot;one of them&quot; kinda enemy.</p>

<p>The channel is called  📷</p>

<p><strong>Reds Rhetoric</strong></p>

<p>The topic there is quite often an attempt at conveying any convincing theory about flat earth or as in the case of this video attempting to counter the flat earth theory with examples and observations.</p>
