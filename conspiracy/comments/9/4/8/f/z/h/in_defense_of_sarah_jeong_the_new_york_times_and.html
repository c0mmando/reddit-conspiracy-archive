      <p>
       Yesterday, I was astonished to see the New York Times defending their new hire for their editorialist board, Sarah Jeong, who had expressed a deep-rooted hate for white people in a series of (now deleted) tweets from 2014- 2015.
       <a href="https://www.nytco.com/statements-in-response-to-criticism-of-the-hiring-of-sarah-jeong/">
        Their statement
       </a>
       , which does not actually address the tweets themselves, can be found here. (Their main argument is that Sarah Joung is in the right because her tweets are jokes and were defence against online trolls)
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look for yourself and decide whether these count as racist and whether you think this person should be writing for the NYT (Remember that these were posted after she graduated from Harvard:

      </p>
      <p>
       What happened next was a blatant attempt by the MSM to spin the mass outrage coming from all groups as an attack by right-wing trolls to get Sarah Jeong fired for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within hours of the NYTs posting their statement, a swarm of articles from MSM outlets rushed to defend Sarah Joung and portray her as a victim of a harassment campaign. The majority of these articles either did not reference the actually horrifically racist tweets, or tried to push the idea that anti-white supremacy does not exist. The more left-leaning outlets even tried to spin the controversy as an attack by the alt-right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, in the midst of the fracturing of the MSM over this issue, prominent leftist and feminist journalists expressed mass support for Sarah Jeong while completely disregarding the actual racist tweets themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not you agree with the political aspects of this controversy, and regardless of your opinion on whether or not Sarah Joung should be fired, it is important to understand the precedent being set by the NYT and all the other outlets that defended Sarah Jeong:
-You can’t be racist if you're white
-It is ok to be racist to others if get hate messages on the internet
      </p>
      <p>
       ***It is also important to note Reddit’s overwhelming disapproval of Sarah Joung and the NYT’s defense of her. The first post to r/news about this was removed in mere hours after garnering thousands of upvotes. The second post with 32,000 upvotes, and which has currently been gilded 17 times, was also locked within hours. Countless comments have been removed. It is obvious that the majority of the internet does not think Sarah Joung should be working for the NYTs, but multiple articles are claiming this is a minority group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikipedia has taken adown any reference to these tweets. The page is currently locked.
      </p>
      <p>
       REMEMBER, this has nothing to do whether you lean left or right. In my opinion, this was the most blatant attempt I have seen of the MSM attempting to push their narrative and is setting an extremely dangerous precedent. WE CANNOT LET THIS GO
      </p>
      <p>
       If we do nothing, the MSM will pretend none of this ever happened, and an open racist will be writing opinion pieces for the New York Times. I urge you all to familiarize yourselves with Sarah Joung’s tweets, and analyze how Google search results are portraying this incident.

       In their eyes she’s a victim of the same people she tweets such hateful things about. Plus she’s Asian and also a woman. Therefore she can do no wrong. That means no matter what I’m willing to bet she won’t be fired. Which is fine. I’m a conservative and I detest the idea of boycotts or whatever else people come up with to protest businesses. If the NYT want to hire her, fine. Let them keep digging their own grave. Newspapers are on their last lifeline.

       Is there a context that justifies her being racist towards white people? Or any people for that matter. What is the context for: #CancelWhitePeople
  What if it was:

      <h1>
       CancelBrownPeople

       Her being wrongly harassed doesn’t justify being racist.

       Ok ok... so she isn’t at all racist?  And she didn’t do anything wrong. And it’s ok to fight back against hate with more hate. And the media attention is all about some bad jokes she made in retaliation.

       I mean, this is 100% subjective. I'm not sure what it has to do with anything though. Should she not have a job now because 4 years ago she said 'offensive' things on twitter?

       Y'know I'd wonder who would most profit from this narrative being pushed? The same people that have been trawling tweets from 10 years ago on other people who dared not agree with dear leader?

       No but I think her defense is that she was parodying the things she was receiving?
      </p>
      <p>
       So its kind of a bad joke. I think policing old jokes on twitter is dumb. If she actually beat up a white person then Id pay attention

       I’m in agreement that she had been wrongly harassed and these tweets were her fighting back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally it feels from what I’ve seen and heard up to this point she believes that white people and men in particular are a force evil in the world.

       Has anyone asked her today if that is what she believes? I'm not interested in reading old jokes. She should do a 2 hour podcast with someone who is intellectually honest and curious and explain her feelings on race or white people or whatever, and be pressed on it a little bit.

       With the response to this going viral she retweeted 2 tweets that were from other people calling her a lesbian and a gook. I’m sure there were more. As I said in a different response fighting hate with hate isn’t justified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outside of the Internet has she suffered at the hands of white people? Or the patriarchy? She probably think she has but what’s the reality?

       All I have seen is a dozen or so absolutely horrific and racist tweets posted by her and 2 tweets from censored (could be her account for all we know) accounts.  Why in the ever loving fuck could you accept that as a defense?  How?  Just...

       True enough. I don’t know the source or if Miss Jeong has ever been really harassed online.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is anyone here surprised that the liberal New York Times hired a white hating Asian woman? What is the end goal of this outrage? If she gets fired I’m sure without a doubt they have stacks of resumes from those cut from the same cloth.

       Law enforcement is made up of people, many of which are happy to operate along the lines of tribalism of people that look similar or different to themselves. Rich and middle class black people still get pulled over way more often than their white/asian counterparts
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont know if I would call this 'Racial division' tactic (which I agree exists) a MSM one. I think its a political one. For one, because NONmainstream info sources are much more racially focused on difference and separation(stormfront, breitbart), and 2 because I think the political teams have staked out different sides just to cloak the fact that they are in it for self enrichment and entrenchment of power

       They weren't asking for or expecting to vote in those days.  Also it was assumed they would just vote as their husbands did.  Given society's structure it did not disadvantage them, men and women were considered a unit, not one seeking "men's" issues and another seeking "women's" issues

       Not so much unworthy as unnecessary.  Like many things it was accepted as a man's role.  Just like how men were senators, presidents, generals, mayors etc and that was accepted as the way things were.  It wasn't systematic oppression as your SJW professors may have told you

       After men (the minority) voted to GIVE them the vote.  Of course, they still never had to uphold the same civic duties that are placed on men for the privilege of voting.  If you think being

       </strong>

       I’m meaning like those organized boycotts. If you don’t want to shop at or buy a certain companies product because of a decision they have made that’s fine. But when it becomes like a rallying cry I become disconnected. For example, Chick-Fil-A. If people don’t like the fact they are a Christian based and operated business then they don’t have to go there.  But when so called leaders call for a nation wide boycott against them because of what they stand for then they lose me. I have no problem with people individually choosing not to go to Chick-fil-a if they are honestly bothered by something. Just the idea of organized boycotts seem like a pointless gesture. It’s that group think mentally that bugs me.

       You shouldn't be. That's how the market is used to affect change in lieu of government regulation. Like right now, people should be boycotting Facebook (and others). That's a great solution to the problem of data mining and mass surveillance, and it's the conservative solution.

       The conservative solution would not be requesting further regulation. Conservative is for smaller government. Boycotts are fine, but we dont need further government intervention. Its the free market. The boycott is there to send a message to that company that they will change or consumers will go elsewhere. Government regulations will only stifle innovation and investment. As for the facebook boycott... I think you might find FB is just a part of the government's surveillance network anyway. Look at the DARPA lifelog / facebook link.

       Why is this a surprise? It's a classic part of a liberal mindset that you cannot be racist against white people.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if you start chanting death to whites it's not your fault, you were just upset at how white people have all the power.

       There is a Canadian woman reporter and she has several youtube videos documenting their plight. Her name escapes me but I'll send you some links. It is quite a story the things they were doing to people, some had family ties to the region going back 200 years. Pillars of the community being brutilized in home invasions and the government encouraging it. A heartbreaking story but good awareness. Russia recently allowed 15,000 in, they are excellent farmers and leased them land and was a great story also did not make MSM.

       I’d like to point out that this philosophy is not “a classic part of a liberal mindset” but instead comes from extreme leftists who push the ideology of Cultural Marxism.  The large majority of the left is far more moderate and does not necessarily agree with this view.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is however being pushed into the mainstream media and online discussion by an intensely vocal minority and is a very problematic viewpoint.

       To vaguely quote stokely carmicheal: "I don't care if you hate me, that's your problem. If you have the power to hang me, that's my problem." The idea being that yes, racism is wrong, but it really matters when that racism causes harm.

       Disarming the word for a group of people will cause problems as the not so informed are empowered to express their racism. Eventually the mob mentality will take over and people will get hurt and/or killed. The word racism carries to much weight. No one wants to be called out for being racist. Call someone prejudice and it doesn't carrier the same weight.

       He's absolutely wrong. IDK when white liberals and their lackeys decided to change the definition of racism, but hating someone for the color of their skin is the text book definition of racism. Most of the racists i know (black &amp; white) are just people filled with hate and excuses for they cant find success in their pathetic lives.

       I see what you're saying and but I still don't disagree with him.
If all you heard was "black people can't be racist" then you weren't listening.

      <p>
       Can black people be racist? Sure.

       Does it change the world? Does it change anything? Has she enacted any policies made any changes to the world with her view?

       Do isolated incidents of racism change the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, absolutely not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does normalizing racism against white people, to the point that major news orgs are doing it, have an impact on the world? Yes, absolutely. You’re deluding yourself if you think that normalizing racism against whites won’t have an impact on society.

       Paul Mooney is hilarious, but of course he's racist, because he groups people and ascribes negative qualities to them according to race.  His explanation was a little silly, saying he couldn't be racist because he wasn't actively oppressing white people, giving examples of institutional racism.  The problem is that the institutions of government  now give preference to black folks, there are entire institutions geared towards punishing examples of racism, and the entire apparatus was led at the time of the interview by a black man.  Then he seems to become more racist by comparing black folks to cows, which are forever the property of a farmer, something about how a cow could never be in charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interviewer tried to point out that young people don't see themselves connected to issues like slavery and segregation, because they're not.  Mooney and others who argue about formerly oppressed minorities not being capable of racism seem to rely on the idea that they are eternal victims who can never rise up to the level of their former oppressors, despite their own success and fame, and despite having a 2 term black president.

       FBI is different than the military, different branches. I can't go to my Superiors and discuss taking down Mueller/Rosenstein/FBI, and so on. It has all be done legally within the rules/laws of gov. I will say that the top brass in the Military know there is a deep state and there are various fights, intelligence, counter intelligence, and so on between the various branches.

       And there we have the central problem with Trump and his sycophants. No, you're not supposed to lie. No, accepting support from a foreign person/organization for a campaign is not legal. And no, Hillary did not "use a foreign agent." Are you this misinformed, or are you intentionally lying?

       Veselnitskaya wasn't the double-agent. She was trying enlist one... Seriously, that's in the first paragraph of the article.

       Wow, is there anything the deep state is not? I mean, no matter who or what you are referring to, they are always deep state.  Is Michael Cohen a triple-secret deep state spook too? Or only when he flips?

       You would have to ask the DOJ why they finally relented at let her attend the Prevezon hearing. Maybe they could also tell you why the DOJ settled the Prevezon case shortly after Trump fired Bharara.

       If the deep state didn't think he had a chance, then why did they spend so many resources in getting all of these spies into the campaign?  By the end of Mueller's investigation, you'll be claiming that everyone who isn't Donald Trump is deep state. =/

       I'm glad you were just bullshitting about being highly ranked in the military. If you were an accurate representation of the minds in the US military, I would be worried about us nuking ourselves.

       Hilary used a British MI6 ex-British spy, and is off the hook, so as of now its legal unless she goes down. But the Trumps didnt get anything from the Deep State spies they sent to them.

       You should be worried that you actually believe the lying liberal media narratives. The majority of the military knows about the deep state and there are plans in place to beat them at their own game. If there is a Coup done by the Deep State, we already have plans in place to take them all out and they are massively outnumbered, plus we have the NSA on our side. But they stull used encrypted devices to skirt it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really just look at Strzok's texts, that shows you who's side they are on, their own, and their systems of money laundering, secret banking, drug running, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not going to Nuke ourselves, but there are Deepstate agents that want trump assassinated and a few attempts you're not seeing in the news or will ever hear about, already were skirted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deepstate hates you, wants you enslaved, owns the media narratives, and does not follow the constitution. That should make you really scared

       Again, go ahead and ask the DOJ why they approved the visa. See if it contains the word "Prevezon" or not.

       Trump had agreed to let Bharara stay on to complete the cases he was on. But then he suddenly got let go and the DOJ cut a deal with Prevezon that was so sweet even their lawyers said they were surprised by it.

You really think Cohen doesn't have evidence against Trump? Oh boy, I wish I could see your face when all the info is released. Just try to remember, we all tried to warn you about Trump. We are not the ones you should be mad at.

       No, just Russian spies. Like Butina as well. So many Russian spies with connections to Trump... I wonder why.

       Riiiiiiight. And Trump isn't a criminal.

       Do yourself a favor and stop listening to Fox. Then, start actually looking at the chain of events with an unbiased attitude. Actually follow what happened, where it happened, who was involved, and what the response to it was. If you actually researched this, you would be calling for Trump's impeachment.
      </p>
      <p>
       More important that Strzok's texts, look at his actions. Why is it that you value words more than the actual actions taken by an individual? I mean, that's the only way you could possibly believe Trump is on your side. You only care about what is said, and not what is done.

       Prevezon doesn't matter. Meeting with this Lawyer who possibly did have opposition research, isn't illegal, and the Prevezon case already shows that she may already have been spooked out to Deep State, the proof being her meeting with Fusion GPS just before and right after the meeting with Junior

       The Trump tower meeting is nothing. There is literally Zero laws that make it illegal to meet with a foreign attorney to discuss opposition research, which in this case was sent there by FusionGPS/Deeptate. This is literally a massive nothingburger and absolutely nothing will come of this except proving she's an agent or double agent. Keep trying though

       I never said Steele wasn't foreign. But he wasn't hired by the DNC, FusionGPS was hired. Also,
       <em>
        hired
       </em>
       . They hired oppo research and properly reported it in their finances, as opposed to a foreign government "offering" dirt and the meeting not being reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who did the DNC hire? Let's see if you can answer this one, basic, question. Who was it that was hired?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're half right. Prevezon wasn't really important. It was just her cover to get into the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a difference between seeking out oppo research, and dirt being offered. And if this was legal or above board, why would Trump repeatedly lie about it? Seriously, if it was as unimportant as you claim it is, then why wasn't the initial response, "yes we had a meeting with a Russian lawyer had offered dirt on Hillary. We didn't report this to the FBI like we were supposed to because there was no substance to it." ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know where I am. I also know how very idiotic the "deep state" theory is. It's a go-to for the lazy or those trying to hide the truth. Like when ancient cultures dreamed up gods to explain things they didn't understand, and those gods we're then used to control the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're saying that Preet was preventing the DOJ from accepting a bribe, so they had to get rid of him so they could be corrupt?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who was involved in making many of those real estate "deals"? Cohen. He was probably the one handling all of Trump's illegal deals, not just the illegal payoffs.
      </p>
      <p>
       You mean treasury admin met with the representative of the Russian central bank?! Wow, it's almost as if that may have been related to their job...
      </p>
      <p>
       Ah, so you've got the inside scoop, you know all the deets, and you're an intel pro. Got it. ;)
Getting all of your info straight from the source! ...and podcasts/YouTube &gt;.&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait, so Trump is a Clinton plant, so it's all Hillary's fault he is president, so even when it turns out that he is a criminal it will still be Hillary's fault?  Lol
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you seriously more concerned with what was said than what was done? Give one reason why, if Strozk's goal was to destroy/sabotage/prevent the Trump presidency, did he not leak that Trump was being investigated by the FBI?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hi, are you just now joining the conversation? Have you not read the past several comments?
      </p>
      <p>
       But if my only source of news is CNN, how would I have known about the Guardian story? And do you really think the SS wouldn't put out a presser to try and save face after they are embarrassed?

       And this where I leave. The whole "deep state doesnt exist and is just an excuse of the right" is a fabricated CNN and Deep State narrative, and you got played + I know you didnt read those deep state links/books I linked you that proves they exist 100% beyond all doubt, as factual truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So since you are choosing to ignore sources, truth, facts, books, etc, and instead, consciously choosing a fake propaganda narrative, there is no point in discussing anymore because nothing I tell you or link you, will ever break through, through the cognitive dissonance you've chosen to believe from propaganda outlets
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, here is proof of FBI paying Fusion GPS and the Clinton connection, just came out yesterday while you were busy choosing to ignore all factual evidence:

       Let’s be honest it does not matter who they put up as a front be it Hillary trump or any number of people the people who really run the show will always remain behind the curtain. However after seeing the hatred and arrogance of Reddit’s dems I surely hope he get elected again just to piss them off it’s nothibg less than they deserve. Maybe then they will forsake the system and we can finally revolt

       The message has changed over the past decade. What began as “were all one race, the human race” has now become “oppressor race vs oppressed races.” The dems stirred this pot as a way to secure minority votes, and now it’s created a dangerous division. Like many white people, im pretty fucking sick of being blamed for the problems of “white privilege” for simply existing. I’m not a racist, I believe all people are equal, however I’m not going to give away my place for someone else out of some kind of ancestral guilt.

       Wait so your comparing President Trump's defense of our flag and national anthem to the rampant free speech suppression on college campuses all across the US?

      <p>
       The players are employees of the NFL, the NFL has a policy that requires players to stand during the national anthem as a sign of respect, some players disregarded that policy and they are now unemployed, justifiably so.

       Trump is the president, he cannot try to limit speech, its in the 1st amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I agree that the NFL, as a private organization can set its own rules and set its own penalties for the broken rules. But the president should not get involved with that because then he would be violating the 1st amendment.

       No that's not suppression of free speech.  An example of suppression of free speech is what happened to Ben Shapiro and the myriad of other conservative speakers, banned from college campuses after being invited.
      </p>
      <p>
       President Trump for involved solely for political reasons, he knew that this was winning issue for him since the majority of Americans respect the flag and national anthem.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did the government abuse it's powers?
Did Trump create a law that forces people to stand up to the national anthem?
      </p>
      <p>
       The NFL is a private organization which has its own policies. Players are allowed to protest, but if they do they would receive a penalty. 
Players have a right to protest but outside the forum of the NFL. People have the right to criticize them. I don't know if you're aware but the President also has the right to free speech and he has the unequivocal right to denounce people that are disrespecting our flag and national anthem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also argue as to what these people are protesting about. Police involved shootings of black men? I bet they don't know that more white people are shot and killed by the police than black people. In fact, black and black homicide are way higher than white on black homicides. If that's the essence of their protest, than they are just deceiving people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm working for a private cooperation and I don't like the way they run things, I can't just go and espouse my displeasure with impunity, I will most likely be fired. If that's the case did they violate my first amendment right to free speech??

       dissent will always be far more patriotic than forcing people to stand during the national anthem.  kneeling for the flag isnt disrespectful to begin with, you see many images of soldiers kneeling for the flag to honor those killed in time of war.  kneeling in of itself is a display of respect and humility.
      </p>

       whats treasonous is to say that dissent is unpatriotic,  you specifically are a traitor to the ideals the united states was founded on.

       So you're comparing soldiers who risk their lives for this country and who for the most part get treated like shit to NFL players who get paid millions and are treated like kings for literally trying to catch, throw a football?
      </p>
      <p>
       Dissent isn't unpatriotic, but the NFL (since it's a private organization) can force it's players to stand and If not they get penalized. You really think the NFL is a public organization?

       there are no second class citizens, im absolutely comparing an nfl player to a soldier...we are all americans, anyone who doesnt believe that doesnt deserve to live in the untied states of america.

       the nfls rules are not the issue, whats the issue is that the president of the untied states of america broke a federal law.

      <p>
       members of the executive and congress cant call for someone to be fired from their job at the nfl.  its unamerican and more to point treasonous to the very founding principles our country was based off of, to use the office of the president to threaten someones job because they dont like their display of politcal dissent.

       So does the NFL have the right to "fire" a player who "dissents."?

       the nfl has the right to fire anyone, they may not have the right to force someone to stand for the national anthem, and they may get sued for any reason.  the issue was never about what the nfl can or cannot do.
      </p>
      <p>
       its hilarious that you seem to think thats the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       the issue is what the president and members of congress can and cannot do.  the president can not call for an nfl player to be fired over political dissent.
      </p>
      <p>
       but i get it, you support treason and tyranny, and are having a hard time grappling with a defense of your position.

       No the NFL can't get sued, since there  policy is to stand up for the national anthem. NFL is merely adhering to its own policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       No I support a tradition that has been around for centuries and respect our country and our flag. If your ever attend a  sporting event, don't stand up for the national anthem, you'll feel like a moron.

       lol of course the nfl can get sued, it doesnt matter what their policy is or isnt.  you can sue your employer for any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       the nfl only took action because the president made it an issue, not because their policy was broken.
      </p>
      <p>
       you support the president threatening someones job over politicsl dissent.  thats very different than your personal choice to sit, stand, or kneel durring the anthem.

       you support tyranny and treason...thats what you support.

       This so much. I dont really love it when lefty SJWs do it (unless it is about ACTIONS, not bad jokes on twitter.

You are just a pathetic partisan hack at that point who does not have the best interests of people in mind.

       I can see where you're coming from. I guess the biggest difference, for me at least, is that she is on the editorial board for TNYT. Someone tasked with that kind of responsibility, should probably not be incredibly racist. TNYT is supposed to be run by journalists, ideally people that pursue the truth whole heartedly, trying to free themselves from biases on a personal level, as well as on a professional level. A racist doesn't really meet those requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's contrast that with say, Roseanne. She's a professional comedian. Her responsibility is to make people laugh by illuminating entertaining attributes of the human experience. That's almost always offensive. Roseanne can make a joke about how children with cancer need to die to improve the gene pool, and it's okay. It's a fucking joke. It doesn't have to be true. In fact, for really offensive jokes, it's better if it's not true, and incredibly hyperbolic. That's kind of how comedy works.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying Roseanne should have kept her job, she made some really fucked up, racist comments on twitter, and even though she's a comedian, the context of those tweets seemed pretty serious. Giving her a pass is kind of dancing around the truth of what she was saying, of what the context of her communications appeared to reveal about her intent, which was to involve the race of someone she was criticizing as a criticism, a genuine criticism. That's not okay. Maybe a really edgy black comedian could get away with the kind of humor she was getting at, if it was done correctly, and they had a reputation of just not giving a fuck, but it's definitely not okay for Roseanne to say these things. We don't want that kind of distasteful, tact-less humor in our media. I'm not an SJW, and I don't think that stance is in any way "left leaning". It's just, pretty true. Some anonymous edgy meme account, with no personality attached to it, could get away with it. That's fine. Someone making a reboot of a syndicated sitcom reaching millions of viewers? Not so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALL that said, I have
       <strong>
        more
       </strong>
       reason to come down on Sarah. What she has said was
       <strong>
        FAR WORSE
       </strong>
       , and she has a
       <strong>
        FAR MORE
       </strong>
       significant responsibility than Roseanne.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that clears things up for you, where a moderate is coming from on this. I get your criticisms of the right. They definitely haven't thought this shit through. Ideology is driving people kind of crazy, enraging people, until they can't even see the other side of America anymore.

       I mean, it's funny because in my highlighted posts here you can see the beginnings of an actual journalist. She had moral outrage due to news stories, and wrote about it. She just did it immaturely.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was 4 years ago. She hasn't continued writing like that, she hasn't continued being childish.
       <br/>
       That's what makes it acceptable as a journalist.

       She clearly grew as a person.

        We don't know what either of those guys said (because they've been suspended :hmm:) that she's responding to but it's clearly being sarcastic, and how in any way can this be offensive? Her plan was to make white people stop breeding... by....? Lets just move on, she has more controversial tweets.

       That's fair. It's less clear without those other comments, but yeah, you're reasonably left to conclude that she is being sarcastic here, I agree. Good point for this one.

       That doesn't make her comment not racist. Imagine, just imagine, if I said, "Are asian people genetically predisposed to having small pensises, such that they are only fit to be cuckholded into extinction?" and I was later hired as a journalist, working on the editorial board of The New York Times. Do you think I'd still have a job? She was what...25, 26 years old at the time? A Harvard graduate? I'm surprised wherever she was working at the time, she wasn't fired right then. It doesn't matter if she was being a troll, she felt it was somehow acceptable to make this public. She's not a comedian. She's a journalist. If she made these comments in private, I'd say fuck off, she's human. She didn't make them in private, and that reflects some deeply held racist beliefs. I'm not saying she is a bad person for making the comments at all, I'm saying she's racist for making the comments public and associating them with her persona, by assuming that it is in some way acceptable to make these racist comments as a journalist, publicly.

       No, she didn't just do it immaturely, she did it unprofessionally, in a racist manner, by assuming that this would somehow be acceptable. This is not what a journalist does. Maybe by today's standards of journalism, which throws journalism as a profession completely out the window, but not what we should accept as Journalism. TNYT's acceptance and defense of this just further drives that point home.

       I'm not saying she hasn't, but I don't want her on TNYT's editorial board until she redeems herself. She should get fired, black listed by MSM outlets, and learn from her mistakes. 10 years of climbing back up the rungs of success. That's what needs to happen to prove she has grown as a person.

       Is that even relevant? Pinning the ridiculousness of the fact that the case went to the Supreme court on "white people being bullshit" is racist. If OJ's trial did go the the supreme court, that would not make saying "black people are bullshit" okay. In fact, OJ won the case. That's insane. That doesn't make "black people bullshit". It's racist, period.

       This is not meant to be a moral judgement, just what I think will happen, because it has happened before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're looking at it with our current morality. History is not like this. We don't observe the past and make moral judgement (usually) unless these people want to resurrect that kind of life style. For example, everyone can agree, almost all the greats form history were immoral and would be appalling to see in the modern era. But we remember them as the Greats for their deeds, not for their morality. If some one actually tried to resurrect the mongol Empire, we would find them evil. However, Genghis Khan is recognized as a great man. (Great in the achievement, not morality).

       Napoleon lost his bid for dominion over Europe, but he has an entire age named after him and is regarded as one of the greatest historical figures ever. Because while he was defeated, the things he achieved in his life had lasting effects on the course of history, and the odds were so heavily stacked against him, it shouldn't of been possible, but he made it so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler is much in the same. A homeless man who goes from nothing, to on the verge of establishing a new world order. While he is morally bankrupt, in both his ideology and designs, no one can doubt the achievement of going from nothing, to the brink of a world order, led by him.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we grow ever more distant from WW2, figures from it will be remembered as "great" not out of morality, but achievement. Right now there are still many who were there, and directly effected by it, it is still hot within our emotions, and the ideas Nazism created were never defeated, they died in the battlefield, but we did not watch them stumble, fail, and collapse on their own merits, much like we did Communism, and this is why they will be appealing to some.

       White insecurity? I agree. How are people so worked up about this columnist no one has ever heard of? How come white people get so angry at kneeling football players instead of supporting them? This isn’t a fight against racism, it’s white insecurity.

       For the record she should be fired, at the very least anyone in journalism should be smart enough to know social media is a permanent public record now and what she did is gross negligence even before the blatant racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day ask why you are mad over this? Is it because someone was mean to white people, or you don’t see the irony that the advantages of being white are shrinking and you just don’t like it?

       Airing out peoples past transgressions is in the culture right now. Its being done by both sides. The fake outrage has been brewing for a while and seems to be boiling over.

       I think most smart people are already there. The problem is the populist people on twitter still seem to think its legitimate to make the defining feature of an individual their race or sexuality or gender or whatever

       "  I remember when I was with Special Forces. Seems a thousand centuries ago. We went into a camp to inoculate the children. We left the camp after we had inoculated the children for Polio, and this old man came running after us, and he was crying. He couldn't see. We went back there, and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm. There they were in a pile. A pile of little arms. And I remember ... I ... I ... I cried. I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out. I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it. I never want to forget. And then I realized ... like I was shot ... like I was shot with a diamond ... a diamond bullet right through my forehead. And I thought: My God ... the genius of that. The genius. The will to do that. Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized they were stronger than we. Because they could stand that these were not monsters. These were men ... trained cadres. These men who fought with their hearts, who had families, who had children, who were filled with love ... but they had the strength ... the strength ... to do that. If I had ten divisions of those men, then our troubles here would be over very quickly. You have to have men who are moral ... and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling ... without passion ... without judgment ... without judgment. Because it's judgment that defeats us. "

       Here's the thing that people are missing, in my opinion:
      </p>
      <p>
       Who makes up the leadership of the NYT? What sorts of people have the final say in hiring someone like Jeong?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that they are a bunch of old, White men. So why would they hire someone who despises them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its because these people do not consider themselves to be White, and in fact, history shows us that they consider White people to be their greatest enemy.

       The NYT is not the supreme court. It doesn't set precedents as per its opinions. I think it's pretty damaging to start saying everything the NYT does creates a precedent, as if they, or the MSM at large, have the authority to dictate how human beings think. I get that they have a lot of influence, but maybe we should stop saying that everything they do "sets a precedent".
      </p>
      <p>
       Precedent: an earlier event or action that is regarded as an example or guide to be considered in subsequent similar circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NYT should not be used as an example to be considered in subsequent similar circumstances. They're regarded as a prestigious news organization, true, but I think it's high time we stop caring about what they publish and what their editors think. That's the precedent we need to set as a society. They're just not relevant anymore, or at least they really shouldn't be.

       That's false. She was not replying to someone attacking her. Don't believe me just look at the tweets they were all parent tweets. It was her just claiming that she experienced racism before so she deserves to spew vile hatred.

       All of your questions center around the same premise that we disagree on. You claim her tweets came out of nowhere and she wasn't provoked, I claim she was indeed provoked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could ask you the question of why you are so sure she wasn't provoked? You didn't even know she existed until this week and yet you've convinced yourself she was never harassed online at any time before 2013. Have you looked into her past?
      </p>
      <p>
       A google search shows she has a strong journalistic focus on online harassment. She even wrote an entire book about it. So regardless or not if she was directly provoked she's really speaking against the entire scourge of alt-right trolling in general. Again, I think it's an inappropriate way to go about it, but her intent was not to incite racism against white people, it was to try to counter-troll. This is obvious if you are familiar at all with her work as a journalist.

       Please read back to me wherever I said this. It looks like you're constructing a strawman rather than addressing what I say, because I've made no claims, other than that I don't find that her statements passed as satire.

      <p>
       I'm aware of the book she wrote, and it has absolutely no connection the the hate speech regularly employed on her personal account. As for this crusade that you feel she is waging, it's looking to me more like a case of the Shirky Principle in action:

       How does that Shriky quote apply here? This is one woman, not an institution. This relates to a point I was trying to make earlier. You're blowing all this out of proportion. You're speaking so grandiloquently like you have this all figured out and know all about this woman you've never met. You speak of the 'Shirky Principle' like it's an actual thing, it's not. You're taking a quote way to seriously and trying to make it into a universal truth. Try as hard as you can but you can't draw a line from some vague idea of a liberal conspiracy against all white people and some tweets this one Asian chick made.

       I think you actually
       <em>
        want

       her to be racist against white people, because that would prove something to you. It would validate your worldview, and there is so little evidence in the world to indicate there is a conspiracy against whites by the 'elite' or 'deep state' or whatever the fuck else you jump on stuff like Sarah Jeoung's tweets  and make such a big deal out of it.

       The chronology of the tweets as well as the fact they are parent tweets contradicts the claim that these were supposed to be direct retaliation to harassers.

       The NYT started pushing this anti-white narrative when Obama was in office. Liberal media has made white hate trendy. Most people protesting for DACA and BLM are white. Publicly declaring hatred for your own race is now seen by leftists as a virtuous and selfless act. It's perverse narcissism at best, and plays to the mentality of perpetual victim-hood.

       Same old story.  Some retarded, dangerous idea becomes an academic fad, and
       <em>
        20 fucking years later
       </em>
       it finally makes it out to the normies so people can be outraged about it.  Meanwhile, 'only white people can be racist' is so establishment in lefty academic circles that they don't even understand why people are objecting.   To them it's like we all started raging about the heliocentric model of the solar system.

       I'm just looking at this from a boardroom perspective. This very public company didn't respond in the way one might expect. There must be a reason they didn't distance themselves from Jeong reflexively, and it's definitely NOT because their viewing audience is composed mainly of rabidly racist Asians. This is our culture being purposely manipulated through media.

       the NYT can do whatever the fuck they want. Donald Trump can call Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas but no one does anything about it because white Americans killed all of the Native Americans 200 years ago. Donald Trump can also claim Lebron is not intelligent to thousands of people over twitter and won't get impeached because of it.
