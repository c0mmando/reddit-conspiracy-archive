What do you get?</p>

<p>Here is a list of the top results from the first page (in order): </p>

<p>A link to <a href="/r/actualconspiracies">/r/actualconspiracies</a> (a low traffic controlled opposition sub that sources pretty much solely MSM articles)</p>

<p>A link to <a href="/r/ConspiracyMemes">/r/ConspiracyMemes</a> </p>

<p>A link to &quot;<a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Reddit#.2Fr.2Fconspiracy">RationalWiki</a>&quot; about r/conspiracy, which hilariously reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The front page of paranoia on the Internet. Run by a white supremacist moderator who worships Timothy McVeigh, they made Hitler Did Nothing Wrong their official documentary long before Trump ever considered running for president. Theories discussed here run the gamut from 9/11 to chemtrails to lizard people. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has a large subscription base but is considered by many to be the laughingstock of the site, with regulars routinely accusing anyone who disrupts their echo chamber of panicking of being a &quot;shill&quot; or an evil impostor working for the government/Jewish overlords/reptilians. Despite being presented as an open forum and &quot;thinking ground&quot; which &quot;respects people of all religions and creeds,&quot; we dare you try to question prolific appearances of Anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and Alex Jones. Lastly, anytime a mass shooting or a terrorist attack or anything horrible where many people die or are injured, it is automatically considered a false flag perpetrated by the United States government. No exceptions. </p>

<p>Many <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regulars actually believe that most of Reddit is paid government employees watching them (and yet they still go there - which might prove there is a genuine need for it and/or it is simply addictive). Due to the insanity and hostility of the subreddit, other subreddits such as <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and <a href="/r/actualconspiracies">/r/actualconspiracies</a> have been set up to take a slightly more rational approach to conspiracy discussion. People who are interested in woo but not politics, meanwhile, have mostly fled to <a href="/r/ConspiracyII">/r/ConspiracyII</a>. </p>

<p>In September of 2014, the subreddit showed how anti-Semitic it really is by posting the documentary Hitler: The Greatest Story Never Told in their sidebar (which included a big picture of Hitler&#39;s face). The move caused major controversy and was heavily panned by <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a>.[33] Despite everything (though it shouldn&#39;t be any surprise), the documentary stayed up, and anyone who didn&#39;t like it were deemed Zionist Shills. </p>

<p>It is regularly featured on r/TopMindsOfReddit, another watchdog sub. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/06/politics/trump-fbi-texts-conspiracy-theory/index.html">CNN article</a> about conspiracy theorists and Trump, which oddly enough doesn&#39;t even mention this sub once.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/reddit-conspiracy-theorist-study/">Wired article</a> titled &quot;Here&#39;s One Way to Reform an Internet Conspiracy Theorist&quot;, which warns that beliving in ANY CONSPIRACY THEORIES at all means you&#39;re &quot;a short walk from false flags to &quot;crisis actors&quot;—and from there, Pizzagate and full-on Alex Jones-ville aren&#39;t far behind.&quot;</p>

<p>A link to this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversial_Reddit_communities">Controversial Reddit communities</a>  Wikipedia page.</p>

<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/youtube-search-results-list-celebrities-hijacked-conspiracy-theorists-n895926">this NBC News</a> article discrediting all claims of pedophilia in Hollywood, advocating YouTube further censor it&#39;s search results (ironic considering the entire topic of this OP), and again shits on Qanon for some reason.</p>

<p>Now, if you type in the words &quot;reddit ______&quot; with any sub or topic, that will be the first result every single time. Except for r/conspiracy. Hell, even typing &quot;reddit donald&quot; or &quot;reddit greatawakening&quot; will give you those subs as the top result, so it&#39;s not a matter of hiding &quot;right wing&quot; or fake news content. Does anyone know if Google does this with any other sub?</p>

<p>They are hiding r/conspiracy because we are often right above the targets that no one else is talking about. Topics that the both the left AND right media mutually agree to ignore. Despite reddit&#39;s best efforts to disrupt this sub with constant brigading and trolling, we continue to be a thorn in the side of people that want things hidden from the public eye.</p>

<p>Keep fighting everyone. We&#39;re obviously doing something right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Are you logged into a google account?</p>

<p>I will say, I&#39;m a little suspicious of your screen shot, as I did this search every way possible (Chrome, IE, Incognito, VPN, etc.) and got the same results each time.</p>

<p>But if you type in, just for example, &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=reddit+conspiracy+thread&amp;amp;oq=reddit+conspiracy+thread&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.3983j0j1&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">reddit conspiracy thread</a>&quot;, then r/conspiracy shows up as the second result. Which would make your screenshot extremely simple to fake by just typing that and then deleting the word &quot;thread&quot; before taking a screen shot.</p>

<p>Just saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not necessarily saying you faked it, I&#39;m just saying it would be insanely simple to do so.</p>

<p>I could have something to do with being logged into a google account. Kinda like how you have to be logged into YouTube to view content in &quot;restricted mode&quot;.</p>

<p>One thing that I noticed thanks to your post though, is the strange behavior of Google&#39;s URLs for search result pages.</p>

<p>When I click the link in my above reply to you for &quot;reddit conspiracy thread&quot;, r/conspiracy no longer appears as the 2nd result, and it takes me to the URL:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=gCRjW8D7ApD45gKis5GwDw&amp;amp;q=reddit+conspiracy+thread&amp;amp;oq=reddit+conspiracy+thread&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...1247.1247.0.1381.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.yV5q8Mamrn0">https://www.google.com/search?ei=gCRjW8D7ApD45gKis5GwDw&amp;amp;q=reddit+conspiracy+thread&amp;amp;oq=reddit+conspiracy+thread&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...1247.1247.0.1381.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.yV5q8Mamrn0</a></p>

<p>But then when I add an S, r/conspiracy shows up as the #1 result... and then when I delete the S and search <em>again</em> r/conspiracy shows up again!? Clearly they are fucking with the algorithim to specifically hide  the URL <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/</a></p>

<p>Personally, I dgaf what your beliefs are, as long as you&#39;re polite and courteous to other users here. <em>Especially</em> ones you disagree with. That&#39;s far and away the biggest tell of shills. And they can&#39;t do anything about it, because that would only lead to actual discussions, of which they don&#39;t want! So snark and vitriol are all they&#39;ve really got. And when they still get massively upvoted, everything below just gets buried.</p>

<p>Absolutely. They love to project, and its why the shills claim that those who disagree with them are Russians.</p>

<p>Good catch! I&#39;m not very familiar with Godlike productions really... although now I think maybe I should be haha.</p>

<p>I guess my real problem with them manipulating their results like that is because of course I know where this place is and how to find it, it&#39;s the people that <em>don&#39;t</em> know where it is or how to find it. People that <em>aren&#39;t</em> familiar enough with reddit to know what r/ means. People that have heard from friends or random other people to check out &quot;reddit conspiracy&quot;. <em>Those</em> are the people google is trying to keep this place from.</p>

<p>Won&#39;t be surprised if it doesn&#39;t even show up when searching reddit itself soon.</p>

<p>Do not read Wikileaks! We on CNN will tell you everything you need to know!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the point at all. Please explain to me why &quot;r conspiracy&quot; gives you the correct result, but &quot;reddit conspiracy&quot; doesn&#39;t? Them removing the most relevant search result from the most common search term is indeed, 100%, a conspiracy.</p>
