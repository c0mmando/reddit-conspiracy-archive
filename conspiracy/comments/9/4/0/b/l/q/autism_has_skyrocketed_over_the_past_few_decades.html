<p>As stated by  one mom: <strong>&quot;In this country, we&#39;re indoctrinated to  believe in vaccines, and believe there&#39;s this incredibly impeccable science behind them. [But] once you start the investigation and you  realize how flimsy the evidence is, for safety in particular</strong> … that&#39;s  when you realize how little of this is based on fact.&quot; On its website, &quot;The Greater Good&quot; team notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;In the early 2000s, CDC instructed vaccine makers to remove the  mercury preservative in childhood shots. But as the mercury was being phased out of most childhood vaccinations, CDC  recommended that pregnant women and infants at 6 months and again 7 months receive the  flu shot — which they knew still contained mercury.</em>   </p>

<p><em>In addition to the flu shot, CDC began recommending that pregnant women also receive the Tdap vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus, and attenuated pertussis). So, pregnant women and their unborn babies are still being subjected to mercury-laden flu vaccines and aluminum-laden  DTaP  vaccines — and at an earlier point.</em>  </p>

<p><strong><em>These vaccines during pregnancy contradict decades of advice to take no medications, quit smoking, stop drinking alcohol and avoid mercury laden seafood while pregnant, but people have been so conditioned to trust authority that they accept this, making it  all too  easy to tell parents, &#39;sorry, your kid was born that way&#39; …</em></strong>   </p>

<p><em>[G]overnment health officials maintain the charade that they are trying to find a cause for autism when they have blown $1.6 billion over the past decade looking for a supposed genetic cause despite ample science showing that environmental factors are the culprit.&quot;</em>   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There could be several. Depopulation: see bill gates speech on rising population &quot; We can reduce that number if we do a really good job on vaccines.&quot; It could be they aren&#39;t purposefully causing Autism but know that these vaccines are probably the missing link but they look the other way because it would hurt their pockets. CDC buys over 4 billion dollars of vaccines a year from big pharma and hold several patents. If it came out that they can cause autism can you imagine the shitstorm they would face after all of this damage and how much money they would lose.  If it came out that autism on the rise is their fault countless careers of politicians, scientists, government officials, CDC and WHO would be over and some probably jailed (hopefully). There is no agenda that would make sense from a parent who says that their child was perfectly healthy and when vaccinated they do a complete 180 and who clearly knows their child and their behavior better than anyone, especially a doctor who sees them once every couple a months. To say your doctor could judge your child and say why they changed better then the parent is a complete fucking joke. Fuck your medical degree I know my child better than you. If there is nothing to hide then have unbiased scientist do real studies and do everything in our power to regulate and make sure that vaccines are safer than any other medicine in the world bc we inject our babies with them. But no they refuse to do so. They are compromised not the parents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most diseases that you vaccinate for are relatively acute but deadly. Things like meningitis, pertussis, diptheria, etc. can kill you quickly if untreated. Most people don&#39;t have protracted treatment for them so there is no money to be made. </p>

<p>Also let&#39;s say you get meningitis. Typical therapy is a few different antibiotics and corticosteroids with a few additional things. Those drugs are most likely all made by different manufacturers so the money made by treating the disease will be split accordingly. It is better for the drug company to sell bulk vaccines and get that money up front than it is for them to hope someone gets sick and then hope that whatever hospital they go to sources their drugs from them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines only appear cheap because they&#39;re largely subsidized by tax payers (to cover vaccine damaged payouts). Vaccines generally cause immune system compromise which leads to the patient needed additional medications. The number of vaccines have also risen dramatically since the Regan administration where big pharma convinced the government they needed protection from massive law suits. Due to that lobbying there&#39;s now over 50 vaccines administered to children before adulthood. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s a few flaws in your theory, autism isn’t fatal and they can still have children so depopulation isn’t really a good reason, also autism usually isn’t diagnosed or even very noticeable until at least 3 years old so you could think your child is fine/normal and still not notice it until 4-5 years when they’re suppose to be progressing in speech and motor skills which could explain why parents seem to see a decline but really it’s just they aren’t progressing as they should be because of the pre-existing autism. My mom is a special education pre-school teacher so she’s trained to watch for signs because that’s the age is typically presents itself</p>

<p>Or immunocomprimised?? So they could have been vaccinated but immunocomprimised? Why mix these together.</p>

<p>Immunocompromised children made up about 68% of varicella cases,</p>

<p>Why were so many of them immunocompromised? Either they were receiving cancer treatment .. or had some genetic reason why they were compromised. </p>

<p>The definition expanded <em>without</em> accompanying tier-ing or banding.  In other words, the definition change resulted in diagnosis detail being lost.  This almost <em>never</em> happens unless someone is trying to deliberately cover something up.   Why wouldn&#39;t the definition be expanded but add categories like &quot;mild,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; &quot;profound?&quot;  I&#39;d argue it was done deliberately to obfuscate an increase in &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;profound&quot; type autism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said you wanted a national sample of the actual diagnoses. That&#39;s not what that is. That&#39;s a long-term study looking to estimate prevalence by using sampling of participating community service providers. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Findings from the ADDM Network, on the basis of 2014 data reported from 11 sites, provide updated population-based estimates of the prevalence of ASD among children aged 8 years in multiple communities in the United States. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly helpful for gathering information on prevalence, but is not what you asked me to provide. And it does not break down the diagnoses by severity.</p>

<p>Have to say though, 325k participants is quite impressive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really all that weird, based on stuff I’ve been reading over the years.  There’s a lot of stuff that seems to either originate or be mixed in with the bacteria inside of you, down to psychological stuff like your mood.  Years ago when I looked into psoriasis, back before the internet became 95% filled with bullshit, and came across mentions of a researcher in the 70’s or 80’s who thought it was tied into irritable bowel syndrome.  From what I recall the researcher wasn’t able to figure out exactly why, but just saw a correlation between the two things and in more recent years it made me wonder if gut flora could be to blame for at least some of the symptoms of psoriasis sufferers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The purpose to cause illness or simply not to effectively treat it is for the sole purpose of money and profit. The more a company can get in funds to search for a cure or cause, the time is in their hands so they can use this money and keep majority percentages of the donations and funds for themselves while other people all over the country are suffering. Why is autism is in the top 5 in countries with highest rates of autism per 10,000. This is logical reasoning and although its speculative, there is a very strong financial incentive or motive. Some of the elements and chemicals in these vaccines may have mercury - little or none at all- but what about all the other ingredients that have negative effects and symptoms. After all the idea of vaccination is one thing, but the carried out processes for all these years have shown clear signs of problems involving illness and genetics when paralleled with the charts. </p>

<p>Hormones are tricky, anyone with polycystic ovarian syndrome, thyroid issues, or people who use products with hormones in them can see fluctuations. Definitely older people are more likely to have hormonal shifts/imbalances and the median age of people having babies has increased since 1980.</p>

<p>also look into monkeys and autism, i think they found a hormone imbalance in the brain which seems to support this argument</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you read that right. I&#39;m saying more people are being diagnosed autistic, because the popular criteria to be considered autistic is broadening. Vaccines may have some link, but if we put a totally vaccinated autistic kid in a time machine and sent him back a few decades, they wouldn&#39;t diagnose him as autistic. </p>

<p>Nothing we eat is &quot;natural&quot;, we have been modifying plants for thousands of years. Go look at what bananas look like on the wild, they are full of seeds. We grow most fruit via grafting onto other plants. We blast plants with radiation to induce mutations. And of course, plenty of&quot; natural&quot; things are poison, like hemlock and cyanide. </p>

<p>It&#39;s alwaya relied on cosmic rays or copying errors to create mutations. But fundamentally it is the same, bits are inserted, deleted, or modified. &quot;Within nature&#39;s model&quot; is meaningless because agriculture is not within nature&#39;s model. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Expanded definition is definitely a contributing factor, but funding has a lot to do with it as well. My wife works at a school for children with autism. A lot of the students really should have a primary diagnosis other than autism (such as personality disorders, ADD/ADHD, etc). The state offers more funding for autism than for other disorders, so doctors and parents push for an autism diagnosis even if that&#39;s not the child&#39;s main issue. This provides the parents with more state funding for private specialized schools, therapy, respite and rehab services, and even just living expenses. So these children that aren&#39;t necessarily autistic are sent to schools that specialize in teaching children with autism. Most parents go for this because it means more support and one on one education for their kids.</p>

This is just a shower thought as you may conclude but all my family have had their children vaccinated including myself without one ounce of worry.  Maybe Canadian Dr.s don&#39;t push the influx of vitamins being that care starts as soon as possible due to our health care system.  I can&#39;t say women in other countries self administer a regime of vitamins/meds due to not seeking medical advice till late in pregnancy for lack of health insurance.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, you can obviously overdose on too much vitamins, but the vitamin push isn&#39;t even a big thing from what I&#39;ve seen.  Most respected drs and naturopaths just say to keep a healthy <strong><em>balanced</em></strong> diet.  It&#39;s not too difficult to measure your intake of vitamins and keep it in line, I take iron, calcium-magnesium and vitamin b12 supplements because I have a deficiency, I don&#39;t take them every day of every month though.  I&#39;m sure some people taking too many vitamins could hurt but the scale seems almost negligible because vitamins go in and our body can excrete them properly, if you keep taking them they can have an effect on the organs from over working, but the fact is our body can reject them if it&#39;s too much, this is not the case with vaccines though, we can&#39;t detox the heavy metals from our blood since they&#39;ve already bypassed multiple organs.  </p>

<p>I have a friend who&#39;s a neuroscientist, and suggests the Internet is changing our social relationships and thought patterns in a way that can resemble autism in some individuals.</p>

<p>Look at how autism has become an insult on the Internet, and it&#39;s associated with Internet addicts. Look at how many young adults are being diagnosed later in life with high functioning forms of autism. What if it&#39;s not autistic people are prone to Internet addiction, what if Internet addiction causes autism like symptoms and changes to the brain?</p>

<p>2) We are now better able to detect it in a wider range of ages and levels of severity.</p>

<p>3) This is a very common trend in medicine. Another recent example is Gluten allergy, scientists were mystified by America had such a low ratio 1:10000 of people with this ailment compared to Italy which was at 1:200. Turns out American doctors were just really poorly trained at recognizing the symptoms and misdiagnosed thousands of people, and that the ratio was actually slightly worse than Italy&#39;s. </p>
