<p>There is no law against taking to foreigners. That would be xenophobic.  </p>

<p>But since you brought it up did you know that the &quot;foreign agent&quot; was working for a company hired by the DNC when she went to that meeting? Is it worse to talk to a &quot;foreign agent&quot; or to have one on your payroll? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/91ydf7/because_of_continuing_gaslighting_this_is_a_run/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/91ydf7/because_of_continuing_gaslighting_this_is_a_run/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would run as an independent so the DNC wouldn’t be a factor. And yes there is no law against talking but trading favors is a campaign violation and that’s what is alleged. The lying and credibility issues around Trumps campaign is the issue in this case as it lends to obstruction and maybe conspiracy. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this has even been alleged. Maybe out of spite by the corporate media but not seriously by anyone that matters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the investigation pertinent to Trump is apparently just about obstruction at this point but it has been alleged by many that there was more centered around the Tower meetings. If your assertion that it was just setup is true then there is nothing to worry about on the collusion/conspiracy/treason side. But if there was and there is evidence or witnesses that suggests otherwise there could easily be more charges levied and that’s why they are seriously backpedaling over who was in the meeting and/or in the leaked alleged pre-meeting. </p>

<p>I think our next candidate should embrace their dark side and stop pretending to be perfect. Fucked a hooker 5 years..ok..14 people just arrested in my city last week for trying to buy hookers.so admit it,you&#39;ll get the &quot;willing to pay for sex&quot; vote. Are you a furry? Then go to a debate dressed as you. It is 2018 an I hope at this point enough people realize politicians are humans and terrible ones at that. I always said as a teen i would run for prez an my campaign slogan would be &quot;I smoked and I inhaled, and y&#39;all were there too.&quot; I also think if a presidential candidate ran on the legalization platform it would be a landslide. </p>
