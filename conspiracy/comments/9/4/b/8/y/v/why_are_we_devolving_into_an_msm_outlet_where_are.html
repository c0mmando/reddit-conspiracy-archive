       Hi guys,
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been something bothering me for a while, it seems to me that this community is devolving into merely copying and pasting MSM news articles in an attempt to garner themselves easy karma. I don’t understand why certain posts are being hammered to death when there is no conspiracy behind it. This community is being relegated to the smaller sibling of r/News and r/Politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed this trend with the Trump/Putin thing we’re people were merely reposting HuffPo, WashPo, NYT, etc articles about the conference. This is not at all what this community should be about. We are about uncovering kooky, crazy, and almost impossible to believe topics that the MSM would never touch
      </p>
      <p>
       Have we forgotten that these media outlets have propagated and disseminated mis/dis info pieces that have lead to the death of our countrymen, endless debt, and death of innocent foreigners, etc. Why are people merely reposting these articles when they aren’t germane to our community.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to scroll so far down to find quality posts about the Egyptian Pyramids being used for electromagnetic stuff (I barely get that stuff haha), the Denver Int’l Airport murals, reptilians, or the Nephilim that were omitted from the Bible. Those are the posts I’m sure this community was created for, not for partisan bickering that I could easily get in r/News and r/Politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s not forget that these news agencies are PROPAGANDA machines that are created to mislead us into the abyss. Many users here are endlessly lapping it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sarah Jeong (whatever her name is) issue is horrible, certainly, racism is unacceptable. But this is no conspiracy post. One post would have sufficed but this is being beaten like a horse. To the point where I don’t want to open this sub because that’s all I’ll see for 5 mins
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing that I happened to me this morning is that I posted a “controversial” comment and I was downvoted like crazy - which I’m fine with - but I got a PM from someone who agreed with my opinion but was probably too afraid to post publicly because of the backlash. I mentioned this and someone replied that this has been happening to him as well, that he too had been receiving PMs of people who agreed but were too scared to post. Moreover, he was also receiving threatening PMs which is absolutely unacceptable. I have no idea why anyone would get so worked up about a comment by some random person on the internet to threaten their life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we seriously that obsessed with our karma that we are afraid to voice our opinions or because we’ll be called racist or other unfavorable terms? Why are we attacking one another to the point of death threats?The MSM is already waging a war on “conspiracy theorists” so if we attack each other, we are ripe for the picking.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must unite and be friendly with each other, note I didn’t say friends. We can agree to disagree and engage with one another but we must remain polite and germane to the whole purpose of this community which is uncovering stories that will never see the light of day in the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       This turned out to be too long, but thanks for reading.

       Its very simple, and countless other subs do it, to have a rule limiting what content can be posted. Its not censorship if it can simply be discussed elsewhere, and its required to stop this place being flooded by msm content. Alternatively, enforce strictly one post per topic that msm is already covering, to help avoid the constant spamming we have now. The whole “just scroll down” argument is weightless, as all this msm content is drowning usual discussion.

       I wish they would just make it against the rules to post anything about current political events in the US that has a partisan slant. Quality unbiased sources or you don't get to post. That'd get rid of a lot of the bullshit spam from users from T_D and politics.

       Solution:  Restrict the submission of MSM news articles to archive links.
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN links are (rightfully) already not allowed.  r/conspiracy mods need to follow through and and do the same for all centrist MSM websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       This fits the community ethos of peaceful protest.  What better way to show solidarity from this community than hitting these companies where it hurts: by taking away ad revenue.

       I’m not opposed entirely to you linking something from HuffPo for example, but please don’t just link an article and that’s it, that’s what r/news is for. That serves no purpose here. If you want to post something about a Vatican bust (which I’m all for) on pedos then link it to pizzagate or something else of substance. But just dropping links is so pointless.

       It's pretty clear to almost anyone that if we got the whole truth, we'd find row after row after row of criminal activities - more than your usual President.  Whether it's the Russians or not is immaterial.

       The problem is how do you find out info then? I understand when you use articles from different sources to string together a theory. But just saying “hi here’s this an article I found and I’m not questioning it at all” is just a total waste of time.

       It comes down to this: this Trump/Russia thing is a conspiracy. If accusations are true, people conspired to win the presidency with the help of a foreign government. Would this not be bigger than Watergate?
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the problem with its discussion here? That you don't agree with the accusations? Pick any media source you want - it's not the media running the investigation and laying charges. So you don't like a link from CNN, so what? Would you rather people link directly to indictments? This story isn't
       <em>
        coming from
       </em>
       the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this subreddit existed during Watergate, how would you have felt about posts discussing it?

       I've noticed the amount of new submission on this sub have slowed down a lot over the past year or so.  I'm assuming it is the effects of Rule 13 but could be something else as well.  Many less submission though per hour or per day from what I can tell.

       Are you aware of the vote manipulation by shills and brigades? Sometimes you'll see coordinated attacks (particularly pushing CIA talking points about Russia) where the post is jammed to the front page with only 60% upvoted and obvious vote manipulating across the comments.

       sometimes i wonder, of all the conspiracies, of all the horrible things that have been reported that people truly believe to be going on... crimes to humanity... still, after all this time, all the years and years... no one, still has a solid idea on how to fix anything.

       I think it really boils down to, you’re fighting a system that operates with nukes with slingshots. That, and people are so brainwashed and convinced they aren’t being lied to by MSM. I was like that for the longest time. Thank god ny bf had patience with me and helped me wake up, I wasn’t a psycho feminist but I did believe mildly crazy stuff. I try to have conversations with people I’ve known for years and they look at me like I’m crazy, and I actually got called racist this morning by someone close to me. They really can’t help but see nails and they are the hammer.

       I dont think nukes are the strongest weapons of the system. Nukes are still on the hands of people, people are there and not computers making the choices with the hope that they can make the right and just choices in such an event. That he wont nuke our own people for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Youre not really against the system when you go out there, youre against the people that actually want it there. That being the majority. How close have people actually been, few managed to but what happened to those few, exile, imprisonment, death and... but your common person... you dont even reach the systems gates to really fight it or make any difference, you are stopped from your tracks by your own neighbors.

       Ok I see your point. But what about all this introduction of AI? How does that change this whole equation. People swear they can control this thing and they can’t. Wasn’t it Facebook that reported they created 2 AI robots or something and it got to the point where the robots created their own language and humans couldn’t understand so they shut the trial down. What happens if we can’t shut them down? That’s something that genuinely scares me.

       But if you think about it the internet is only 20-30 years old and look how indispensable it’s become. People are actually implanting trackers and tech into their arm. I get the feeling that tech people (who get government funding and meet extensively with gov officials) are trying to down play how quickly this stuff will take over and become mainstream but just look at the internet. Just 30 years and we can’t live without it.

       oh god those super smart cities that are supposedly the very effigy of perfectly equally faily distributed resources thruogh the bloody aid of technology and letting it do it all for you coz humans cant do it... its not new, from that zeit people. It is popular to a group of people, they think itll give em that. The perfect socialist utopia...
      </p>
      <p>
       But thats just a smart system, its not the same as a conscious machine. Its just like many things, what we have elevated to a grander scale. A conscious one would ask, why must I give this human being water today.
      </p>
      <p>
       And people would give up their land, their houses, their way of lives to just go along with this? Because demolition on a massive scale is required for that thing in total execution of the concept. But then again, who cares about them, they will be forced out if ever. And the rest, wont really mind bec theyre promised something great to just shut up and watch and move along.

      <p>
       Id say, your bigger worry is not having enough jobs left down the line as just like in factories, more machinery can do the same things you used to do. Vs machines killing you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as people got used to the internet, people will at that point get used to subsisting. And they will love it, because its the new way, it is progress.

       Does the Sarah Jeong thing strike anyone else as inorganic?  I get that she's a racist, but the level of attention this is getting is much higher than I would have expected.  If I had to guess the reason is that someone is trying to normalize canning people for stupid shit they said on the internet (by getting both sides on board with it) and weaponizing that later.

       Hmm well that Gunn guy got fired for those jokes which were horrible but I mean, should we really be policing people’s speech like that? I think it leaves at lot to be said by the NYT that they gave her a friendly pass and claim that she was attacked because “she’s a female Asian.” That stuff was so blatantly racist that it’s just obvious they should’ve fired her. But the Gunn thing I’m ambivalent about because they were obviously horrible jokes and no one has come out against him accusing him of anything and now his career is dead. Ehh I’m not sure 2 wrongs make a right

       I think you're close to the truth. From what I've seen the public outcry to get someone fired has been weaponized for quite a while by media and predominantly left wing initiatives. The difference now is that right wing folks are gleefully adopting the same strategy. I've even seen folks comment in other places that they don't care what the person said, they're just using outrage mobs against political rivals until the other side sees how harmful it is and agrees to stop.

       Interesting thought. Could be an orchestrated problem-reaction-solution stunt. In order to get right-wingers on board with censoring speech, display some anti-white racism and watch things descend into hysterics. It’s weird to see the right calling for her to be fired over racist tweets.

       Absolutely, for someone who isn't famous, this is getting crazy amounts of attention. For one, I think what she said is racist and I don't like it being handwaved away, but the outcry over this seems a bit over the top. I also noticed in a news thread that there were tons of comments of the idea that without power you can't be racist. That view is common on Tumblr maybe and a few subreddits, but not most of Reddit. It seemed like there were tons of people commenting with that and being downvoted. It seemed like people were commenting that idea specifically to give credence to the idea that more people think like that.

       I’m not a stone wall like other people on this sub. We can talk if you want, I have no issue. I interned with a congresswoman for a year and during the Iran Nuke deal she wanted to hold debates so she could vote accordingly, the AIPAC immediately called and told her if she went forward with that debate they would protest her and shut it down. Guess what, she cowered. Then again, she’s model citizen. I was there for roughly a year and I never saw her and I went almost everyday for several hours.

       Just because they started as a client state doesn’t mean children don’t grow up to control their parents. Again, not that I’m saying they are to blame for EVERYTHING like some people claim

       Yes I know about this and you can see that Hollywood’s biggest directors, producers, studio head, etc are Jewish. Now I’m not saying every single Jew is in on some master plan. My Jewish neighbors seem nice enough and like they are doing their own thing. And my Jewish family also seems relatively normal. So I don’t think every single Jew is working at some master goal but it should be mentioned that they are disproportionately powerful when you consider there are only something like 10 million of them.

       Most of the execs in MSM outlets are Zionist jews. The only MSM outlet I can find thats just blanket goyim is Fox News (Not that they're any better). Most news being propagated in America is pro-Israel.

       After people abandoned news and politics and other mayor subs and moved to conspiracy to be able to discuss things the MSM was pushing under the rug, it therefore became necessary to crush conspiracy next. They cannot allow free thinking.

       As much as we are dismayed with the msm, they are viewed as authoritative by many and using them as a springboard to support or question is necessary to gain some traction sometimes. One of the first shill tactics is to attack the source rather than deal with the issues.  So, I can see if an msm source can be used to clarify matters it would be a plus.

       I Saw that video on the actual Q sub but I’m still not convinced it’s real. I still have the impression/feeling it’s a little too ra ra ra Trump when we should still be criticizing him when he makes mistakes. I’ll probably vote form him in 2020 but I’m not on his “team” my team is individual freedom and liberty. If he best represents that I’ll vote, if someone comes and does a better job then I’ll vote for that person.
