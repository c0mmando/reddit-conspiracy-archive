<p>They are oversaturating, but that&#39;s what they do when they get the slightest whiff of hypocrisy. It swings the other way on other posts. So I agree that they are pushing this hard, but it&#39;s still a situation that needs to be rectified. We are creating a precedent where racists can rise in power if they choose the right target.</p>

<p>However, take away the hyperbolic screeching that you hate. Do you still think it is acceptable for her to have that position? After so many others have been taken down for so much less? Why do they get free passes? Because the represent the right team that the media is for.</p>

<p>You know what needs to be rectified? The continued child sex abuse going on in Hollywood, various churches, and in education. That&#39;s what needs to be rectified. Any time pedophilia is brought up, a forum slider post surfaces, disrupting the important pursuit of justice and protection of children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you there as well, but those are two different situations and I&#39;d like to see action on both of them.</p>

<p>However, an editor to one of the biggest American papers is a self-recognized racist. Breitbart lost loads of advertisement, Spotify just ripped Alex Jones off for hate speech. She is a prime example of the hypocrisy in identity politics and race relations.</p>

<p>If you wanna talk child sex abuse, you&#39;ll find me in every one of those posts as well.</p>

<p>Right but shouldn&#39;t priority be placed on people being sent to jail for raping and killing children? Especially when the NYT responded and maintained their position about this Sarah woman? She&#39;s an editor. It&#39;s not like she&#39;s a director of a really popular franchise or an elected religious official. We already know not to trust MSM, and many people are learning to follow suit. Why place such importance on this issue when so many worse things are happening?</p>

<p>Like the meteorite and the ongoing volcano, and most importantly, rampant pedophilia?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I don&#39;t think you should dictate where priority should go. You&#39;re a random on the internet just like me. This is a forum where a variety of ideas are discussed openly and should fucking remain so.</p>

<p>The fact that they maintained their position at NYT is why it&#39;s being posted though? Do you not get that?</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t placing &#39;such importance&#39;, it&#39;s just relevant to what has happened on this site in the past two years. Pedophilia is the most difficult topic to discuss on this forum due to the forum sliding, but if the mods aren&#39;t going to to help mediate the bullshit brigade then what do you expect me to do?</p>

<p>I understand the divide and conquer aspect, but rise above it. They are all crooks and I refuse to hold water for any of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by &#39;forum sliding.&#39; In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly pre-positioned on the forum and allowed to &#39;age.&#39; Each of these mis-directional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a forum slide. The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a forum slide and flush the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then replying to pre-positioned postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. </p>

<p>Right but shouldn&#39;t priority be placed on people being sent to jail for raping and killing children? Especially when the NYT responded and maintained their position about this Sarah woman? She&#39;s an editor. It&#39;s not like she&#39;s a director of a really popular franchise or an elected religious official. We already know not to trust MSM, and many people are learning to follow suit. Why place such importance on this issue when so many worse things are happening?</p>
