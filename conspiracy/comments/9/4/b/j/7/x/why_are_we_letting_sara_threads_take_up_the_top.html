       Remember when XXXtentacion died and I made a thread to put a stop to all the new threads that popped up. And like 100 of them did. This is the same thing. Are you going to let these Sara threads just eradicate all the noteworthy conspiracies?
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time you upvote those threads you allow important news and conspiracies to be pushed down into obscurity. Stop supporting this obvious forum slide.

      <ol>
       <li>
        This news story has been posted on this subreddit now over 15-20 times.
       </li>
       <li>
        The news story is already a few days old with the NYT having made their response.
       </li>
       <li>
        The top three posts discuss this topic with a new one only an hour old receiving 31 posts.
       </li>
       <li>
        There are no new updates only 'outrage' at people being banned in r/news.
       </li>
       <li>
        The reason for the bans is because you can't repost there.
       </li>
       <li>
        This is being used to further forum slide here. "Oh I was banned, look it's a conspiracy'.

       I don't think so. This is aimed to divide people. Right vs left, conservatives vs liberals, whites vs non-whites.

      <p>
       This subject is a perfect example of a forum slider post. The pedophilia post about the vatican will not get buried thanks to the recent post again about Sarah and people won't get to see the harm the church has created through sexually abusing children.

       Best part is they're using r/news to make it seem like a conspiracy people are being banned when literally they explain in their rules section what gets people banned.

      </p>
      <p>
       They are oversaturating, but that's what they do when they get the slightest whiff of hypocrisy. It swings the other way on other posts. So I agree that they are pushing this hard, but it's still a situation that needs to be rectified. We are creating a precedent where racists can rise in power if they choose the right target.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, take away the hyperbolic screeching that you hate. Do you still think it is acceptable for her to have that position? After so many others have been taken down for so much less? Why do they get free passes? Because the represent the right team that the media is for.

       You know what needs to be rectified? The continued child sex abuse going on in Hollywood, various churches, and in education. That's what needs to be rectified. Any time pedophilia is brought up, a forum slider post surfaces, disrupting the important pursuit of justice and protection of children.

       I agree with you there as well, but those are two different situations and I'd like to see action on both of them.

       However, an editor to one of the biggest American papers is a self-recognized racist. Breitbart lost loads of advertisement, Spotify just ripped Alex Jones off for hate speech. She is a prime example of the hypocrisy in identity politics and race relations.

       Right but shouldn't priority be placed on people being sent to jail for raping and killing children? Especially when the NYT responded and maintained their position about this Sarah woman? She's an editor. It's not like she's a director of a really popular franchise or an elected religious official. We already know not to trust MSM, and many people are learning to follow suit. Why place such importance on this issue when so many worse things are happening?

       Like the meteorite and the ongoing volcano, and most importantly, rampant pedophilia?

       Dude, I don't think you should dictate where priority should go. You're a random on the internet just like me. This is a forum where a variety of ideas are discussed openly and should fucking remain so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that they maintained their position at NYT is why it's being posted though? Do you not get that?
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't placing 'such importance', it's just relevant to what has happened on this site in the past two years. Pedophilia is the most difficult topic to discuss on this forum due to the forum sliding, but if the mods aren't going to to help mediate the bullshit brigade then what do you expect me to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand the divide and conquer aspect, but rise above it. They are all crooks and I refuse to hold water for any of them.

       So you think this Sarah thing is more important than raising awareness on pedophilia, meteorites, and volcanoes? There MAJOR stories on pedophilia right now being suppressed thanks to these Sarah posts.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly pre-positioned on the forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these mis-directional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a forum slide. The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a forum slide and flush the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then replying to pre-positioned postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment.

       It's like the bots and shills learned their lesson with XXXtentacion and are actively upvoting this sarah crap to the top spot. Just now a recent thread literally repeating the same crap about that chick already has 16 points in 39 minutes. Prepped to take the top spot again.

       As a white male who saw Roseanne go down for comparing Valerie Jarret to an actor from the planet of the apes, and that has NEVER been to The_Donald; I think she deserves a swift kick to the curb.
      </p>
      <p>
       How the fuck can someone normalize treating a person differently because of the race they are or the race they’re attacking? She said racist things many more times than Roseanne ever did, and if Roseanne is a racist then so is that bitch. Racism is racism, people.
      </p>
      <p>
       To demonstrate my point, I’m going to take one of her comments and type it out, replacing the word white with a different race:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Are Jewish people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the sun, thus logically being only fit to live underground like groveling goblins.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, this is a HARVARD GRADUATE, there is just no way in hell that she didn’t know what she was doing. It was the political climate around white hate that facilitated this, and people need to get that through their heads.

       Remember, if you’re branded a racist or an anti Semite as a white person, YOU ARE DONE. If you are anyone else, and targeting the “right group” (whites) you can just say: “lol just kidding, totally satire.” The constitution is being stomped on by this shitty rag.

       Right but shouldn't priority be placed on people being sent to jail for raping and killing children? Especially when the NYT responded and maintained their position about this Sarah woman? She's an editor. It's not like she's a director of a really popular franchise or an elected religious official. We already know not to trust MSM, and many people are learning to follow suit. Why place such importance on this issue when so many worse things are happening?
