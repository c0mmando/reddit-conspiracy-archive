<p>Post 2, which I submitted, was also just removed and labeled &quot;already submitted.&quot;</p>

Both went from 90% upvoted to 60% within seconds
While Post 1 was somewhat repetitive of the post from yesterday with 32,000 upvotes, Post 2 was covering something entirely- specifically the overwhelming backlash on social media.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not an argument, but I&#39;m sure you already know that and don&#39;t care. I can simply it for you, though. (1) The NYT is an influential and widely-read newspaper. (2) The editorial board is an important and influential part of the NYT. (3) Influential and widely-read newspapers in America <em>can and do</em> influence America. (4) America influences the world.</p>

<p>Can you follow that? Let me know, I might be able to simplify it further for you if you&#39;d like.</p>

<p>A dynamic many miss is that the definition of racism has gained a purposeful fluidity.  What started as a moral wrong morphed into a tool to quell discourse.  There is no more effective and, for some, satisfying method to both escape a discussion you are losing and still claim victory than to simply say &#39;this all sounds racist to me,&#39; regardless of applicability or merit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no she is racist obviously.  i don&#39;t agree with the standard that was set by nyt, sjws, and others that we should be firing ppl over what they say on fucking twitter with their own, personal accounts.  If you want to be racist, be racist.  Free speech.  But when these ppl say &quot;racism is absolutely disgusting!  Unless it is against white people, then you can be an editor at the NYT!&quot;  that you will here me screaming at the absolute hypocrisy.</p>

<p>so, just to rehash:  Sarah is obviously a racist.  Papa John is questionably racist (if that).</p>

<p>Papa John is removed from his own company.  Sarah Jeong is given a job at NYT.  And ironically, here is NYT reporting on this exact topic.  There is no way they were ignorant to their hypocrisy.

    <div class="md"><p>She called white dudes groveling goblins who are better equipped for living underground. I&#39;ve read her tweets and a few aren&#39;t even replies to other individuals, just her letting over angry steam. However, don&#39;t say racial shit online if you don&#39;t want it to bite you in the ass. It&#39;s a simple fact that has been known since the internet brought social media to the world.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard a comedian call white people aliens in one of the new Netflix specials.</p>

<p>I view these a separate incidents, one was made for a comedy performance, one was made while an individual was writing a book on the internet.</p>

<p>One is trying to have a scientific basis for their racism, the other made a joke about it.</p>

<p>In my opinion, nobody deserves public shame through online forums. However, activist on the left have been bombarding right leaning media and getting them taken off platforms through demanding action and public shaming tactics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the thought out response. Did she really propose some racial hypothesis over her twitter acc like you made out? or did she just try to be edgy by egging on trolls who were making fun of her race? </p>

<p>You also compared people&#39;s reaction to her tweets and peoples reaction to articles published by breitbart. One is a multimedia giant whose site is worth about 700Millon and has reached 64 Million views this year already.

    <div class="md"><p>Have you heard her speak on her book, specifically stating that white people are the reason her live and many others suck? It is on YouTube I believe, just Google the name of her last book and you should find it </p>

<p>She said white people make her life suck at Harvard, when giving a lecture over her book.</p>

<p>Jeong is now apart of a multinedia giant at this moment. She is no longer just a columnist, but an editor to one of the perceived prestigious papers.</p>

<p>Edgy tweets got a guy fired from directing Marvel movies, even though they had known about them. He was fired due to their fear of backlash. She isn&#39;t fired because they do not fear the backlash from the people who are against Sarah in this. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a different set of rules, based on her privilege. What is happening is what they appear to be against, but since it&#39;s a member of their team it is a non issue.</p>

<p>I still stick by the fact that we are personally responsible for what we put on social media, and I take careful precaution to avoid saying inflammatory statements that can be either taken out of context or spun into a terrible way. I went back on my Facebook and deleted movie quotes that would show up from 10 years ago on Facebook. If you don&#39;t want to be called a racist, don&#39;t house overt racist ideals and spew them openly. It&#39;s literally that easy, but she was promoted for her skill, the hatred is just a secondary part. I&#39;ve seen many of people go down for less, and feel like it&#39;s wildly hypocritical for a paper who covers a large amount of identity politics and racial issues to have an actual racist on staff. It just seems like her brand of racism is considered acceptable and that leaves a sour taste in my mouth.</p>

<p>The left really doesn&#39;t need any help from shills and botnets to be villanized, it was taken over by radicals and the herd is simply following along. It abandoned the working man long ago and is now the party of identity politics</p>

<p>The 2nd topic had a fairly informative comment removed by u/LetsTalkDancing that listed Sarah Jeong&#39;s racist tweets.  </p>

<p>r/news then banned u/LetsTalkDancing for &quot;trolling.&quot; <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/945e5x/i_was_banned_from_rnews_for_being_100_sincere_and/">Absolutely nothing strange here</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[–]LetsTalkDancing 274 points 2 hours ago* </p>

<p>These tweets are from 2017/16/15/14. That&#39;s pretty recent too.
Not like it&#39;s from 10/15 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Fun fact: NYT fired her predecessor for racist and offensive tweets.<br/>
But those tweets weren&#39;t racist about white people, but instead about black people, or used LGBT slurs.<br/>
She (the newly hired writer) claims she made all these racist tweets in response to people being racist to her, and that was was trolling.<br/>
Just looking at all the evidence I&#39;ve found: This appears to be a lie. Many of the tweets listed are ones she posted, of her own will, showing her own blatant racist beliefs, not in response to anyone.<br/>
Further claiming you are &quot;trolling&quot; is not a &quot;get out of jail free card&quot; to be racist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media class in the West is essentially a politically-motivated cabal. The media class includes not only mainstream television (CNN / MSNBC) but mainstream print sources (NYT), mainstream web sources (HuffPo) and mainstream platforms (Reddit, Twitter, etc). They know that the Jeong story is the kind of story that would shift people to the Right, or at least question the NYT&#39;s motives, and this means that they simply <strong>cannot allow</strong> the story to surface. When you can&#39;t argue with a fact, and you&#39;re also a terrible person, the logical conclusion is to <em>hide</em> the fact.</p>

<p>like it might be true but if she&#39;s actually dating white dudes then I honestly don&#39;t see how this is news.</p>

<p>Yea sorry to all of you who were offended by tweets made in 2014, that didn&#39;t become relevant until 2018. Why don&#39;t you guys take a look @ some of the tweets Esther Ku has made towards Asian men...oh but wait Asian men are worthless so there&#39;s no reason to get angry!!!!</p>

<p>Reddit is a news aggregator. People read headlines, sometimes RTFA, and discuss. Other people look at the discussion to see what everyone else thinks. This has a groupthink effect.  People tend to agree individually with whatever group is the loudest. If you silence one side of the discussion, people tend to move to the other side.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first Sarah Jeong Racist article is posted to News. Source was The National Review. Sarah was getting destroyed in the comments. Most people were calling for her to be fired. The thread after 2 hours at the top of news and reddit was &quot;Removed due to altered headline&quot; The headline was changed by the National Review not the author of the thread.</p></li>
<li><p>After 1 hour of no Sarah Jeong on the front page of News. Somebody posted a link to the Fox News updated article saying &quot;NYT stands with sarah jeong&quot; Again the initial comments were saying her treatment was unfair. She needed to be fired. After 1 hour the thread was &quot;Locked due to lack of moderation&quot;. So what happened during the 1 hour break that the thread was locked? The NYT PR police hired a hit team to come in and control the thread. Locking and deleteing it was creating more outrage so they needed time to organize and get the comments more in their favor.</p></li>
<li><p>The top comments were originally calling for Sarah to be fired for Racism. People were even saying &quot;Im Liberal and this is ridiculous!&quot;
After the thread was unlocked the comments suddenly changed to the MSM narrative that &quot;Its ok Sarah was responding to trolls&quot; and all the comments calling for her to be fired for racism were downvoted.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Big surprise.  I had the same thing happen to me on 9/11/16 when I posted about Hillary&#39;s collapse and the subsequent shitstorm.  <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> deleted all of my comments and the posting was shadowbanned.  I was instantly perma-banned from <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and muted from talking to the mods about it, so I was unable to appeal the ban.  Their talking point was that the things I was posting were &quot;politics&quot; and thus unsuited for <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and should be posted on <a href="/r/pol">/r/pol</a> instead... now look at <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> today. They will post any news article about Trump whatsoever as long as it paints him in a negative light.</p>

<p>Anyone who will not allow something negative to be posted about Group A (and perma-ban you for trying, and mute you from appealing) but encourage posting negative articles about Group B... think about what this means. They are shaping the narrative. This is not unbiased news. This is shaped propaganda. It makes it seem that reddit as a whole skews left instead of centrist.</p>

<p>actual honest question here, and I hope you take the time to answer.  Please.  I keep seeing people call Trump a racist.  What has he done or said that is racist?  If i am wrong I will eat my words, but I can&#39;t find anything he has said or done that is racist.  It weakens your argument against him (there are plenty of things to criticize the man logically about)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow the TPTB are really showing there hand by choosing this issue to be so aggressive over with their online armies.  You would think they would keep their blatant control of the media a little closer to their chest. I am really curious to see where this goes, as it seems to have A LOT of normies waking up to a form of censorship they had never noticed because it always aligned with their beliefs so much, their cognitive dissonance did the rest.  This particular example seems to be bluring the lines and red pilling quite a lot of left leaning people.  </p>
