    <div class="md"><p>It’s a legitimate question and a good thought inducer. I’ve had a similar thought somewhere in the middle though, if there really are shadow governments and deep state actors and filthy dirty rich people moving massive amounts of dark money in aim of their goals- would anything really ever get done to further a centralized agenda? Or would it be constant stalemate? We see things here so carefully focused on a western view of the world where things like The British Royal Family, American Federal Reserve, Israeli intelligence, the Vatican, Rothschilds et al are the definitive power-brokers. But what about the billions of people and many trillions of dollars elsewhere? In the Far East, South Pacific, Middle East, etc. Are there not some shady rich Japanese people vying for world domination too? Are there secret wars we’re not even considering yet?</p>

And that&#39;s on the low end of the conspiracy spectrum, then there is groups like Bilderberg that are literally a conspiracy by definition...

Because like, who the fuck really wants to sit around and research crazy stuff like this when you could be watching TV or something? Relaxing with your family or friends and what not.. Then, you conform. And that&#39;s exactly what they want! Nah I don&#39;t know to be honest. I think deep down we all just wanna live a somewhat normal honest living, and this is what stops us from going out in numbers and demanding the truth.

    <div class="md"><p>I like to play the, Lets imagine if i had accumulated massive amounts of wealth and power game.</p>

<p>Queen owns most of the world</p>

<p>Rockefellers owned the trains(logistic) and oil from the start, bush&#39;s family has the war manufacturing business, not to mention all the money that is made from private prison&#39;s and archaic laws. Where do you think the trillions of dollars go every year being spent on the war, we are literally making the rich, even richer, why do they even need all this money, healthcare, now tariffs, they are nickle and diming the people so hardcore, we dont even expect to save anything anymore, everyone has become content living paycheck to paycheck, i guess most of them are like op, blaming themselves, yes we all make our decisions in our life, but the opportunity and the community we used to have even 20 years ago, is gone, traded in for cellphones and #yolo. Humans are way to easy to manipulate because of group mentality, its almost like we were bred for it. </p>

<p>Ill give you a hint, Ill find it strange that building doomsday bunkers is a billion dollar business now, i still believe that something catastrophic happens during certain time increments in earths history, yet we dont talk about the past, we just seem content to think we evolved from monkeys in the blink of a eye and without zero proof. How can we truly know where we are going, if we dont know where we came from.</p>

<p>Ill give you another hint, all these wealthy familys have been around since the start, if you believe the rumors the queen is part of noahs line,   and thats supposedly their most guarded treasure, the papers proving lineage, thus their right to rule. Can you think of any reason&#39;s they may not want people knowing we were created by another godlike race? Or that our planet is going to be thrown into disarray whenever whatever this catrastrophic event may happen to be. The population is growing exponentially everday, they bleed people a little more of their dignity, humanity, money(pleasures), every day. Do you not see we are rapidly approaching a melting point. </p>

<p>Whatever the truth may be, interdimensional aliens, a christian/muslim/jewish god, or even  a alien race who had a civil war because of their little pets they created, I dont think any of us are truly prepared for what the 1% already know, what has been passed from family to family, for generations...</p>
