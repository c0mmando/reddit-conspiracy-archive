       Historically there has been conflict between Jews and Christians. It’s an open secret that as a part of this conflict Jews were against converting and therefore assimilating, so they had to refute the divine nature of Jesus. This tradition of denying his authority using comedy and slander continues to this day. Just ask a Jewish individual their opinion about Jesus and on average it is negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the conflict between Jews and Christians largely ended in an alliance in the end of the 19th century with William Blackstone and Theodore Herzl creating Zionist political movement that resulted in the development of the state of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the Israeli claim to the land using the Bible, the fact is the Palestinian people are genetically related to the ancient Judean society where Jesus was born more than the modern Israelis. The Israelis can’t even use archaeological evidence because there are no ancient Hebrew buildings that have been found, only Greek and other cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as in that era the largely innocent natives (the innocence epitomized by Jesus) were suffering, living and dying under authoritarian religious systems and foreign imperial ambitions, today the Palestinians undergo similar conditions. 2000 years ago the Jews killed Jesus using the Romans as proxy, and now they kill those most closely related to him using evangelical Christians as proxy. 
History repeats itself.

       The Israelis have an absolute hatred of the Palestinians...so much so that they openly murder Palestinian children. The Israelis who murder these children are never prosecuted, and if by chance an Israeli goes to jail for his crimes, it is s joke of a short sentence,
      </p>
      <p>
       I always thought that the hatred was because the Palestinians are a constant reminder to the Israelis that "Israel" and the so called Israelis who squat on Palestinian land are  a fraudulent people. They are the false Jews...imposters... illegally occupying and stealing the land from its native original people. The feeling that they really don't belong there must drive the Israelis nuts.

       The Palestinians have an absolute hatred for the Jews. Almost all middle eastern countries don’t allow Jews in their borders and palestians are known to use children as human shields. Hell some Palestinians go out of their way to provoke Israeli soldiers to kill them

       I suspect it goes even deeper than this. The word Palestine comes from "Philistine", and the Arabic word for Palestine,  فلسطين‎ is pronounced "Filisṭīn".
      </p>
      <p>
       The Philistines were historic enemies of the Jews in the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible. In the Book of Samuel, David famously slays a Philistine giant, Goliath. In Judges, Samson kills a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the modern era, Israeli zionists have conducted a genocidal Talmudic quest to eradicate the Palestinians and expropriate all the land they own, absorbing into greater Israel.

       They lived on the same land (until 1948), and have the same name. The Israelis need to pretend the Palestinians and Philistines aren't related, because it makes the Jewish "ancestral" claim to Palestine look bogus (which it is).

       Living on the same land doesn't mean anything nor does the name. Genetics and culture matter. The fact is Philistines are essentially a Greek offshoot from the Aegean sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Palestine was simply a new given by the Romans to all of Israel and prior to 1948 the name usually referred to Jews
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read historical documents talking about Palestine such as old travelogues, the British White Papers, the Peel Report, reports to the UN, contemporary news reports from archives etc., you will generally see references to “Palestinian Jews” and “Palestinian Arabs” or to “Jews” and “Arabs” (for short.) What you will notsee is references to “Jews” and “Palestinians” (when the two groups are being discussed together) with the term “Palestinian” referring solely to the Arab residents.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, UNGA 181 proposed ‘a Jewish state’ and ‘an Arab state’ not ‘a Jewish state’ and ‘a Palestinian state’. [1] .
      </p>
      <p>
       UNSC 242, passed in 1967, refers to “ territories occupied in the recent conflict” by Israel, not to ‘Occupied Palestinian Territories”[2]
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the PLO’s original charter refers to “The Palestinian Arab people” - that qualifier being necessary because when the charter was written (in 1964) ‘Palestinian’ was not synonymous with ‘Arab’ (and it renounced any claim to sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza as well, since those areas were still in Jordanian and Egyptian hands.)[3]

       Relying on UN Resolution 181 is very self-serving (I am assuming your religion, here) because the Palestinians had literally zero input to the United Nations Resolution to implant a Jewish state in Palestine.
      </p>
      <p>
       So of course there is no reference to the Palestinians - this is the start of the dehumanising process that the state of Israel has pursued for 70 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever your view on the ancestral connection between Philistine and Palestine and  (the etymological connection is not in question) they have a far stronger case to continue inhabiting their land than the white, European colonists (aka Ashknenazis) who have been parachuted in to uproot them.

       Most of Israel isn't even Ashkenazi and I can cite five additional studies in addition to the one I just posted that you conveniently ignored that say that Ashkenazi Jews are still middle eastern.
      </p>
      <p>
       Palestinian Arabs didn't exist in when UN resolution 181 was in effect, they just identified as Arabs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every Arab state objected because of Arab racism. The entire middle east was Arab and they couldn't accept a small Jewish nation in their midsts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Palestinian Authority claims the West Bank, eastern Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip as “Palestinian land”. There’s a small problem with that: the original Palestinian National Charter of 1964:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Article 24. This Organization does not exercise any regional sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on the Gaza Strip or the Himmah [Jerusalem] Area. Its activities will be on the national popular level in the liberational, organizational, political and financial fields.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The Original Palestine National Charter (1964)
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time this charter was written, all the PLO wanted was all of Israel. Then came the 6-Day War of 1967.
      </p>
      <p>
       The areas mentioned in Article 24 were no longer under the control of an Arab regime, so something had to be done… and it was. In July 1968, the Palestinian National Council deleted Article 24 from the text of the Charter, claiming those areas as “Palestinian land”. Basically, what they were saying was, “We liked the previous owners, so we didn’t claim the land. We don’t like the present owners, so we claim the land for ourselves.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Even many Palestinians questioned this decision… Walid Shoebat famously asked, “How is it that I went to sleep a Jordanian and woke up a Palestinian?”
      </p>
      <p>
       IF the Arab Higher Committee hadn’t neglected to declare the establishment of “the Arab state” mentioned 22 times in UNGAR 181 instead of attempting to destroy the newly created Israel, the Palestinians would have a far better case for argument. As it is, rejecting UNGAR 181 and embarking on a war of aggression negated any claims they might have made legitimately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under international law, Israel has the best legal claim to the land “between the river and the sea”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s what the authors UNSCR 242 had to say about the issue… and note that they never mentioned the word “Palestine” even once.
      </p>
      <p>
       Security Council Resolution 242 According to its Drafters
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it’s time the Palestinians got off their high horse and stopped making demands for capitulation by Israel as if they were the winners of multiple wars.

       Studies have shown y-chromosome DNA in Ashkenazis but not x-chromosome, and relying on studies which merely demonstrate the former is disingenuous because Jewishness is not passed down the male line, as you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       UNGAR 181 was an ultra-vires resolution, and that's why many countries have refused to acknowledge that the state of Israel is a legitimate country. UN Resolution 181 declared a right of national self-determination for the Jewish people, and in so doing it (illegally) expunged the right of national self-determination for the Palestinians. And as we see, the Ashkenazi cuckoo tactic is to pretend that the Palestinians don't even exist - chutzpah, I think it's called.

       What has the genetic make-up of Palestinians to do with anything relevant under the sun when it comes to this situation? They owned the vast majority of the land the Zionist terror gangs would go on to annex in 47/48 using acts of terrorism producing an exodus of Palestinians from their homes.

       I've seen this odd, pointless discussion come up so many times and always brought up by the race-obsessed Jews. 'Palestine never existed'. It kind of did. It had a football team in the 1930s, it was on the map, it was a territory which post-British departure was mostly taken over via ethnic cleansing by the Zionist terror gangs etc. What this has to do with race, God knows exactly. The real God though, not the hateful one of Judaism who preaches hatred based on

Imagine being brainwashed in racism enough to think you can go around, check the DNA of someone and see if it matches certain standards, or whatever, and decide it's alright to commit wars of aggression against them and annex their land.

       Small wonder most of Israel's leaders and founding fathers were openly racist and proud. What a profoundly sick, disgusting country.

       Islam officially came to Israel in the year 636, four years after Prophet Mohammad’s death, and during the reign of the second Caliph of Islam Omar Ibn al Kattab. The Islamic Caliphate conducted an attack onto Jerusalem which was ruled by the Byzantine Romans, who were placed under a four month siege commencing in November of that year. (2) After four months of hardship and butchery, the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Sophronius, surrendered Jerusalem to Caliph Omar in 637.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to that not a single word in Arabic was spoken in Israel and no one identified as Arab or Palestinian Arab.

       Mitochondrial DNA testing on Ashkenazis jews shows beyond question that they are descended from European women. And since Judaism is passed down the matrilineal line only, this proves the Ashkenazis are cuckoos - fake Jews who have used the cloak of Judaism to forcibly displace the native inhabitants of Palestine to create their own European colony in the Levant.

       But its clear that after all the peace offers, and generous ones given the power Israel has over Palestine, that the continued conflict between the two states is completely upon the hands of Palestine. It has had several offers at peace and refuses them all. The conflict only continues because of Palestine.

       This is legit Palestinian activism. Dealing with what an intrinsically racist and supremacist religion Judaism is. Not to say all Jews follow the supremacism in it, but a lot or most probably do considering Jewry is a highly organized thing and very well represented in public life. Jesus, just look beneath to literally view a Jew/Zionist try and justify annexation/ethnic cleansing based on the
