You have as much access to the multiverse and jumping parallel realities as the limitations of your mind allow. Think of each &quot;plank-time&quot; as a frame of consciousness. Your 5 senses are ALWAYS lagging behind the &quot;True&quot; present moment, because the &quot;Truth&quot; is nothingness. We are holographic projections. Matter doesn&#39;t truly exist, it&#39;s all &quot;spirit&quot; (99.999999999% of atom are empty space, the deeper they go every scientist eventually realizes he knows nothing and is nothing)  The &quot;Matrix&quot; is maleable. &quot;Knowledge&quot; is both power and prison. </p>

<p>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints</p>

Not in the way you&#39;re describing the word &quot;tampered&quot;. Does a tree in the forest make a sound if nobody is there to hear it? The answer is no. Time only exists because you believe it does. Nothing can be &quot;perceived&quot; unless there is a mind to perceive it. You&#39;re thoughts alone are shaping the Akashic as I type this. </p>
