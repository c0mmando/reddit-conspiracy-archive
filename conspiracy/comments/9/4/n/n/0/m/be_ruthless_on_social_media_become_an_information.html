       I post this guy way too much.

      <p>
       Who are the most ruthless information warriors on Reddit? Who are the most organized? Who are the most persistent? Does the establishment still truly "not get it" or have they been ahead the whole time?
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is a battleground of ideas. r/conspiracy is no exception. This battle will continue into the foreseeable future.

         It just takes discovering one lie for a person to be turned away from the mainstream media forever. Have patience with your fellow citizens who may be in a brainwashed, albeit temporary, state.

       Legitimizing Q anon?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah right. They are trying their damndest to bury the fuck out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying that in general, if the MSM is against it, r/conspiracy is usually interested in it, especially if it has to do with a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very odd how r/conspiracy wants nothing to do with Q.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's more the mods and shills that don't want Q on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to call r/conspiracy my home, and moved to r/GreatAwakening as soon as I found out what it was all about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know lots of other users here would find great relief in that place if they even knew about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a shame that everything every conspiracy theorist dreamed would happen is going on right now.

       Definitely used to smear the name of "conspiracy theorists".
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess not everything they go after is true, but it's easy to tell the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat-earth is obviously just an easy strawman to discredit real conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Qanon is not anywhere near flat-earth but the MSM would definitely like you to think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Qanon is basically about every political conspiracy lumped into one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political conspiracies are a lot more likely to be true than flat-earth.

       qanon is about laying down and waiting for a hero to save the world from parasites.

       politics is a hoax, it is fact that politicians conspire  against citizens, until we actually band together in numbers and figure this out ourselves, nothing will change.

       Well maybe you're right, but we have to at least wait and see how this whole Hillary Clinton illegal private email server thing goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are real people investigating the "matter", and they aren't falling for the excuses. The implications are huge and it's not like they don't know what is actually going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember Anthony Weiner's "insurance file" that had images/video that made NYPD officers vomit? I've seen some sick shit on the interwebz. Nothing that would make me vomit. I can only imagine what was in that file.
      </p>
      <p>
       That shit isn't going away, and it's out in the public, and now even more because the MSM is forced to cover it since there are enough Q followers now for there to be noticeable numbers at the Trump rallies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust me, the people who follow Q are after blood. If Q doesn't do it soon, there will be actual blood spilled in the streets, and no one wants that, including the bat-shit insane deep state.

       I've spent more time than should have researching those things.

       I've seen enough to have a pretty good idea what is going on with all the Q stuff.

       They don't need to bury it, it buried itself. It's safe to mock at this point since it has failed in it's purpose and has absolutely no power nor influence. It was very scary propaganda at first, but luckily it couldn't keep up the pace of believeability long enough to build an actual following.

       Have you even been to r/GreatAwakening?

      <p>
       There are now 50,000+ subscribers, and most of the subs there know the numbers are bullshit, just like r/the_donald.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are millions that follow Q.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea what you mean saying Q doesn't have "an actual following".
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just flat out wrong, whether Q is a legit insider or not.

      </p>
      <p>
       There absolutely are not millions following, nor are there likely 50k organic individual subscribers to the sub. I've seen how many upvotes things get there. There's multi accounting up the butt there, just as we saw in
       <a href="/r/the_Donald">
        /r/the_Donald

       . You can fake subscriber count, but you can't fake activity as easily and especially not upvotes, without risking getting caught by the admins.

       You know what I've always believed about that word here in this subreddit?  It's projection, always projection. Always.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just some random person that doesn't agree with you tightly held beliefs, that's it. We've spoken back and forth now what...3 times? You're projecting. You know nothing about me other than a few comments on a highly devisive topic. Yet you jump right to this accusation of...what exactly? You are so convinced in your beliefs that you can't imagine someone disagreeing with you on their own. It must be something larger, something grand, something organized and anti-everything you believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit man, get over yourself. This movement has failed. The US has firmly rebuffed it and the only storm coming is the one everyone else has watched brewing that you pretend doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, you're projecting. Who knows? Doesn't matter. It's going to get a little crazier come November, sure. And then even crazier still until the dust settles and we as a nation emerge from this hellish nightmare we cast upon ourselves.

       Holy shit, just checked r/the_donald and you're right!
      </p>
      <p>
       They got rid of the rule that specifically mentioned banned topics such as "Q conspiracy theories".
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't remember the exact wording, but I'm pretty sure I quoted it somewhere in my comment history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hardly go to T_D anymore after they banned me for talking about "debunked David Hogg conspiracies", so I don't know if anyone is talking about Q, but I'll check it out when I have more time.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I know is people in T_D
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be at the very least
       <em>
        talking
       </em>
       about Q. There are hundreds of people showing up to these rallies who are loyal Trump supporters AND Q supporters. That's going to raise questions, and if you're not seeing posts in T_D of all places, there is no way there is not some kind of suppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       T_D mods are likely still just deleting all new posts mentioning anything to do with Q even though it's not in the rules anymore. I've heard some people got away with talking about Q in comments buried deep in some obscure post, far enough away from the front page the lazy mods don't care/bother to look...
      </p>
      <p>
       Brb, I'm gonna have my cat make a post asking T_D about Q from their totally legit Reddit account. :)

       Whether it was before he became compromised, or he was part of the con to discredit the ideas of conspiracy theorists to mainstream audiences from the get go, Jones nailed the game by calling his outfit InfoWars. Information Warfare has been the most important theatre of modern geopolitics since at least WWII, and arguably long before that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Propaganda, psy-ops, false flags, disinformation and the like all fall under the umbrella of information warfare. If as a state, your enemy (and that includes your own citizens) are not aware of the true state of things, they will be distracted and unable to resist your control matrix.

       I got banned for calling someone an idiot because they responded to my post but didn't even respond to my post if you get my drift. Then she proceeded to call me retard tell me to fuck off go fuck myself. Mind you she came into my timeline. And she reported me and I got banned. I fucking hate that place. Call a brick a brick and that's targeted harassment.

       I hate to break it to you, but there have been literal pools of blood spilled in the name of this 'political theater'.

      <p>
       If you still think it's all just harmless scandals and politics, you need to spend more time researching Mena, Arkansas and "the Clinton body count".

       That's just the tip of the iceberg.

       You are intentionally taking my words out of context.

       I didn't call you a shill, I basically called you mean.

       You're the one who called you a shill.

       Again, I'm not claiming to be 100% certain of anything, you are.

       Again again, you're either really mean OR a shill. Or both I guess.
