        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SS: What is behind the endless barrage on links on this sub to stories about the Asian NYT contributor who said shitty things about white men on twitter? </p>

<p>This sub has more than it‚Äôs share of conservative users but does this ‚Äúgenocide against whites‚Äù nonsense <em>really</em> have that much traction here? There‚Äôs a couple turds in every punch bowl but the sheer volume of these posts is more than the usual resident population of white nationalists. </p>

<p>So why does a story about a liberal media outlet trying too hard at diverse views rile up this community that much? Are the sad victimhood fantasies of white supremacists that prevalent here? Or are feelings that easily hurt? I hate to say it but the blowback is either disingenuous or speaks to a pretty profound weakness on behalf of the aggrieved posters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the people who are sooooooo outraged over some dumbass tweets, where someone was mocking someone who was trolling them, are being nothing but little crybabies. Boohooo, that person was making fun of trolls in a dumb way. Wahhhhhhh, she sent out supposedly racist tweets, wahhhhhhh. They were turned into something they weren&#39;t but you can have your outrage if you want. It&#39;s your life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For consistency&#39;s sake... How do you feel about Roseanne&#39;s firing?</p>

<p>Also... There&#39;s zero indication of satire or &quot;copying rhetoric of things said to me&quot; outside of jeong&#39;s declaration. Feel free to fill me in on the specific context im missing.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I feel that NYtimes editors should be held to a higher standard than internet trolls and even sitcom actors. But if youre cool with numerous racist tweets coming out of one of the most influential newspaper&#39;s editor I&#39;d like to hear a more in depth explanation than accusing me of &quot;being emotional&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not personally in any negative emotional state about anything. Im merely critical of obvious bull shit when I see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t care about her firing. It was a dumbass thing to say though and directed at a specific person. It is up to the person she directed it to and her being outraged, not me or anyone else. I think everyone says dumb shit when they are online though. As for this one, the NYT vetted her social media, did think she said dumb things but that in the context she did them in, they didn&#39;t care. Fine by me.</p>

<p>I guess my issue is that this is a conspiracy sub and when I logged on today, there were 15 posts about this. Then, it was a bunch of mostly racist posts other places. Shit drove me crazy and I just feel like this type issue has been politicized, on both sides. I am tired of it, from both sides. I think both sides manufacture outrage and it is so tiring. Everyday it is something. I come here to escape from all of that nonsense but it is even worse here at times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. It‚Äôs the double standard bestowed to both 1. the justification for / acceptability of the behavior(s), and 2. the ‚Äúpublic response‚Äù / NYT reply.</p>

<p>I enjoy that this post has the vibe of ‚Äúblaming the victim‚Äù (to borrow a phrase... üòâ) for their ‚Äúhyper-sensitivity.‚Äù</p>
