       SS: What is behind the endless barrage on links on this sub to stories about the Asian NYT contributor who said shitty things about white men on twitter?
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub has more than it‚Äôs share of conservative users but does this ‚Äúgenocide against whites‚Äù nonsense
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       have that much traction here? There‚Äôs a couple turds in every punch bowl but the sheer volume of these posts is more than the usual resident population of white nationalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why does a story about a liberal media outlet trying too hard at diverse views rile up this community that much? Are the sad victimhood fantasies of white supremacists that prevalent here? Or are feelings that easily hurt? I hate to say it but the blowback is either disingenuous or speaks to a pretty profound weakness on behalf of the aggrieved posters.

       Glad this story broke, as we can read closer into the writings of this individual, who previously tweeted a grotesque ability to ‚Äúdivide and conquer.‚Äù Hopefully this tale of ‚ÄúI once was a racist but now I am found‚Äù is as genuine as the NYT has responded...

       It's a conspiracy that points out the divide that the media is trying to push for advertising $$$. It shows also that every race, not just white people can show racism towards others.

       Sarah Jeong's tweets were direct responses to racist tweets directed at her. In that context, isn't the lesson that we should all strive to treat each other with love and respect, even if they insult us?

       That‚Äôs like saying it‚Äôs a double standard that my infant son can wear a diaper but I can‚Äôt. Have you been paying attention to what we caucasians have been up to for the last 400 years on this continent? With more power comes more accountability. I think it‚Äôs telling that all it took was one non-white leader of this country for some people to feel like the establishment was somehow put on its head. Ridiculous. What you should worry about is the very next president being a cartoonish exemplar of every negative trait of the white male power structure. That ain‚Äôt helpin‚Äô!

       Well then, no offense, but your experience in your country is not germane to a discussion about the social fabric in America. You‚Äôve got your own history that informs your own present day, whatever that is.

       You seem fairly defensive about what I said regarding our history and quick to dismiss an honest look at our history. I suspect that has more to do with your own feelings regarding race than reality.

       It's not white supremacy until someone white posted tweets that are exactly like hers, but targeting other races.

       It still blows my mind that so many of you on this sub refuse to look at what Russia is doing to our country through stories like this on social media. This Sarah Jeong story is something they are pushing, hard. These are known Russian bots that are pushing these stories. They don't just push this stuff, they push a lot of things. Just check this site out to see what I mean.

       All of the people who are sooooooo outraged over some dumbass tweets, where someone was mocking someone who was trolling them, are being nothing but little crybabies. Boohooo, that person was making fun of trolls in a dumb way. Wahhhhhhh, she sent out supposedly racist tweets, wahhhhhhh. They were turned into something they weren't but you can have your outrage if you want. It's your life.

       For consistency's sake... How do you feel about Roseanne's firing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also... There's zero indication of satire or "copying rhetoric of things said to me" outside of jeong's declaration. Feel free to fill me in on the specific context im missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, I feel that NYtimes editors should be held to a higher standard than internet trolls and even sitcom actors. But if youre cool with numerous racist tweets coming out of one of the most influential newspaper's editor I'd like to hear a more in depth explanation than accusing me of "being emotional".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not personally in any negative emotional state about anything. Im merely critical of obvious bull shit when I see it.

       I really don't care about her firing. It was a dumbass thing to say though and directed at a specific person. It is up to the person she directed it to and her being outraged, not me or anyone else. I think everyone says dumb shit when they are online though. As for this one, the NYT vetted her social media, did think she said dumb things but that in the context she did them in, they didn't care. Fine by me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my issue is that this is a conspiracy sub and when I logged on today, there were 15 posts about this. Then, it was a bunch of mostly racist posts other places. Shit drove me crazy and I just feel like this type issue has been politicized, on both sides. I am tired of it, from both sides. I think both sides manufacture outrage and it is so tiring. Everyday it is something. I come here to escape from all of that nonsense but it is even worse here at times.

       I personally find the posts wanting everyone to stop talking about it to be far more concerning. The fact that anybody can defend people like her, especially the NYT, is extremely upsetting. It furthers the distrust of the media for me and many others.
