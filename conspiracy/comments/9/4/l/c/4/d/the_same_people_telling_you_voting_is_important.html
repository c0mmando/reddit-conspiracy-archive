<p>American democrats are currently rounding up anyone they can for this &quot;important&quot; mid-term election.</p>

<p>Trying to get as many people to vote as possible to persuade the results in their favor.</p>

<p>The only issue of course being, that Russian hackers will rig the midterms as well, using their advanced Blockchain knowledge and Cryptoterrorism to flip upsidedown the very discourse of America on truth-based websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. /s</p>

<p>Don&#39;t bother voting democrats, the Russians already rigged it.</p>

<p>Your vote doesn&#39;t matter. Stop convincing people to join your cult.</p>

<p>Game&#39;s always been rigged you just don&#39;t like the results this time peasant.</p>

<p>The problem is not that CNN has different people that say different things. The problem is that other sources have different people that just happen to all say the same things. </p>

<p>Ultimately, your attempt to mock CNN for hypocrisy proves something entirely different -- that CNN permits people with completely opposite views to get on and provide their perspectives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple thoughts- 
First do you not think more people voting in general would be a good thing?-- and do you not think the upcoming midterms are &quot;important&quot;?</p>

<p>Your description of meddling in the previous and upcoming elections is at odds with most of people who&#39;re tasked with studying the topic, from intelligence agencies and investigators, to Congresspeople on both sides, to Trump and people appointed by him. Obviously many people don&#39;t trust the intel agencies or Congress or any of the reporting on the story, and just don&#39;t find the ongoing investigations compelling. That&#39;s fine, people disagree. </p>

<p>That said, your &quot;/s&quot; description is a pretty...narrow view of the ongoing matter, if you have followed it and consider yourself familiar with all the various parts.  And while, again, that&#39;s fine- you do you, share your views- it&#39;s not very likely to convince anyone who believes otherwise or might be on the fence (people generally don&#39;t cotton to being called cultists or peasants). And if you don&#39;t want to win people over, what&#39;s the goal?</p>

<p>No disrespect intended to OP or others, I just don&#39;t get what seems to be a lack of interest in understanding opponents&#39; views (an issue with folks on all sides, no doubt).  Like, are people enjoying this bitter, divided political environment? Really want constant bickering to be the norm? I don&#39;t see much value in &quot;winning&quot; some political victory if it just further divides the nation. I do see value in employing at least the minimum amount of empathy for people who disagree, trying to understand where they&#39;re coming from, and focusing on the people who have power and use it poorly- rather than the hundreds of millions of everyday people we don&#39;t know personally, and as individuals tend to be pretty neighborly and reasonable. </p>
