       Which is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       American democrats are currently rounding up anyone they can for this "important" mid-term election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to get as many people to vote as possible to persuade the results in their favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only issue of course being, that Russian hackers will rig the midterms as well, using their advanced Blockchain knowledge and Cryptoterrorism to flip upsidedown the very discourse of America on truth-based websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. /s
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't bother voting democrats, the Russians already rigged it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your vote doesn't matter. Stop convincing people to join your cult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Game's always been rigged you just don't like the results this time peasant.

       You do realize those are two different people, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is not that CNN has different people that say different things. The problem is that other sources have different people that just happen to all say the same things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, your attempt to mock CNN for hypocrisy proves something entirely different -- that CNN permits people with completely opposite views to get on and provide their perspectives.

       Mock CNN? It was simply a comparison with no extra words added. But the articles reflected the opinion of the time. I mean Obama did some whole speech saying the election couldn't be hacked -&gt;

       The notion that Obama says something and therefore it must be true is such juvenile partisan adherence. Anyway, here's the question that you begged for:

       If voting doesn't count why do the Republicans spend so much effort purging Democratic voters from the registration lists, year after year beginning in particular in that stolen 2000 election and increasing to both voter purging and special voting machines for 2004.

       Their efforts don't count because the Democrats just import more people who believe their "American ideologies" from other parts of the world to counterbalance.

       The joke that you apparently missed is that people who come from other countries and hate capitalism and vote democrat generally don't align very well with American nationalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       They hated the old country they lived in and they hate the new one too. It's almost as if life is what you make of it and your circumstances aren't always the fault of someone else.

       Some of our immigrant and their children are Republican, the Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees for example, and some from other nations as well are conservative, not liberal.

       A couple thoughts- 
First do you not think more people voting in general would be a good thing?-- and do you not think the upcoming midterms are "important"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your description of meddling in the previous and upcoming elections is at odds with most of people who're tasked with studying the topic, from intelligence agencies and investigators, to Congresspeople on both sides, to Trump and people appointed by him. Obviously many people don't trust the intel agencies or Congress or any of the reporting on the story, and just don't find the ongoing investigations compelling. That's fine, people disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, your "/s" description is a pretty...narrow view of the ongoing matter, if you have followed it and consider yourself familiar with all the various parts.  And while, again, that's fine- you do you, share your views- it's not very likely to convince anyone who believes otherwise or might be on the fence (people generally don't cotton to being called cultists or peasants). And if you don't want to win people over, what's the goal?
      </p>
      <p>
       No disrespect intended to OP or others, I just don't get what seems to be a lack of interest in understanding opponents' views (an issue with folks on all sides, no doubt).  Like, are people enjoying this bitter, divided political environment? Really want constant bickering to be the norm? I don't see much value in "winning" some political victory if it just further divides the nation. I do see value in employing at least the minimum amount of empathy for people who disagree, trying to understand where they're coming from, and focusing on the people who have power and use it poorly- rather than the hundreds of millions of everyday people we don't know personally, and as individuals tend to be pretty neighborly and reasonable.

       But are you concerned you might be limiting your face-rubbing effectiveness by not studying others' views and their reasoning? You know, in order to really convince them how idiotic their deeply held personal views are. Or in other words if I'm playing poker I'd be more worried about an opponent who understands what I'm trying to do and why, and can get a step ahead of me- rather than someone who just thinks I'm dumb.

       I should be more tolerant instead of calling James Alefantis a creepy faggot. My lack of tolerance makes me an American republican.

       Russians didn't hack the election.  The democrats simply lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can everyone put their big boy pants on and stop propping up the fake russian hysteria which was invented by the same Intel community that enjoys long walks on the beach and unseating democratically elected leaders all around the globe?
      </p>
      <p>
       They lost one here for the first time in a long time and they are literally using you to reverse the election.  Just like they prop up radicals in South America, the Mideast, East Asia etc etc etc.  The United States is NOT off limits to their spycraft BS.
