       I've come across some sources that say the planet isn't "hollow" in the sense that there's literally nothing in the center, but that it is instead honeycombed throughout various layers under the surface - which would make sense.  It's said to be very cavernous for many miles beneath the uppermost layer most of us humans live on.

       you can actually see them flying by with the naked eye if its dark enough. Theres sites that will tell you exactly where they will be as well. satellite imagery for weather would be a hard one to pull off.

       I know i have been watching these things for years now, but in now way are they satellites. We are told they are the size of a bus, but in no way could something of that size be visible from a few thousand miles.
IMO they are very sophisticated high altitude drones that have a strong wide angle light reflector attached to the bottom.
We all know that jet fuel is a total hoax and that the jet engines only need fuel to start up. Then it just runs on air. Its called a overunity engine look it up. Many people that are not corrupt had amazing breakthroughs. Look at teslas work for example. He invented free energy that worked wireless and we are still paying for it today.

       The things are the size of a bus, but they have big solar panels facing the sun. Its like a big mirror up there, planes are made to dull the sunlight if anythingThe air and fuel combust when they are compressed, so you have that huge amount of air compressing and becoming explosive the jetfuel gives the extra thrust required for jet liners, but you still need to drive the compressor and produce all the power required in an airline. Commercial jets are fking awesome when you think about it. But they use ALLLL that air and a tiny bit of jetfuel....thats how jets work....
      </p>
      <p>
       yeah.... i know they have lied in weather.... in suspect n that as well, but flat earth doesnt work.... its not correct, but i think they ARE lying about space.... i know they do all kinds of things, but there are live weather satellites that update the whole planet,and if you go outside the clou is actually there as it was updated, so they have stuff up there for sure.

       Also look up the deep drilling experiments undertaken in Russia and Germany. In all cases things get much hotter sooner than expected, hydrogen gas starts bubbling out, things which contradict the mainstream models of the earth.

       The Kola superdeep borehole in Russia, 12.26 km
      </p>
      <p>
       The KTB superdeep borehole in Germany, 9.1 km deep
      </p>
      <p>
       Both projects encountered:
      </p>
      <p>
       -temperatures twice as high as expected (180 °C recorded)
      </p>
      <p>
       -fractured rock, saturated with water
      </p>
      <p>
       -extracted material (mud) boiling with hydrogen
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it in perspective, the depth of Kola was about 0.19% of the distance from surface to center. Not much deeper than the Marianas trench is from sea level. We've only scratched the surface and already our theoretical models our way out of whack with the observations.

       I think people just want you to admit you were wrong and acknowledge that you were misinformed and own it. Saying "K" when thoroughly rebuked in an argument is just childish. I don't think it was rude but you're engaging in a discussion, made an assertion, and were proved wrong. That's not a bad thing. That's why we do this at all. Just admit it though. Doesn't make you lesser.

       It's become a religion, based completely on faith and wishful thinking. Like religion, evidence, facts and logic are completely anathema, and the proliferation of videos on YouTube and the like only serve to feed their fantasies.

       and thats the real mystery or conspiracy to me.  it must be orchestrated. there must be a willfull push behind it, because people are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       this stupid, and even when they are it wont manifest in outlandish conspiracy theories.  maybe there is a concerted effort to return humanity to the dark ages and obviously satanic characters like eric dubay are doing their part... its fishy

       I hate to say it, but I think some of them are that stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think some of that is historical - it's how they've been brought up, particularly where religion is involved; they've been taught that everything in there religious texts is 100% accurate, because if you start questioning what you've been taught, then how much of that book is wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       More recently, I think it's a failure of the education system, not teaching critical thinking, and also the internet. Anyone now can post videos on YouTube and make it seem like they know what they're talking about, whilst they're actually talking complete nonsense. Ignorant people view these videos and like them, because they seem plausible to them. Before you know it you've got people pointing at airliners producing contrails and screaming "CHEM-TRAILS!!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It might also be because it's fashionable to distrust anything told to you by people in authority, or people with years of training and experience behind them, and to cry that everything is fake. Space flight, satellites, fossils, dinosaurs, the shape of the planet, etc. etc.

       You all claim that it's stupid. But in the past people called everyone else stupid for entertaining the idea that the Earth revolves around the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in this world is certain. There are a lot of mysteries out there and it's possible that a hollow Earth does exist. It's possible it's also a figment of someone's imagination as well. Who really knows

       It's not new, and it's not stupid like the flat Earth stuff. There are many, many myths going back a long way in history all over the world. There are also unexplained observations such as animals migrating to the north in the winter, the Northern Lights (orthodox explanations are lame) and some interesting firsthand accounts, some of which are semi-plausible like Olaf Jensen who went missing two years with his father when they sailed north from Norway (?) and returned with a wild story about the hollow Earth. He was institutionalized but felt strongly enough to commit his experience to a book before he died.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not as dumb as flat Earth and is a fun idea to entertain.

       it is just as dumb, because multiple expeditions went to both poles and saw nothing like the hollow earthers claim to be there.  planes flew over the poles and the crew saw nothing either, furthermore sats in polar orbit recorded nothing extraordinary and there is a lot of those going around.  there is
       <em>
        no evidence
       </em>
       of any kind which is not suprising because the laws of physics wont permit it anyway.  furthermore if you look at other planets and moons in our solar system you will also fail to observe any polar holes (its even ridiculous to write this down), why would the earth display different characteristics?  its just not how the universe/nature works.  only people alienated from reality and nature would entertain outlandish ideas sucha as this.
      </p>
      <p>
       the only real possibility is, as i wrote in my previous comment is that there is money and power involved in this deception, to fleece the gullible.  therefore i consider all flat and hollow earther either as dangerously stupid individuals or even worse, evil deceptive scammers without scrupules who are out there to make a buck, or for, even worse yet, to return humanity to the dark ages on behalf of the powers that shouldn be...  the only question is, in which category you belong?  are you dumb, are you a satanist shill, or are you a scammer?

       It's a pretty awesome theory to me. I even went outta my way to buy the book Journey To The Center Of The Earth by Jules Verne's. I haven't finished it, but reading it so far, it is good. It's not so in depth with the theories that come along with Hollow Earth, but the story is inspiring hahah. I personally believe that the Earth has a ton of layers to it, and we under estimate just how small we are compared to this floating world. So, it's not so crazy to think that within this world we stand on, there is another world underneath. A world within a world. But... sadly, most of us may never know.

       Lmao it’s much more likely to be flat than a sphere that curves at a rate of 8 inches per mile squared. In fact, the world could be both flat and hollow, but there is definitely no good evidence to believe it is a sphere.

       I have no idea. But I do think we should be focusing our time and money exploring all the things we don't know about the planet we are currently on, rather than say, trying to colonize Mars. Besides if the surface goes to shit, it sure would be nice to know if there were places we could go to survive.

       I will tell you why I'm against them. Because they are some of the clearest examples, IMO, of the outcome of terrible education policies that governments have REALLY done as a conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy isn't that the earth is flat or that it's hollow.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's that world-wide, most people don't get a decent education that gives them the ability to actually reason things out effectively. And that's because governments don't want their citizens to be smart.

       Those are near polar orbits, not polar orbits. Planes are not allowed to fly directly over the poles either, according to some pilots I've met.

       There is not a single answer to this as there are so many types of orbits. But, the satellites i watched were low earth orbit[leo]. Our low earth orbit satellites would orbit the earth, the entire planet, in about 90 minutes. and our constellation had 45 to 65 satellites at any one time active.

       My thoughts are similar to Expanding Earth theorists.  The Earth is exponentially expanding.  Models of dinosaurs being replicated in 3D programs are revealing that in our current gravity and physics - most skeletal structures of Dinosaurs would crack (neck and ankles).  The T-Rex could only walk, any faster and it's legs would crush under the weight (how would it ever catch prey?).  It's neck would snap if looking to the side while moving.  Some top tier predator eh?  unless.. the gravity/parameters on Earth were different.
      </p>

       Pangaea makes a lot more sense as not just an island in the middle of a giant ocean, but rather the entire planet was void of saltwater oceans and Pangaea WAS Earth in it's entirety.  People have puzzled together the Pangaea model and stitched it together on it's opposing ends, and it fits together perfectly (without the giant oceans) - making Earth magnitudes smaller.   Some thoughts are that the Salt Water oceans were cataclysmic remnants from Tiamat (our neighboring Ocean Planet that is now the asteroid belt - once shown like a Second Sun in the sky a la Tatooine).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are myths of a time that speak of an Earth with only "sweet water" and no grand oceans.  So to come back to the Hollow Earth.. I think that what we may perceive as Hollow Earth may in fact be Earth from a time immemorial (smaller in diameter, and thus "within our current Earth).  Other theories are that during our cyclical Cataclysms, people create underground cities to weather the storm.  These cities are stumbled across after their use was long forgotten and people believe it to be a world unto it's own.  Alternatively, some think that the paths to Agartha and the Hollow Earth are just portals in caves etc that transport a person to a different place/time (and people believe it to be within the Earth).

       I would love to hear what facts and evidence you have to support your conclusions.  Not only is the skeletal structure already beyond it's weight limits, but to add another mating dinosaurs on top of that does sound ludicrous.  Can you point me towards any articles or videos that further expand upon what you say?

       Dinosaurs were theorised in the 1840s by 2 Freemasons and “discovered” in the 1850s. No full dinosaur skeleton had ever been found, that’s admittedly.

       There exists a mountain of anomalies in geology that suggest our understanding of what is beneath our feet is anything but certain.  People that use seismic waves as a defence of the globe being solid have never looked deeper into how seismic waves actually function.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are numerous myths from older cultures about civilisations under the ground, even refuges used by surface cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we can suspend our current dogmatic thinking in terms of science being 100% correct about its theories, as well as the notion that humans were stupid up until a century ago and older cultures just made up stories cause they were ignorant, we'll see that there is a very serious possibility that the Earth is either hollow or honeycombed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally after reading some books on the subject I'm convinced by the geological anomalies alone. Let alone the mythological evidence.

       It drives me nuts how we're supposed to believe in "science" as if it were gospel truth. Science has been proving itself wrong since Aristotle -- not that that's bad. If the Earth is hollow, I would bet that there are scientists who are well aware of this and not allowed to talk about it.

       It's the dogmatic beliefs built up around science that's the issue I feel. It's become just another religious mystery school where a priest type class are the gatekeepers to knowledge that they feed to the masses. Only they are worthy to interpret the cosmos and only they can say with certainty how the world around us works. All hail the cult of $cience.

       Wha....literally if you proved that the earth was hollow, without just throwing words around and broke it down with a published and sourced study with peer-review you would be able to change scientists minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The leap your base descriptions of reasoning without sources to being able to critique a process, not a conclusion, is a little grandiose no?
If you had to prove something, imperically, would you not try to show as much evidence as possible? Then confirm that evidence with other sources? Then have someone check your work to confirm and sift through any discrepancy you might miss? And if you found nothing, given all the funding you needed, would you then sigh and admit that the Earth might not be hollow?
Theory, research, Analyses on findings...thats the process of science. You lamenting this won't change anything, so of course it will appear as if you are kept out. Go prove it. If you do it credibly people will listen.

       Here's the problem with suggesting that people believe science as if it were a gospel truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       YES, science deals in theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when enough data is gathered, enough experiments are replicated and enough evidence from multiple angles and experiments match up and back each other, the theories end up being pretty damn good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not always perfect, no. Which is why sometimes science changes its mind (but not nearly as often as conspiracy theorists tend to believe it does. There's a LOT of bad info running in the conspiracy world and it actually tends to get repeated more often because it's the 'truth' that people are desperately seeking).
      </p>
      <p>
       But a 'theory' in science is NOT the same as a religious belief. Beliefs, by definition, have no rigorous research or peer reviewed reports or anything of the kind. In fact, most religions argue that any -proof- or evidence defeats the entire purpose of 'having faith'.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not how science works. Scientists DO test things. And sometimes they don't have all the answers. But the answers they HAVE are a lot more likely to be true than someone's gut feeling or anecdotal evidence or mythology or anything else that conspiracy theorists often run with.

       Most seismic waves only go down a distance of 400km before they either bounce off something or disappear; the auras are mirrored at the poles, so the northern lights have the same patterns as the southern lights simultaneously; the deepest holes drilled by man constantly prove the theoretical models wrong in terms of heat, pressure, density etc; current models of the creation of the solar system don't allow for a solid planet as the centrifugal force would push the heaviest matter away from the centre of the mass.
      </p>

       They are just off the top of my head. The video goes into quite a few of them. If you're really interested track down a book called
       <em>
        Hollow Planets: A feasibility study
       </em>
       by Jan Lamprecht. That has a wealth of information in it that seriously makes you doubt that earth is solid.

       thought about it being a possibility. could be that most planets are hollow and life starts on the inside until conditions are right on the surface (if ever). some huge craters on the moon have peaks in the center that would indicate that it could be hollow because it swallows whatever massive objects impact the surface. earth also rings like a bell when massive earthquakes or impacts happen. the HAARP facility can ping the earth and see a lot more than prospectors looking for oil and gas.

       I posted a thread about this some time ago. There was this guy who debunks this myth. This diary was fake. Admiral Byrd never wrote it. One of the strongest and most obvious arguments about is that in this diary "he" says the expedition to the North Pole was on the 4th of February. That's the dead of the winter. It's completely dark there during that time. And the whole February as well. So he couldn't have seen mountains, vegetation, etc. No sane pilot would choose this date for such expedition. The author of the article also said that this story was fabricated as a distraction for what's really on the Pole. Also you can check the map - (not sure south or north pole though) There are areas named after Rockefeller , he sponsored some of the expeditions.

       this diary of Admiral Byrd was proven to be fake. Look it up. One of the arguments supporting this - 4th February, when the alleged expedition took place - it's completely dark on the North Pole. The whole February as well. He couldn't have seen mountains, vegetation, etc. It's the dead of the winter and no sane pilot would choose this date for a polar expedition. The whole story was a cover up for whats really on the poles.

       I was under the impression that when it gets "dark" for months at a time in the winter, it's actually more like a dim twilight rather than pitch black.

       I mean the earth is at least partially hollow caves and whatnot so it's less of if the world is hollow but more to what extent does the hollow go... and what lies inside. There are many examples of cave painting and civilizations that have lived there maybe some people went deeper instead of out

       I dont think its impossible for there to be some hollow spaces down there, as to how huge they are... how can anyone know unless theyve been there?  if there are lizard people living there, whether there is or not or other alien species to even the nazis..., how am I to know that.

       and thats the real mystery or conspiracy to me.  it must be orchestrated. there must be a willfull push behind it, because people are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       this stupid, and even when they are it wont manifest in outlandish conspiracy theories.  maybe there is a concerted effort to return humanity to the dark ages and obviously satanic characters like eric dubay are doing their part... its fishy
