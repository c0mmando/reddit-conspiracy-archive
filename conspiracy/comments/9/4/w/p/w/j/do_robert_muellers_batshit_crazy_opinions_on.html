       ever since the election of Donald Trump,
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       has been inundated with new users who are quite sure that none of the "conspiracy theories" that we discussed before the election had any merit whatsoever
      </p>
      <p>
       but now that Trump is in office, these same users who used to mock us for anything we discussed, are now totally convinced that Robert Mueller will present his official Trump-Russia conspiracy theory any day now
      </p>
      <p>
       but in the meantime, i hope the old-school users of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       take every chance they can to mock the Trump-Russia pushers as "conspiracy theorists", they same way they have done to us for many years

       "oh you think Trump and Russia colluded? you must be a paranoid-schizophrenic with borderline personality disorder, who is also a LWNJ, frothing-at-the-mouth, bat-shit-crazy, tin-foil-hat-wearing conspiracy theorist who needs to have his meds adjusted! have you seen your mental health care provider lately ?

       So you have no idea what Mueller has, but you are sure it's going to lead to Trump impeachment?
      </p>
      <p>
       You should probably start thinking about how to recruit a better candidate for 2020 rather than being fixated on making excuses for 2016

       Here one for you OP, "
       <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-were-sharing-3-million-russian-troll-tweets/">
        If some one thinks 3 million Russian troll tweets over a two year period influenced the election
       </a>
       is nuts considering
       <a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/twitter-statistics/">
        there is 500 million tweets a day... 400 billion over two years
       </a>
       ... to act like .0000075 percent of tweets that were decisive split the nation and got Trump in office is delusional.  It's been my biggest issue with this who investigation and narrative.  Look, I know Trumps corrupt and a peace of shit, I don't support the guy, but the Russian influence story doesn't even add up when you look at the over arching idea behind it.  Honestly I think It's a false flag to justify a crack down on social media to install a similar system they have in China where accounts have to be tied to you with a social credit score.

       I have the same issues and the so called trolls appear to just be shitty marketers trying to get likes and follows. I haven't seen any definitive link to the Kremlin just yet. Like you I'm most definitely not a Trump guy but I try to not be gullible either, especially since we're dealing with alphabet agencies. Given his role in the Iraq war lead up and the aftermath/"investigation" of 9/11, I certainly can't trust anything from Mueller without overwhelming evidence, and even then it's probably fabricated. I try to live by a simple rule: if the govt badly wants us to believe something, it's probably a lie.

       You seem really hung up on the idea that anyone who believes in the Trump Russia conspiracy hates other conspiracy theories and theorists, which is simply untrue.

       let me put it another way.
      </p>
      <p>
       before the 2016 election, anyone who dabbled in any kind of conspiracy theory was considered a RWNJ by default
      </p>
      <p>
       you think vaccines cause autism? you must be a GOP!
      </p>
      <p>
       you think WTC 7 was controlled demolition? you must be GOP!
      </p>
      <p>
       you think Pearl Harbor was a MIHOP? you must be GOP!
      </p>
      <p>
       you think Nathan Sproul, Colin Small, and Karl Rove should be tried for Voter Registration Fraud? You must be GOP!
      </p>
      <p>
       etc etc etc
      </p>
      <p>
       so now, after the 2016 election,
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       has been flooded with LWNJ's who are utterly convinced that their particular conspiracy theory is more than just a theory, because evidence and stuff
      </p>
      <p>
       and of course, the pre-2016
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       subscribers laugh at this particular conspiracy theory, because we were watching as it all unfolded, and we can't be bullshitted by the media or those who regurgitate it as their own original thoughts
      </p>
      <p>
       take Carter Page, for example... your average LWNJ knows a lot less than your average RWNJ
      </p>
      <p>
       have you even read his wikipedia page yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Page">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Page
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       so, there is some validity to...

       i do talk to people. like, right now for example. answering everything point by point
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't get angry at others. i sincerely appreciate the debate. i have learned far more from talking to people i disagree with than talking with people i agree with
      </p>
      <p>
       heck, it was by talking to a person who still believed that men had walked on the moon that i learned about "LaGrange Points" and another believer helped me find a very specific photograph in NASA photo archive, which he thought was going to prove his point but i feel it proved my point better.

       I think the main difference is one has enough evidence to have a special prosecutor and indictments and you know, legal stuff...and the rest of it is just paranoid theories people come up with to say about people they don't like.

       Let's just stop and examine the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       That with Russian assistance, voters were tricked into voting for President Trump.  Yet Clinton had the assistance of the billionaires, media and the Democratic Party but these small group with less resources beat them at marketing their candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the amount of posts from Russia there is nothing unusual and the percentage is small.  If they are claiming that the uncovering of the wrongdoing by Clinton is manipulation then I don't know what they think that the role of journalists is but it can't be good for freedom of the press.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not forget the role of those that said they would "stop" Trump.

       So far nobody has been able to put up credible evidence to support Robert Mueller's crazy conspiracy theory.

       And yet, in spite of being faced with the glaring lack of evidence, the tubes go on believing Russia installed a puppet dictator in the White House
