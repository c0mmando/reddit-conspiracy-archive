<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/d8Y0JNu.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/d8Y0JNu.jpg</a></p>

<p>This is the map of the lane I live. My house is at D site. People go outside from D house have to pass through the lane between A and B house and their parking lot. Sometime ago I found owners of A and B each has a vehicle parking deadly at their garage lot(at least more than a year or two, or longer). To my experience, it&#39;s a surveillance car equipped with camera or censor. To alarm the outside surveillance station that their targets is leaving so they could track. </p>

<p>About two weeks ago, my wife gave me a letter, said, &quot;It&#39;s a mistake. You go and give the letter to A neighbor.&quot; The letter came from Home Owner Association. It said they found an inoperative car on our site. It violated the rule so we must remove it. The picture showed it was Vehicle A. It was a mistake shouldn&#39;t made by Home Owners Association. Consider they are the tool of the FBI, I think the Feds is framing new plot. I didn&#39;t go to neighbor A, worrying that could be a trap. </p>

<p>Seeing I was indifferent to the letter, my wife took it back. On 8/1, Vehicle A was towed away. The Feds had planed to damage my garage door last August. From the map of lane, you can see how Vehicle A becomes an obstacle of a roaring in car to impact the garage door. In reality, the Feds parked Vehicle A to the center as near as possible to ensure the best efficiency of censor. Make a right turn difficult to do. </p>

<li>Sessions and garage door (8/21/2017)</li>
</ol>

<p>In 2005, my rolling up garage door was broken up by the car my daughter drove. The </p>

<p>Homeowners Association warned to fix it right away. I noticed the Feds drove the </p>

<p>contractors from the market away so their men could take over the work for an </p>

<p>unreasonable search and arrest. 12 years ago, I wrote,  </p>

<p>[quote] (300.) Garage door (3/27/05)</p>

<p>On 3/18, Mercury News reported: &quot;Unlicensed contractors get stung&quot;. 59 unlicensed </p>

<p>builders were nabbed in an undercover sting operation. Those nabbed by the ruse were </p>

<p>given criminal citations that could land them in jail for a maximum of six months, or </p>

<p>they could be ordered to pay a $1,000 fine.&quot; </p>

<p>That&#39;s amazing similar to the event taken place in July 2003. When Feds tried to force </p>

<p>me to have a roof contract with them, they created a roofing worker&#39;s death to </p>

<p>intimidate other uninsured roofers out of the market. So the undercover contractor could </p>

<p>get the deal. (see &quot;145. SARS, a big issue(7/20/03)&quot; [/quote]</p>

<p>To avoid an unreasonable search, I repaired the garage door. It&#39;s more then ten years </p>

<p>now, the repaired garage door had worn out and had to be replaced. In late May, the </p>

<p>Homeowner Association mailed me a notice that there would be a meeting. I knew that was </p>

<p>to justify an inspection. The target was the garage door. </p>

<p>In mid June, my wife gave me a weekly magazine - &quot;USCITYPOST&quot;(June 17, 2017) In its </p>

<p>&quot;Business Classified&quot;, I found four advertisement of &quot;Garage door&quot; contractors. In </p>

<p>newspaper commercial, &quot;Garage door&quot; is a rare. That four ads obviously were prepared for </p>

<p>me. To avoid being framed by the Feds, I had to do it by myself. I thought of the </p>

<p>original one piece garage door which I hadn&#39;t abandoned. </p>

<p>The Homeowners Association&#39;s meeting date was set on 7/26. I had to replace the garage </p>

<p>door at that time. In mid July, I dug out the old one piece door. What surprised me was </p>

<p>next day President Trump told media he was going to fire Sessions. </p>

<p>[quote] Can Trump fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions? Yes, but it would be </p>

<p>unprecedented
Maureen Groppe and Jessica Estepa, USA TODAY      July 20, 2017 </p>

<p>In an interview with the New York Times, the president on Wednesday slammed Sessions for </p>

<p>recusing himself from the Russia investigation, believing that this action led to the </p>

<p>appointment of a special counsel.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/07/20/can-trump-fire-">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/07/20/can-trump-fire-</a></p>

<p>attorney-general-jeff-sessions-yes-but-would-unprecedented/495537001/ [/quote]</p>

<p>Trump is unqualified to be president. His victory was out of the support of the Feds.</p>

<p>(FBI) Now I believe his main task is to eliminate me - Kat Sung. When they thought it </p>

<p>was a certain, they didn&#39;t expect I dug out an old door. So Trump was so angry. They </p>

<p>quickly plan new plots in rogue&#39;s way. </p>

<p>On Aug. 3, a &quot;Fed Express&quot; cart roared into the lane, not for delivery, but turned </p>

<p>around to drive out. 
Then came the PG&amp;E engineer pick up to replace the gas meter of my house. </p>

<p>I think they have two plans: 1. To create a gas leaking. 2. To damage newly installed </p>

<p>garage door to force a replacement. I believe so because two days later, a US Mail cart </p>

<p>rushed into the lane too. Both cars rushed in with high speed that caused large noise. </p>

<p>That was not the way to move in small lane. As for why changed a mail car later? The </p>

<p>&quot;Fed Express&quot; cart is too big and long, not easy to aim the target in a lane. The mail </p>

<p>car is smaller and easy to carry out the impact mission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though it&#39;s hard to believe, I&#39;m the target of the Feds (FBI) for decades. Last year&#39;s Las Vegas mass slaughter was part of my case, and other big case. Google my name to find my posting. </p>

<p>(985.) Las Vegas shooting is a false flag (10/8/2017)</p>

<p>Las Vegas mass slaughtering was a distraction case done by the Feds(FBI and DEA).  </p>

<p>I am the murder target of the Feds(FBI and DEA). Since I stay at home to avoid being set up, They used to organize tours for my relatives to justify a search and arrest. To cover up the framed case from the sight of public, they used to activate big events to distract. My wife were arranged two tours recently. All follow this style. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>9/2 to 9/8, my wife had a tour to Canada. 
On 8/31, I wrote in #979[quote] What will be big event used to distract public&#39;s attention? I think    it is war in Korea Peninsula.[/quote]
9/3,(next day to 9/2), N. Korea exploded a nuclear bomb. If Trump kept his promise of &quot;Fire and       fury&quot;, there would have been a Korea war. </p></li>
<li><p>10/2 to 10/18, my wife had a tour to Europe. 
On 9/25, in #983, I said,[quote]&quot;The framed case is going on. My wife said she&#39;ll go another trip      to Europe from 10/2 to 10/18. So something will happen at that time.&quot;[/quote]
10/1, LasVegas mass slaughter took place. (My wife left home at 10/1 evening, around 17pm. she said  the plane would leave at 12:55. What she meant was 0:55 of Oct.2)</p></li>
<li><p>News said Stephen Paddock might also planned other shooting case in August. It coincides with the murder plot of August. Paddock booked two bedrooms from 8/1 to 8/6 in Blackstone hotel in Chicago which overviews the park where the Lollapalooza music festival took place.(8/2 to 8/5) </p></li>
</ol>

<p>That was the time when I alleged the Feds would create a gas explosion murder on me. (Aug. 3)</p>

<p>[quote]974. Prepare for a gas leaking (8/9/2017)</p>

<p>On 8/3, a P.G.&amp; E engineer truck drove in my lane. A worker changed the gas meter of my house. I saw him checked my neighborhood but my house was the only one he had worked at. He left hurriedly after I asking him why there was no notice in advance. I called p.G.&amp; E that night. The operator confirmed there was a meter change that day but she didn&#39;t know why. Billing is normal. I allege that was an operation of the Feds. They could have installed some device in that new meter which may cause leaking to their control. Three months ago P.G.&amp; E had a commercial in TV Chinese channel to apologize for deaths caused by gas leaking explosion six years ago. Now they are in action. It can be an explosion murder or an unreasonable search in the name of gas leaking. </p>

<p>But honestly, if the FBI wanted you dead, then you&#39;d be dead. I do not think they are that inept that they have wanted you dead for decades and have not accomplished it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly this sounds like extreme paranoia. Take a step back, deep breath, read this yourself and see how it sounds.</p>

<p>Should the government actually want to imprison you, they could simply arrest you on false grounds. There would be no need to tinker with you door.</p>

<p>Try meditation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He doesn&#39;t answer comments on here. I don&#39;t know if he still posts on other forums. It just showed that he used to post on other forums years ago.</p>

<p>He uses the same username on other forums. So do a search and google or duckduckgo search and you will see his other stuff.</p>

<p>Yes, he seems really paranoid and delusional. But I&#39;m sure his family knows. He mentions a wife, so she has to know all this.</p>
