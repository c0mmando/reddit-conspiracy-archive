       We used to receive free milk everyday in school from the ages of 4 to 11. Its disgusting to think that this programme was directed at naive children who have no knowledge of the dangers of fluoride consumption, and no way to know they were part of an experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heres the document if anyone wants to check if they took part, it has the locations and details of fluoridation programmes that were carried out worldwide.

       I was researching the toxic chemical fluoride and the reasons why some governments spend a lot of money to make sure its put in the tap water but in some other countries it is banned!

       After reading through that document i i found was shocked to see that my area was targeted in a government fluoridation programme. If you got milk in school it may be worth checking if you were part of a programme too.

       Sorry, I thought my sarcasm was clear. Whenever someone starts telling me about fluoride they always link to some YouTube conspiracy channel so I can educate myself.

       Where are you getting that imformation? Singapore is the only country in the world that fluoridates 100% of their water supplyy, and similarly they have the highest prevalence of dental fluorosis on the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, you don't need to consume an Olympic swimming pool-sized volume of fluoridated water to develop dental fluorosis - you just need to consume the standard fluoridated dose daily once the course of your adolescent development. Hell, you don't even have to live in Singapore to develop dental fluorosis. In any country that fluoridates any % of their water supply you'll encounter individuals exhibiting this, just look for the white spots on people's teeth.

       Wait, he says Singapore is the only country who adds fluoride at those levels to all drinking water and you say other countries use similar levels?

       When I said level I meant percentage of fluoridation overall, which in Singapore's case is 100% of national water supply fluoridation at a level of 0.5ppm (down from 0.7ppm in 1958).

       So, because there’s a larger (100%) portion of the counter fluoridated, that somehow increases the rate that individuals get fluorosis?

       You’re not really correct there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are roughly 190 countries in the world. Your list is 13.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s not even touching the fact that of the countries you listed,
      </p>
      <p>
       -Sweden is naturally fluoridated, and doesn’t need to fluoridate water. They didn’t “ban” anything other than adding extra, because some municipalities took it to 1.5 PPM.
      </p>
      <p>
       -China is also naturally fluoridated, and is “banned” for a similar reason as above.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Austria never considered it, due to naturally high fluoridation levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Belgium passed laws to allow it, but hasn’t yet done so, due to naturally high fluoridation levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Denmark has naturally high levels, but didn’t “reject” anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       -France fluoridates salt, but you’re otherwise correct. Again, not rejected so much as not implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Greece you’re correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       -India has incredibly high levels of natural fluoridation, similar to China, to the point of needing to reduce the levels. Hardly “rejected.”
      </p>
      <p>
       -Japan does in school fluoride rinses.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Latvia you’re correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mexico you’re correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Norway has taken no action, not rejected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Netherlands you’re correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Croatia never did, so it’s not discontinued.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Czech Republic does fluoridated table salt, otherwise you’re correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finland is naturally fluoridated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Germany you’re correct, though more to do with the fact that it ended during reunification than a policy plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hungary had technical difficulties starting so they have not done so.

       Kind of surprised people here don't know more about the hands of fluoride, even at "safe" doses. While there is benefit to topical application (toothpaste, mouthwash), there is no need to consume it. 50 studies have linked fluoride with reduced IQ in children, including a Harvard study.

       Don't you think there are cheaper ways of avoiding the costs of disposing it safely? Like... digging a deep hole and pouring it there? Or... secretly pouring it in the ocean? Don't those sound cheaper and more practical than setting up a giant scheme in which the entire population of the world is fooled and willfully poisoned...?

       They might be ‘cheaper’ if pouring it into the ground or ocean wasn’t extremely harmful to the environment. The lawsuits from people being harmed by it leaking into ground water in higher concentrations or killing natural life in the area. So yes, cheaper to dilute it and pump it into an ignorant population and run a PR campaign to have them thank you for it

       <em>

       Also in case you were wondering, it has been clearly demonstrated that fluoride prevents cavities in the teeth of children, and there has been a remarkable decline in the number of cavities in children in this country since tap water has been fluoridated and fluoride toothpaste has been introduced.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is evidence of this and research done by professional doctors backing this up and actually none backing up that fluoride is dangerous in any way in such small amounts.

       In small amounts? It's in everything. You get a tiny bit in water, in food, in toothpaste, in your shower water, etc. Fluoride doesn't leave the body. It builds up and calcifies in the pineal gland. Dumb fuck.

       Something being published in a scientific journal is not an inherent sign of scientific backing. Especially because biomedcentral is an open-access publisher. It doesn’t do peer-review. 
The lancet neurology piece is a well-known debunked piece that wasn’t actually published in the full lancet because of the need to retract it.

       Your second article is about lead, methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, arsenic, and toluene and manganese, fluoride, chlorpyrifos, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, and the polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Do you know what it says about fluoride after it's mentioned
       <em>
        once
       </em>
       ? Further characterisation of the dose–response association would be desirable. That means they don't have enough information to make a sound conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the last one, that sentence means they couldn't find a specific empirical study on adult men that met the exact guidelines they were asking for. It has nothing to do with fluoride being dangerous. At all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you linked one fundementally flawed study that received brutal peer reviews (you can read them on the site) and two irrelevant medical links that looked good without reading them. Alright.

       That's not too bad, really. It's stronger than the fluoride content used in civic water, but it's at 200 doses per year, it's about the same as drinking well water.

       Yes, I minimize this because is close to half as much as is found in common toothpaste, or three litres of tap water in most cities, and far less than a treatment from a dentist. Everyone in the study would have been fine.

       Because they didn't fluoridate water or toothpaste, and not everyone could afford to go to the dentist. Most of these studies are from decades ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoride in school milk is a good way to ensure every kids, regardless of economic status, get the fluoride treatment to prevent cavities. A study is done to check results and allow comparison to other methods of delivery. Might as well know if what you're doing is actually helping.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all routine. You need to take in quite a bit of fluoride before problems occur, and I'm pretty sure the milk jug challenge proved this delivery method is reasonably safe -- but I reckon tap water is easier for delivery.

       I would agree but studies have shown drinking fluoride does nothing to help with cavities. Listen to what you’re saying, drinking a toxic substance and ingesting it in your stomach and bowels ISNT helping your teeth. Yes it may work in the dentist office in small quantitative but you don’t need to drink it. Listen to yourself. Drink a toxin to help prevent cavities? Is that even worth it?

       It's also only toxic in the same way that everything else is toxic: if I give you a massive dose of nearly anything, it'll have a toxic effect. Water, oxygen, vitamins and minerals, they all will kill you if I give you enough.

        There is very little contemporary evidence, meeting the review's inclusion criteria, that has evaluated the effectiveness of water fluoridation for the prevention of caries.
       </p>
       <p>
        The available data come predominantly from studies conducted prior to 1975, and indicate that water fluoridation is effective at reducing caries levels in both deciduous and permanent dentition in children. Our confidence in the size of the effect estimates is limited by the observational nature of the study designs, the high risk of bias within the studies and, importantly, the applicability of the evidence to current lifestyles. The decision to implement a water fluoridation programme relies upon an understanding of the population's oral health behaviour (e.g. use of fluoride toothpaste), the availability and uptake of other caries prevention strategies, their diet and consumption of tap water and the movement/migration of the population. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether water fluoridation results in a change in disparities in caries levels across SES. We did not identify any evidence, meeting the review's inclusion criteria, to determine the effectiveness of water fluoridation for preventing caries in adults.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is insufficient information to determine the effect on caries levels of stopping water fluoridation programmes.

       A large study was conducted in New Zealand. There, the New Zealand  National Health Service plan examined the teeth of every child in key  age groups, and found that the teeth of children in non-fluoridated  cities were slightly better than those in the fluoridated cities.  (Colquhoun, J. "

       In 1995, neurotoxicologist and former Director of Toxicology at  Forsyth Dental Center in Boston, Dr. Phyllis Mullenix, published  research showing that fluoride built up in the brains of animals when  exposed to moderate levels. Damage to the brain occurred and the  behavior patterns of the animals were adversely effected. Offspring of  pregnant animals receiving relatively low doses of fluoride showed  permanent effects to the brain which were seen as hyperactivity  (ADD-like symptoms). Young animals and adult animals given fluoride  experienced the opposite effect -- hypoactivity or sluggishness. The  toxic effects of fluoride on the central nervous system was subsequently  confirmed by previously classified government research. Two new  epidemiological studies which tend to confirm fluoride's neurotoxic  effects on the brain have shown that children exposed to higher levels  of fluoride have lower IQs.

       This is just so untrue and a perfect example of confirmation bias. Try citing something reputable and maybe reading how fluoride actually works in the oral cavity. 
And just because something is a toxin...doesnt mean it cant be beneficial in low doses.

       If we ration it in milk or water, the chances of actually poisoning yourself with fluoride is near zero: you can't retain that much water to overdose on the fluoride in it, and we're only going to give out one milk per day.

       Once fluoride is in the water, it's elemental fluoride in solution, plus either trace minerals of sodium, or trace minerals of calcium plus whatever the hell dissolved it. It's not a totally different compound by the time you get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll stick with the sodium, thank you. I'm a little more concerned about what you'd have to add to avoid scaling with calcium.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no difference, except the mineral content of your water. Sodium isn't a problem, our body can deal with that -- even needs some. But it really isn't much -- milligrams per liter.

       Sodium fluoride also is not just sodium. Do you know how compounds work? As my previous message said, I think you are being very disingenuous if you cannot see that the two compounds are different, and will have different effects on the human body.

       You seem to be repeating yourself, rather than providing any reasoning. So, I'll repeat myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, there aren't the same. But, once dissolved in water, you get the fluoride all on its own, no matter which you start from. That's how dissolving things in water works: they break into their constituent elements.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we've been doing things with waste products for centuries, because
       <em>
        that's not how chemistry works
       </em>
       . And this is the absolute
       <em>
        shittiest
       </em>
       way of disposing of it, because fluoridation requires absolutely tiny quantities of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluorine also has value as a feedstock for numerous chemical processes -- they never really needed a place to get rid of it.

       I am repeating myself because it's obvious you are not listening to any reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sodium fluoride is not the same as the naturally occurring calcium fluoride. They both react differently inside the body, because they are both different compounds with different elements present, so they cannot possibly react the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry but waste products from pesticides should not be getting added to our food or water. Crazy to think it's ok 'because past'...

       Thank fuck I live in a country that does not add fluoride to our drinking water. Probably partly the reason we have the best tasting water in the world : )

       Okay. But you can't drink calcium fluoride: it doesn't dissolve in water. You'd be drinking elemental fluoride, dissolved in water.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, they don't react differently in the body, because sodium fluoride actually dissolves in water, so you get sodium and fluoride seperately.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is really simple chemistry, high school stuff.

       Calcium fluoride is naturally occurring in water. You
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       get sodium fluoride by creating it from processes like production of pesticides.

       Even if sodium and fluoride separate their bonds in water (I find it a bit hard to believe...) then it's still not

       fluoride then, is it? It's not the same compound as the naturally occurring fluoride, so it's not going to have the exact same reaction!!! Yes, this is very simple and basic high school stuff. Why do you think fluoride + sodium is the same as calcium fluoride and has the same effects??? It's not the same thing. Not in the slightest. It's got an element / half a compound correct, but even you should know that it's two totally different chemicals.

       Yeah, my country

       No. Once again, it doesn’t dissolved in water. You can leech calcium from calcium flouride into the water, but that’s not the same thing.

       Once again:
       <strong>
        no
       </strong>
       . Calcium fluoride is a mineral found in the ground: it leeches fluoride into the water table.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sodium fluoride is a pure form of fluoride produced by us. But elementally, there's no difference between the actual fluorine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you're not drinking calcium fluoride, because it's a solid and can't be dissolved in water. You can't drink it, unless you feel like drinking sand.

        No. But neither is calcium fluoride by the time it's fluoride reaches you.

       I can't believe I have to keep repeating this:

       No, but it gives you an idea of the scales. If you brush your teeth twice a day, you're going to ingest about this much fluoride, unless you manage to rinse like a champion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And 3L of water isn't all that much -- not an unreasonable amount to drink on a hot day.
      </p>

       The amount is a bit on the high side, but it's no where close to the dangerous level.

       That's a fair point -- their recommended water intake would be lower; 1L - 1.5L is recommended for children in the age range for this study.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on that: it's a heavier treatment than we use in civic water, but still not enough to get into the ranges suggested by the Harvard study for toxicity.

       I’ve heard there are ways to fix that though, I have heard. I don’t have any science here, just friends who have done natural psychedelics who said it woke them up and seemingly opened their pineal gland.

       Well, I think the idea is it makes new neural pathways that may have fatigued over time. Just like a stroke victim relearning speech, this too might work in this way, and we do know that psychedelics do increase and create new neural pathways. The brain has its ways.

       Yes, the potential of neural plasticity and psychedelics is something that needs a lot more research. I’m very hopeful in the ways that they can help us.

       Me too. I only recently have been considering trying this, for what I guess the term would be “spiritual” purposes. There are ‘shamans’ or people who assist those in using psychedelics not for recreation but for deeper understanding of the universe type thing in my area. It’s all very wild stuff, but I think I should at least try it to see for myself.

       Have you ever taken a psychedelic? I would highly recommend it. I’ve always wanted to have an experience with a shaman as I think it could be very beneficial. Where you live if you don’t mind me asking where you have these kinds of people?

       One time I was tripping on shrooms just walking around and a kitten came out of the darkness randomly and followed me all the way back to my house. Guess, I’ll have to try it again.

       One time on shrooms I followed a cat that had been following me. It was skittish at first but eventually it led me down a little path to a riverbank. Middle-of-the-city-creek-like, but strangely quiet; although the road was just there where I'd left it with the traffic and all. As I was considering how my here and now could be so serene given all that surrounded me that cat winked at me. I laughed at myself and my worries.

       I would like to argue against that.
DMT helped me with some leg problems,
As after "a friend" tackled me seven or so years ago, my ankle went completely out, I popped it back in, no doctor(my mistake), and everything up to my hips went out of whack(but then, again, to be in whack doesn't sound good either, in fact, to be out of whack, is to not have whack, so I think it's pretty whack that we use whacklessness as a means to call things whack), and my other leg slowly did the same too, by weight compensation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually I got tired of anyone trying to make money off of my pain, or delay healing by not scratching passed the surface of "professional" assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       On two separate occasions, I asked, tended to, and focused on the experience as a work order rather than a roulette wheel. Once alone in as private as could be, and once at a music festival(though to this day, I swear that batch, was not powerful, clump powder full of oxide's, instead of pures, just a random tryptamine fest), while the alone time can not be mistaken or replaced by any experience on this earth, the second one probably could have been taken for a low level LSD trip that doesn't take you far past the "glowing trails, HD/4k imagery", but doesn't get you close to the " melting everything" levels a high dose could get you to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, the first time was thee most prominent, my feet/leg damages were apparent to me, as I had gone to venues, wanted to dance, but my two left feet refused.
Eventually I got a nice batch from a fellow, more yellow white crystals than rusty whites(plus the rusty colored ones happened linearly after the yellow ones, which I believe are the actual DMT-oxides), and was outside in a backyard, listening to some bouncy bass freeform music, and a golden aura took to me and took me out of me in the most peaceful, yet, invigorating stunt I've seen in a DMT trip.
Several of me's were split. Not like a disorder, but versions from timelines, but probably not that technical. Anyways it was important to note that while the main me was sitting on concrete, this energy seeped into me, and I felt they were all me, and this warming energy snaked into my leg muscles, and I hadn't felt so energetic since the first time I enjoyed psilocybe mushrooms and ran on those.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be so connected in that moment without feeling forced to fuse or defuse into anything was what sold me. I had asked, and I had received.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no alien extraction like my first trip, meeting a blue skinned lady with a severed headed necklace of fallen men... Wooooo!!!
(That one was riveting)
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, I'm still not totally untwisted, but I definitely have more flexibility, and was encouraged to "Bruce Lee" myself out of my debilitation. (His spinal injury led Doctors to say he would never be able to walk, etc, again, HE of course, proved them wrong)
      </p>
      <p>
       Never give up on your goals, aim for uncharted territory, that's the only way we discover what's new anyways!!!

       Sorry bro I just took some DMT and I mixed with some mushrooms just to be sure, I got in touch with the higher consciousness and they are saying your theory is incorrect. It was merely a placebo. And by the way I agree with you I'm just passing on the message, they said they are around for a few more hours of you want to dose again they'll meet you at McDonald's if you want

       Iodine supplements can help decalcify your pineal gland, as can cutting out meat and dairy from your diet (especially red meat). Couple that with regular exercise, mindful mediation practice, maybe the occasional use of psychedelic compounds to give your brain a "jump start" in the right direction, and you're golden!

       That definitely helps but it's not a fix. Not drinking fluoridated water and not eating food that's been cooked with fluoridated water is easily the best way to reverse any damage done. Also, definitely unscientific, you can sun your eyes within the first hour after sunrise and before sunset. It's perfectly safe to look directly at the sun at those low angles. This, apparently, breaks up the fluoride in small amounts because your pineal gland has photoreceptors just like your normal eyes do. Abd it's actually good for your eyes.

       I’m going to assume the question mark is a typo. You probably were one of those kids that swallowed to much fluoride and toothpaste. It’s funny how something I remember is not right cause YOU don’t remember it that way or your school was even more broke and didn’t give you flavored fluoride. That’s how the world is these days I guess, little bitches whining cause only their opinion matters.

       I grew up drinking from an artesian well. I believe the lack of fluoride helped to shape my thought process as I get older. Most people have been consuming fluoride all their lives and appear to be oblivious.

       I still can't believe people can follow and accept the CONSUMPTION of a TOPICAL TREATMENT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do people think eating sunscreen or lotion will help their skin health?
       <br/>
       Do people think swallowing the eye drops will clear up their eye irritation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoride kills living shit. It can actually be helpful to oral health. Who the fuck stands at their sink and gargles water to get the benefit? I have never understood how this is ignored. I have seen a product called 'nursery water' for infants. It has added fluoride for oral health. For infants. Without teeth. To ingest. For their oral health...

       I was talking to a couple of friends about this the other day, one had never heard of it and the other knew exactly what I was talking about. I just assumed that all schools did this. We decided that it was really just the rural/poor counties that participated. We rotated between bubblegum and root beer flavored.

       I think Santa Ana is in Orange County... But yeah, Santa Ana isn't the greatest... OC definitely has bad areas... But OC bad areas are more like European bad neighborhoods... Not proper bad.

       Oh man I remember this. This was back in 2001.  I was about 5 or 6. We had a dental health lady come by teaching us how to brush our teeth and floss through song. And then she advertised the fluoride pill and how delicious it is while also strengthening  your teeth.  All the other kids would brag about how good the cherry flavor is since I forgot to get my permission slip signed. I remember it clearly. She would come by, with her bottle and the kids would line up, one by one she would place a pill in their mouth. I lived in a well off area but there were a lot of lower middle class type apartment homes area where I lived in, so the school mainly consisted of lower income family children.

       Military too. My dad was stationed in Okinawa in the 90s and I distinctly remember, my first day in class, base elementary school making us do fluoride swishes. I was either in kindergarten or first grade. I swallowed the fluoride not knowing what it was, and that I was supposed to spit it out after a certain amount of time. Needless to say I was sick to my stomach that morning.

       Places with public water just add the fluoride directly to the water supply. Rural/poor communities are usually don't have public water and are on wells.

       Those were the red tablets that came with a free little toothbrush and paste pack at my school. They were pretty tasty- the idea was to chew them before bedtime so you'd see how bad you needed to brush- but by the end of class everybody had red smiles, because...free 'candy'....

       At my school it wasn't every morning, (that was the pledge of allegiance!) but they'd regularly roll out a cart, a big pump bottle of flouride 'swish' and paper cups for everyone in the class about once a month. I don't remember any kids not doing it or any option to decline or get a written opt-out. I hated it. It ground the day to an intrusive distracting halt.
It was creepy and 'forced'as far as I recall, and how I felt about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our 'mouthwash' was sickly green and vaguely mint, but not in a cleansing way. Yes, we were rural country kids all on well water, but none of us had bad teeth. There were other programs in place to give us free toothbrushes and toothpaste too, so why we did this every couple weeks just totally reeks of a mandatory poisoning/intelligence-inhibiting program to cover young people not getting fluoridated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell I remember kids straight up drinking the stuff. You were supposed to swish for like a full minute or two(!) then spit it back into your cup and someone would collect them in the trash but so often kids would not have anything to spit out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hated it. And remembering it makes me uncomfortable as hell

       They say

        now
       </em>
       it was because rural kids with well water didn't get the 'advantage' of fluoridated city water, or that we were a bunch of cave people that didn't brush our teeth, but to be honest we were never told why as kids other than 'it was good for us'

       Plus if they figured it was harmless, kids would be wondering "how come he has to drink it and I don't? Is the government trying to poison the people who are a tax burden? Is that why don't have good health care system? Are they keeping it inefficient for the masses in case they ever need to do a large scale "cleansing?"

       Interesting to see my personal recollection get downvoted now and then.... I guess there are some people that consider this program fine and normal, both when it happened and in retrospect? Government always knows best to some I guess, but I didn't think that was the case here at r/conspiracy

       It's not really a conspiracy as an implemented government program that you were ignorant of. They didn't give you AIDS in your milk to see how the disease would progress under the guise of fluoride. They gave you fluoride for your teeth. I have a number of dentists and hygienists in my family so getting fluoride didn't really come off as a covert government operation to us.

       Nah man it's pretty well established the very low levels of fluoride in our water help your teeth. And be more pissed at your parents then the government for participating. They didn't just not tell people they were doing this hence why it isn't a conspiracy. You're entitled to your feelings lol, I'm just saying this does not fit the literal definition of a conspiracy.

       This is EXACTLY how it was in my school growing up. It was during morning announcements and most of the time it was the nurses who pushed the cart around of little shot cups of it. They told you to swish it around for 1 minutes then spit it out. All of us were on well water.

       Geez, it makes you wonder if doing it in the morning may have been a way to numb or dull you to be more docile throughout the day. Say your pledge and drink the fluoride. 
 I certainly don't remember the swish happening at my school every day- it was a little spaced out but felt random enough that we were always surprised when it happened-  it was spaced out but felt random enough that we were always surprised when it happened- but I would be interested to know if there were schools where that happened daily.  My school was in such a Podunk nonexistent Georgia town that probably this (and other programs we didn't even know about) or ways to guarantee federal or state funding. Shit, people still don't believe me that square dancing was a mandatory part of PE class. That and dodgeball. First you get paired up by the state and then you get whittled down into factions based on physicality.

       My school sounds like yours, we did square dancing, learner how to drive a tractor in middle school, our PE teachers were the varsity football coaches so we did anything that would be considered violent the days lol.

       Learning to drive the tractors sounds cool – I guess there was 4H club for that where I was.  Our PE teacher was also the football coach, and I remember he would literally hit and throw kids around if they weren't dancing properly.  It was whispered around by the girls that he may have been a molester as well, but he died before any of that came out.

       We had a toothpaste experiment - "Free toothpaste!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It was called "Castle toothpaste" - with a purple castle logo on it. In the UK, Wales I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back then they were probably trying to turn the frogs gay - I think they worked it out.

       My dentist had bubblegum flavor flouride but he literally would say that it was bad for you and only recommended a rinse once every 3 visits or so... this was as long as I can remember so like 25+ years.

       I feel like it was every other morning to be honest, but I do remember times where it happened more than one day. This was about 24 years ago so I can’t remember fully but I know for sure it wasn’t everyday but like a spurt of days. Now that I think of it, it’s kind of scary to think about.

       I remover this at public schools in rural Ohio, they called it “swish”.  We weren’t lucky enough to have bubble gum flavoring, I remember it being a bitter green substance. I transferred to a less poor school and none of my new class mates had ever heard of such a thing.

       Fluoridation of water under the guise of added dental protection is what we get suckered by here in New Zealand. We also have that free milk for schools but New Zealand dairy products are the best in the world but I will be looking into this to see if it is indeed fluoridated milk.

       Why look at the reputable sources when there are less reputable sources that will confirm what I already believe to be true? That way I can say I'm a free thinker - I'm free to think what I want so basically I believe everything that guy said in the YouTube video I watched a couple years ago and don't remember the details of.

       This data comes from the CDC and the WHO. Yes, the data, not the CDC's biased conclusions. By the way, the CDC also supports circumcision with flimsy evidence. They are not impeccable.

       That link shows that correlation between fluoridation and reduced cavities does not equal causation, because countries that did not fluoridate had the same reduction in cavities. It's probably from greater access to dental hygiene over time as that is a common factor.

       Authorities are not God. They are men, corruptible, fallible men. When we integrate their unbacked or poorly backed claims as truth, we let them decide for us the content of our own minds. Why not just ask questions and think on your own? You don't have to disbelieve authorities, just question them when you think they might be wrong, even just privately. How can you look like a fool to your own self alone?
      </p>
      <p>
       The clowns who are demonstrably wrong? Join them if you don't want to think. They could use some advice on looking more intelligent without the actual attribute. Just trust authority and blame authority when they turn out to be wrong rather than trying to fix their errors. It keeps you looking intelligent without the expenditure of mental effort. Look at how well it works on reddit.

       Luckily flouride is relatively harmless in low doses and I really hope they didnt put enough flouride in the milk to be able to harm, especially a child's drink. Hopefully very well diluted.

       Lead is relatively harmless in small doses. I really hope they didn't put enough lead in paint/petrol/etc to be harmful, especially in children's toys. Hopefully well diluted.

       It's not
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       about dilution. It's also about repeated/prolonged exposure.
       <br/>
       It's not just the fluoride in the drinking water, but also the fluoride in the toothpaste, in the food you eat (in the meat that was reared drinking fluoridated water and eating plants that were watered with fluoridated water, and later had fluoridated water added to it to increase the weight before going to market), in the shower water that gets absorbed into your skin as the heat opens up your pores, and in every other method and way that fluoride/fluoridated water can make it into your system.

       Yeah water is flourided here, and nobody is sick from it. Very low concentration. Good for your teeth. However they should not be giving it to kids secretly.

       When you get the big flouride wash from the dentist, they put a suction tube in so you can't swallow it because that much could make you sick.

       Yeahhh just because it’s not being attributed to fluoride yet doesn’t mean the harm is non existent. Lived with fluoridated water in my childhood and my family developed many auto immune diseases and hormone imbalances.

       At the level that’s present in water, you’d need to drink an Olympic pool’s worth of water every hour for roughly 70 years, or whatever the current expected lifespan is. It’s somewhere near that.

       It actually is banned in many countries or just not used, so its not a falsehood, some nations beleive it does nothing for tooth decay and that other ways of stopping tooth decay naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some countries it depends on the area also, some are strictly against it, some just don't see a reason to add it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The countries that use it outweigh the countries that don't but him saying many have banned it isn't a far stretch since in the last couple years some have actually, google it.

       Remember the dose makes the poison. And while I'm not a huge supporter of fluoridated water supplies, I do think there is little harm based on the low amount actually used. Now the question is, what were the doses used in all the milk?

       Nice try.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoridation is UNETHICAL because:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) It violates the individual’s right to informed consent to medication.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The municipality cannot control the dose of the patient.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The municipality cannot track each individual’s response.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) It ignores the fact that some people are more vulnerable to fluoride’s toxic effects than others. Some people will suffer while others may benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) It violates the Nuremberg code for human experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water fluoridation started at a time when asbestos lined our pipes, lead was added to gasoline, PCBs filled our transformers and DDT was deemed so “safe and effective” that officials felt no qualms spraying kids in school classrooms and seated at picnic tables.

       No, actually, the CDC and some other trusted authorities just look no further beyond the assumed causation from the correlation between fluoride and tooth decay. Comparing fluoridated and nonfluoridated countries shows this causal relationship assumption to be in error. The data comes from the CDC and the WHO.

       Admit you just bow before perceived authority. They are citing the data from authorities you trust, yet you cannot be bothered to look at it unless an authority you trust presents it to you with their own conclusions about it.

        What the CDC failed to mention is that tooth decay rates have “precipitously declined” in all western countries,  irrespective of whether the country ever fluoridated its water. Indeed, most western countries do not fluoridate their water and yet their tooth decay rates have declined at the same rate as the U.S. and other fluoridated countries

       I dislike articles like the one linked, not because any of the sources they use, but because they feel the need to use sleazy sentences like: "fluoride is toxic. In fact, the number one reason for poison control calls concerning fluoride are for children who’ve eaten toothpaste"
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's break down why the author wrote that sentence. At first glance, to someone skim-reading the article, the point appears to be that the most frequent calls to poison control are from children consuming flouride.
      </p>
      <p>
       But actually, all that's being said is
       <em>
        of the calls to poison control which involved flouride
       </em>
       most of them were children who had eaten toothpaste. Of course this will be the case, as concerned parents will rightly call poison control if their future-nobel-laureate child eats an entire tube of toothpaste, and children are unlikely to be exposed to toxic levels from any other sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if the facts are as solid as the author claims them to be, they should stand alone without any literary trickery.

       It's amazing how you conspiracy people will believe anything you read online with zero evidence to suggest it's true (like the pineal gland being a third eye and holding the spirit) yet if someone says fluoride is medically safe and even helpful in small doses (backed up by research btw) then that person should fuck off

       I should have phrased that as "hardcore conspiracy people" or something along those lines. I couldn't think of a better word at the time to group the general population of this community who believes things with absolutely zero evidence in their favor yet pushing against mountains of medical journals and years of research.

       I've heard plenty of people talk about the pineal gland, but nobody said it holds the spirit. You don't have to like their speculations, but do cite them properly. They think it is a special organ that facilitates connection and communication with an unseen aspect of reality. It's never been proven, but the speculations have been around for a long time.

       There it is again. Are you a professional at this?
       <br/>
       Stop making declarative statements on things you don't conclusively know.  Can you link to the 99% of posts which say those things that you quote?
       <br/>
       You're trying to convince the casual readers that the majority of users on this sub act a certain way while you paint yourself as the "standard user". It's like you're saying you're all for discussing conspiracy theories, but only so long as they're the conspiracy theories you want to talk about. It's subversive.

       And you are right; I can't conclusively say lizard people are real. But I also can't conclusively say that we're not all just really large alien coconuts plugged into the matrix controlled by giant bananas.

      <p>
       Also the things that I quoted are called exaggerations. They are used for a slightly comical effect in the English language.

      <p>
       Also I am a standard, casual user. You don't need me to try to convince other casual readers that a lot on this sub is borderline silly. The hardcore people like the ones in this thread who think bloody fluoride is the separating line between reality and being brainwashed are doing that already.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I am all for discussing conspiracy theories but at a certain point they get out of hand (in my personal opinion). In my opinion the conspiracy is that kids may have been secretly given a chemical. To some people, the conspiracy is that the government is trying to encrust the third eye in order to prevent people from having free will.

       I don't know why you're getting downvoted. I very much agree with you, and even regardless of how much a post may be
       <strong>
        <em>
         "THE SKY IS FALLING"
        </em>
       </strong>
       , everyone deserves to have their opinions and thoughts heard. If we start censoring our posts because they're outlandish  we will no longer be a conspiracy community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, I firmly believe a lot of modern emotional/psychological/physical problems have their roots in what we eat and drink. Flouride is one of those things that is very unnatural in terms of quantity-consumed. (And Xylitol is actually significantly better in almost every way, except that it's a laxative at higher doses. But you almost never see anyone advocating for that).
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, totally agree with you. This is not a Lizard-People scandal. This is a chemical we can
       <em>
        see
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        confirm
       </em>
       is added into our water supply, and even though it might not affect everyone, there's
       <em>
        bound to be people more sensitive to this stuff
       </em>
       . I suffered from Flouride Overdose for a few months at college; everything tasted like soap so I stopped eating as much, headache all the time, completely exhausted (thought I had Mono, but nope, that soap-taste is one of the hallmarks of flouride overdose). I had to look everywhere for a good bottled water too :( Flouride is in everything.

       I agree that everyone deserves an opinion and has the right to have it heard but at the same time myself or anyone else has the right to think it's going overboard or disagree. I don't want anything censored at all, don't get me wrong, I just don't like the amount of pseudoscience that people assert as fact and that is my personal opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I agree that there is conversation to be had about fluoride being tested on youths without consent, but when people start saying the government is doing it to control the masses by sealing their third eyes like it's some kind of world domination scheme, or that you can counteract the effects of fluoride by staring at the sun and feeling the earth's energy, I have to disagree..

       I'm not saying that some of the conspiracies posted here aren't a bit nutty, but I don't think it's fair to compare the addition of Flouride into the water (by, yes, city/state
       <em>
        governments
       </em>
       , though more likely to "better peoples' health" than "mind control") to
       <strong>
        LIZARD PEOPLE FROM SPAAAACE
       </strong>
       . Like u/Leuan1996 said, that kind of comparison--to make it seem like governements/companies testing or distributing Flouride is as outlandish as
       <strong>
        FLAT EARTH
       </strong>
       ers etc, in this case--is a common form of manipulation and shuts down the dialogue that we could be having.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't, personally, think Flouride was added for mind control, and, nor do I really like that article because it's text was intentionally written in a biased and misleading manner. But, from my own experiences, I don't think Flouride is the most healthful thing to consume, and I think it should be an opt-in in terms of tap water rather than the other way around. I think we should have discussions about that, and the reasons to or not to have flouride in water, instead of likening and discrediting something we can see/prove (flouride
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       added into drinking water) to something outlandish like
       <strong>
        <em>
         XENO IS BRINGING THE END OF THE WORLD
        </em>
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, after I told my dentist I was trying to avoid flouride, one of the hygienists
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       said "you have to have flouride! It's the best
       <em>
        vitamin
       </em>
       for your teeth!" A
       <strong>
        <em>
         vitamin
        </em>
       </strong>
       ! If nothing else we really need to restructure nutrition and basic chemistry classes. And being a biologist/wannabe nutritionist, I died a bit on the inside from that comment.

       Iirc, Flouride is in natural streams and water
       <em>
        but tap, and most bottled, water contains 20x more than any natural source
       </em>
       . And for people with a struggling thyroid, it can put you right over the edge and cause thyroid failure which is not pretty. Not pretty at all my friends.

       I acknowledged it when I said "nontoxic doses of fluoride," implying there are indeed toxic doses. But the toxicity of it is irrelevant in such small quantities and there are only dental benefits at that level (with literally zero health repercussions of any kind)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...was and still is being introduced to people without their knowledge

      <p>
       It's kind of hard to tell but actually I even acknowledged that it's arguably fucked up to do that without consent when I said "is "testing" the medical effects of safe completely nontoxic doses of fluoride in kids without consent fucked up? Yeah, arguably"
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's pretty common knowledge that fluoride has been in most public water for a while now... It's not really a secret. You can check your local water's fluoride levels at
       <a href="https://nccd.cdc.gov/DOH_MWF/default/SearchByWaterSystem.aspx">
        nccd.cdc.gov
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there aren't really teams here; as I said, my opinion is just that it's not good to give people any kind of chemical without telling them what it is and what it does first but I don't think the government was trying to masterfully brainwash the masses through pseudoscience.

       A little bit of fluoride is actually really good for you. This is the reason it is in tap water and toothpaste so I don't really get why you are complaining about free milk with a tiny amount of fluoride in it.

       Yea, deodorant itself just helps with the smell. Antiperspirant contains aluminum and I guess that clogs your pores so they don't sweat. (Or something) most brands have a deodorant and antiperspirant version

       as a kid my parents were told from my dentist that we should also brush with Flouride after using normal toothpaste, I hated the taste and so i would fake it almost every time.  i would put it on my toothbrush but use the faucet to wash it off and id just brush with water...im so happy I was lucky enough to accidentally not flouridate myself

       That's kind of crazy.  As another person mentioned in here, did your parents give authorization perhaps through a school slip or something?

      <p>
       I personally don't use fluoride but it's been so long since I came to the conclusion that I don't recall all the imperial evidence.  I told my dentist I didn't because she was pushing me on it and then she looked at me like I was a holocaust denier or something.  Lol dog.

       Centrally treated water is uncommon, so I guess they have to dose the people somehow. And yes the people still think eating it is somehow good for their teeth.

He has a chiropractors degree and while it's technically correct to put Dr. In front of his name the article literally discloses that this should not be a substitute for medical advice.

       Interesting. I remember being told that the reason brits were known to have bad teeth while Americans had good teeth is that Americans put fluoride into their water much sooner. Any basis to that? Just wondering not trying to pick an argument

       Interesting I thought brits had genitcally bad teeth, years ago when they would go exploring to tropical islands by ship they would often dump their more precious cargo for limes (vitamin C) because they suffered from scurvy causing tooth decay among other sickness hence the nickname "limeys" they were mocked for traveling all that time and distance only to return with limes.
 Indegionus peoples all over the world including Canada studies found had an even lower amount of cavities compared to flouridated citys/populations.

       For anyone who has the ability to read and understand research, this isn’t as big of a deal as you making it out to be. Also, you provided a review article. It would have made more sense to provide the article of the research you were actually involved in. It kind of makes me think you don’t really understand the scientific process and shouldn’t be making posts with such a sensationalised title.

       Research has since then become much more ethical and it takes a lot of work to get a study approved. Besides, if you want shocking unethical research, just YouTube the Milgram experiment.

       I think that we can split the hair in 1,000 pieces, the substance was known to have good effects on teeth, however, they don’t want a sick population, nor to kill a hood amount of it, testing it on a small scale is the way to go

       Did you or your parents agree? Probably not

       Did they mess you up in some way? Probably not

      <p>
       Is it bad that they run these experiments on the public? Absolutely
      </p>

       Don't you think there are cheaper ways of avoiding the costs of disposing it safely? Like... digging a deep hole and pouring it there? Or... secretly pouring it in the ocean?

       They might be ‘cheaper’ if pouring it into the ground or ocean wasn’t extremely harmful to the environment. The lawsuits from people being harmed by it leaking into ground water in higher concentrations or killing natural life in the area. So yes, cheaper to dilute it and pump it into an ignorant population and run a PR campaign to have them thank you for it

       Something being published in a scientific journal is not an inherent sign of scientific backing. Especially because biomedcentral is an open-access publisher. It doesn’t do peer-review. 
The lancet neurology piece is a well-known debunked piece that wasn’t actually published in the full lancet because of the need to retract it.

       Your link contained no science.  Just unsubstantiated dogma.  You're attacking the messenger, which is intellectually dishonest.  No surprise there, as anyone who wishes to "mass medicate" without permission of your victims is without morals or ethics.
