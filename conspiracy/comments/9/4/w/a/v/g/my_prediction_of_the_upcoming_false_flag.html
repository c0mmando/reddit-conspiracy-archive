<p>Who are Q anon people? According to hundreds of articles by the corporate media they are a far right violent cult. Also according to the media Trump supporters, almost 50% of polled americans according to resent polls, are violent racist fascists.,. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1&amp;amp;q=Qanon&amp;amp;spell=1&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi34KCdiNfcAhXFtVkKHbE4CloQBQgmKAA&amp;amp;biw=1360&amp;amp;bih=579">https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1&amp;amp;q=Qanon&amp;amp;spell=1&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi34KCdiNfcAhXFtVkKHbE4CloQBQgmKAA&amp;amp;biw=1360&amp;amp;bih=579</a> </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t lay the ground work for this narrative for nothing. There was recently an event stopped before it could happen thanks to the tip from someone who talked to the person. The person had a gun and ammo and said the CIA was experimenting on him. Unfortunately the search engine is hiding this incident and I can find decent links. There was fake Qanon people at the Trump rally that were turned away.. Also the corporate media rules all info and I have no way to link to that either. </p>

<p>The coming event will be blamed on Q and Trump supporters. They want to solidify the stereotype they created with an event. </p>

<p>Make my words. One will get through soon. </p>

<p>No one wants this, maybe John Bolton. People don&#39;t want a compromised president capitulating to a hostile nation who just attacked the country. Also the fact that he is making money off of the office is a clear constitutional violation, but that&#39;s all getting investigated and his whole family is going down</p>

<p>The parkland shooter was a maga hat wearer, the Charlottesville nazi rally was full of Trump supporters, ice running around the country like the Gestapo is because of Trump. The shootings and violence against journalists all from his rhetoric </p>

<p>There&#39;s also talk radio, Alex Jones types and other people who completely toxic to public discourse like Cernovich and PJW</p>

<p>Hard not to be when that&#39;s the reality of what&#39;s going on. If he wasn&#39;t constantly lying, race baiting and poisoning everything he gets involved in it would be different. He&#39;d also have to of not broken several laws like he did</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Parkland shooter was a mentally I&#39;ll high school kid. The Columbine shooters listened to Marilyn Manson. Should we get rid of him and anyone who likes his music? Charlottesville had violence on both sides and it ended tragically. ICE is doing what they were designed to do. If you don&#39;t like it, give George W. Bush a ring.</p>

<p>There are problems on both sides. I can admit that.</p>

<p>The problem is the media and how they manipulate the public; you&#39;re a great example of how effective their brainwashing techniques are.</p>

<p>Hodgkinson was probably sick just like Nikolas Cruz. My goal was not to get any violent Trump supporters off the hook here. It was to show op how ridiculous it is to strictly blame the right for what&#39;s going on in the country right now. The hate exists on both sides and that&#39;s how they want it.</p>

<p>You could also conclude that the constant “they will frame us” is actually laying down a cover story before a planned event or insurance to offset the difficultly or realizing one of the collective snapped. </p>

<p>I hope it doesn’t happen but to immediately disavow an event as a false flag and someone else’s fault is a defense mechanism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Japan and whenever North Korea launched a missile our phones give off an alarm and we get an emergency text telling us what happened.  Even though no missile hit Japan the text is sent out just to let you know what happened.  So every time we got a text the day went on a normal.  No one was talking about it at work, the news on at the ramen shop I went to wasn&#39;t talking about it, train station kept running, school wasn&#39;t canceled, no one looked worried.  I was asking a Japanese guy I work with about it and he said no one in Japan worries about North Korea that much and you only need to start panicking if you hear air sirens going off.  </p>

<p>Compare that to the US media which I didn&#39;t watch, but apparently was going balls to the wall crazy about the missile launch that my parents and other parents and family members of my gaijin co workers are all sending us frantic  e mails and face book posts asking if we are ok and what the situation in Japan is.</p>

<p>My prediction is that the false flag would be the opposite. It would be set to look like one of the groups that the alt-right don&#39;t like. You don&#39;t radicalize a group just to demonize them, you use them.  It&#39;s the people in the media that are the catalyst for this extremism. They don&#39;t care about women, sexual orientations, and other races. They&#39;ve been propagating stereotypes against them for a years! Only now do they act like all that&#39;s bad after people have grown so accustomed to those stereotypes in the media.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so transparent that the media is trying to stir the bee&#39;s nest.</p>

<p>It&#39;s crazy that you would come to a conspiracy subreddit to carry water for the most powerful people in the world.</p>

<p>The only conspiracy here is how SOMEONE convinced a huge swath of people to believe that anything the President of the United States does or says is part of some larger unknowable plan. </p>

<p>The worst dictators in the world would LOVE to have a Q on their side.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry guys, Q says they&#39;re reading our emails now so they can expose the global pedophile ring!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry guys, Q says they&#39;re suspending habeas corpus because the deep state was planning a false flag!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry guys, Q says that we shouldn&#39;t believe those articles about corruption because those journalists were working for the globalists!&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure Q will be exposed now that more people are being made aware, but everyone&#39;s watching how easy it is to pacify entire populations using the same tactics.  Politicians, corporations, and interest groups all now know what&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t wait until some dude named REDDITOR-Z starts making drops to let everyone know that it&#39;s cool that Monsanto is spraying cancer causing pesticides because the &quot;deep state&quot; was putting mind control chemicals in the soy crop.</p>
