<p>The Washington Free Beacon initially hired Fusion GPS to do op research against Trump prior to the primaries. The law firm of Perkins Coie picked up funding after the primary (on behalf of the DNC and the Clinton campaign).</p>

<p>The main players are Simpson the head of Fusion GPS, the company hired by the DNC and was also behind the Pee dossier, and the 2 Russians that were at the Trump meeting were Natalia Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin. They all worked together on occasion.</p>

<p>Akhmetshin, a former Russian agent now lobbyist, has a history of participating in alleged black-ops smear campaigns. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinat_Akhmetshin#Hacking_incidents_and_smear_campaign">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinat_Akhmetshin#Hacking_incidents_and_smear_campaign</a></p>

<p>Veselnitskaya is a Russian lawyer.</p>

<p>The 3 Simpson(Fusion GPS), Veselnitskaya (lawyer), and Akhmetshin (lobbyist) have all worked together before on behalf of a Russian-owned company against the Magnitsky Act. The United States government accused the company that the 3 worked for of laundering some of the funds stolen in a fraud uncovered by Sergei L. Magnitsky, after whom the act was named.</p>

<p>Mr. Simpson(Fusion GPS) was in court with Ms. Veselnitskaya hours before the Trump Tower meeting and saw her again shortly after it, his lawyer, Joshua A. Levy, confirmed.</p>

<p>The man behind the Magnitsky act, Bowder, said of Simpson (Fusion GPS) “He’s a professional smear campaigner and liar for money,” “The credibility of anything that he does is in question.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not exactly True.</p>

<p>At the same time Hillary was paying smear peddlers Fusion GPS for the Steele dossier, she also had close allies Cody Shearer and Sidney Blumenthal working on a similar document.</p>

<p>You probably don&#39;t know much about Blumenthal, but he&#39;s a long time political operative that deals in secrets and dirty tricks.  He was working for a PMC in the run up to the Libya overthrow.   It&#39;s not outside the realm that he knew Steele or that he was co-ordinating efforts on both dossier behind the scenes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with any of those theories is that none of the information came out before the election or was used by the campaign. That&#39;s some shitty opposition research if you don&#39;t get to use it before the election. We know these guys went right to the FBI, like your supposed to, instead of using it for political means. Don Jr fucked up by not going to the FBI immediately after getting those emails for that meeting, it just shows the willingness to break the law </p>

<p>Go back and re read that section...they mention the articles for reasons to stop working with Steele, it also references a yahoo news arcticle Page publicly denounced which leads to believe its probably true then...

<p>Glenn Simpson is a US citizen who works for a opposition research firm, what he was doing was legal and a normal part of campaign. The memo is useless since Nunes lied through out the whole thing and he never even read it! </p>

<p>No they don&#39;t, they mention the articles on to frame the Trump campaign as distancing themselves from Page, and to state that Page responded in a defensive manner.  It is not used to distance itself from Steele.  It is used piece to build a case. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well first of all, they did not have &#39;raw intel&#39;.  They had allegations made by Steele. Whom they framed as a reliable source...  </p>

<p>They did not need the articles, but the articles, were used as a political intervention before the the election, and they used them to pad the FISA application.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FISA document stated the dossier was funded for political purposes, that&#39;s sufficient enough for disclosure.</p>

<p>No, omitting the fact that it was funded by an opposition political campaign is omitting very pertinent information, claiming that the FBI speculates that Simpson was interested in using the information for political purposes is nowhere near being enough for a sufficient disclosure. </p>

<p>Yeah because the FBI was sitting on their hands and Steele was concerned there was an active cover up to help Trump within the FBI (specifically the NY office which there&#39;s a lot of evidence for) so he gave to to news orgs to force their hand. The FBI terminated their relationship with Steele after buzzfeed decided to release it</p>

<p>They did not verify it independently, they verified it by referencing a Steele memo.  The allegation and the verification were both the same source. </p>

<p>Well, it was done by Clinton campaign money paying Fusion GPS and in Turn Steele.  I think that if the tables were reversed in this situation we would both agree that it was done by the &#39;opposition campaign&#39;, and that it is a gross violation of democratic norms. </p>

<p>Nothing of the kind was in the unredacted parts of the FISA warrant.  There were allegations made by Steele, there was Page&#39;s prior history, and then there were articles referenced to support the case that the Trump campaign was changing its foreign policy. There was the Isikoff article already linked.  There was no &#39;independent verification&#39;.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is true that Carter Page&#39;s statements as a reaction to the article are included, however they were not used to terminate Steele.  Steele was terminated after talking to Corn at Mother Jones, who published the story with the title</p>

<p>&quot;A Veteran Spy Has Given the FBI Information Alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump&quot;</p>

<p>published at the end of October, after the FISA warrant application!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All private organizations</p>

<p>How is this relevant?  More importantly in what world does an ex-MI6 agent talking to Russian government agents, and passing this information to investigative firm hired by the Clinton campaign become information that is easily overlooked?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>none of them represent a foreign country</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that is debatable, I mean if it was shown that a lot of allegations against the Trump campaign originated in organizations representing Ukraine and NATO interests would you even care?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the dossier was not given to the Clinton team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was instead funded by them, and given to the press to run a negative stories against the Trump campaign.  It was a political intervention. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All this spin is nonsense, just completely false information or non sequitors.</p>

<p>What is false, and how are they non-sequitors.   Here is what you are missing, the US surveillance state was used against a domestic political campaign, and the threat to democracy that this poses, is much greater than Trump&#39;s presidency. </p>

<p>This is:</p>

<p>This only works under the premise that Trump and his campaign are completely innocent which is just untrue.</p>

<p>If Trump and his campaign were subverting democracy and negotiating clandestine deals (like we have the emails as proof for) then it completely justifies the FBIs investigation. If anything they should have acted much faster and harsher.</p>

<p>There hasn&#39;t been a single piece of exculpatory evidence regardjng Trump and Russia. Not one. The more we learn the more connections we see , the more meetings with Russians they get caught covering up. This won&#39;t end well for him and hopefully Trump supporters can accept the results of the investigation </p>

<p>A mistake is being made here, Trump may indeed be &#39;guilty&#39; of something (what is not specified), however, by going about it the way &#39;intelligence community&#39; went after the campaign would discredit it&#39;s claims.  Steele is not a reliable source, no matter how much insistence there is on the contrary, and Page was indeed maligned by the surveillance state. </p>

<p>If this is a reference to the information that Veselnitskaya was offering, you are mistaken.  I don&#39;t share the view that this was a deliberate set up by GPS like the Trump supporters here.  The information that was shared, was evidence that was admitted into a US courtroom during the Prevezon case.   It concerned Bill Browder&#39;s dealing in Russia and in turn the fraud perpetuated by HSBC.   Perhaps you think that access to information that challenges political narratives  shared by nationals of other countries poses a threat to democracy - I don&#39;t, and in fact it is an integral part, in our ever increasing connected world. </p>

<p>The sole purpose of the dossier was to get a FISA warrant.  None of it was ever supposed to be made public.

<p>That is a plausible theory as to why Steele leaked it, but it does not explain why Hillary&#39;s campaign sat on it throughout the election, through the electoral college vote, and seemingly was never going to release it.

<p>That makes no sense.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>He was.  But if he had any contact with anyone on the Trump campaign after that, they get 3 hops.  And I would assume that the warrant allowed them to spy on people he had contact with prior to the issuance of the warrant.  If the cops get a warrant to search your phone records because they suspect you&#39;ve committed a crime, they don&#39;t just get permission to search calls made after the warrant is issued, they get it all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Schiff memo and states as much and that is in line with what was left unredacted in the FISA warrant</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Schiff memo? Really?</p>

<p>Here is our original conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My opinion is that the dossier was never intended to be made public and it was to be used only as justification for a FISA warrant to spy on Trump&#39;s campaign. Had Hillary won, no one would ever find out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s already disproven by the actual documents released by DOJ and the senate</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The Schiff memo does not say that the dossier was intended to be made public, and we know, per the FBI&#39;s release of the Carter Page FISA warrant application, that the dossier was used as a basis for that warrant.</p>

<p>So how does the Schiff memo disprove what I said?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because they werent paying Steele, GPS was after they started uncovering crimes they turned it over to a professional who can gather the info and give it to the FBI. DNC/Clinton had no idea about Steele</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that at all.  They were paying Steele through intermediaries.  Clinton Campaign&gt;Perkins Coie&gt;Fusion GPS&gt;Steele.  They were paying specifically for research into Trump&#39;s ties with Russia.  The FISA warrant says this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you lying intentionally or just misinformed? Mueller was appointed because trump fired comey to shut down the Russia investigation. He was told to finish the Russia probe, look into the Trump obstructed justice and follow any threads that lead to other crimes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the left wing media&#39;s spin.  Firing Comey did not stop the Russia investigation, though.  It continued while McCabe was acting director.  My opinion is that Muller was brought in to cover up Hillary and Obama&#39;s spying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not hard, they never had it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t believe that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only October surprise was promised by Giuliani who had his sources inside the FBI leaking info to him about another bogus Hillary investigation coming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a bogus Hillary investigation.  They found backups of Hillary&#39;s emails on Wiener&#39;s laptop.  Comey told Congress that he would notify them if he reopened the investigation, and that&#39;s what he did.  I&#39;t wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all if the NY FBI leaked to Giuliani.  I&#39;m sure they thought the DC office was trying to hide it.  The team heading up the Clinton investigation learned of the emails on September 29th, but they did nothing about it, and didn&#39;t even tell Comey until October 27th.  The only reason they told Comey is because the NY office complained.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you&#39;re still ignoring huge details trying to spin this as the other side entraping Trumps campaign. They lied about the meeting ever happening, then lied about what was talked about and then recanted on that too. Then Trump lied about knowing about it, Jr lied under oath about it. They broke the law and failed to cover it up, this doesn&#39;t even get into all the obstruction of justice and other clandestine activities they got up to on the campaign... Or all the crimes he&#39;s committed since he&#39;s been in office </p>

<hr/>

<p>Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya approached the Trump campaign claiming she had dirt on Hillary Clinton. Veselnitskaya had been denied a visa to enter the US by Phreet Bhara (DOJ) and then miraculously Obama&#39;s State Department approved entry into the US under &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; just before the time period when she approached the Trump campaign.  </p>

<p>Just before the meeting at Trump Tower, Veselnitskaya met with Glenn Simpson founder of the firm (Fusion GPS).  Fusion GPS had been hired by Hillary&#39;s campaign via Perkins Coie to collect dirt on Trump.  Veselnitskaya then meets with Don Jr, provides no dirt on Hillary, and changes the topic to discussion about repealing the Magnitsky Act.  Following the Trump Tower meeting, Veselnitskaya is spotted meeting with Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson again.</p>

<p>The whole series of events was a manufactured ploy to try to collect dirt for Hillary&#39;s dossier.  It was a setup and it failed.</p>

<p>The Clintons paid Russians (via intermediaries) for fake pee pee dossier, sent it to Obama friends at CIA/DOJ/FBI to initiate FISA warrantless wiretap on useful low level idiot Carter Page, which is used to spy on entire Trump campaign. </p>

<p>A pied piper candidacy (Trump) wins unexpectedly and the ruling class loses their minds. </p>

<p>Russia Hoax hysteria ensues for two years as CIA/DOJ/FBI partisan cabal decides to plot an &quot;insurance policy&quot; soft coup to correct outcome of 2016 election as pre-selected candidate Clinton did not win as decreed by the ruling class.  MSM messaging owned by the ruling class, amplify Russia Hoax and other negative narratives in an attempt to marginalize and hamper an independent executive with the goal of impeaching a dually elected President.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/07/fusion-gps-official-met-with-russian-operative-before-and-after-trump-jr-sit-down.html">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/07/fusion-gps-official-met-with-russian-operative-before-and-after-trump-jr-sit-down.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fusion GPS official met with Russian operative before and after Trump Jr. sit-down</strong> </p>

<p>....</p>

<p>The DNC and Clinton campaign hired Fusion in April 2016 through lawyer Marc Elias, who was general counsel for the Clinton campaign. Fusion, in turn, paid Steele $168,000 for the dossier, memos from which were shared with the FBI in the summer of 2016.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya occurred during a critical period. At that time, Fox News has learned <strong>that bank records show Fusion GPS was paid by a law firm for work on behalf of a Kremlin-linked oligarch while paying former British spy Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on Trump through his Russian contacts.</strong> </p>

<p>But hours before the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, Fusion co-founder and ex-Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson was with Veselnitskaya in a Manhattan federal courtroom, a confidential source told Fox News. Court records reviewed by Fox News, email correspondence and published reports corroborate the pair’s presence together. The source told Fox News they also were together after the Trump Tower meeting. </p>

<p>Nice try buddy.</p>

<p>The DOJ/FBI first tried to get a warrant in the Summer of 2016. They were shot down by FISC.  In October 2016 they submitted another application, this time with the Steele Dossier serving as the basis for the application.</p>

<p>That is when wiretaps were approved. </p>

<p>This is:</p>

<p>the US surveillance state was used against a domestic political campaign, and the threat to democracy that this poses, is much greater than Trump&#39;s presidency. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This only works under the premise that Trump and his campaign are completely innocent which is just untrue.</p>

<p>If Trump and his campaign were subverting democracy and negotiating clandestine deals (like we have the emails as proof for) then it completely justifies the FBIs investigation. If anything they should have acted much faster and harsher.</p>

<p>There hasn&#39;t been a single piece of exculpatory evidence regardjng Trump and Russia. Not one. The more we learn the more connections we see , the more meetings with Russians they get caught covering up. This won&#39;t end well for him and hopefully Trump supporters can accept the results of the investigation </p>
