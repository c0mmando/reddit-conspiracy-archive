<p>It is quite clear that the Trump administration is moving the USA towards fascism. The fact that it is tied up with Putin&#39;s administration in such myriad ways that the President is now so undeniable that the President is openly admitting collusion.   </p>

<p>This is a conspiracy. Another (far less interesting) conspiracy is the lack on posts about it here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a fair statement. Even if in practice America has seldom lived up to its ideals, those very ideals have provided the foundation with which more Freedoms were fought for more people. </p>

<p>The Constitution may have allowed for slavery, but the DoI created the cultural underpinnings to remove it. Senators may have once been the vanguard of the landed Elite&#39;s, but the Constitution gave us a method to change it, which we did. Women and non propertied people may not have been enfranchised once, but the &quot;Right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness&quot; provided the rationale for changing that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Curious question. If Trump is Putin&#39;s puppet. Why is he attacking Russian allies? Currently in a trade war with China. Threatening Iran with war and Iran is having naval drills in the Persian Gulf.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is in conflict with everyone--China, Iran, Russia, Canada, Mexico, the EU, UK, Turkey, North Korea, Palestine, etc. </p>

<p>The countries he is on good terms with are Israel/Saudi Arabia/Egypt (enemies of Iran, Russian ally), Japan, South Korea, and Poland/Hungary (as well as other Central and Eastern European nations who are historical enemies of Russia). </p>

<p>If he was owned by anyone, they&#39;d have leaked dirt on him a long time ago. Trump is causing major problems for China and Iran. </p>
