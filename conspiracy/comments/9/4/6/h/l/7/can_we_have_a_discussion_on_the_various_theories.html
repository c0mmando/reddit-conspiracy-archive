        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Physicists recently discovered that the Great Pyramid of Giza has the ability to concentrate electromagnetic energy in the its internal chambers as well as under its base, where the third unfinished chamber is located. <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-07-reveals-great-pyramid-giza-focus.html">https://phys.org/news/2018-07-reveals-great-pyramid-giza-focus.html</a></p>

<p>It seems unlikely that this structure was not intentionally designed this way. Unlikely that this is merely a coincidence.</p>

<p>So the question now is, why was it designed this way and what was it used for?</p>

<p>Perhaps these concentrated electromagnetic waves were somehow harnessed and used during the initiation process?</p>

<p>Maybe they can shift consciousness to a higher realm or vibratory frequency, possibly interact with the pineal gland, or cause a massive DMT dump? </p>

<p>Or maybe the pyramids were designed as power stations, and the energy was harnessed to provide electricity.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious if other pyramids around the world can also do this with electromagnetic waves. Maybe that&#39;s why so many pyramids of similar design were built in the first place.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s not really an unusual thing at all as any structure with uniform material does what is being talked about in the article. In fact that&#39;s how they knew the pyramids would do that. They just had to estimate the resonance frequency which was easier to do thanks to said uniformity in materials used as well as sizes of blocks. It&#39;s focusing certain wavelengths but there is still a net loss of energy across the entire spectrum. It&#39;s just resonating allowing certain wavelengths to penetrate farther in while blocking out other wavelengths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Points to support your perspective:</p>

<p>1) We don&#39;t <strong>understand</strong> gravity in the least and can&#39;t explain it. We can merely describe it.</p>

<p>2) There is a tendency of separate fields of study in physics merging into one as the interactions between the mechanisms can&#39;t be easily untangled. It&#39;s conceivable, and in deed theorised by the Electric Universe Theory, that gravity is just another facet of Electromagnetism.</p>

<p>3) It&#39;s then further conceivable that the ancients had learned to concentrate and structure massive objects in such a way that it induces some kind of electromagnetic resonance with surrounding vibrations. Think of the Schuhmann Frequency or Tesla&#39;s musings about the Earth ringing like a bell from continuous lightning strikes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Schumann Frequency IS the ringing of the bell, by the way. </p>

<p>We understand the electromagnetic spectrum and have harnessed it. That&#39;s our technological paradigm. We see evidence of other types of energy that we do not fully understand (gravity and <em>qi</em>/life force, for example). It&#39;s possible that the Egyptian paradigm was based on an understanding of gravitational energy, the tech lost when Moses blew its load parting the Red Sea (or some other way). If the lights went out for good due to a polar shift or similar, our civilization would fall into ruin and chaos overnight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the correction, I should have phrased that sentence the other way around to be more clear.</p>

<p>Qi is certainly interesting. I&#39;ve had many energetic healing sessions myself  as a partial paraplegic and so often the sensations I felt were precisely mirrored by a subsequent description of what I could expect to be feeling or by a sensation in my healer friend. That, and the fact that my healing progression has been called miraculous on many more than one occasion lead me to believe that energy within and around us can be gathered, cultivated, utilised, destroyed, and manipulated in all directions. </p>

<p>I believe most of that is just our genuine interactions, the energy we receive from the world depending on which energy we send into it, that kind of thing, but there seems to be more to it than that. I reckon that we can perceive and affect nuances of such depth when we allow ourselves to, that we can flow through time like a leaf down a stream and adopt strengths and levels of interaction that are mostly considered mythical or supernatural. Within limits, of course. I doubt laser vision is a thing, and neither, perhaps, is levitation (though who knows), but we seem to be capable of loads more than we typically think; individually, as as a whole.</p>

<p>&gt; And no, you don&#39;t need aliens to explain the rise and fall of great civilizations. People are just too smart for our own good.</p>

<p>No, but I have been toying with the idea that we may be the aliens, though more for fun than profundity.</p>

<p>I think this is really the big thing going on with most Egyptian and other ancient monuments, that they were using sound waves to help achieve altered states of consciousness. This is something John Anthony West gets into in his docu-series &quot;Magical Egypt&quot;. It&#39;s also similar to meditation in many ways, when you &quot;ohmmm&quot;, you&#39;re slightly vibrating the pituitary gland, and with enough vibrations, you can basically trip balls. I imagine the pyramids and other structures had similar effects, but on a much higher level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somewhat kinda related, but I&#39;ve been having interesting thoughts the last couple weeks about energy and been reading tons about Tesla stuff and got into the pyramids and energy - and then coincidentally there was a couple stories about this the last couple days. It seems so obvious it was some sort of battery or radio tower. A conductive, gold capstone with insulating limestone surrounding it. It would be some sort of giant capacitor (battery), the missing piece is whatever was going on inside and underneath. It got me thinking about a lot of things and I wrote some of it down. Like i said, semi-related lol</p>

<p>The aether was the basis for Issac Newton&#39;s work about gravity and an idea seen from Aristotle to enlightenment scientists to Faraday, Bernoulli, Maxwell, Lorentz, Tesla - and like the same thing as Qi or Chi from eastern philosophy. Aether as the medium that light/energy travels in was the leading model up until this one experiment (Michelson-Morley) which isn&#39;t even that conclusive and then Einstein comes along with relativity and the speed of light is constant, with a bunch of bandaid math to make it work. But the true og&#39;s at the time were not down with it at all. They felt it was using math tricks to avoid addressing the true physical reality of light and its medium just because this &quot;aether&quot; is hard to detect and measure. Einstein made it so the aether is not necessarily needed, even tho it&#39;s super similar to his &quot;space-time&quot;, but just a different way of thinking about it physcially and how all energy interacts. The press lauded Einstein and aether got phased out pretty quickly and becoame known as like pseudoscience. And the current relativity model has needed a ton of more bandaid math with like dark matter and dark energy. The aether model is more concerned with the frequencies of energies and how they interact with each other, whereas the relativity model obfuscates this by making light a constant and focusing on time and the &quot;observer&quot;. </p>

<p>Interestingly, names like Illuminati and Lucifer are related to light. The aether was often called the luminiferous aether.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s this guy named William Reich in the early-mid 1900&#39;s who built upon the Faraday cage and Tesla coil (which seems to have similar properties as the Egyptian pyramids ...see all this is related somehow) and made chambers which capture energy from the aether and people would sit inside them and it supposedly cured diseases and cancer, he called it Orgone energy. Long story short, about 10 years later, in 1956, he was raided multiple times by the FBI and then the FDA banned distribution of his orgone devices. Later that year, they forced him to personally dismantle all of his devices and then burned over six tons of his publications.</p>

<p>This all may seem random but I think it is extremely relevant in terms of our awareness and energy and happiness (and how some would want to control those things), and just the way when you interact with others you can feel vibes and it&#39;s like there&#39;s this communication going on the spiritual/energy level. You notice it a lot with like dogs or other animals. There are frequencies in the air. It&#39;s like tuning your car radio to a certain station, the radio waves playing the songs are all flowing in the &quot;aether&quot; right now interacting with us, but we only decode it if our receiver (brain) is tuned properly. All these frequencies and information are flowing around us, thru us, and our brains and senses can interpret it in some way.</p>

<p>Things like shitty food, negative mainstream news, ads, radio towers, cell towers, haarp, cern, vaccines, flouride, etc fuck us up by altering our vibrations, by putting out bad frequencies to disrupt our collective awareness, and by preventing us from interacting with certain frequencies. This function/system of altering the natural vibrations could be called a &quot;matrix&quot;. Our natural vibration state and thus our minds, bodies, and consciousness is alter by the &quot;matrix&quot; to produce what we perceive as our shared reality.</p>

<p>All information in basically a vibration, whether it&#39;s sound or light or thoughts or a spark of energy, it creates a frequency that propagates outward into the aether. We understand it as a sound or a sight or an emotion simply because of the way our brain and body are designed to sense and decode that sequence of frequencies. And in decoding the frequencies, we are really accessing the information about the event that created it. </p>

<p>Like a pebble being dropped into a pond of water. The size, speed, frequency of the rippling wves propagating outward contain information about the event that created it. But what&#39;s interesting is that the waves themselves don&#39;t actually really exist, like you can&#39;t hold a &quot;wave&quot;, it&#39;s really just a movement of whatever medium it&#39;s occuring in. Electromagnetic waves, light, energy, photons, radio waves, x rays, microwaves, brain waves, ultraviolet, infrared, red, green, blue, etc are all the same types of &quot;wave&quot; with some different speed, frequency, amplitude. They are like movements or vibrations of the aether and they propagate outward interacting with the other frequencies in the aether. </p>

<p>All atoms, molecules, dna, organisms, rocks - basically mass - is dense regions of the aether where energy frequencies have settled into a very stable, harmonic state. Depending on the nature of the frequencies (or &quot;electron configuration&quot;) you can have something like iron which is super dense and heavy or a piece of cloth which is light and can be ripped easily. </p>

<p>Frist of all, Michelson and Morleys experiment wasn&#39;t inconclusive, it was predicted that they would measure different speeds of light in the Michelson interferometer (probably the most sensitive machine we have, it was used to detect gravitational waves or a length difference of 10<sup>-20).</sup> So had there been an ether, they would have found it. </p>

<p>While Einsteins model was rejected and ridiculed at first, it has withstood the test of time. Cosmic muon lifetime, gravitational redshift and gravitational lensing are just some of the predictions that have been verified again and again. The ether is not Chi, it was a physical object, not a mysterious force and nor it is like space time. </p>

<p>Dark matter and energy aren&#39;t even a part of general relativity, just something you is allowed to be in the universe. And we happen to have a lot of it. Just because we don&#39;t know what it is doesn&#39;t mean you can call it mathematical band-aid. </p>

<p>All those waves you mentioned move at the same speed, and they are Electromagnetic waves or EM waves. </p>

<p>The very last section is just plain wrong. All of it. Not everything is EM waves (especially not atoms) and the material is not determined by the electron configuration. </p>

<p>If you have questions, feel free to ask. </p>

<p>You obviously don&#39;t know how general relativity work. It is not &quot;one theory&quot;. It is a framework that describes how a universe (metric) has to work. It is basically a set of equations that describes how space time warps when you put matter and energy in it. You can put all the matter at one point in the center and none elsewhere, then you get a black hole (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric">Schwarzschild metric</a>), if you make it rotate you get the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric">Kerr metric</a>, or you could make matter evenly spread out in the universe, then you get the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric">Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>So I think the reason why the aether wasn&#39;t picked up by Michelson and Morleys experiment is that because none of them took the earths ionosphere into account, meaning that the earths ionosphere protects us against the shear forces which would give rise to a positive result. (The assumption that two perpendicular rays of light would travel at different speeds would require for those shear forces to be felt on the surface of the earth, I bet that if these experiments are performed again outside of the earths ionosphere ylud see different results, definitely would be worth checking out the upcoming GOLD or ICON data)</p>

<p>And unfortunately dark energy and matter ARE mathematical bandaids for the observed speed at which the universe is expanding. Einstein put that cosmological constant to allow his equations to explain a static universe... and he called it his greatest blunder, theres clearly something missing here in our understanding of the energy dynamics which gave rise to what we observe today, theres a good amount of energy unaccounted for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shear forces doesn&#39;t matter if they are physical forces. The photon is massless so a force can only act perpendicular to its motion, i.e. change the direction. Besides, the refractive index of air is very close to that of vacuum, so that would not affect it much either and is only spends a fraction of a second in the atmosphere before it hits the detector anyway. Also, if you are correct, wouldn&#39;t these shear forces affect every experiment we make that involves light? Thus making them all invalid? That&#39;s a pretty bold statement tbh. </p>

<p>Einstein later on admitted that it could be useful in models though and the nature of both dark matter and energy are unknown, but we know it&#39;s there. Just as in the 1920s they knew that there were some other particle involved in beta decay because there were always some missing momentum, and in 1930 Paul Dirac proposed the neutrino, a nigh massless particle that is also emitted in beta decay. It interacts only via the weak force, and very rarely, so at the time it was believed that we would never find it. But here we are, three of them have been found. I am certain that within a few decades the nature of dark matter and energy is resolved, at least to some degree. That&#39;s how science evolves. </p>

No deep understandong or technology has come from his insane theories. Because they are wrong and incomplete.
Tesla on the other hand, proved his theories with countless real world experimentation and practical application in technology.  He proved the existence of aether. And most importantly he showed us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but there is another effect that also affects the wavelength of a photon. Thoughtexperiment: Imagine that you have a machine that can turn a photon into a ball and another that does the reverse. Now shoot a photon straight up to the photon-to-ball machine, let it do its thing and drop the ball down to the ball-to-photon machine. Since photon is massless and does not feel the pull of gravity, no energy is spent when the photon is fired up, while we gain potential energy by dropping the ball. The machines can be considered perfect with no energy loss. With such a contraption we could in principle generate infinite energy - something we know is impossible. So something in our initial setup must be wrong, and it&#39;s the assumption that the photon is not affected by the gravitational field. </p>

<p>Thus the photon will lose energy and the wavelength will increase as it travels from a strong gravitational field into a weak one. This effect is called Gravitational Redshift, and it is different from time dilation. Time dilation works in any two frames of reference that move with respect to eachother while gravitational redshift only affects particles moving from one gravitational field to another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the photon is massless. In quantum field theory (QFT) energy exists in two forms: mass and momentum, and you can have one without the other. Mass and momentum are related to energy by E<sup>2</sup> = (mc<sup>2)<sup>2</sup></sup> + (pc)<sup>2</sup> . Think of energy states like a ladder, they can be evenly spaced (harmonic oscillator), increasing distance (flat potential), decreasing distance (hydrogen atom), but there is always, <strong>always</strong> a lowest step on the energy ladder. If there is not your model has infinite negative energy and that&#39;s not physical. If it did particles would &quot;fall&quot; down to lower energy states perpetually and release more and more energy to the system, and this does not happen in reality because we would have seen it. </p>

<p>In QFT the lowest step of the ladder is determined by the mass. There E=mc<sup>2</sup> and p=0, no momentum and there is a continuum of increasing energy as the momentum increases from 0 to in principle infinity, but practically to the Planck energy (since we don&#39;t know what happens at the Planck energy so the model is not valid there). The lowest energy an electron can have is 511 KeV, because that&#39;s its mass. For a proton it&#39;s 938 MeV. A photon has no mass, so its energy comes only from momentum. </p>

<p>Gravitation affects <em>energy</em>, not mass, which means that every particle that has a nonzero energy (if it has E=0, does it even exist?), including photons. That is because in GR the right hand side of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations">Einstein field equations</a> is the energy-momentum tensor which contains both mass and momentum (as the name implies). </p>

How heavy something is is equivent to its density of energy.</p>

<p>Now with the great pyramids being in the center of gravity of the planet... maybe you can transfer information between two places using fluctuations in the local concentration of energy, aka gravity waves.</p>

<p>Maybe your pineal gland can &quot;hear&quot; changes in concentrations of electro magnetic frequencies, just like your inner ear (these two organs, inner ear and pineal gland are the only two places in the human body with crystals that are piezoelectric).</p>

<p>Maybe we can learn to hear those <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect">clicks</a></p>

<p>And maybe these fluctuations are carried through the natural standing waves of our plane before traveling outwards (personally I think they go through the sun) the Schumann Resonances...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What your describing here is consciousness. Everything that we perceive that is not man-made is conciousness. Animals, plants, light, air...EVERYTHING. It is the medium that our perceived reality is composed of. </p>

<p>What we call a tree is just organic material that has coalesced/&quot;grown&quot; into a pattern that we call a tree. Same thing with animals. Same thing with humans.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how a single cell immediately after conception knows what to do? How does it know to split into more of itself? How do those cells then know how to become a liver...an eye...a brain? Science will tell you dna has instructions in it. What is it in dna that has this information if it is essentially just proteins and other chemicals? I&#39;ve yet to hear a satisfactory explanation how that could have initially happened.</p>

<p>Consciousness needs something to be able to process itself...to perceive itself...to take in and interpret the nearly endless myriad of forms that it has divided itself into. Something so powerful that could never be replicated artificially. Something that could behold the beauty of a sunset...the awe of an interstellar nursery...the love reflected in a lover&#39;s eyes...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, it seems like a tool that the pharaohs and their peers used to gain a higher understanding of their place and purpose through the magnification of their own and surrounding spiritual(or whatever) energy through meditation, manafestation and possibly some more advanced(or totally insane) lost practices </p>

<p>So you go to this place that magnifies your energy and allows you to focus with more clarity and divinity shall we say. Call me a kook but it seems to fall in line with the desires of every other powerful person(and person in general) ... To gain knowledge that is otherwise unknown in order to gain an advantage for some purpose or another....selfish or selfless.</p>

<p>In the end the pyramids are a tool and like other tools they have multiple uses. I&#39;m not saying I have the answers by the way. All I&#39;m doing is following my own path of logic. Do with that as you will. But back the the pyramids and their uses. I feel their true uses are somewhat lost to time because of our ever changing interpretation of language and human motive due to the gradual rise, fall and change of society many times over.</p>

<p>So here we are, an unknown amount of time later trying to decrypt the purpose of a mysterious building. You can say we know all of things but you can also say what we know is constantly changing. So I think the takeaway from this is that the pyramids are one of humanities earlier manafestations of the unknown and our curiosity for it. And because of that we will never know their true purpose because that is their purpose. The unknown.</p>

<p>Unless I&#39;m missing something blatantly obvious which in that case by all means, rip me to shreds with your counterpoint. Be it world domination, a pathway to the aliens/gods, or maybe their nothing more than elaborate monuments with so accidental energetic properties. I don&#39;t know and probably neither do you. </p>

<p>so yeah it looks like pyramids are resonators.  crystal prisms do it with light.  same thing.  something about that shape takes &quot;the media inside of it&quot; that&#39;s otherwise perceived as homogenous, and fracts it into 7/8s.  sound and light fract in 7/8s.  colours and the scale, respectively.  so this pattern could be a function of the design of waves.  those are my general impressions of this really cool discovery.  i&#39;ll probably go build a pyramid structure now to meditate in, and see how that works out.    </p>

<p>Saying DNA contains &quot;instructions&quot; is really just shorthand to provide a simplified explanation of certain parts of the process. DNA is not like a codebook. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jeez are you for real? I truly hope you are trolling. </p>

<p>The mathematical model <em>is</em> the theory, and it is supported by evidence and experiments. A theory can never be proven right, just not not proven wrong. </p>

<p>At the time the photoelectric effect was revolutionary. He literally showed that the photon was a particle too when everyone thought it was only a wave. </p>

<p>Then, please, show me a better alternative that is an actual scientific theory. Which means it needs to make a prediction that can be tested. </p>
