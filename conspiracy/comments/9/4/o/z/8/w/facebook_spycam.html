       I never gave much thought to the hysteria over Facebook spying and data collection - until tonight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drank a bottle of Heineken tonight while browsing Facebook on my notebook. First bottle of Heineken I've had in years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Five minutes later, on top of my Facebook News Feed - ad for Heineken.

       Holy Shit. Never been a tin-foil-hat guy, but I'm covering that webcam on the notebook.

       Anybody else had any experiences like this? I know a few years ago Facebook rolled out a product recognition feature that would detect and tag commercial products in your photos. It would not surprise me a bit if that's what caused that ad to be served, OP.

       I did, I dont even use social media. But I was talking out loud in my room about needing to remember to search google for something and went and sat at my computer and started to type in my search. And google auto complete popped up and it was the exact search that I was wanting. Found that to be really creepy. This happened last night and I am gonna see if I can replicate this again now that I read this post.

       Recently, went on a chartered shark fishing trip.  Posted a picture of one of my catches. Less than 12 hours later, my Facebook ads are for yachtworld.com.  I actually live in the Midwest, landlocked by several hundred miles in all directions.  I also could not afford a saltwater fishing vessel.  Only thing I can think of that could have caused me to be targeted are that picture or geo-data showing I was at a harbor?

       I recently had a YouTube video suggested to me about turning in a wrecked rental car within days of being in a friend's rental car after we got in a minor accident with it. That seemed pretty suspicious to me.

       While I don’t doubt this stuff as a whole, sometimes I wonder if more than a few are examples of people never really paying attention to the ads.  As in, you might’ve seen that video multiple times before but didn’t pay any mind until it fit in with a recent experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, you’re likely sharing more information than you know.  When you rode in the rental car you might’ve been tracked using your phone or other digital device, and the information regarding the rental claim became associated with it.  I’d assume the ad generating algorithms are pretty good these days so they can take in all that data people keep giving them.

       My partner's friend had to move suddenly and they couldn't take their pet with them. So we sat down and talked about inheriting a lizard, a bearded dragon. I've never had anything but cats. We discussed that we would need a heated pad to go under the terrarium. I opened up amazon, and lo and behold, what was the first item under "Suggested items for you"? A reptile heating pad.

       I had that happen with printer toner. The day the toner ran out, I open Amazon, there's an ad saying "need printer toner"?

       Some of them you can have them automatically order you toner/ink when they are low. It wouldn't surprise me if that you didn't sign up for it, it "phoned home" and told Amazon you were low.

       I have lots of experience with this. The FBI has been watching me via Facebook for years now. It all started one night. I was at my computer, drinking a soda. The brand started to appear on my ads, too. Then, the next day, people around me were talking about the ad. They were trying to get my attention. I wouldn't listen. Then, it got weirder. My family would all of a sudden have that brand. It's gotten worse since. That was just the beginning, trust me. Wonder if Zuckerberg would enjoy being looked at. Can't have fun unless both people are enjoying it. I sure as hell don't enjoy being watched.

       Think about it. We have to accept a bunch of legsal stuff to use google etc., but we don’t really got any alternative and we don’t really understand the terms.

       So the governments can’t be held accountable because private international companies own the sites etc., and the got an army of lawyers to crush any resistence.

       It probably wasnt your webcam. It was probably your credit card! Card companies are now sharing shit in ways I could never have imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something similar happened to me. I physically walked in to my local walmart. I bought Q-tips, tums and dog shampoo using my credit card. They didnt have the body wash I use, so when I got home 30 minutes later, I went on e-bay to order it. (The same card I used at walmart is saved to my e-bay account.)
      </p>
      <p>
       After ordering the bodywash, "you may also like" popped up with 3 suggested items- 1)tums 2)Q-tips and 3) dog shampoo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have NEVER purchased any of these items online before in my life. My card company shared the items I bought on the card at walmart with e-bay within 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you sure you didnt buy that 6 pack of heineken on your credit card?

       Then it must have come from your credit card. Or perhaps they are doing mic access on laptops now too. I don’t know much about that though.

       I was at a store at the time and only had my phone so it had to be that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another instance I know for sure was my laptop's webcam saw an object, even though I did not turn the cam on, and I received a targeted ad on FB for that object which I never searched for or talked of on the internet. Because of where the laptop sat it was the only thing it could see.

       As an electronics hobbyist I can tell you a credit card does not have that capability because it has no power source of it's own.

       Oh. Ya. they do that but that was not the case. I have a rot rod C1500 truck  and a guy was checking it out. He was telling me all about the S10 dragster he was building. Then 10 minutes later I get home and FB has ads for something about "S10 lovers".  I have no interest in S10s and never search for them or talk about them on the internet.

       Then it’s definitely your mic on your phone. Super creepy. Must be some other app you got. I would go through and turn off all the mic access for everything and see if that helps. Otherwise you might have something nefarious going on.

       If you said the brand name out loud, it might be your mic. I’ve seen that happen to friends of mine, no purchases made, but words said that within 5 min got them served completely different ads for things they were never into.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve never had it happen, but I have always had mic and camera access turned off for most apps, including Facebook. I highly suggest turning off the mic and camera access for Facebook if you are going to continue using Facebook.

       People need to stop using the spyware trash known as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Twitter. Unless those companies cease their mass surveillance.
