       Taxes are
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6q0slMhDw8">
        voluntary
       </a>
       .

       Listen, I'm not
       <strong>
        defending
       </strong>
       the system.  But if you're going to criticize it, you should know how it's
       <strong>
        supposed
       </strong>
       to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       A "citizen" is someone who
       <strong>
        lives in a city
       </strong>
       .  "Citizenship" implies the right to own property
       <strong>
        outside
       </strong>
       of the city -- absentee ownership.  Citizens should
       <strong>
        want
       </strong>
       to pay taxes on the
       <strong>
        income
       </strong>
       that comes from their income-producing property
       <strong>
        outside
       </strong>
       of the city, because those taxes go to
       <strong>
        defend
       </strong>
       that property.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the way it has worked, for the most part, since city-states appeared
       <strong>
        thousands
       </strong>
       of years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I understand that this is not exactly how it works lately.

       while I'm only recently aware of the movement, I'm aware of two relevant factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sovereign Nation of USA was foreclosed on and forfeited, in its entirety(property and people), to the Federal Reserve Bank through the Emergency Banking Act of 1933.
      </p>
      <p>
       An endentured US citizen can purchase sovereignty, assuming no outstanding debt or any legal issues, and if they like you, for just over $600k.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, I'm about $800k behind. :(

       At the heart of their argument is the idea that they're not citizens of the United States because they've revoked said citizenship, and are reverting to some common law status, or status as citizens of their respective state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume that that's possible.  This still doesn't mean that the laws don't apply to you, simply because you're not a citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that were the case, someone from Canada would be able to cross into Maine and kill, murder, and do drugs all day, because the laws of Maine -- for some reason -- don't apply to them because they're citizens of Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't really strike me as reasonable.

       What separates one from being a diplomat from a citizen? If I'm a Russian diplomat and have Diplomatic Immunity, I cannot be tried for my crimes in the US unless Russia obliges. The Sovereign has to agree. The worst that can happen is something called Persona non grata.
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it simply, a Sovereign has the ability to choose which laws they will surrender Sovereignty to. This is why the Queen of England will never be tried. The law is sanctioned under her name. She can choose whether to be tried or not.

       This theory falls apart when you apply the same logic to King Charles I of England.

       No it doesn't. Magna Carta is a loose Contract. I mean, your comparison is no different than what happened to JFK. If enough powerful people want you dead then you're a dead man walking.

       I don't see how that's the case.  In the example you provided you said that the Queen of England will never be tried.  Conversely, English monarchs
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       been tried.  And, in the case of Charles I, English monarchs have even been sentenced to death by English courts that have jurisdiction over them.

      <p>
       I disagree.  The court that presided over Charles I's case was authorized and established by the Parliament of England.  Assuming that JFK was executed for treason, I don't recall any courts being involved.

       Only because they gave up Sovereignty and agreed. It's a catch 22.  Ask Louis XVI about that. Mob or the courts?

       You're wrong.  Charles I's defense was predicated on the notion that the "King can do no wrong."  If he was refusing to give up sovereignty and most definitely did not agree to be tried and executed.

       So, basically, you're saying that your point - that "the law is sanctioned in the sovereign's name," until it isn't - is immune to any example I can present that shows you're point is incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       History is full of very clear, historical examples, of personal sovereigns that embody state sovereignty, who're tried and executed, despite the very fact that they are not willing to allow the court in question to legally preside over them.

       Yes! But, it's also backed by subject compliance, Treaties and International Law, if the people revolt. That's why I brought up Louis. Look man, we can learn from each other. Nothing I've said is factually wrong. Can you admit that?

  I think I'd be a little more comfortable with sovereign citizens, and their ideas, if they were more honest about their anarchism.  I think, by hiding behind (especially in the American brand of the movement) certain democratic and federal documents and institutions, sovereign citizens are veiling the anarchic heart at the center of their movement.

       Government authority is a magic spell, only this and nothing more. Mao said power grows out of the barrel of a gun, and he was half right. Power, in the political sense, comes from the collective delusion of the people that governments have power.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my readings on the sovereign citizen movements, they make some good points, but I don't think their strategy is sound. Their strategy seems to boil down to a series of counter-spells to the dominant spells of government, and that by using these counter-spells, one can be free from the spells of government. I've never seen this work in practice, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong.
