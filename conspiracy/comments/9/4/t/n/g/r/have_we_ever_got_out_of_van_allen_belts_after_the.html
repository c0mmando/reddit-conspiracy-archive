        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok I won&#39;t argue about Moon landing. I won&#39;t argue about why aren&#39;t we going back there either. Moon is a useless rock and it&#39;s too expensive to go back, I&#39;ll buy that.</p>

<p>But what about Mars? It seems we&#39;re very interested in terraforming it.</p>

<p>Then don&#39;t we have to practice going in and out of Van Allen belts just to prepare future travel?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about Van Allen belts. All I found was space station is in the low earth orbit so it&#39;s not outside of the belts. Only unmanned things seem to go out of the belts.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, so please educate me, have we ever got out of van allen belts with manned craft since the moon landing? Not monkey or dog in it,  but manned craft.</p>

<p>Actually I don&#39;t know much about this, somebody enlighten me with vall allen belts problem please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the mindfuck right? It&#39;s a confidence game, you have to accept the entire illogical magical tale, or your cast out and shit on. And you have been convinced that the story is so important and critical to the plot line that you don&#39;t even want to consider the new plot where the story was a lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;you have to accept the entire illogical magical tale or your(sic) cast out and shit on&quot;
I mean if you&#39;re characterising it as that then it suggests a lot.</p>

<p>Some people react to skepticism that way, but most times when the situation is described that way it&#39;s someone being salty they lost an argument. Sure some react to any hint of conspiracy with tin foil hat jokes, they&#39;re assholes. The only way you get that stronger kind of reaction is to push an opinion that&#39;s wilfully ignorant despite evidence and reasoning. I. E. (&quot;why can&#39;t we go through VAB&quot; &quot;actually, we can, hard to make safe but possible&quot; &quot;but what about X&quot; and then you get attacked.)</p>

<p>To me it sounds like OP had some people explain that the van Allen belts are a serious problem further but in fact not a huge conspiracy, responded with skepticism and then got the conspiracy theorist attack from some normies. Making sure the explanation is legit is normal, but arguing over scientific facts as if they&#39;re open to debate, yeah people are going to attack you for being stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your response is to assume I don&#39;t argue that any are true, that says a lot more about your lack of ability to provide any logic refuting my points and less about the actual discussion.</p>

<p>Im saying some people do just attack, but if you feel you&#39;re always under attack for voicing opinions on scientific conspiracy theories like the moon landing, it might have something to do with you. It might be more a case that someone is refusing to think critically and skeptically about a theory and so instead wants validation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a blatant lie, they calculated it and saw that the radiation that the astronauts would be exposed was very small. And after they returned they saw that they were much <em>less</em> exposed to radiations than firstly thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? Do you even research before saying shit like that? Well, obviously no.</p>

<p>I assume you are talking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZqSWWKmHQ">this!</a>, and random youtube videos such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDBBUwdyz4I">this!</a> were enough to convince you that the earth is flat, or that the moon landing was a hoax.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/12/04/nasa-orion-apollo-hoax-va_n_6268704.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS5ici8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_cs=Jkxfn-DWVvIib7JljpO2Zw">Here&#39;s!</a> the explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The answer, simply, and which has been explained in detail elsewhere, is that the Apollo astronauts were not in the Van Allen belt for long enough to have to deal with dangerous levels of exposure to radiation.</p>

<p>The Apollo astronauts did return to Earth having been exposed to significant radiation - but not more than is allowed by US law for workers at nuclear power stations, for instance.</p>

<p>First, Orion contains much more complex and complicated electronic equipment than the Apollo systems, which could potentially be damaged by radiation and so has to be tested before humans are allowed to fly inside it.</p>

<p>Second, Orion isn&#39;t just intended to go through the Van Allen belt and back in a few short days. It&#39;s designed for missions up to 21 days long, and perhaps even longer if it forms part of a mission to Mars. As a result it would face exposure to vast amounts of radiation in space, for months on end, and so testing its shields and how much radiation gets through is prooobably a good idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL so that&#39;s all the evidence, arguments and reasons you have to say that space isn&#39;t real and/or the moon landing was a hoax?</p>

<p>OMG worth it, knew it would be some <em>big</em> bullshit lmao. Thanks for the laugh, now check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment">this</a> out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ongoing Lunar Laser Ranging experiment measures the distance between Earth and the Moon using laser ranging. Lasers on Earth are aimed at retroreflectors planted on the Moon during the Apollo program (11, 14, and 15), the two Lunokhod missions, and the upcoming MoonLIGHT retroreflector to be deployed by the private MX-1E lander.The time for the reflected light to return is measured, and the distance is calculated. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can do it yourself, but of course you won&#39;t since it will end for once and for all your doubts whether we went to the moon or not (spoiler: we did, and pretty much everybody came to this amazing conclusion already).</p>

<p>Unless you think space are just CGI and the moon and the sun are I don&#39;t know.. pictures or some big reflectors-satellites? LOL wouldn&#39;t doubt anything from you tbh</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for confirming you didn&#39;t even open the link! Now we can all see how you are driven by belief and faith (in the ridiculous) and not reason and logic.</p>

<p>From the same link (since the fear of being wrong is stronger than your will to seek knowlegde):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first successful tests were carried out in 1962 when a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology succeeded in observing laser pulses reflected from the Moon&#39;s surface using a laser with a millisecond pulse length. Similar measurements were obtained later the same year by a Soviet team at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory using a Q-switched ruby laser. Greater accuracy was achieved following the installation of a retroreflector array on 21 July 1969, by the crew of Apollo 11, and two more retroreflector arrays left by the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 missions have also contributed to the experiment. Successful lunar laser range measurements to the retroreflectors were first reported by the 3.1 m telescope at Lick Observatory, Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories Lunar Ranging Observatory in Arizona, the Pic du Midi Observatory in France, the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory, and McDonald Observatory in Texas.</p>

<p>The unmanned Soviet Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2 rovers carried smaller arrays. Reflected signals were initially received from Lunokhod 1, but no return signals were detected after 1971 until a team from University of California rediscovered the array in April 2010 using images from NASA&#39;s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Lunokhod 2&#39;s array continues to return signals to Earth. The Lunokhod arrays suffer from decreased performance in direct sunlight—a factor considered in reflector placement during the Apollo missions.</p>

<p>The Apollo 15 array is three times the size of the arrays left by the two earlier Apollo missions. Its size made it the target of three-quarters of the sample measurements taken in the first 25 years of the experiment. Improvements in technology since then have resulted in greater use of the smaller arrays, by sites such as the Côte d&#39;Azur Observatory in Grasse, France; and the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico.</p>

<p>What was NASA funding as a percent of GPD during the Apollo missions and what is it now?  That is your answer.</p>

<p>You overlook all the planetary, deep space, remote sensing, and space station which take lots of money too.  NASA didn&#39;t do all that back then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why would they have done it? The USSR had lost the space race and was haemorrhaging money during the Cold War. There was no reason for it to send people beyond low earth orbit. The USSR even mothballed its space shuttle program. And China also had no reason to send people up there. Space agencies just got on with using probes. Yes, they could have done it, but it would still have cost billions and it still would have been risky. And you don&#39;t do something expensive and risky just because you can – you need a compelling reason. And proving that the Van Allen belts can be traversed is not a compelling reason: scientists already know this, and the small number of conspiracy theorists who don&#39;t believe it won&#39;t change their minds and will just call any new mission faked as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>&quot; ILC’s team , a motley group of seamstresses and engineers, led by a car mechanic and a former television repairman, manages to convince NASA to let them enter their “test suit” in a closed, invitation-only competitive bid at their own expense. They spend six weeks working around the clock—at times breaking into their own offices to work 24-hour shifts—to arrive at a suit solution that starkly outperforms the two invited competitors. In open, direct competition with larger, more moneyed companies, ILC manages to produce a superior space suit by drawing on the craft-culture handiwork and expertise of seamstresses, rather than on the hard-line culture of engineering.&quot;</p>

<p>Doppler shifts in GPS signals show the transmitters are moving at a high rate of speed that combined with the way that GPS works (Not triangulation (angles) it uses trilateration (distance)) gives us evidence that satellites exist.</p>

<p>Why?

You&#39;ve completely ignored my question and made the assumption that every astronatut had to know everything about the mission. And they simply didn&#39;t. The Van Allen belts weren&#39;t a threat to their life and just weren&#39;t something the astronauts needed to know in detail about and years after the event they had even less reason to remember what they did know.

<p>Lets just do a quick recap to try and explain why I think you must be one of those: </p>

<p>I point out that he isnt a scientist(therefore it should be suprising he doesnt know things like this), I give the pilot comparison.</p>

<p>You ignore my point and my comparison, try to argue his honorary degrees make him a scientist and an engineer, you accuse me of not supporting my claims. </p>

<p>I point out honorary degrees are not real degrees, try to repeat my initial point that you ignore, I ask what I need to support.</p>

<p>You once again ignore my point, you ignore my question, then ignore the context of our conversation to stop talking about his honorary degrees and try to talk about his actual degrees, claiming I got it wrong, and seemingly thinking that deploying experiments makes you a scientist. Somehow. All of this with a heavy dose of lets call it rudeness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said before I respect your opinions on Alan Bean what constitutes an official scientist or engineer. </p>

<p>The facts are that Alan Bean received a bachelors of science degree in aeronautical engineering, then became an astronaut and traveled to the moon and performed experiments there. Then as spacecraft commander he traveled the skylab where he continued to perform more experiments in space, giving him a total of 1,617 hours in space. After completing the skylab mission he was awarded an honorary degrees in science and engineering.  He was also awarded the Rear Admiral William S. Parsons Award for Scientific and Technical Progress among other awards for achievements in science and engineering. </p>

<p>Regardless of whether he is an engineer or a scientist, or whether he has perfect recall of all the trivial details of the Apollo missions and the van allen belts. I don&#39;t believe the argument for the moon landing hoax really has that much to do with this, all this discussion was in reference to the original comment that Apollo didn&#39;t really give a shit about the van allen belts and I showed that with the fourth man on the moon not really being worried about them in an interview. </p>

<p>Ok, lets be condescending then. Fuck you you stupid piece of shit. Its not my fucking opinion you illiterate fuck, its a fact. He isnt a scientist. He has no degrees in science, he has no published scientific works, he has almost nothing a real scientist has. At best you could find a mention of him in some scientific papers, which anyone can achieve. If performing an experiment others have set up for you makes you a scientist then most elementary school kids are fucking scientists, you fucking brainiac.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That video is deliberately misleading you.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Chris Hadfield: Hadfield&#39;s speech is taken out of context and even then he does not say we never went to the moon. He&#39;s clearly talking about developing long-range space travel there.</p></li>
<li><p>Terry Virts: We cannot presently travel out of low-earth orbit because we no longer have the craft to do that. It&#39;s not because we never did. They discontinued the Apollo program and they didn&#39;t keep a few Saturn Vs hanging around in operational condition just in case they wanted to make a quick trip to the moon.</p></li>
<li><p>The Orion clip: The video says the Van Allen belts pose problems for the electronics and guidance systems for Orion. This is because they use much more senstive electonics these days, the trajectories are different, and Orion is going to travel much further and for longer than the Apollo missions.</p></li>
<li><p>The Obama clip: see answer 2.</p></li>

<p>When the people making these claims have to resort to misrepresenting statements like this, it should show you they don&#39;t have any real evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have a look at the actual history of the moon landing broadcasts – it&#39;s fascinating. The tapes that were lost were the backups for the live broadcast and were on the telemetry tapes. The live broadacst worked, there were plenty of copies of that broadcast, and (if I recall correctly) the original tapes were&#39;t easily able to be broadcast back in those days. So, the telemetry tapes were likely erased and reused, as was the practice then. Storing physical data that you didn&#39;t think you&#39;d ever need again just wasn&#39;t a priority back then. It&#39;s the same reason we lost a lot of early TV broadcasts – they just reused the tapes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between “impossible” and “impractical”.  We have also not lost the technology to build an old model-T car it’s just that we have better technology now.  Setting up the assembly lines again for a model-T would be just as hard as setting up an assembly line for some new fancy car.</p>

<p>The safety standards used in the Apollo program were abysmal compared to modern standards.  Apollo 1 and Apollo 13 are good examples, even Apollo 11 came close to failing.  The Apollo program cost about as much as the goddamn freeway system so setting it up again would be incredibly expensive, so expensive and impractical in fact that it would be both easier and safer to build a new rocket capable of landing on the Moon.</p>

<p>You know, like the Constellation program before Obama canceled it.  It’s aim was to return to the Moon but politics got in the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apollo 1 caught on fire killing all 3 astronauts and Apollo 13’s service module exploded which the crew was incredibly lucky to survive.  On just Apollo 11 they had a landing computer malfunction during landing which required Neil Armstrong to manually take over the decent and when they had to lift off again the launch button broke which would have left them stranded had they not found a workaround.</p>

<p>Apollo spacecrafts were fucking death traps and all things considered it’s a goddamn miracle that only one of the 17 Apollo missions resulted in the death of the entire crew.  Just going off these examples I can think of off the top of my head that comes out to like a 6% chance of death before you even take off and nearly a 18% chance of having a close call with death.</p>

<p>Let’s compare that to the space shuttles, 135 launches and 2 catastrophic failures.  That’s about a 1.4% chance of death.  There were some near misses as well but not nearly as many as the Apollo program.</p>

<p>By modern standards Apollo rockets are death traps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The objective of Apollo 1 was to take the command/service module designed for the Moon landings into low Earth orbit and see how well it works on space.  Every mission before Apollo 11 was a test all the way up to Apollo 10 which brought a functional Lunar module within 8.4 miles of the Lunar surface.</p>

<p>This doesn’t make things any better for your argument though.  If we only include the 7 missions that makes for a very small sample size which in statistics generally increases uncertainty.  Take a coin and flip it 10 times, chances are you won’t get exactly 5 heads and 5 tails because any single outlier or statistical fluke will have a huge impact on your data.  With only 7 missions to go on that means that the average imminent death rate can be as high as 14% without 7 successes in a row being unexpected.  Considering that the space shuttle killed all crew on 1.4% if it’s launches, you’ve basically proven that Saturn V’s are either perfectly safe, 10 times as deadly as space shuttles, or literally anywhere in between.</p>

<p>Speaking of space shuttles, their first 17 launches went flawlessly yet they clearly don’t have 100% safety.  Clearly judging from such a small data set doesn’t work because it wasn’t until the 51st launch that the first major space shuttle disaster happened.</p>

<p>But wait, there’s more.  You know the 3 major close calls with death I named off the top of my head in the Apollo program I mentioned before?  They all happened to to the 7 missions that had “land on the Moon” on their agenda.  This brings the likelihood of a close call with death up to 43%.</p>

<p>Also, 7 missions with plans to land on the Moon and 6 moon landings.  What’s up with that?  Well, Apollo 13.  Their Command service module exploded rendering it’s engine and life support completely fucked.  The crew had to jerry rig the lunar module life support systems meant to support 2 people for a couple days to support 3 people for a week using the CSM’s CO2 scrubbers.  They made use of their free return trajectory using the lunar module’s engines for course corrections and they had to pray that their heat shield wasn’t damaged by the explosion during reentry.  100% safety my ass.</p>

<p>For the sake of argument I’ll give it to you that every scrap of data about building Saturn V rockets was lost and everyone who built them forgot what they’ve been doing for the past decade.  There is a fully functional Saturn V currently on display at the Kennedy Space Center.  If you wanted to get to the moon quickly and probability of certain death were no factor you could refurbish the would be Apollo 18 rocket or even reverse engineer it.  Nobody has done that though because the things are death traps.</p>

<p>We lost the technology to build Saturn V’s in the same sense that we lost the technology to build IBM 5100’s, we could still make new ones if we really wanted to but setting up the production line again would take a lot of work for something so obsolete and it would just be easier and better in every way to build a new modern design with new technology.</p>

<p>I dont believe apollo went to the moon. There are too many inconsistencies,  strange coincidences, and odd behavior of the astronauts for me to believe it.</p>

<p>For the record I have a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering and work at a Fortune 500 company that makes turbine blades for jet engines, so I think I have at least some credibility from a technical perspective. </p>

<p>I also hate arguing on the internet because it is a waste of time and it typically devolves into insults.</p>

<p>I read your post. I understand your position. I just, as an engineer, cannot accept the fact that, even with nearly every apollo mission going perfectly accoring to plan, with no deaths (again, apollo 1 not included), that the technology is too old and outdated to simply remake and reuse. </p>

<p>Never in my career or life for that matter have I come across a piece of technology that wasnt made easier and cheaper as time went on, except for the apollo technology. Which was also something that worked first try, on another celliestial body, flawlessly. Its illogical to me. Especially since our experience in space was faarrrr behind the Russians, who had achieved many milestones prior to us.</p>

<p>I believed the moon landings were real for the last 29 years of my life. I accepted them as fact, and though of the people who doubted them as morons. I took all of the official explinations for various discrepancies at face value, because why would they lie about this stuff? </p>

<p>However some anomalies in the videos/photos/interviews/behaviors/etc piqued my interest, and since then, havnt been able to look at the situation the same. I could type out all of the aspects that lead me to believe it was faked, but unless you can simply open your mind to the possibility and view the situation through a different perspective, it would be a waste of my time. </p>

<p>I dont believe in flat earth, I don&#39;t think the gov did 9/11, I dont think chemtrails are real. The moon landing is the only conspiracy that makes me want to dig deeper. And aince doing so, my opinion on the matter has changed dramatically, which, as well as I know myself, doesnt happen often. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading this if you did, Im genuinely unnerved by this situation, and I hope I can at least get someone else to examine the situation without immediately dismissing it, bcause like I said, I <em>knew</em> for a fact it was real, all up until recently. </p>

<p>I also hate when that happens, so let’s just agree to avoid insults and ad hominem fallacies.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>But the Apollo missions didn’t all go flawlessly, the first four missions especially were full of all kinds of hardware failures.  It wasn’t until Apollo 15 that they were able to get to the Moon without anything breaking down or exploding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Never in my career or life for that matter have I come across a piece of technology that wasnt made easier and cheaper as time went on, except for the apollo technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What about any sort of antique item?  I remember my neighbor used to own an old model-t car from back when cars were new.  It’s a slow vehicle with no seatbelts and in terms of performance is objectively worse than any modern car, yet it cost him way more than any regular car because nobody has made a model-t in so long.  One could start manufacturing them again but why would they do that when for the same amount of effort they could start manufacturing a new car design that’s objectively better?</p>

<p>The same applies to rockets.  They are more efficient and reliable than they used to be, which is exactly why the Saturn V design is obsolete and in dire need of being replaced.  Attempts have been made to replace it only to be met with government budget cuts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which was also something that worked first try, on another celliestial body, flawlessly. Its illogical to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do know that the first 10 Apollo missions has a purpose, right?  They tested all the Apollo hardware out in the field before Apollo 11, so it was not the first try.  Also, it was far from flawless as I explained above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Especially since our experience in space was faarrrr behind the Russians, who had achieved many milestones prior to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It makes perfect sense when you consider the different strategies the US and Russia had.  The United States has a very slow and careful approach to space travel while the Russians rushed their projects resulting in very dangerous rockets.  That approach worked well for them until they got to the moon landing thing where there was so much that could go wrong that their recklessness caught up to them.  The Russian moon rocket was called the N-1 and they couldn’t even get it very far off the launchpad without it exploding because the project was too rushed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believed the moon landings were real for the last 29 years of my life. I accepted them as fact, and though of the people who doubted them as morons. I took all of the official explinations for various discrepancies at face value, because why would they lie about this stuff?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My experience is quite the opposite.  I was raised to believe that 9/11 was an inside job and that moon landings were likely faked, I was even a fan of the Alex Jones show.  At one point I began to realize that most conspiracy theories have a ton of major holes and with a bit of scientific knowledge the official stories begin to make a lot more sense.  Believe me, this is not just my default position.</p>

<p>I would be interested to hear about the anomalies you speak of in the photos and videoed from the Moon landings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hardware errors aside, the missions as a whole were a success. They made it to the moon, walked around, and came back safely. Every single one of them. I understand the complexity of what they were supposedly doing, so having some minor failures in their systems is going to happen regardless. That doesnt, in my eyes, mean that the trips were anything but 100% successful. </p>

<p>Antique items- thats a good point, however most monetary value from those items is derrived from human nature and supply/demand. An actual model T is expensive because there are few of them left in good working condition, therefore driving up what people will charge/pay for them. That is more of an economics argument than a technical argument. </p>

<p>As far as recreating the technology, I know from experience that, while there are some costs associated with putting old tools back into production and making new ones that were lost, they are far less than creating entirely new technologies and production lines. If the original Model T tooling still exists, which im sure it does, making one brand new Model T would be expensive. However, if suddenly the demand for model Ts was the same as the demand for Honda Civics, the Model T would cost almost nothing to produce.</p>

<p>The same applies to the Saturn V rocket. It would be far easier for Nasa to take an already existing, &quot;proven&quot; piece of technology, update some aspects of the design for modern requirements, than it would be to completely start over (which they are doing). That doesnt sit right with me as and engineer who works in a production environment. </p>

<p>The Russians were held back by their N1 design, I do agree with that. It was far too complex to be reliable, but even so, their successes far overshadowed ours. If Russia was able to achieve so much before us, why were we all the sudden able to achieve something far far far far greater, while at the same time being so far behind them? Its like a college baseball team showing up the the world series and beating the Yankees 4-0, then the Yankees never winning a game ever again.</p>

<p>I dont think all of the theories presented lack scientific credibility. I think we have been so indoctrinated into believing its real, we accept what we are told by Nasa as a fact, and theyre Nasa right? Of course rocket scientists know the technical reasons behind this stuff. But in reality, they are just coming up with some technical arguments to explain their mistakes in the fakery, and since its such a big event in history, our psyche makes us believe that what were hearing are the reasons behind the very real flaws in their story. </p>

<p>If youre interested, and its what changed my mind for good on the subject, watch Bart Sibrels documentaries &quot;A funny thing happened on the way to the moon&quot; and &quot;Astronauts gone wild&quot;. Bart is the same guy that got punched by Buzz Aldrin (lol). Apparently while requesting footage of apollo 11, he was sent some unedited, classified video of the astronauts faking the shot of them being halfway to the moon.</p>

<p>In the second movie, he is interviewing astronauts about their time in the moon for what he told them is a documentary, but as soon as he mentions he has this footage, almost <em>all</em> of them start acting like complete lunatics! Swearimg at him, hitting him, literally running away from him. Not at all the behavior of a person who is telling the truth. You would think by now the astronauts would have heard people call the moon landing fake that they wouldnt have such a visceral reaction to it, but they all get very hostile. That in itself makes me believe these guys are just a bunch of liars. You could accuse me of not doing something all day long, and if I actually did do it, Im not going to immediately get mad and start swearing at you. Thats just not how honest people behave. </p>

<p>Anyway, glad this hasnt turned into name calling, etc. Im just genuinely overwhelmed by the fact that Im almost 100% confident it was fake, and much of human history is built on a lie and that its basically blasphemy to question it.</p>

<p>Hardware errors aside, the missions as a whole were a success. They made it to the moon, walked around, and came back safely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, Apollo 13 needed to cancel it’s moon landing because of it’s CSM explosion and it completed almost none of it’s objectives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antique items- thats a good point, however most monetary value from those items is derrived from human nature and supply/demand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a good point, although with all the narrowly avoided disasters and incredibly limited capabilities of the Saturn V I would argue that it’s demand is pretty low compared to that of a newer better rocket.  I would also like to mention the Saturn V on display at the KSC again, even if they did lose the technology they could just reverse engineer that thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>while there are some costs associated with putting old tools back into production and making new ones that were lost, they are far less than creating entirely new technologies and production lines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll give you that, it would probably be cheaper to start producing something old than to make something new.</p>

<p>I would like to bring up another thing though: the capabilities of the Saturn V were very limited.  It’s computer was as powerful as a modern day calculator, it’s landing sites were limited to regions close to the Lunar equator, it couldn’t stay on the Moon for more than a couple days, it could only carry two people down to the surface, and it barely had the cargo space for one small rover in the later missions.  This is in addition to the safety issues which modern space travel technology can mitigate.  It would be like if car manufactures kept making model-t’s instead of designing new cars because it would save money, which would be insane when technology exists which can improve cars a lot.</p>

<p>Look up the Constellation program, it was a plan to return humans to the Moon until it’s funding got cut for political reasons, but it’s crew and cargo capacity would have been large enough to set up a Moon base.  It’s the logical next thing to build after figuring out how to get there in the first place.  Just imagine what kind of Moon rocket could be built with SpaceX’s booster landing technology and tell me we don’t need an upgrade.</p>

<p>The United States was not that far behind.  The Russians launched Yuri Gagarin into orbit in 1961 and the Americans launched John Glenn into orbit in 1962.  It’s not like Americans just planted a flag on the Moon before Russian even had a chance of getting there, the first N-1 launched before Apollo 11 but it was just so rushed and had so many problems that it could barely even make it off the launchpad and after the fourth time their rocket exploded they gave up on the design.  The Russians tried and failed before the Americans tried at all, and if they succeeded like they did the previous times the would have also gotten to the Moon first.  Americans were never far behind Russia and when Russia made a mistake the Americans took advantage of it.</p>

<p>I do agree that America had the motivation to fake the moon landings, but a conspiracy theory which would make more sense is Americans sabotaging the N-1 because that’s the reason America won the space race.  The visual effects technology of the 1960’s is nowhere near what you’d need to fake the moon landings that good.  Have you seen “2001: a Space Odyssey”?  It was made in the 1960’s and considered revolutionary yet it’s scenes on the Moon look like garbage by modern VFX standards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CUNY you should say that right after <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.teslarati.com/spacex-private-passenger-bfr-moon-mission/amp/">this news from SpaceX</a> came out, there are plans to do that exact thing and the only reason it hasn’t been done already on the FalconHeavy is because there was a decision to not bother human rating that launch vehicle.</p>

<p>The main problem with that idea of using 1960’s tech for commercial space flight is that the Apollo program cost 25 billion dollars and a single Saturn V cost over a billion dollars.  To put that in perspective Elon Musk’s net worth is 20 billion dollars.</p>

<p>Bear in mind, that’s net worth.  Not bank balance.  If even Elon Musk wanted to construct a Saturn V he would need to sell a billion dollars in assets which means buildings closed and jobs lost.  All this for a week long trip to the Moon and back which has about a 25% chance of a catastrophic life threatening failure.</p>

<p>If a company did this they would need to rely on volume to break even after the R&amp;D costs associated with designing and testing a rocket so a lot of billionaires would need to be willing to take this quite insane deal.</p>

<p>SpaceX on the other hand with their reusable boosters they have cut space travel costs by nearly an order of magnitude, and their upcoming reusable orbiters promise to lower it even further to the point where fuel is the largest expense.  That is the only reason they have been able to realistically consider Lunar tourism.</p>

<p>If we accept that we had recovered a crashed UFO in 1947 and began back-engineering the technology at that time, that&#39;s over 20 years of development time, not to mention what we may have gained from the Nazis/Operation Paperclip.</p>

<p>Theoretically, any vehicle sufficiently shielded against radiation would have been too heavy to launch into space with a conventional rocket, but antigravity would have solved that problem.</p>

<p>If the astronauts really went to the moon, I think it&#39;s possible that they used antigravity vehicles to bring everything up there and then staged the landing site. That would explain the lack of a crater or disturbed dust under the lander. And also allows for the items (reflectors and whatnot) that were allegedly left behind by the astronauts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I 100% believe this is what happened, but it&#39;s one theory that I think accounts for everything.</p>

Gnosticism was persecuted into obscurity during the advent of Roman Catholicism, however it has had a modern resurgence which has continued developing the context and nature of its theology.

I&#39;m always amazed at the hypocrisy of people who are prepared to accept scientists when they say that the Van Allen belts exist but they then ignore those same scientists when they point out that the belts could be handled. The Apollo missions bypassed the inner Van Allen belt and passed through only the thinnest part of the outher belt, where the radiation is mainly high-energy electrons, and the aluminium of the spacecraft hull was sufficient protection against them. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf">Nasa scientists had carefully caulated the likely exposure</a>, and even took into account radiation left over from the 1962 Starfish Prime detonation. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/SMIII_Problem7.pdf">You can do a basic exposuree calulation yourself here.</a></p>

<p>The Apollo missions had the following radiation detectors on board: a nuclear particle detection system; a Van Allen belt dosimeter; three personal radiation dosimeters; and a portable radiation survey meter. Each astronaut also carried four thermoluminescent dosimeters.</p>

<p>By nuclear facility, I assume you mean nuclear reactors.</p>

<p>They produce a all types of radiation, alpha, beta, gamma, and neutron.</p>

<p>Thick lead (or water) is required to stop gamma and neutron radiation. This is because they are have a neutral charge, and so basically need to collide directly into a nucleus to stop.</p>

<p>Alpha and beta are charge particles, and take <em>much</em> less material to stop, beta taking a few mm of aluminum or plastic, and alpha only travelling ~2-3 inches in air, and are able to be stopped by a piece of paper.</p>

<p>Pretty much, the radiation is &quot;deadly&quot; in the sense that it&#39;s relatively high compared to the rest of space. If you were to fly a space station in it for a long period, it would be a concern, and generally a bad idea, but for a short direct flight through, you&#39;re not going to be exposed to a significant amount of radiation.</p>

<p>The thing about radiation is that it&#39;s the cumulative dose that you have to worry about, not the strength of the field itself. There&#39;s a concept in radiation protection called ALARA, &quot;As low as reasonably achievable&quot;. The idea is to reduce the total dose of radiation as best you can, while still doing the work you need. In order to go outside near earth, you <em>have</em> to travel through the belts, but if you limit the time inside them, that&#39;s an acceptable amount of exposure, since it&#39;s so small compared to the dose require to cause any harm</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So you believe nasa when they say the van Allen belts weren’t a problem in the 60s because “we hadn’t discovered them yet”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FYI: This is incorrect, the belts were confirmed to exist in 1958 by the Explorer 1 and 3 satellites, and had been theorized to exist before that, since people knew magnetic fields can trap charged particles.</p>

<p>Multiple satellites were sent up during the late 50s and 60s to map and measure the belts, they knew pretty well what they were getting into by &#39;68 when Apollo 8 went to orbit the moon. A literal decade of research before they sent anyone through them. </p>

<p>So no, &quot;we hadn&#39;t discovered them yet&quot; is not an accurate statement, and whoever you are quoting is just wrong.</p>

<p>But what purpose would there be for this? There&#39;s nothing interesting between the van allen belts and the moon that would give anyone a reason to send an astronaut through for. What would you need to practice? It&#39;s not a physical barrier, or technically tricky, it&#39;s just a zone with higher than normal radiation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do I think they need to practice for a mission to Mars? Yes. Although keep in mind these are my opinions as someone with no aerospace background.</p>

<p>They need to practice long duration trips without the option to resupply, right now the ISS gets regular shipments with more air, water, food, equipment, etc. That&#39;s not an option for long haul travel. We don&#39;t have a design right now for something that could go the required months without resupply.</p>

<p>I also think they need to practice a long term stay and habitation on the moon first, the Apollo missions spent a couple days at most, with at most 3 EVAs with two people, which could be done without long term concern over things like dust, power, waste, heat, etc.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s any need to practice travelling through the Van Allen belts. What do you think there is that they need to practice? They literally just have to fly through them. There have been numerous scientific probes that have been used to map and measure the contents. There&#39;s nothing there, if you didn&#39;t have radiation monitoring, you wouldn&#39;t even notice you went through them.</p>

<p>The actual scientists and engineers that have to worry about things like building space ships and planning missions say that the radiation from the Van Allen Belts are not deadly to astronauts passing through them. There is no confusion about it from the people doing the actual research on the actual Van Allen Belts, the only confusion is from people with little to no scientific background trying to interpret these reports (or interpret the interpretations of other people, or interpret something they read on a forum once, and now carry about to any conversation they have in the future)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main reason nobody has been there since is because of politicians canceling finding to those programs.  It takes a multi million dollar skyscraper sized launch vehicle to go to the Van Allen belts and you think that radiation is the only obstacle?</p>

<p>That explanation isn’t from NASA, it’s from the field of particle physics.  Earth’s magnetic field collects only charged particles in the Van Allen belts, and charged particles are easily blocked by thin objects.  The same property that makes the particles come together in belts makes them easy to block.  It’s not like neutron radiation which needs thick walls to block.</p>

<p>I mean, NASA is sending an unmanned then a manned capsule through the belts and around the moon in the coming years to prepare for manned flights into deep space.

<p>Do you mean space radiation is different to radiation from the nuclear facility, so we don&#39;t need thick lead wall but only some layer of aluminium?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By nuclear facility, I assume you mean nuclear reactors.</p>

<p>They produce a all types of radiation, alpha, beta, gamma, and neutron.</p>

<p>Thick lead (or water) is required to stop gamma and neutron radiation. This is because they are have a neutral charge, and so basically need to collide directly into a nucleus to stop.</p>

<p>Alpha and beta are charge particles, and take <em>much</em> less material to stop, beta taking a few mm of aluminum or plastic, and alpha only travelling ~2-3 inches in air, and are able to be stopped by a piece of paper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you downvote and then express disbelief I&#39;ve &quot;ever argued for a conspiracy theory&quot;
I&#39;d respect you more without the passive BS.
&quot;why would I refute your points, they&#39;re not relevant just your opinion&quot;
Yeah, ok. You do seem quite confused if you&#39;re contradicting that hard. </p>

<p>Do you lack reading comprehension or are just unfamiliar with the concept of sarcasm? </p>

<p>&quot;I was sarcastically implying if he remembered any of it he would recall the giant radiation belts&quot; </p>

<p>You should be able to hear these things whooshing over your head at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean your cognitive dissonance restricts you from including it in your reality? </p>

<p>I mean space isn&#39;t real and the moon landing was a hoax but not just because Alan Bean doesn&#39;t give a shit about the van Allen belts lol, it&#39;s just logically consistent with the behavior or someone pretending to have gone to the moon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for confirming you didn&#39;t even open the link! Now we can all see how you are driven by belief and faith (in the ridiculous) and not reason and logic.</p>

<p>From the same link (since the fear of being wrong is stronger than your will to seek knowlegde):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first successful tests were carried out in 1962 when a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology succeeded in observing laser pulses reflected from the Moon&#39;s surface using a laser with a millisecond pulse length. Similar measurements were obtained later the same year by a Soviet team at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory using a Q-switched ruby laser. Greater accuracy was achieved following the installation of a retroreflector array on 21 July 1969, by the crew of Apollo 11, and two more retroreflector arrays left by the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 missions have also contributed to the experiment. Successful lunar laser range measurements to the retroreflectors were first reported by the 3.1 m telescope at Lick Observatory, Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories Lunar Ranging Observatory in Arizona, the Pic du Midi Observatory in France, the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory, and McDonald Observatory in Texas.</p>

<p>The unmanned Soviet Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2 rovers carried smaller arrays. Reflected signals were initially received from Lunokhod 1, but no return signals were detected after 1971 until a team from University of California rediscovered the array in April 2010 using images from NASA&#39;s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Lunokhod 2&#39;s array continues to return signals to Earth. The Lunokhod arrays suffer from decreased performance in direct sunlight—a factor considered in reflector placement during the Apollo missions.</p>

<p>The Apollo 15 array is three times the size of the arrays left by the two earlier Apollo missions. Its size made it the target of three-quarters of the sample measurements taken in the first 25 years of the experiment. Improvements in technology since then have resulted in greater use of the smaller arrays, by sites such as the Côte d&#39;Azur Observatory in Grasse, France; and the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico.</p>
