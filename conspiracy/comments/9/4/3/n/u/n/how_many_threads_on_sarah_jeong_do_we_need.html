       That's not true in any way shape or form. And that hardly means we need 9 threads about it.

       What? Key word there is "multiple". Don't put words into my mouth, thank you very much.

       White nationalists' whole online presence is basically a giant circlejerk and it doesn't bother me in the least. Nor do I care that people are talking about this racist NYT hire. Just don't need 10 posts about it on the front page of r/conspiracy.

       No way to tell what the deleted comments are, seeing as they weren't around long enough to archive. So your evidence is...? Regardless, not seeing many explicitly anti-white comments after spending a few minutes sifting, can you point me in the right direction so I can report them?

       Yeah, there was a comment in there at over 200 upvotes talking about how "this is why white Supremacists are coming back, you made us do this!" As though people who have a problem with one person being a racist asshole would then choose to support more racists assholes...
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been a targeted campaign from the start, The thread on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       has over FIFTEEN Gold. Nothing gets that many unless its part of a targeted campaign. the 1488 crowd is trying to worm their way back into popular opinion using any vice they can find, and an actual racist anti-white person getting into a position of (realtive) prominence is a golden opportunity for them to peddle their own brand of racist shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet crickets from the crowd who is so fast to call out shilling and decry the media for having a "race baiting" agenda...odd. Is it acceptable for them when race baiting is done by groups like this? It has all the same force and organization that they say the MSM has, but I see not a single thread calling it out here for obvious shilling.

       I think there’s a pretty concerted effort to project that feeling on to people. I mean, look at how this is all going dow. I’m a dude who doesn’t give a shit about this any more than I give about nearly any twitter wacko, unless that wacko happens to directly effect or represent
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       in some way (I don’t want a cop in my city, or a teacher at my kid’s school, or you know the president of the fucking country to be some whacked out lunatic but who has the time to care about every lunatic out there?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone bitching about double-standards is ignoring the roots and intentions of modern racism in America, or they have been truly convinced that they are “under attack”, or more than likely a lot of them are puppeteers by people who don’t want you paying attention to actual
       <em>
        news
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way this is idiotic. It’s gonna be a full-time job if people are going to start finding every racist thing someone ever said on the internet...I don’t envy it. There’s a lot. And if you cum all over your keyboard about an Asian woman hating on white people on the internet and decide to get outraged, it’s pretty obvious you’re a
       <em>
        hypocrite
       </em>
       or you think your white supremacy is being threatened. It’s so lame. But then, I comfort myself knowing that a lot of this outrage is artificial, it really is distracting the types of folks who need to be distracted from global events so their reality can stay in place.

       Lol, I'm half black. I'm hardly a racism apologist. People say fucked up shit, no one is politically correct 100% of the time. Don't get me wrong, racism is definitely a cold stop, but I feel like a lot of the time people are picking and choosing stories to fit an agenda. Was she wrong for saying it? Absolutely. Is she wrong if she actually feels that way? Most definitely absolutely. How many people would give a shit if it didn't spread like wildfire? Probably near none.

       I know that different stories are picked for spreading by different propaganda groups.  The NYTimes has run many stories about racists in the conservative/GOP crowd, but they won't run this.  Similarly, I'm sure Breitbart is running with this story but maybe didn't cover Roseanne Barr much.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for individual people, I'm not so sure.  Like I said, racism is a hard stop for me.  I don't want to associate with people who hate blacks, those who hate whites, or really any racial group.  When I traveled in Europe, I skipped people who complained about Gypsies.

       I don't know, I care about that.  Someone who hates a race -- any race -- like that probably has a lot of other noxious beliefs.  In media, she will have an outsized voice compared to others.  I'd certainly keep a wary eye on her, but an even more watchful eye on the NY Times which (apparently) condones this particular brand of racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then I already don't like the NY Times, mostly because this is not the first time they have espoused and condoned racism and hatred.

       That's a colossal understatement. The NYTimes has defended their choice to make Jeong an editor and openly defended their decision even after they were confronted with Jeong's explicit racism. That means that the story has moved on. It is no longer about Sarah Jeong's hatred of whites and is now about the anti-white hatred expressed by the Jews who publish the NYTimes.

       She is talking/daydreaming about a world without a particular race. Just consider that. I actually think fuck it, go for it, say what you want, but I’d think there would be consequences of that. Not saying anything violent should happen to her or that she should get charged, I guess I’m just surprised you’d want to hire that person. That’s what is fucked to me about it.

      <p>
       It's interesting, if not frustrating, to witness how the NYT &amp; other media outlets are dismissing this by ridiculing anyone who speaks out against this as trolls &amp; accuse them of harassment while turning Jeong into a victim because she's an asian woman.
      </p>

       Its all classic media manipulation. A clinic on how much of a tool the media is to warp the public.

       Can you imagine the outrage if Sarah Jeong was Sarah Jones instead and these tweets were about blacks? OH the world would grind to a halt!
Liberals would come sprinting out of their basements...CNN reporters would light themselves on fire, it'd be a mess!  /BillBurrVoice

       I imagine it would be the same lack of action that occured when a republican senator called Michelle Obama an ape in heels or Palin's tweet that Barack was doing "the old shuck and jive". Liberals typically under react rather than over react, they might get emotional but they're never going to do anything other than cry and hold vigils.

       3000 upvotes on r/conspiracy is often organic here, 5-6k is usually fake all the way.

       In just a little over a week, the Unite the Right rally will take place in DC, on the anniversary of the Charlottesville fiasco.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NYTimes has given the groups behind the rally a perfect opportunity to drum up support.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so plainly coordinated I can't believe more users aren't noticing. Instead, things are so amygdala-driven around here that our collective dog seems to be the one getting wagged.

       I'll be honest. This thought has crossed my mind as well. If you view both parties as parts of a ratchet working together, and I don't know why one you wouldn't at this point, then it's not hard to see a coordinated effort to disenfranchise and push white voters to the right polarizing them that in turn polarizes and pushes everyone else to the left.

       They don't even need to be working together.
       <br/>
       Their current viewers just want to be proven that white nationalists are a huge issue in the US, and they know that if they do get footage of white nationalists existing, and being pissed, they'll keep their dumbasses viewers hooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, poke the bear, make it angry, and then you'll get more footage of angry bear to show your dumbasses.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'll work until they've actually started a race war, and the news gets taken out first. Then it won't look like it was such a good idea.

       There are more members of blm, than white nationalist.
       <br/>
       The statistics don't agree with you. There's like barely 2500 white nationalist in the whole us.

       People who clamor about "white nationalism" are just suffering from racial fragility. XD

       Technically you're correct, but they're not looking for that they're looking for an answer of a more "terroristy" flavor - like KKK or an organization, because he doesn't realize that you don't need to meet up with a bunch of hicks in a field anymore.

       It's been awhile since I've looked into the story, but the car didn't run her over. There wasn't any decent footage of the contact, so it's hard to say for certain just how bad she was hit. But there was footage of a first responder trying to resuscitate what was clearly a morbidly obese woman. It's such a shitty thing to split hairs on, but if someone's death is a combination of a stressful incident and their poor health, how much blame can one place on the "murder"?

       People don't believe she died of blunt for trauma to the chest. Personally, I don't. I believe she was hit by the car but she died of a heart attack. I haven't been able to find a vid of her getting hit. I have found a pic in another thread that shows her being hit.

       I think my comment about hemophilia is relevant so I want to revisit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say a crackhead broke into somebody's home and shot a woman with hemophilia. Because of her hemophilia she died from a gunshot wound that somebody without hemophilia might have survived,  but instead she held out before the ambulance arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should we call the crackhead's crime assault instead of murder, because it was really hemophilia's fault she died and not the crackhead's?

       I understand what you are saying. I just don't trust the report saying it was blunt force trauma. If we were talking feels, countless things could have killed her.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was overweight and a smoker. It was a stressful day. She could have fell down a few stairs and it would be just as likely to kill her. See where I am coming from? You haven't said anything about it but I am going to point out I am not defending the driver.

       You're saying you're not defending the driver. You're just saying that you don't think the driver was at fault and that a 32 year old woman, who you posted a picture of being in the path of a guy driving through a crowd of pedestrians died of natural causes isn't really to blame.

       If a hemophiliac gets grazed by a crackhead's bullet and dies from it, do we charge the crackhead with murder or say it's hemophilia's fault and give them a lesser charge?

      <p>
       If a 92 year old woman is grazed by a car plowing through a crowd of pedestrians and dies, should we say "what ever, she was old and going to die soon. A younger person would have survived"?

       I mean they were already at the rally. It was a huge fucking rally where protesters and anti-protesters were talking about race and southern history. You think that wouldn't be covered?

       Then HOURS into it a psycho runs a car into people and you're surprised the media who had been there for hours and in the age of everyone has a camera so they can post what X person from group Y did that people would film it?

       Anti white racism is not vilified like racism against any other race. It's even encouraged by a lot of popular and mainstream ideologies, groups, activists, and institutions. What we're seeing here, and how many institutions, such as a few MSM outlets, popular sites and subreddits, etc, is just a reflection and a confirmation of that.

       But isn’t there a big movement in the US around white people being racist against everyone (black, Latinos, Jews, Muslim). Politicians, journalists. Isn’t this a double standard? I dunno, this seems like some ploy to whip up outrage for the alt right side.

       What big movement? This is the first I have ever heard of this big movement in the USA? secondly, this anti white racism is not restricted to America, it is easily noticeable and measurable across the entire Western world. With it becoming more so as the years go on.

       Unite the right? The presidents attacks on Mexicans, Muslims and mostly anyone with color. 
Not American, Aussie here but we are seeing it more and more here. Racial tensions are at a high here. Sure, there is anti white sentiment but is it justified?

       Unite the right is such a tiny group, and its views extremely diverse. When has the president ever attacked a Mexican on the basis of their ethnicity? Muslims aren't a race, so why is it being associated with racism?

       I mean he said some pretty messed up things (some are not that bad). 
The Muslim thing, I agree. My point is that there is racist things on both sides. But coming from westerners (whites) doesn’t get 30 threads here.

       How is calling a country, a shit hole racist. That can only be true if you believe the country is shit because of the biology of the race(s) inhabiting it. IE, Mexico is a shit hole because of Mexicans, and Mexicans make it a shit hole because of their genes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump attacked illegal Mexican immigrants, as he should. All criminals need to be judged and sentenced appropriately.
      </p>
      <p>
       latimes shows a huge amount of racism here, believing when you call a country a shit hole, it must be racist, because clearly it is that way due to the genetics of the people in those countries. That's the only way you can find it racist, is to essentially agree with race realism, and then say its racist to point it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason you will see anti white racism get more attention here is because it is not acceptable in the mainstream to criticize it. That's how much power and influence is in support of it, when you are ostracized for pointing it out, at best, and socially pressured into being okay with it.

       If the intention is to pit the two against each other then there's no reason one side would be spared.  This is like basic south pacific anthropology, Bateson and Meade documented these kinds of cultural matrix for cia in 40s.

       Jump to p64-68 or thereabouts in Gregory Bateson's book Steps To An Ecology of Mind that's where he goes into specific cultural warfare strategies to achieve the kind of schizmogenesis we are look at here.  Googlebooks a has it.   I'm not exactly confident NYT cares about its public image enough to bet against whether or not they'd risk tarnishing it.  It's not like they're gonna just organically implode over some dumb shit they did but I share the fantasy.

       I certainly don't think the NYT will implode over this either, it just seems to me that this fiasco and their response cedes too much moral ground, and they've heavily depended on that public impression of moral ground as a foundation for most of their reporting lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just one obvious but topical example, I can't imagine them making the same statement on Roseanne's cancellation after this incident. It would be too much cognitive dissonance for any but the very truest of believers to swallow.
      </p>

       I think it is frustrating to see someone who openly fantasizes about white people being culled off joining an editing staff in a paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's frustrating that terms like white fragility get thrown around when someone is pointing out someone who would have been shitcanned harder than Weinstein if it was aimed at any other race. Instead she is applauded, lauded, and everyone is willing to turn a blind eye to an obvious double standard in both hiring practices, and the news that they put out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's frustrating that people freak out and assume we are trying to start a race war for voicing our concerns against the news and what many are perceiving as an anti-white bias, especially if she is now editing after openly voicing those opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like this corporate double standard where dudes like Gunn could get shit canned for shock humor but her racial tirades are yawn worthy. It's just a bit surreal to me.

       I'm calm, I was only voicing my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Difference in action between Gunn and this reporter is key for me. It's a racial double standard, and the only reason she still has a job is because it is acceptable to call white people goblins and trash people if you just say it's satire.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Gunn's firing was ignorant, but I view her tweets worse than I do Gunn's shock jokes, he never advocated for genocide.

        Right, you're just "anti-globalist" and definitely not running obfuscation for team-Trump (we can read your post history!). If I rolled my eyes any harder I'd pass the fuck out.

       It was not a good hire. What I'm saying is, it's being PLASTERED across conspiracy because the left finally did something the right can beat the war drum about. They have very little ammo, especially considering the garbage coming from the right constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're trying to equate the hiring of one racist to a network literally run by racists and push the narrative that both sides are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not. There are bad apples on both sides, but it's not an even distribution. The right has to take what they can get and they don't have much ammo.

       Left-right dynamics have no bearing on why stories are organically spread across conspiracy boards. Most here understand racial tensions are eagerly taken advantage of by both parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the real reason this gains so much traction here and other alternative media sources is because the situation so clearly exposes hypocrisy. It's also compounded by the fact that discussion on the topic is being actively censored elsewhere, such as that

       No the right is pointing out the blatant hypocrisy. The NY Times fired an editor after it was shown that he espoused anti gay sentiments on his Twitter account.
      </p>
      <p>
       This ignoramus espoused anti white sentiments which were blatantly racist and not only did she not get fired the NY Times defend her. Don't you see the hypocrisy?
      </p>
      <p>
       And also, Imagine if we switched the words"white" to black do you really believe the NY Times would've defensed her? She would've been fired immediately.

       That’s not a fair summary, it was defended by the NYT. This isn’t something that happens all the time, it would never happen with the roles switched. It’s blatant bullshit and I think a fuss should be made about it, because otherwise the justification is accepted and it can only get worse.

       If this exact situation happened with the target being black people, for example, you bet it’d be everywhere and she’d be fired.

       White fragility is the far left term equivalent of the far right terms like cucked and triggered and snowflake. It's an insulting and dismissive term to ridicule the other person and shut down discussion. Both are pretty toxic towards an actual dialogue.

       The “fragility” is the overreaction to racism against whites. Generalizations and prejudice against you hurt no matter who you are. But as a white man I can see that my hurt feelings are really the only negative effect when people have treated me differently based on race. No matter how someone makes me feel, I still enjoy the most deference and respect from society as a whole of any demographic. That hasn’t changed even if someone was mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blatant and person racist invective against a minority has more effects. It just does, sorry. Stigmatization of black and brown Americans feeds on itself cumulatively, meaning the racism that flows from the historically powerful down onto the less powerful will always have the context of social hierarchy and power. Even, to paraphrase LBJ, from the lowest white man to the highest black man.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, no one should be racist- but people are in every part of society. Intellectual honesty demands that we look at said racism in historical and cultural context. In the case of a Asian woman casting aspersions on established white American men, I’m sorry to say this doesn’t have much impact or importance beyond hurt feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im going to assume that the people who are most freaked out by this woman are white guys who feel like her opinions going unchallenged are a dangerous precedent. To that I’d say take a deep breath, a look around, and realize you’re still in charge. If you still feel powerless, first look to make sure there isn’t another white dude standing on your neck before you worry about a lady being mean online.

       Yeah there's way too many people absurdly butt hurt over those posts which is just silly. There's so much vitriol on the internet i find it hard to believe this many people find the issue in her statements and not the double standards in the infrastructure which allowed her to do it without suffering the consequences she would have faced had she been talking about Laotians or something. I'm fairly certain there's an effort in distracting from the real problem with the situation (the asymmetry that comes with "academic" racism) by astroturfing with a bunch of stereotypical white lives matter shit.

       When you get hired to the biggest news paper in the world after going  on racist tirade for years this will happen. Don't act as if this out of left field.

       Probably one more, since you seem to really want to just hide it away in a big thread. "Oh, racism against white people? We must hide it somewhere, you can't be racist against whitey".

       I agree, that is 100% the main takeaway from pretty much any topic in here. If we could boil down every culturally divisive story that's showed up in modern western politics the end lesson would be that divide and conquer really works and I'm going to hazard a guess that the western world has never been as divided in both political and world views as it is today.

       I really think people underestimate the power of linguistic programming, people are concerned because a word is being redefined to refer to a certain type of (dictionary definition) racism in which the offending person's "privilege" (which is culturally determined) is paramount in determining whether a certain act is racist, with this word she's absolutely not an (academic definition) racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the problem, one word and two ideas. I personally agree with the formal concept of the academic definition and think it does refine certain aspects of how racism manifests at a societal level but there must be a reason this didn't simply become "culturally enforced racism" or some other highly specific and academic concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is that the concept does still work appropriately in almost all cases but only if you accept people of different ethnicities who share the same "race" can exhibit racism against a distinct ethnic group also belonging to the same "race". If not that's when the two definitions really diverge and things start becoming political and highly anchored in the western world after the beginning of the atlantic slave trade.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example the Irish have been absolutely stomped on for almost a millennium by the english (mainly Anglo-Saxons) and were even enslaved and brought to Iceland by the Nordic peoples. The problem is that the "privilege" that the icelandic slave traders had over the Irish would go undetected by the academic definition (as far as I understand it) simply because they are too similar ethnically.
      </p>
      <p>
       A similar example is the conflict in Rwanda between the ethnically Bantu Hutu people and the Bantu-Cushitic Tutsi, was this a case of academic racism? The Cushitic and the Bantu are distinct linguistic-ethnic groups and since (I) the Hutu were the majority ethnic group (II) they exercised privilege over their Tutsi neighbors it seems enough to call it an example of racism yet wikipedia mentions that academics have recently concluded "there are no significant ethnic differences between the two groups" so that racism in the academic sense is out of the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's literally doublespeak. Not to mention most people's idea of the "privileged" party has been cemented in the context of western society and in some sense can even be stereotyping non-whites in the process; I doubt many would say the Japanese were exhibiting their "Japanese privilege" when they opressed the chinese and Koreans after getting the imperial itch to invade China and Korea but is that simply because they're all "Asian' (like the irish and nordic are both white and the Hutu/Tutsi both black)? If so that's something like being an anti racist who uses racial stereotyping to fight racism...

       Shes not even racist. Her tweets were meant as a joke in retaliation to alt-righters filling her page with racist shit. She flipped and started posting white jokes to get a reaction and people started taking it out of context.

       Yeah it was those goddamn alt-righters. Even though she made these tweets before the existence of the sole-called alt-right, you can rest assured she was making these tweets IN RESPONSE to the alt-righters. Further, you can clearly tell she is indeed replying to alt-right white supremacists when she makes tweet after tweet without replying to anyone and simply stating her opinion.

       incorrect. I remember it as far back as 2009 in relation to Tea Party stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that these statements were made in reaction to the abuse she received on twitter, yes. Because that's what she said and it makes sense regarding what I know about how people are treated by assholes on twitter, especially when they are women, non-white, and are public figures writing about tech (of all things).

       When the media created the term to put center liberals, libertarians, and white nationalists in the same basket.  But especially white nationalists, because now it's a dog-whistle to call everyone right of center a nazi bigot.  That's why Dave Ruben and anyone he doesn't shout down in an interview are considered alt-right.

       The Sarah Jeong story is growing into something much bigger than Sarah Jeong. Everyone can see that Jeong hates Whites, but when the (((NYTimes))) publishes a statement defending her appointment, the anti-White bigotry of the (((NYT))) is clearly laid bare for all to see. That's what makes this story so huge. It allows us to peak underneath the surface and see that the Jews who run the Times will tolerate and endorse expressions of racial hatred against Whites that they would never allow against their fellow Jews.

       I am unsure of the subs policy on linking pics of dying or dead people. You can google pics of her at the scene. She was morbidly obese.

       There are more members of blm, than white nationalist.
       <br/>
       The statistics don't agree with you. There's like barely 2500 white nationalist in the whole us.
       <br/>
       People who clamor about "white nationalism" are just suffering from racial fragility. XD
       <br/>
       It's the "muh russia" of race relations, a negligible part that has no impact.

       Lol white nationalism isn’t a real thing.  Most white gangs with any power are prison gangs. Those gangs largely exist as a function of survival.
