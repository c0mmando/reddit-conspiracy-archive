       Is this just another example of Reddit trying to divide people. The posts aren't necessarily bad, but it just reinforces identity politics.

       It seems odd that virtually 24 hours a day, there is a post from both of those subreddits on the front page.

       White people Twitter isn't popular enough to be on the front page everyday. It has about the same number of subscribers as Conspiracy. Also, most of the posts are just regular Tweets that happen to be from white people, they don't have anything specifically that makes them "white". The top post right now is about a guy who talks about his first day as a bartender. Is something about this exclusively a white person's experience or reaction? If anything it's more of a dad joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see black people Twitter being popular enough as years ago that was a source of a lot of memes and has 2 million subscribers.

       They're both to stereotype the two different groups. Of course the white one isn't about anything in particular, that's the joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about division, if that were the case they'd be more hostile. I imagine they share a lot of users too.

       Obviously if they were filled with hate filled Tweets the manipulation wouldn't work. What I meant by divisive is that it's just to constantly reinforce the idea that racial and gender identity comes first before anything else. It's nuanced but that's how modern manipulation works. They don't put up huge posters that say "obey or die" in case you haven't noticed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But nobody has answered how white people Twitter has about the same number of users as Conspiracy yet Conspiracy is lucky to get on the front page a few times a year. White people Twitter is on the front page several times a day. No other Reddit with that few subscribers gets on the front page several times a day. All the other ones like Aww or Gaming have millions of subscribers.
      </p>
      <p>
       White people Twitter is obviously pushed to the front page for a reason.

       It's a meme subreddit. It has a much more active user base than Conspiracy. That number of people you see viewing their subreddit are actually contributing due to the more open nature of the place. Not everyone upvotes here due to the skepticism so not much gets traction.

       Conspiracy was just used as an example to show they have about the same number of users, not that the content is the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       No reddit with only 600K users is on the front page several times a day except for white people Twitter. If that content was so well liked, why is the subscriber number so low, even with constant front page exposure?
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly it is being forced to the front page for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       People can argue as to why and perhaps there is an innocent reason, but it seems pretty clear that it is being pushed on the front page.

       Content is very important as to the popularity of subreddits. And if you want to know a reason why its subscriber count is lower, it's because it's a spin off of a different subreddit that a lot of people already didn't care much for. Also it's "WhitePeopleTwitter". Maybe people see it as uncool like they do with SequelMemes.

       The article doesn't say "All better! No racism left in America". Feel free to post a link to the article so people can make up their own minds. The fact that you went through my post history shows you must care about the issue in this thread way more than I do. I haven't looked through anyone's history who has replied to me. But I see you have.

       But thanks for adding evidence to my theory. Many people benefit from fostering racism and pitting races against each other. Perhaps that is why Reddit sees fit to make sure every day there is a post from blackpeopletwitter and whitepeopletwitter on the front page. Can't let the people forget they have differences now can we?

       You are missing my point. I could care less if a reddit makes fun of white culture with memes. The point is why is there always one blackpeopleTwitter and onewhitepeopletwitter on the front page every single day and often several times a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not against whitepeopletwitter, but it has way to few subscribers to be on the front page several times a day.

       Reddit has 14 billion page views a month. It's a very popular medium. With that many page views it has the ability to shape public opinion if it wants to.

      <p>
       So yes, I take it seriously as a site that influences public opinion. Also, I posted this on Reddit in a forum called Conspiracy. So I'm not sure why are you are insinuating this discussion is somehow out of place here. Seems like the perfect place to ask the question.

       Man you are getting hit with so many people intentionally mis-understanding your premise. Usually means you're over the target.

      <p>
       I've been noticing this for a while now. The constant harping on race that the media (and in turn, many people on the left. Not that the right is excused) does is so, unnatural? Like it wasn't this bad a few years ago.

       You understand that both of those subreddits are predominately populated by white people, right? And users of both subs of all races tend to be folks who can appreciate other cultures and joke about their own good-naturedly. The fact that you think these melting pots of memes and humor are somehow an attempt to
       <em>
        divide

       people suggests you may be the one with the identity politics agenda. Or at least clueless.

       As I replied to someone else. I have ZERO problem with either of these subreddits and the content posted there.
      </p>
      <p>
       My issue is that there is no way whitepeopletwitter has enough users to be on the front page several times a day. Reddit is pushing it to the front page for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't try to confuse the issue here by falsely claiming I disagree with the content of blackpeopletwitter or whitepeopletwitter or lack an understanding of who posts there . The issue is the fact that one is obviously being pushed to front page when organically it would never end up there every day.

       And we have seen the blatant manipulation reddit has been pulling for the last couple years, it got even worse when net neutrality was repealed. The idea that someone is pushing their own agenda at the top is not unfeasible.

      <p>
       Fuck sakes this is conspiracy, we all know aaron one of the original creaters was murdered for his beliefs, do i find this idea hard to believe? ill just tell you, yeah i believe its possible. The fbi/cia are bad about doing the same thing in real life, sending in undercover people to pretty much every college campus in the states, just to keep a eye on "radicals", now they dont need to have undercover people doing all the leg work, because people are stupid and give all their information for free on fb and other social media sites. They are there to observe, but most of the time end up promoting dissent, got to keep their funding coming in, am i right? I wouldnt be at all suprised if the movment BLM, was originally created by the gubment to keep people mad at each other, and not the real people who shoulder most of the blame, the ones at the very tip top. I do beleive the scariest thought for these people is that all of us are going to realize weve been played and lied to and revolt, but as long as we are fighting and blaming each other with the illusion that were somehow different because our skin is a different shade of color... thats never going to happen. Fucking mob mentality, people are animals and they dont even realize it most of them.

       This might be the wrong sub for me to say this to you, but I think you might just be a tad paranoid. As everyone else has said, those are satire subs with many active users. There has never been any prominent drama between them. I would think that if these subs were as divisive as you think they are, they're users would have much more open hostility toward each other.

       You are missing my point. I never said the subreddits themselves caused any problems or even were a problem to begin with. I have no problem with both of them. My point was how are they always on the front page, sometimes several times a day, when whitepeopletwitter has very few subscribers.

       Okay, I disagree as it doesn't fit the definition of either aspect (especially a threat - which would imply an action was going to take place), but hey, I'm not the moderator here. Fine.

       What then is your stance on the racist comment that mine is responding to? Are you condoning that? By singling me out, that is the impression I'm getting and would love if you could directly clarify.
