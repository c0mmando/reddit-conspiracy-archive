    <div class="md"><p>White people Twitter isn&#39;t popular enough to be on the front page everyday. It has about the same number of subscribers as Conspiracy. Also, most of the posts are just regular Tweets that happen to be from white people, they don&#39;t have anything specifically that makes them &quot;white&quot;. The top post right now is about a guy who talks about his first day as a bartender. Is something about this exclusively a white person&#39;s experience or reaction? If anything it&#39;s more of a dad joke.</p>

<p>I can see black people Twitter being popular enough as years ago that was a source of a lot of memes and has 2 million subscribers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re both to stereotype the two different groups. Of course the white one isn&#39;t about anything in particular, that&#39;s the joke.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about division, if that were the case they&#39;d be more hostile. I imagine they share a lot of users too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously if they were filled with hate filled Tweets the manipulation wouldn&#39;t work. What I meant by divisive is that it&#39;s just to constantly reinforce the idea that racial and gender identity comes first before anything else. It&#39;s nuanced but that&#39;s how modern manipulation works. They don&#39;t put up huge posters that say &quot;obey or die&quot; in case you haven&#39;t noticed.</p>

<p>But nobody has answered how white people Twitter has about the same number of users as Conspiracy yet Conspiracy is lucky to get on the front page a few times a year. White people Twitter is on the front page several times a day. No other Reddit with that few subscribers gets on the front page several times a day. All the other ones like Aww or Gaming have millions of subscribers.</p>

<p>White people Twitter is obviously pushed to the front page for a reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy was just used as an example to show they have about the same number of users, not that the content is the same.</p>

<p>No reddit with only 600K users is on the front page several times a day except for white people Twitter. If that content was so well liked, why is the subscriber number so low, even with constant front page exposure?</p>

<p>Clearly it is being forced to the front page for some reason. </p>

<p>People can argue as to why and perhaps there is an innocent reason, but it seems pretty clear that it is being pushed on the front page.</p>

<p>Content is very important as to the popularity of subreddits.

<p>But thanks for adding evidence to my theory. Many people benefit from fostering racism and pitting races against each other. Perhaps that is why Reddit sees fit to make sure every day there is a post from blackpeopletwitter and whitepeopletwitter on the front page. Can&#39;t let the people forget they have differences now can we?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You understand that both of those subreddits are predominately populated by white people, right? And users of both subs of all races tend to be folks who can appreciate other cultures and joke about their own good-naturedly. The fact that you think these melting pots of memes and humor are somehow an attempt to <em>divide</em> people suggests you may be the one with the identity politics agenda. Or at least clueless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I replied to someone else. I have ZERO problem with either of these subreddits and the content posted there.</p>

<p>My issue is that there is no way whitepeopletwitter has enough users to be on the front page several times a day. Reddit is pushing it to the front page for some reason.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t try to confuse the issue here by falsely claiming I disagree with the content of blackpeopletwitter or whitepeopletwitter or lack an understanding of who posts there . The issue is the fact that one is obviously being pushed to front page when organically it would never end up there every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And we have seen the blatant manipulation reddit has been pulling for the last couple years, it got even worse when net neutrality was repealed. The idea that someone is pushing their own agenda at the top is not unfeasible.</p>

<p>Fuck sakes this is conspiracy, we all know aaron one of the original creaters was murdered for his beliefs, do i find this idea hard to believe? ill just tell you, yeah i believe its possible. The fbi/cia are bad about doing the same thing in real life, sending in undercover people to pretty much every college campus in the states, just to keep a eye on &quot;radicals&quot;, now they dont need to have undercover people doing all the leg work, because people are stupid and give all their information for free on fb and other social media sites. They are there to observe, but most of the time end up promoting dissent, got to keep their funding coming in, am i right? I wouldnt be at all suprised if the movment BLM, was originally created by the gubment to keep people mad at each other, and not the real people who shoulder most of the blame, the ones at the very tip top. I do beleive the scariest thought for these people is that all of us are going to realize weve been played and lied to and revolt, but as long as we are fighting and blaming each other with the illusion that were somehow different because our skin is a different shade of color... thats never going to happen. Fucking mob mentality, people are animals and they dont even realize it most of them. </p>

<p><strong>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might be the wrong sub for me to say this to you, but I think you might just be a tad paranoid. As everyone else has said, those are satire subs with many active users. There has never been any prominent drama between them. I would think that if these subs were as divisive as you think they are, they&#39;re users would have much more open hostility toward each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are missing my point. I never said the subreddits themselves caused any problems or even were a problem to begin with. I have no problem with both of them. My point was how are they always on the front page, sometimes several times a day, when whitepeopletwitter has very few subscribers.</p>

<p>However, I assume you knew my point and you are simply trying to confuse the issue.</p>
