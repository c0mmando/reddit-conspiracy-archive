       <strong>
        The Japanese government banned the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine from its vaccination program in 1993, after a record number of children developed adverse reactions, including meningitis, loss of limbs, and death.
       </strong>
       [1]
      </p>
      <h2>
       The MMR Vaccine’s Tragic History in Japan
      </h2>
      <p>
       The MMR vaccine was introduced in Japan in April 1989, and parents who refused the compulsory vaccine were fined. After three months of analysis, officials realized that one in 900 children developed adverse reactions to the vaccine,
       <strong>
        a rate that was 2,000 times higher than the expected rate.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Four years later, in 1993, the government removed the MMR mandate against measles and rubella. A doctor from Japan’s Ministry of Health and Welfare admitted that the separate, individual doses of measles and rubella cost twice as much to administer, and he defended the decision, stating, “but we believe it is worth it.” Furthermore, a member of the health ministry also stated that
       <strong>
        the ban has not caused an increase in deaths from measles.
       </strong>
       [2]
      </p>
      <p>
       Japanese officials were also concerned about the MMR vaccine causing additional cases of mumps, citing numerous studies in
       <em>
        The Lancet
       </em>
       . [3]
      </p>
      <h1>
       What Many Parents Don’t Know About the MMR Vaccine
      </h1>
      <p>
       The list of adverse reactions to the MMR vaccine, straight from Merck’s vaccine package inserts, is long and alarming. A shortened version of the vaccine damage associated with the MMR vaccine includes-

       A search of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database shows the following statistics
       <strong>
        from the United States: over 75,000 adverse events have been reported from any combination of  measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines, including, most notably:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       ·
       <strong>
        78 deaths
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         85 cases of deafness
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         48 cases of decreased eye contact
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         92 cases of developmental delay
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         855 reported cases of autism
      </p>
      <p>
       ·
       <strong>
        116 cases of intellectual disability
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         401 reports of speech disorders
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         276 reports of loss of consciousness
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         143 cases of encephalitis
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         74 cases of meningitis
      </p>
      <p>
       ·
       <strong>
        111 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         692 cases of gait disturbance (not being able to walk normally)
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         748 cases of hypokinesia (partial or complete loss of muscle movement)
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         653 reports of hypotonia (poor muscle tone)
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         4874 reports of seizures, including febrile convulsions and tonic clonic seizures
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         1576 cases of cellulitis (a potentially serious skin infection)
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, in some cases, the vaccine has caused the very diseases  it is supposed to prevent, with the following data reported to VAERS:
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         147 cases of measles
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         384 cases of mumps
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         29 cases of rubella [6]
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of adverse events following vaccination are vastly underreported, as acknowledged by the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC). The National Vaccine Information Center estimates that less than one to ten percent of adverse reactions to vaccines are reported. Many of the numbers reported above could therefore be multiplied by one hundred to determine a more accurate amount of adverse  reactions. [7, 8]
      </p>
      <h4>
       Japanese Officials Speak Out
      </h4>
      <p>
       Japan has been criticized for being behind the times when it comes to  vaccination. Vaccine advocates claim that Japan has not kept pace with other developed countries regarding the use of vaccines.
       <strong>
        Despite listing 110 infectious diseases in a government registry, Japan offers vaccines for only 22 of those.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some Japanese health experts disagree, however. Hiroko Mori, a vaccine researcher, is one of those experts. He was the former head of the infectious disease division at Japan’s National Institute of Public  Health.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has noted that
       <strong>
        Japan has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world and has advocated for fewer vaccines, stating that the country’s excellent sanitation and nutrition has boosted children’s health.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       He observed,
      </p>
      <h1>
       “Medicine is supposed to be about healing, but babies who cannot speak are being given unnecessary shots because parents are scared. Children are losing their ability to heal naturally.
      </h1>
      <h1>
       There are so many people who have suffered side effects. All we  are asking is to establish the right to say ‘no.’ The right to choose should be recognized as a fundamental human right.”
      </h1>
      <p>
       Tetsuo Nakayama, Dean of Kitasato University’s Graduate School of Infection Control Sciences, is an expert who supports vaccines, but he, too, acknowledges the risks of vaccination, stating that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         <em>
          “There is no guarantee that your child will not be that one out of 1,000. You have to compare the risks between the side effects and what will happen if you are infected with the disease naturally.
         </em>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         <em>
          Under the existing law, the decision to vaccinate your child or not is basically left up to the parents, but there is not enough information out there for them to make an informed decision.”
         </em>
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Masako Koga, a former representative of the Consumers Union of Japan, has shared his concerns about the ulterior motives behind mass vaccination programs:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         <em>
          “Vaccines should only be given to those who need them but that is not happening. The global industry is being driven by a strategy that promotes VPD
         </em>
        </strong>
        <strong>

        </strong>
        <strong>
         <em>
          .
         </em>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         <em>
          We must put a stop to it. Vaccines have close ties to money.  From development to circulation to research on side effects, there are a lot of vested interests involved.”
         </em>
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He also summarized what motivates many parents’ decisions not to vaccinate their children:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         <em>
          “There is no knowing who will suffer side effects as a result of vaccination.
         </em>
        </strong>
        <br/>
        <strong>
         [Proponents of vaccination]
        </strong>
        <strong>
         <em>
          say the chance of suffering a side effect is 1 in a million. For parents, however, that one is everything.”
         </em>
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4>
       Conclusion
      </h4>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Japanese officials have made decisions that value the health and  safety of their citizens when they have removed vaccines with dangerous side effects from their national vaccination program.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Japan boasts a low infant mortality rate, despite — or perhaps  because of  — mandating only a fraction of the vaccines required by other developed countries, including the United States.

       Of course.  Look up existing state laws and to be doubly sure, check out county regulations too.  Depending on if you go public or private, you can ask for a waiver.  If you know what the law defines and you know your kids don't have to be vaccinated, you can provide the waiver on your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, your child doesn't have to be injected with vitamin k when it is born.  You can find the right vitamin k oil that will provide the same benefits and all you have to do is put it on the nipple prior to each feeding or in ita formula.  There are benefits as shown to vitamin K, but it doesn't have to come in the form of an injection.

       Thanks for the insight! I’m not having children for a while but i wanted to ask. I actually interned with a congresswoman who wanted to make vaccines mandatory and was sponsoring a bill for it. We got flooded with calls nationwide from families that had experienced adverse side effects because of vaccines, or at least they claimed. I remember one guy told me 3 kids in his family had died after receiving vaccines and I thought at the time the guy was a quack.

       My own personal account is that when I got my booster shots, I developed mild tourettes syndrome.  Thankfully now the ticks are lessened and I'm more OCD than necessary, because I was pretty hilarious to watch when I was growing up. And I should note, there's no history of tourettes in our family.

       Well isn’t the issue as well that they don’t real define what they mean when they say the “vaccines work.” Meaning how do you know for sure that a kid didn’t get mumps BECAUSE of the vaccine and not for another reason. I remember seeing a doc a while back and they were saying that the vaccine makers weren’t really honest in how they evaluated a successful vaccination. I can’t really explain because it’s a little murky in my head, so if I doesn’t make sense sorry haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus last years flu vaccine was only found to be 10% effective (or something like this) at “preventing” the flu - so why bother. The only time I got the flu vaccine was years ago and I got the weirdest cold ever and I decided never to take it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m sorry for what happened to you, is it possible for you to be compensated? I know they have some type of vaccine damage fund. Maybe you could report your experience to add to the seeming growing list of people with adverse effects.

       Can I ask what adverse effects she had? Did the doctor try to reason with you or were they ok? I remember the last time a nurse offered me a flu vaccine and I turned it down explaining I had a weird cold after, she tried to reason with me and when I insisted, she looked at me like a madwoman.

       Yeah no problem. When we brought my daughter home she was the happiest easiest going baby I have ever met. I got to know her very well very quickly. She would look at you, study you and you could easily tell she was thinking and getting (in a way) what you said and did. She was very observant. She also slept. Every. Single. Night with ease and for  at the very least 7 hours straight through the night. She was so good. Never ever cried, always smiling and laughing. Anyway I first noticed adverse reaction her first round of shots. Red bumps/rash appeared, fever, loss of appetite, fussy etc whatever, I chalked it up to being a normal thing and even blindly blamed it on her just being a baby going through baby stuff. At the time I was pro-vax and never thought I would go against the grain. Even though I mostly chalked it up to going through normal baby stuff it bothered me enough to dig even deeper into researching vaccines (yes I did research previous to her shots but I never found anything to worry me enough to the point of not getting vaccinated). When you Google vaccines or the danger of vaccines you are flooded with pro-vaxx propaganda and the side effects they do talk about are diluted and severely down played. Fast forward two months to her next round of shots. I asked the doctor a million times more questions this time but I still didn't know enough to flat out back out and went forward with her DTAP and 4 other vaccines. When we got home I noticed she started to show the same sides as last time but something looked and felt differently. Side note: At this point she is 4 months old and she knows exactly who I am. She laughs and smiles as soon as she sees me as she jumps up and down. My wife would even make jokes and tell me to stay upstairs while she is taking her naps bc she would pop up out of her sleep every. Single. Time I was in the same room like she knew my scent or something. When I would talk to her I could see her clearly show me recognition in every way possible. Anyway back to it...So we get home and again she is showing all the same signs of something not being right like last time but this time is different. Not only is there a massive rash but each time I talked to her she recognized me less and less and that look of complete acknowledgement like she used to have slowly started slipping away. She stopped smiling at me. She wouldn't go to sleep. She just cried, cried, cried, cried and cried. She was never the same since the first round but this was just fucked up. The scariest part of this was the fact that it was like she just didn't know who I was  anymore. She had this blankness behind her eyes and I know my daughter, I know my daughter better than any fucking doctor. This all started literally two hours after her shots and got worse. No sleep, no naps, no eating, blank stares ect...the other thing I forgot to mention that made the whole situation scary was the fact that from the time my daughter arrived home she had an uncanny strength and ability (with assistance of course) to be able to stand. Even the doctors were amazed with how good and strong she could stand with someone holding her hands. It was crazy. I've had many babies in my life (nieces, nephews, sister, friends kids etc) and I never saw such a strong baby as young as her. So with that being said, her losing that strength and ability scared the fuck out of me. On top of looking confused which was totally not normal for her now she couldn't even stand for a split second with us holding her hands. You wouldn't even need to be her parent to see such a drastic changes mentally and physically. After that I started really digging deep on vaccinations and decided it was not in my families best interest. She started to get a little better, a little more towards her past self little by little as time went by just like the last time but this round affected her a great deal more and added some pretty scary shit. We just went back to the doctor around her 6 month mark and basically I told them fuck off. I told them what happened and they had nothing of value to add to the conversation. I'm done getting her shots. I feel horrible I took her in the first place. Especially after recently my wife telling me about her friend's baby that just died from SIDS. Their last post on FB was a pic of their family/baby in the car and the tag read "Off to get this little girl her shots, yayyy!" She is dead now and they don't have a clue or a daughter now. Just some made up bullshit name "sudden infant death syndrome". But some shill will tell me the doctor knows the love of my life better than I do and that i don't know what I'm talking about but hey fuck them.

       WAS THAT YOU WHO POSTED ABOUT THAT KID?!?!?!? I saw that and I was so devastated!!!!!!  God this sub is small, what are the chances of running into you again?!?! Sorry for the caps but seriously, I couldn’t believe it when I read it! Would you consider telling them what you think and your experience?
      </p>
      <p>
       Man, the first paragraph of your story was so beautiful and I can tell the passion and love you have for your little girl. I hope I can experience that love and emotion myself one day. I can’t imagine anything greater than that feeling of having a child.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, my heart totally wrinkles reading about your kid and what your family has gone through. No one knows a baby better than their mom and dad. Doctors have education (faulty ones too) but they don’t have that special bond and connection or maybe 6th sense when it comes to babies like their parents do. I believe what you say about them not paying any mind to what you told them regarding your daughter because I have this annoying foot problem (plantar fasciitis) and I’ve been seeing this podiatrist that gives me the most bullshit excuses ever. Not that I’m comparing my foot to your experience, of course, but they don’t care about us the way we care about our own situations. They probably don’t do any type of research on vaccines either because they have no interest, time, or they too have drank the koolaid like we both did. What’s most disturbing is that so much vaccine research is conducted by scientists that receive funding by big pharmaceutical companies so you can imagine that they wouldn’t say and report anything negative for fear of losing their jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that your baby will have long term effects? I hope, wholeheartedly, she doesn’t. I can’t imagine what you guys as parents are going through with that. You try to “help” the kid with these allegedly safe vaccines and then it turns out to possibly harm your baby. Absolutely heart wrenching. This is a situation that serves to show we MUST do due diligence before we believe anyone. Fuck taking anyone at their word. Little kids deserve to be held to the highest standards and I can’t believe the doctors didn’t care. That makes me so irate.

       God I hope she doesnt have long term effects. She is doing better but still not 100% yet. Her last shots were three months ago so I'm not sure how long olif ever she will return to being the same. Yes there is a reason why doctors are trained hard not to call patients by their first name. They do not have relationships with their patients like they used to. The sad thing is they are being spoon-fed the same bullshit as us about vaccines but if they just took the time to really look into them and all the TRUE horror stories most of them would stop giving vaccines or at least stop giving so many at such a young age. Then you have the doctors who know the truth but get paid bonuses to vaccinate. Did you know that blue Cross blue shield actually pay doctors bonuses if they vaccinate a certain percentage of their patients? Yeah no bias there. Yes I am the one who posted it the other day. It weighs on my heart. I just wish all of the provaxxers antivaxxers etc could talk and figure something out together. We just spent 717 BILLION DOLLARS on a fucking military budget but yet somehow we don't have enough money to thoroughly test vaccines and come up with safer vaccines that we pump our infants with. It's fucking sad and it hurts my heart. We actually test Dick Pills more thoroughly and there are more saftey regulations on the dick pills themselves and their testing then we have with vaccines. To me that's tells people everything they need to know.

       The problem is that provaxxers think that all antivaxxers are anti-science quacks that are going to basically kill their kids. There’s just no middle ground for it. Like politics, everyone either hates or loves Trump but no one wants to say “he isn’t the best and he’s what he have,  so let’s call him out on the good and the bad.” Nope, it’s just a cage fighting match like with vaccines.

       Sad part is I would’ve called you crazy too not too long ago, I would’ve told you it was because of something else too and I would’ve brushed you aside.

       Yes. You have to have certain vaccines to attend school where I live but we are homeschooling our daughter. The "education" in the country is a joke and meant to make obedient little minions that never truly learn anything useful anyway.

       Fortunately no. The moment my wife told me she was pregnant I kicked into high gear and positioned myself to be able to take care of us myself. I still have a long way to go to live "comfortably" but I'm almost there.

       Yeah, that’s what I figured. Homeschooling is difficult for people who have to work full-time. I’m hoping by the time I’m “ready” to have children I don’t live off an employee income. I would like to buy a triplex and rent it on Airbnb so I can make passive income that way. But first I must graduate grad school...

       You can do it! I was a worthless homeless addict 3 years ago. I got clean two years ago. I found a job last March as a forklift driver. In two months I beat out several people for the "warehouse" scheduler position. 4 months after that became a "Group Lead/SAP Coordinator". I've traveled two several States for specialized training. In that same 6 months I became our facilities "First responder", Captain of the "recovery team". ( For major recalls or mock recalls of product) and I became 1 of two trainers who train the trainers. I'm not done yet but now I make enough money to support my family albeit not enough to be truly comfortable yet, I bought a nice car and moved my family into a nice house (duplex) in a nice neighborhood. All this and 3 years ago I had just od'd the the jail parking lot I was just released from. You can do it! You will do it!

       Wow what a remarkable and uplifting story! I’m glad you found our direction and your family to motivate you. At the moment, my life I feel is a bit sideways. My relationship of 4 years is falling apart, I’m not interested in school anymore, and I feel I’ve lost all my motivation. I know I’ll get through it but it’s sometimes difficult to see pat the jump - I’m sure you know much better than I. Thanks for the kind words, they mean so much to me!

       If I read the article correctly, Japan banned the combined vaccine, but still uses the separate vaccines.

       I think a big takeaway from this is it looks like Japan still vaccinates against the measles and rubella as separate injections. I'm not sure if the mumps component is responsible for the side effects, or if it's the multiple vaccine dose all at once.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a similar list of documented side effects in small and medium sized dogs with the 5 in 1 or 7 in 1 vaccine shots, including injection site carcinomas. It may be something as simple as such a dose of organisms overloads the immune system and causes multiple problems.

       That’s partially the problem: that the shots are administered all at once so you really have no idea how they mix inside the child. If they did them one by one, maybe it’s not harmful. But I think kids now get up to 4-5 shots in one sitting. Who knows if they ingredients counteract one another. Researchers, if I’m not mistaken, only study one vaccine at a time and not staggered like they are administered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I have a little dog that I’m debating whether I should get some optional vaccines for... he’s 10lbs and it’s 2 shots that aren’t required but suggested.

 Hasnt Japan's population been on the decline? Meaning less births... Therefore less infant mortality?

       Infant mortality is calculated by how many babies die out of those that are born. Rising or declining birth rates don't matter in the calculation.

       Yea they have a larger elderly population compared to their youngin's, plus a lower birthrate. So it's declining, but naturally as their elders die off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as the other commentor mentioned, infant mortality is not dependent on those factors.

       I'm not exactly sure what per capital means, only have a vague idea actually. Is it what Wikipedia (I know,I know) says?
It's says IMR is
      </p>
      <p>
       (x(number of child deaths under one year of age)÷number of live births that year)×1000.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the same thing as per capital? In truly interested to see/know how these two are connected.

       Also I thank you. I've been corrected/educated numerous times lol. Not a bad thing as it keeps me curious.

       Back in World War II times (Unit 731 to be exact), their experiments led to finding a natural pathogen in Japanese descent that increased life expectancy for over 100 years. Japan spun Unit 731 to be horrific and inhumane, so that the Western world would not figure out their little secret. In fact, there are still hundreds of Japanese living from those times due to those exact experiments.

       You can do it! I was a worthless homeless addict 3 years ago. I got clean two years ago. I found a job last March as a forklift driver. In two months I beat out several people for the "warehouse" scheduler position. 4 months after that became a "Group Lead/SAP Coordinator". I've traveled two several States for specialized training. In that same 6 months I became our facilities "First responder", Captain of the "recovery team". ( For major recalls or mock recalls of product) and I became 1 of two trainers who train the trainers. I'm not done yet but now I make enough money to support my family albeit not enough to be truly comfortable yet, I bought a nice car and moved my family into a nice house (duplex) in a nice neighborhood. All this and 3 years ago I had just od'd the the jail parking lot I was just released from. You can do it! You will do it!
