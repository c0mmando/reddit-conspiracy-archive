        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was 9 years old on the day that JFK was assassinated.  9 years old in 1963 was a lot different back in those days. </p>

<p>We were focused. Aware. In tune with politics. We were because of the very tenuous political climate of the cold war. It was the norm to practice evacuations in case of a nuclear attack. So yeah, even at 9, we were interested in what was happening nationally and internationally. </p>

<p>Back then, there were basically 3 networks on free tv and 2 newspapers. It was not unusual for us to read the paper everyday, and watch the news as a family. There wasn’t much else to occupy yourself intellectually. </p>

<p>The evening comedy shows were mostly idiotic, some good ones, but a lot bad ones, and variety shows were singers and comedians. Pretty boring stuff by today’s standards. Politics on tv were an essential staple. </p>

<p>As an 8 year old, in 1962, my next door neighbor (who was a secret service agent), gathered 4 of the neighborhood kids and drove us over to LBJ’s house for Halloween to trick or treat. We lived geographically close, but light years away economically. </p>

<p>Unlike ltoday where the Veep  lives at the naval observatory on Massachusetts Ave. near Embassy row. In those days, the VP lived in a neighborhood in Spring Valley, a tony upper NW enclave for the rich. </p>

<p>On Halloween, 1962, LBJ’s wife, Ladybird, and one of her daughters came to the door inside their gated driveway (it’s now an embassy), and dropped some candy in our bags. She seemed to smile, I think. </p>

<p>What struck me so unusual as an 8 year old was how unusual ladybird’s hair was styled. It had flipped up on either side. This was how rich women wore their hair back then. And she had on a beautiful yellow dress. It’s amazing I can recall this so many years later so vividly, but it was indeed a special occasion. Momentous. </p>

<p>Anyway, what I have never read or heard in any theories, was the fact that 1 block away, on Van Ness Street, LBJ’s  bagman, “enabler” aka “dirty work” aide, Bobby Baker, was the guy that paid off the Washington powerful with bribes and hookers and lived in a pretty big house with a driveway in front. Literally a 3 minutes walk from Johnson. </p>

<p>Baker subsequently resigned in shame when his antics of “call girls and bribery” to senators came to light. </p>

<p>Years later, while passing by this area, I surmised that many conversations may have occurred between these 2 (LBJ and Baker), while walking around that neighborhood (NW DC in the 60’s was innocuous). In those days, even the Veep could walk around in his neighborhood (probably with a SS agent in tow).  Deals made. Orders given. Bribes ordered. Maybe the ultimate order. </p>

<p>I bet a lot of plotting and planning was done under the street lights on 51st street and Van Ness Street on late summer evenings. </p>

<p>Getting to the Kennedy assassination:</p>

<p>That Friday afternoon, November 22, 1963, will be an afternoon that I will never forget. 
At midday on that fateful Friday, in DC, we got word in school that Kennedy had been shot. I remember a fellow student had told me that all of the nuns on the first floor of my school were “flooding the first floor with tears”, Me being an idiot thought that the first floor was actually flooded. That worries me more than the assassination at that moment.  </p>

<p>Just an aside: </p>

<p>It’s amazing how days of crises are burned into your long term memory. </p>

<p>You millennials probably don’t remember 911. But when the next traumatic incident occurs in the USA, rest assured that the incident will be ingrained in your brain for the rest of your life. You will remember everything of that day. Even the most minute details. Like me, </p>

<p>It was a rainy dark cloudy day in Washington DC on November 22, 1963. My brother and I delivered newspapers that day. We usually picked up our newspapers to deliver at 4:30 PM. </p>

<p>That day, the papers were not delivered until 6:30 PM. They had stopped the presses, and republished the news about Kennedy‘s assassination. Back then, you could buy a newspaper for ten cents. We had people stopping us in their cars begging to buy a newspaper from us for as much  as one dollar. One dollar in 1963 was almost like $5-10 today. The entire coverage on tv for the weekend was the assassination. Period. Even NFL games were cancelled for that Sunday. </p>

<p>Fast forward to Sunday afternoon, and my entire family was near the White House to pay our respects. The place was overcrowded with many people crying in the throngs of well wishers. I had never seen my father cry, until that day. </p>

<p>We were situated across the street from the treasury building on 15th Street. We were standing in front of the same cigar store where Kennedy had bought all of the Cuban cigars in stock, ( through an aid), right before JFK signed the Cuban embargo for goods.</p>

<p>There was an old man standing in front of the doorway of that cigar store that afternoon. (I think back and I am kind of blown away to realize that that guy was probably born in 1880). Anyway, that old dude was holding a cardboard sign that was about 8” x 8” in size. Written on the cardboard sign were  two words: </p>

<p>Oswald shot.</p>

<p>At the time, we all cheered this as good news. It wasn’t until years later, we realized that Oswald may have been silenced in order to protect the real perpetrators as to what really happened in Dallas on that fateful day. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, I doubt I will be around to hear what actually happened. They have refused to release all evidence until everyone associated with that era/assassination is dead.</p>

<p>You guys that were born after 1980 will get the full scoop. Maybe. Anything is possible as to who did it. </p>

<p>My point on posting this story here is to offer the real time climate of that era.  </p>

<p>The climate in Washington DC back in the 1960s was far different than it is today. In the 1960’s, it is indeed plausible that someone would have the balls to try to pull this off. </p>

<p>Things changed things  when  “Watergate” in the early 70s happened. No more outrageous behavior because there were too many people willing to talk. The powerbrokers realized that they could no longer  do whatever it is that they wanted to do with impunity. </p>

<p>But in the 1960s, I have no doubt that the complete audacity  of taking out a sitting president, and getting away with it, by a select few in power could have been considered and ordered. </p>

<p>I have no real theories on this, other than to say that the hubris, arrogance, absolute power, that was possessed by a very few, like LBJ, did exist. </p>

<p>It would not surprise me if he was somehow involved when you put all the pieces together. </p>

<p>You guys maybe will know for sure one day, </p>

<p>However, if LBJ was indeed part of  it, no one probably will ever known for at least for 300 years.</p>

<p>Of all the the crises I’ve witnessed through my time: JFK, Vietnam, Reagan shot, Watergate/Nixon, all of the war leaders like DeGaulle, Churchill, Popes, 9/11, John Lennon, JFK getting taken out was the absolute most devastating to us all. And the one mystery that will probably stay a mystery to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He implemented the “new society”. That’s been a topic of debate for years. He is also credited or demeaned, depending on your point of view, for chain migration. </p>

<p>The chain immigration was intended to limit immigration somehow, it was a compromise that turned out to be a way of many family members of iimmigrants easy to the USA. </p>

<p>I remember his administration. He got zero criticism during his presidency.  It was a total shock when he announced he would not seek re-election. </p>

<p>I also remember reading in the Washington Post that he and Ladybird were constantly attending functions.  The society page always had him in a tux at one event after the next. </p>

<p>I personally have no read on how good he was or how bad he was. </p>

<p>He seemed to be more of a steward than bring revolutionary. That’s my sense, based on living then. I haven’t studied his real contributions as president. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to follow policy when you&#39;re that young. Take a trip back and watch a few documentaries. When LBJ came into office, nobody trusted him. But once he took control, he did lots of good. The United States is the nation it is because of two presidents: FDR and LBJ.</p>

<p>It is exactly this modern view of society that RWR came in to disrupt and destroy. To this day, they are still working on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was with you until the Reagan critique. A lot of my political level of concern was based on my fathers level of concern as a kid. With Johnson, we were fine with him. And my father was a Fed. Johnson seemed to be finishing what Kennedy had started. At least that was what was implied. The press gave Johnson a pass. The biggest hoopla that really hit the mainstream was him picking up his dog by the ears.  He caught a lot of shit for that.  Lol. </p>

<p>Johnson seemed capable. Professional. He appeared in charge. </p>

<p>The fact that he would benefit the most with JFK gone is probably why he’s always mentioned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you elaborate on your comment, &quot;with Johnson, we were fine with him...&quot; In what way? </p>

<p>LBJ was a devout racist his entire life but apologists keep finding ways to repaint his image as a decent man. They did a fairly good job because not many people of this generation know that LBJ was an egotistical lying asshole.</p>

<p>Given his intense dislike of black people, his efforts to pass the civil rights act were based on the huge political advantage he would reap. Doing what was right and fair was <em>not relevant</em> to LBJ. Power and image was everything. Thanks to him, we ended up in Vietnam with a staggering death toll of over 58,000 American lives that history has shown were utterly wasted...and 303,000 more Americans were maimed and wounded (total death count was nearly 1.5 million).</p>

<p>There was very little, if anything, decent about LBJ. He was an opportunist who utterly despised JFK and made no effort to hide his animosity. He also made no secret of his deep bigotry towards anyone who was not Texan and/or white.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Johnson caught zero flack- for anything as president. But that wasn’t unusual. There wasn’t the adversarial climate that sort of found its way during the Nixon years. </p>

<p>I think people gave Johnson a pass. Mainly because he succeeded JFK. </p>

<p>As far LBJ’s civil rights record, he was regarded at the time to be a champion of “the Negro”, population. He pledged to further JFK’s vision of equality for all. </p>

<p>You are saying things that paint Johnson as less than tolerant. In the lens of 2018, I will accept your works as accurate. </p>

<p>But we are talking an era before blacks could even vote, and then shortly thereafter. </p>

<p>You have no Idea what life was like for black folks then. It was insanely bad. Johnson had to maintain a coalition in order to bring America into the 20th century. </p>

<p>Again, context is essential. Turning a barge of racism around requires time, compromise, and patience. </p>

<p>But I’ve got no argument with your slagging LBJ, and have no admiration for him personally. </p>

<p>Just keep in mind it’s unfair to apply 21st century politics to mid 20th century politics. Apples and oranges. </p>

<p>Or go ahead. If it makes you feel better. </p>

<p>Was that enough of an elaboration? Or do I need to recite one of MLK’s speeches, too? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for taking the time to explain your comment. You are quite right by the way. I clearly remember what was going on during those years. Obviously, no white person could even begin to understand what life was like for black people at that time. It&#39;s beyond heartbreaking. </p>

<p>Some of the things I witnessed, such as the so-called &#39;Riot at the Pentagon&#39; in 1967, where I witnessed US Marshals severely beat college kids (who were sitting on the grass having lunch, etc) because other kids had &quot;assaulted&quot; a few Marshals with vegetables, disgusted me in the extreme. Many of those demonstrators needed serious medical attention after being beaten with 4-ft long batons. </p>

<p>The military and media labeled it as a &quot;riot&quot; but having been there (unfortunately in the military), I know for a fact there was nothing remotely close to a riot. It was, however, a massive overreaction and show of unnecessary force - bringing in tanks, firing razor-wire rolls into the crowds, etc. Also being part of debriefing/interviewing some of the soldiers who took part in the My Lai Massacre more than shocked me to the core. Long story, not really something to get into here.</p>

<p>I had minus zero respect for LBJ so my comments were perhaps harsh - but well deserved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well written. Thanks for sharing. Is amazing how those memories do ultimately become permenantly etched into your brain. I was born in 1981. For me, the Oklahoma City bombing and oj getting chased in the bronco were my first experiences of these types of events/memories. 
And as far as I am concerned, this stuff still does happen. I don’t think we invade Iraq without Rumsfeld and Cheney. Pretty sure Colin Powell would agree with me. Maybe not as audacious as removing a sitting president, but pretty ballsy nonetheless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure LBJ was neighbors with that rat fink J Edgar Hoover, too.  It would be decades before the public was allowed to hear what those two were actually talking about on the phone in the days following the JFK assassination.  </p>

<p>Not sure if you have ever seen the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeSug5GVCg8"><strong>LBJ interview with CBS</strong></a> before he left office in which he questions the Warren Report findings (unaired until after LBJ&#39;s death).  LBJ actually went further in an interview with <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1973/07/the-last-days-of-the-president/376281/"><strong>The Atlantic</strong></a> in which he stated: &quot;I never believed that Oswald acted alone, although I can accept that he pulled the trigger.&quot;</p>

<p>As for your childhood being marked with those awful nuclear bomb drills---it was revealed by Daniel Ellsberg that the USSR only had 4 ICBM&#39;s in 1962 (the USA had 40).  At the time, the CIA/DOD were flogging the public saying the USSR had 100 and the USA was behind in the number of ICBM&#39;s.  DOD wanted to make 1,000 ICBM&#39;s.  </p>

<p>Today, we still can&#39;t safely process and/or store the leftover nuclear waste from the Cold War era--yet our government has kept in place a 30-year, $1 Trillion nuclear bomb program that will, among other goals, seek to make smaller, fun-sized nuclear weapons.  </p>

<p>The same mass propaganda onslaught of lies assults the public everyday.  Cheered on by James Comey, former FBI Director and former General Counsel to Lockheed Martin (2005-2010) which makes the $1.4 Trillion F-35...think there&#39;s any ulterior motive for Comey pushing the &quot;Russia Russia Russia&quot; routine?</p>

<p>We are lemmings, led around. Nobody outside of the Kennedy admin had a clue of his extra curricular activities.  Even the press at that time knew things, but were complicit in covering up so many scandals.  It disgusts me that the folks that are supposed to objectively report the news misleads, manipulates in order to further their personal political agendas.  They’re all guilty. </p>

<p>23 Nov 1963 (day after assassination) 
LBJ - J. Edgar Hoover, 10:01 AM
transcript
This call is erased - see The Fourteen Minute Gap and The Fourteen Minute Gap: An Update.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a transcript of the call, but I&#39;m reminded of Senator Richard Russell’s comment to former CIA Director and fellow Warren Commissioner Allen Dulles: “I think you’ve got more faith in them [CIA] than I do.  I think they’ll doctor anything they hand to us.”  </p>

<p>These fucking people never cease to amaze me with their treachery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s probably the most controversial and suspicious event in the USA of the 20th century. </p>

<p>Kennedy had alienated everybody. The Cubans on both sides hated him. Some of the watergate burglars known as “the plumbers” were Cuban exiles that agreed to work with E Howard Hunt. They thought the USA was going to remove Castro. </p>

<p>Kennedy had ties the mafia. Or so has been reported. </p>

<p>Kennedy and J Edgar were political foes. </p>

<p>I’ve heard Johnson and Kennedy were adversaries, but Johnson would deliver Texas. </p>

<p>So many suspects. Who really knows? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where to start?</p>

<p>It was the <strong><em>CIA</em></strong> (as well as certain Cuban factions) that went fucking crazy when JFK refused to send in the USAF to back the Bay of Pigs invasion. Without US air cover (something someone will have to fill us in on whether that was something Kennedy ever promised), Castro easily rolled up the small invasion force.</p>

<p>Mafia ties were probably remnants of his father, Joseph P.&#39;s operation during prohibition, at a guess. Not an area I have researched.</p>

<p>Jack&#39;s <em>brother</em>, Bobby, AKA &quot;US ATTY GENERAL&quot; (how far we have fallen) was <em>kicking the shit</em> out of the Mob nationwide, giving them more than just <em>a</em> reason to hate his brother.</p>

<p>Hoover was the ultimate &quot;secret society&quot;, a one-man NSA, who, if he liked you, could destroy your enemies. But Hoover was a two-edged sword, Kennedy knew, and didn&#39;t trust the ugly little freak any farther than he could throw him. Kennedy&#39;s decision <em>not</em> to dismiss Hoover as FBI director might have been tactical. As the traitor LBJ once observed about a political rival, &quot;(He&#39;d) rather have him <em>inside</em> the tent pissin&#39; <em>out</em> than <em>outside</em> the tent pissin&#39; <em>in</em>&quot;.  Hoover may have known about and/or been involved in the Coup.</p>

<p>LBJ was the consummate &quot;insider&quot; pol. He <em>was</em> on the ticket to bring Texas into the Democrat camp, which still included the &quot;Dixiecrats&quot; who would switch parties with the Civil Rights Act enactment. Johnson wasn&#39;t accustomed to &quot;hunkering down&quot; (settling for less, or a lesser role) for long. The choice of LBJ as a running mate, a seemingly matter-of-fact nod to the need for Texas&#39; Electoral votes, looks a little more sinister if you view his selection as a &quot;built-in fail-safe&quot; for the power behind the power, whose policies and politics did not jibe with the young President&#39;s own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kennedy was highly suspicious of Israel&#39;s nuclear energy [weapon] program, so much that he wanted their facilities inspected.

    <div class="md"><p>I should get off my lazy butt and see what Kennedy was all about. </p>

<p>In real time back in ‘61-‘62 he was a superstar cultural icon. </p>

<p>The press would ask him some pretty heavy questions, but Kennedy would respond with a witty wisecrack. </p>

<p>And everybody laughed. He got away with murder. </p>

<p>It’s weird when you realize that despite Hume being considered a liberal democrat at that time, today he’d be further right then Reagan was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow what an incredible post. I usually skim through long posts but I really loved you writing style. Especially when you mentioned the old man possibly having been born in the 1880s, only 20 years after the Civil War - that’s absolutely mind blowing. Thanks for that post, it’s nice to hear other people’s perspectives about how an event personally impacts them. </p>

<p>I can somewhat give you a book recommendations, it’s called “The Man Who Killed Kennedy: A Case for LBJ” by Roger Stone. Haha I know Stone is a little out there and he was somewhat involved in Watergate as well. The reason why I say I can somewhat recommend it is because I haven’t read it but it’s in my pile of books I bought to read. All the reviews I’ve seen are pretty positive on it, so who knows. </p>

<p>Thanks again :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for taking the time to explain your comment. You are quite right by the way. I clearly remember what was going on during those years. Obviously, no white person could even begin to understand what life was like for black people at that time. It&#39;s beyond heartbreaking. </p>

<p>Some of the things I witnessed, such as the so-called &#39;Riot at the Pentagon&#39; in 1967, where I witnessed US Marshals severely beat college kids (who were sitting on the grass having lunch, etc) because other kids had &quot;assaulted&quot; a few Marshals with vegetables, disgusted me in the extreme. Many of those demonstrators needed serious medical attention after being beaten with 4-ft long batons. </p>

<p>The military and media labeled it as a &quot;riot&quot; but having been there (unfortunately in the military), I know for a fact there was nothing remotely close to a riot. It was, however, a massive overreaction and show of unnecessary force - bringing in tanks, firing razor-wire rolls into the crowds, etc. Also being part of debriefing/interviewing some of the soldiers who took part in the My Lai Massacre more than shocked me to the core. Long story, not really something to get into here.</p>

<p>I had minus zero respect for LBJ so my comments were perhaps harsh - but well deserved.</p>
