       It seems the government wants to take people's guns away. Why was it written, was it really so citizens could protect themselves from a corrupt government?
This is contradictory, first the gov gives people the right to bear arms but now they want to take guns awayaway

       The government does't "give" people the right to bear arms.  It recognizes, via the Bill of Rights, that the right to keep and bear arms to maintain a state of freedom, is a universal right.

       That seems to be a very common mistake people make now. These aren't Rights given to us by the government. These are 'God given' Rights that are to be protected and, by the writing of the Bill of Rights, government has no ability to usurp those Rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, we're in an era where people think commodity is a Right.

       You seem to be confusing the Founding Fathers with the circus freaks of today who are currently referred to as 'The Elites'...
      </p>
      <p>
       While the Founding Fathers were the best that colonial society had to offer, they were also revolting against the tyrannical rule of the English Crown. Many of their writings expressly embrace the right of the common man to protect himself and his family from becoming the victims of tyrants; today's so-called 'Elites'
       <strong>
        <em>
         ARE
        </em>
       </strong>
       the tyrants...

       I find it weird the powerful people in charge back then wanted people armed or at least they had the right to own a gun but now it's the opposite they don't want people having guns
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a biased against the people the top I think most if not all of them are evil and only have their own interests in mind. But I guess it's possible the founding fathers had the people's best interests in mind

       Dude... The founding fathers were citizens under a tyrannical rule, similar to you and I today. Imagine if you could fix the government today, what changes would you make, and what would you do to protect those changes to keep the power to the people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine 240 years pass, and your new government grows into thousands of self serving individuals, all trying to get the largest piece of pie, and start taking the old rights away from it's people, and manipulating your original context to oppress the citizens even greater to maintain and grasp more control and power for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does your original improvements to curb the evil, make you apart of the evil? Just because the current evil wants to take away your rights that was intended to stop the evil?

       If you consider that winning the war for independence wouldn't be the end of the discussion (ie: England would make attempts to reclaim their colonies in the future), it makes perfect sense to arm the populace.

Not the generic stuff they teach at school but exactly the stuff conspiracy theorist like me and you would real.   I really want to learn American history and about freedom and founding fathers and alike.

       The second amendment was written to prevent a standing army. Madison and Jefferson were
       <em>
        clear
       </em>
       on that in their letters to each other during its drafting. They wanted an nationwide militia, where every person would instantly become the ‘army’ in case of invaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Washington threw all that out the window after the Whiskey Rebellion, because he couldn’t get enough people fast enough to respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       Years after signing it, Madison and Jefferson (both on the board of directors) declared the University of Virginia the first ‘gun free zone’, and didn’t feel like that infringed on the amendment they wrote, regardless of modern interpretation.

       Apologies for the length, but it's necessary:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Extravagant as the supposition is, let it however be made. Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the State governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger. The highest number to which, according to the best computation, a standing army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This proportion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the British arms, will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it. Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       -- James Madison (Federalist #46)
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to bear arms was intended to be one leg in a 3-legged stool, an 18th Century version of the triad if you will, in order to stem off an oppressive and tyrannous Federal Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       One leg was the right of the people to bear arms.  One leg was Federalism, the establishment of local and state governments.  The third leg was the establishment of militias and the appointment of officers beholden to the state and local governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       One leg on it's own is not enough to withstand or defeat a tyrannous federal government, however, all three legs must work together in order to achieve a country where liberty may prosper.

       Actually, the Second Amendment was written to guarantee The People the power to defend themselves from the would-be despots and tyrants that would inevitably emerge, and try to deprive The People of all of their

        other

       Like the First Amendment, for example, which guarantees The People the right to speak their mind -- even if what they say is as ignorant, ill-informed and patently false as what you wrote above.

       Thanks for your opinion, the freedom of speech is the freedom to speak against our government, n ot the right to spew every ugly thought while in public and no one cares what is said in private, unless it is a conspiracy against our government. 
That is my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I am concerned that, freedom of speech, has been used to dismiss what was once a legitimate criminal charge, assault and assault is not battery but both are(were crimes).
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you walked up to me on the street and began cursing me and threatening me and attacking my character or appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is an assault, not freedom to speak what ever you think.

       The freedom of speech is the right to say whatever you want, within reason, and not receive any retaliation from the government. It does not extend to making threats, but it does extend to insults. You should try reading a book or something.

       Assault is still a crime. It has legal definitions that vary somewhat from state to state.

       The guns in those days and today are very very different. Imagine if the 2A applied to only those kinds of guns that existed back then. No more assault rifles for civilians. It is like applying a law meant for telephone usage back in 1885 to gigabit internet today.

       I wonder if there wasn't a threat of invaders would they want or allow citizens to have guns, what if they revolt against them
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the government doesn't fear possible invaders so it makes sense they have no need for people to own guns, they might rebel against the government
