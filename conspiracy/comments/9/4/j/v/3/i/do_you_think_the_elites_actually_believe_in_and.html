    <div class="md"><p>Good goy. If your enemy, that uses all the various forms of entertainment to continually push propaganda onto an unwitting and oblivious population in order to more easily control and just in general manipulate them for various reasons, is using aforementioned forms of entertainment to heavily push atheism onto us all, to the point where a large portion of the population now instantly ignores, or even becomes aggressive with anyone that even mentions God, don&#39;t you think you should maybe evaluate why you don&#39;t believe in him? The decline of religion seems to me to be directly tied with the decline of civilization in general, and it certainly allows for being more open to degenerate behavior which weakens us from the inside out.</p>

<p>I remember the point when it the anti-God propaganda finally slapped me in the face and me realize it was when I was trying to watch that Seth Rogen movie &quot;The Night Before.&quot; There&#39;s a scene where Seth,(a member of the tribe remember) gets all fucked up on shrooms or something  and while wearing a CHristmas sweater with a menorah on it, enters a church during their Christmas mass and proceeds to vomit all over the inside of the church. This is the jews idea of entertainment. LOL, the shit is pretty obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Repeating yourself. You could go on forever looking for evidence of God, but you’ll never find <em>exactly</em> what you’re looking for. The idea of God is, God is everything. You know, the alpha <em>and</em> the omega. God is supposed to be infinite, considering (in my opinion) the universe is infinite. I don’t believe the Quark is the tiniest particles. I believe in singularities. I believe you can find a lot of answers and even better questions when looking into the center of a black hole. If the universe really is infinite, how could you expect to see evidence of God <em>as a whole</em>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>rodental you got the wrong concept of god i think. don&#39;t attach a &quot;being&quot; to the idea of god. its the wrong path. think of god as the mind of everything. consciousness is universal. we are all one. that same energy of awareness existing in EVERY living thing is god. pure conciousness at its core. if you think about this from a higher level, YOU are the universe experiencing itself. </p>

<p>Likewise if there is an Anti-Unicorn that suggests things that are readily perceived as evil, and my worship of said Anti-Unicorn motivates me to kill non-believers, and gives me privileges amongst those that also believe, <em>does it matter that there is no Anti-Unicorn?</em></p>

<p>Ideologies have power regardless of their fiction. Saying God doesn&#39;t exist doesn&#39;t somehow magically discount all of the actions taken in that belief. Maybe &quot;God&quot; is more &quot;real&quot; than you think, in a world where a book about a young wizard gives a woman an international voice for her opinion and influences millions, does it matter that Harry Potter is fake?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is indeed a problem. Unfortunately capitalist and industrial society is established to essentially rely on this as daily fact through entertainment and media industries. But beyond that, I can&#39;t say that the other side from God psychotics - atheistic rationalists - essentially have a closer handle on some &quot;objective truth&quot; that is any less delusional, which isn&#39;t easy to consider on the end of most rationalists. Everything humanity creates is still an abstraction that mediates the opportunism between reality and form to someone&#39;s advantage. Everything that isn&#39;t individual experience (and even then) is essentially delusion, seeing as there is still the hard wall of reality that situates any theoretic models into a trash can.  </p>

<p>And yes I am working here from a perspective of scientific methodology being essentially flawed as it relies on theoretical modeling to interpret outcome of sensorial inspection. My perspective of reliance on axiomatic prepositional manufacture of knowledge hierarchy has been radically destroyed through inspection of context, usage and gatekeeping of such mental abstractions, especially in view of the historical structuring of the institutions that have standardized means of our categories, such as through dictionaries, scientific methodology, etc.  </p>

<p>Non-monism is incredibly productive, discernment gives power to those that discern, production creates meaning towards progress, but these are all lies. Reality still exists outside of these things. Just because they are productive - to some end - doesn&#39;t mean they are somehow true. I can understand if you don&#39;t buy such an argument though. Consider that our conception of science comes from religion through Scholasticism and the University guild system that actively kept knowledge secret as a means to secure their privilege of production.  </p>

<p>(To some degree, these are the &quot;Elites&quot; here worshipping Lucifer, that is, the understanding that knowledge is the essential power in the world, that it makes us &quot;gods&quot; and so the control over what knowledge is available and perceived as truth - something that essentially does not exist outside of our interpretation - is the key to control of will, possibility and action in others)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And so a new regime readily denounces the last through newly authoritative perspectives of reductionist foes. To me calling religion psychosis is equivalent to the burning of a witch. Your faith still sits somewhere and is readily co-opted to the interests of a “progress.” A quest is necessarily bounded; truth is a discernment of authority, invented or otherwise. The only proximity to truth we have personally is flawed experience, to suggest a body of work holds truth because of its methodology without personally verifying it lends the same blind faith that religion is readily criticized for, when it is but an aspect of controlling interests manipulating the system to their own advantage, a problem that persists in all ideologies, including science.   </p>

<p>Granted science is a step forward because it attempts barriers to manipulation, but it suffers the same reliance on tradition that disallows its own replacement; like religion it takes advantage of its step in evolution to produce, not to progress (beyond refinements of previous truth), and so it is held back from its purpose of “truth” by its own weight to support itself. Consider the reconciliation between quantum mechanics and classic electromagnetism. What reliance is there to depend on a means of reconciling a synthesis instead of starting anew, when the out of date, non-unitary models are effectively the modern economic foundations of the human species?</p>

<p>That we have productive models holds us back from building better fundamental models, science will have the same momentum issues that religion had, instead of Copernicus being shot down by close minded religion it will be the next genius being disregarded for non-accepted theories, where their attempts to prove anything will face little supportive monetization, when the standard model provides the publishers of scientific legitimacy their paychecks. These interests evolving systems by top-tier system directors choices of self (or group body) interests is a problem both in religion and science.  </p>

<p>I am saying these are both ideological gatekeeping issues. That’s a larger problem than believing in a fake anything (I mean if you don’t, say, perceive God as an allegory to the system of nature we are subordinated to, such as through Spinoza). It doesn’t matter what is “true” or “fake,” only who controls the narrative of its applicability.  </p>

Good thing there&#39;s science to lead you into the hands of whoever you&#39;ll believe in, readily swept away on reductionist schemata. I guess I am just a fool human for being born without reliance on logical positivism as a means of disregarding those that know the pitfalls of rationality.

If you can’t argue against the points made that’s fine, but wrapping it up in discount because of format is a cowardly disservice to both of us. If you can’t argue with someone that doesn’t treat the conversation like a computer then you’ll find plenty of fools, I’m sure. When your parents tell you they love you do you refute it on the grounds that the statement can’t be verified?

    <div class="md"><p>The more refined means you have of arguing means you have less people to argue with. Even if you can argue logically, what good is it if you can&#39;t convince an idiot? You still fail to persuade. It makes it so the only people worth talking to are people that think like you, because you can share control. Like anything it is a tradeoff. I&#39;d rather be capable of convincing idiots - there are a lot more of them, and they don&#39;t have much patience.  </p>

<p>Religion as psychosis is a limited perspective, devaluing it of what richness it can have otherwise.<br/>
Psychosis is a creation of science, a category given to contain a specific non-standard, built from limited data sets to model larger abstractions for application.<br/>
Scientific establishment is an authority that competes for followers against religion (though I would say they are not exclusive). 
If these are true, then how can you rely on religion&#39;s negatives being 
defined by its competitor?  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of overlap in the idea of &quot;mystical experience&quot; - science can call it fugue states, depersonalization, flow, working memory overload, schizoid tendencies, seizures - but, at least the literature I&#39;ve read, places the attributes of these phenomena within the same realm as those described by spiritual enlightenment, alien abductions, meditative states, disembodiment, astral projection, out-of-body experiences.  </p>

<p>To say that there is only one true answer, in any realm, is a manipulation of perspective, an attempt to conceal further perspectives that discredit self-benefit gained from the answers supplied. This has everything to do with the topic of this thread, being perceived Luciferian-Elite manipulation of knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, words have meanings.  When you interpret what I said to be &#39;abusive&#39; or &#39;threatening&#39; you&#39;re being either accidentally or willfully disingenuous.  In no way can that be interpreted as threatening by any definition of the word &#39;threatening&#39; I&#39;m familiar with.  &#39;Abusive&#39; could probably be stretched that far in a pinch, but abuse usually requires intent to harm, and my intent was to help.  I mean, if R4 actually means &#39;don&#39;t say things we don&#39;t like&#39; then put that rule on the sidebar instead, it&#39;s very frustrating when mods stretch the rules so far beyond what they actually say.  I&#39;ll happily obey whatever rules you guys post, but some clarity in the definitions would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I remember the Joe Rogan Experience with Alex jones where Alex says that the elites believe they are channeling some lower, negative,  2 dimensional energy that was giving them information. That essentially humans have become a battlefield for lower and higher dimensional beings vying for supremacy...
I was interested in the idea... but it’s hard to take a claim that radical at face value. </p>

<p>Even the serial killer interviews I’ve watched, I’m not sure anyone is really pure evil.. does worshipping satan bring powers? Idk man I just watched a exorcism documentary and I was much more inclined to believe this woman was having some dissociative schizo breakdown (I see homeless every day who act possessed) than an actual evil entity inside of her</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I&#39;ve come to understand it is through Jungian archetypes. 2 dimensional beings really just means that these people use chaotic archetypes to give them a survival edge over well-meaning, moral people. Channeling your inner psychopath, knowing that you&#39;ve killed, and that you&#39;re in on a huge societal secret would have to give you a huge mental leg up on people, at least as a placebo. I think that all of this is really just a large scale mafia game played by elites, with willing participants in this game being forced into succumbing to their shadow-self in order to play and &#39;win&#39; the game. So manipulation, secrecy, and embracing degenerate, culturally cannibalistic behavior seem to be the name of the game if you want to survive.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re familiar with the concept of an Egregore I&#39;d say that it has something to do with this Satanism concept. Power is used to create a culture driven by a thought-virus. One that promotes &quot;kill or be killed&quot; thinking. I&#39;d wager that this war archetype is within every single human, and served us better in tribal, precivilized, reactionary times. </p>

<p>Great stuff. This is one of the great challenges of shaping rules in our society, whether social mores or actual laws: if we don&#39;t effectively disincentivize malicious actions, then benign actors are typically at a great disadvantage. Society / the system rewards bad behavior at the expense of the common good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re doing a serious injustice to the topic by reducing it to elites worshiping the devil. The reality is much more layered and nuanced.</p>

<p>Those who you call the elite are bound to be much more secret because that&#39;s how you get successful and then keep your status. You make a goofy, happy, whatever looking public face that appeals to the people you need to seem appealing to, preferably picking a class/type of people that were trained to look for such patterns. You make it simple because most people aren&#39;t willing to explore complexity. It&#39;s physically and emotionally tolling. Combine that with social media and instant gratification, you got yourself a perfect platform to abuse. Edward Bernays was far from the first one to create the idea. He made the topic more accessible by picking a new, simpler to understand medium - shops. Then you keep repeating the thing over and over again. You build up a following and encourage them to be vocal. While doing that, you&#39;re engraving a pattern. However, that&#39;s only the public side of the topic. </p>

<p>Having the nation/the majority behind your idea is a bullshit thing to say because that&#39;s not what helps you to make deals. Sure, in the short term you can harm someone or prevent them from making a deal. ALWAYS look at the long term. Most of people will be dead and forgotten. They just don&#39;t matter in the big picture. Having connections, being willing to step over yourself aka selling out, having dirt on others, being willing to bulldoze someone into the ground is what gets the job done and you must do it in a way that empowers the group of people you need to follow you. </p>

<p>The satanic rituals are there to remember all this because you can&#39;t leave. If you do, you&#39;re literally dead. We call them satanic because the Western civilization has the notion of God and Satan. Satan is meant to be scary which is why you shouldn&#39;t look for him. These rituals are there to create a positive feedback loop that shows you you&#39;re not the only one. This is the same principle any religion applies. &quot;If so many people are doing it then there must be something behind it, right?&quot; Plus, these rituals are often used to give dirt to others so that you all have something on each other, which makes it much harder to leave. That&#39;s the reason why taboos exist. Some are manufactured, most are based on our primal instincts.</p>

<p>Is this the right thing to do? It depends. It also is the reason why many people joined. Some were born in it. Most, however, have good intentions. They do it so that others don&#39;t do it. Little do they know how misinformed they are. They become corrupted and everyone is pulling each others strings. It is a completely different world out there and they make it damn sure to remember.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I understand you&#39;re joking, fellow human, I&#39;m not in a society. I am very well off and could retire immediately but that&#39;s not the same. I do, however, meet a lot of interesting and sometimes terrifying people while doing business the way I described and I ask a lot of questions. I&#39;ve even had a gun pulled on me because I got too nosy. Didn&#39;t expect that since I was sitting in a fancy looking lounge similar to the one you see in the movies - all dark brown leather, a lot of books, etc. I genuinely thought the person is unhinged and I was about to get shot. However, his thoughts made me reevaluate a few things. More often than not I get direct answers.</p>

<p>My first mentor, albeit a bit shady type, did teach me the ropes. I&#39;ve written about him in one of my earlier comments. He picked my ideas apart by letting me argue against myself and encouraging me to look for proof and live by the words I speak. Turns out we change our words a lot, we don&#39;t care for proof, and we&#39;re afraid to being wrong. That&#39;s how I got introduced to having big pictures and why there are societies that are fucking long lasting.</p>

<p>One of the users made a short and sweet comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe the elites know all about the most ancient/pre history civilizations, and duly worship those elder teachings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The user right. These societies live by ultimate truths that are very old. Contexts and languages change, but the meaning remains. That&#39;s why there&#39;s a lot of mythology and symbolism in their ceremonies. Sure, most things can be translated and made more understood but that&#39;s not the point as it would lose the connection to the elders, the past, the hundreds of millions of people who died for what exactly?. The man who pulled a gun on me spoke about this. Right before pulling it out, he told me to shut the fuck up and listen carefully, because &quot;in your current state, I could literally shoot you dead and no one would care. Your mom and wife would cry, your friends would be sad, but nothing would be affected in the big picture. You are a fart in the wind. You think you know better but you don&#39;t know ANYTHING (his eyes were getting red at this moment). You with all your education and practice understand nothing and you have the balls to waste your time on asking me questions you should be asking a professor. I&#39;m not a damn professor&quot;. That moment was the ultimate red pill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Over time I have quite a few businesses and in the main ones I&#39;m basically dealing with the analytical side behind propaganda projects and what you can call a matchmaking service (the secret club I briefly mentioned).</p>

<p>Recently I wrote a post about running a bot farm. It&#39;s not exactly what I do but I am well aware how things work, how it&#39;s structured, who makes orders, etc etc. You can model and predict quite a few things because it&#39;s basically regurgitating same old stuff while passing it as brand new.</p>

<p>Regarding matchmaking, I&#39;ve briefly mentioned it in one of my earlier comments. The general idea is that the only way you can become my customer is by being referred by one of my existing customers. Services range from consulting to actually implementing the whole data analysis system and managing it over time during which I introduce the client to my other clients and they create a network themselves. We have rather large gatherings/parties which end up being like mastermind groups where new opportunities are created. Just recently we had a gathering in Dubai.</p>

<p>I also own a few smaller businesses that are run by the people I trust. The more I think about it, the more it&#39;s like a mentoring program for people I believe in and I show it by helping them create companies. Most are related to IT, because where I&#39;m proficient in and I don&#39;t care about running other things.</p>

<p>any thing and every thing, because you seem genuine about your life experiences. I&#39;m not looking for anything in particular, but as you go things will manifest that I believe will be mutually beneficial to me, you, and any one else that is reading.</p>

<p>If you are looking for direction, or a specific question to go off of, how about what it means to hold this identity in public life and privet life. For example, how to you treat a stranger on the street, compared to some one you are trying to win over? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all about ego. When it comes to people who I&#39;m trying to win over, it&#39;s like a game. If I do this, I expect that to happen and so on.</p>

<p>Regarding how I treat strangers - that&#39;s not possible without stereotypes. If I were to consider every person individually, not only would it be physically taxing, but also it would be wasteful. The exception, however, is when I feel that the person is on the brink of collapse. Just recently while walking through a parking next to a shopping mall, two people approached me and tried to start a conversation with a &quot;What a lovely day we&#39;re having&quot; or something like that and looking &quot;sharp&quot;. They got ignored and my day went on.</p>

<p>However, when I got near the entrance I heard a faint coming right next to one of the support beams. It was a mature man (probably in his 50&#39;s) that looked really worn out, looked ashamed as fuck, and was struggling to make eye contact. All I had to do was sit down next to him and ask &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Through the faint sobbing, it took him about 5 minutes to articulate 1 coherent but long sentence. Turns out his wife died and he wasn&#39;t going to able to see his daughter graduate, who was the first one to try and break the spell of poverty through scholarships and all that, because he had a medical emergency and had to use the money on that. He was working 3 jobs and got laid off of one (the one which he took to get extra cash to see his daughter). He had made a promise and this happened.</p>

<p>I might not like scholarships because I know how they&#39;re being abused by those who want to push their ideology, but it wasn&#39;t about that nor it was about me. It was about the dad going such lengths and willing to completely go over his ego and genuinely ask for help. The only question I asked him after that was &quot;How much money would you need?&quot; It was about EUR 1200. I don&#39;t remember the exact number, since he named it with all the cents. He even wanted to show me all the documents which I declined to see. I went to the bank gave him the money because I know how fucking hard is to step over yourself and do this. It&#39;s humiliating. I told him to go and grab something to eat, gave 20 euros, and told to wait for me. I&#39;ll drive him home because he walked to the mall not to have to spend money on a bus ticket. It was basically a test to seal the deal. He already had the money in an envelope and could leave. Well, he waited for me and I took him home, which was about 30 minutes away.</p>

<p>While driving, I had a monologue about the very topic we&#39;re talking about. I told him one of my personal stories where I ended up being in a similar position and how he was miles ahead of me. I also told him to use it as a self-reflecting moment on what&#39;s going on in his life and think what&#39;s going to happen after this event. He had this problem down to a single cent and had the dedication to go any lengths. Turns out he wanted to start a company right before his wife died and then he lost track of his life. He wanted to break the cycle as well but life hit him hard. It doesn&#39;t matter what the company was. I knew I couldn&#39;t help but one of my business partners could, so I told him to expect a call later next week from a specific person. I&#39;ll set up a meeting and they&#39;ll go through their idea as if it was a real business proposal. We&#39;ll see what comes from that but it seems promising. If he&#39;ll be lacking in some aspects but my business partner will like him, I&#39;ll have a job lined up for him. Sure, it will take a favor or two but if that man is as dedicated as he was when he wanted to see his daughter, he&#39;ll have a success story and I&#39;m 100% certain he&#39;ll help others. The funny thing about success stories is it doesn&#39;t matter what you do as long as you are focused. He literally has nothing to lose and I want the man to succeed. My first mentor had a similar attitude and I keep finding myself doing the very same thing. It just works.</p>

The world has built up this perverse image of necessary complexity and it&#39;s usually sold to people with scientific achievements and how impossible it was [until it wasn&#39;t lol]. Things I&#39;m talking about is not science. It&#39;s not even pseudoscience. It&#39;s just what we are. It&#39;s unimaginable to convey a scientific theory with a ritual/a dance, but you can do that with the history of the society. You can influence people with the right music, the right food (Indian culture is light years ahead of the Western culture in this sense), the right movements. There has to be suffering, otherwise there will be gluttony and when that happens it&#39;s the end of a society. Literally ALL religious texts talk about this. This is why sacrifice was and still is needed. You need to have suffering to better yourself.</p>

<p>I think these people are just mafia type scum tbh. Maybe it&#39;s not black and white and some aren&#39;t so bad (with honor and some level of ethics), perhaps some were blackmailed or born into it or whatever and don&#39;t truly want to harm anyone (economically or physically) but have no way out. But some are most definitely the scum of the Earth!</p>

<p>Also, I think you mentioned something about gluttony? I personally don&#39;t buy into that argument (from them). I think it&#39;s bullshit because while gluttony can be damaging (eating too much = might get disease, going on reddit or on your phone too much = you&#39;re wasting time instead of doing actual fun stuff or invest time in something that would improve your life later on, etc.)
But it seems highly exaggerated to the point it seems like an excuse to justify their highly unethical activity. </p>

<p>It sounds like the type of crap a dodgy monarch would spew &quot;do as I say, not as I do!&quot;
because a lot of these psychopath elites indulge in extreme twisted levels of gluttony, way way beyond anything a &quot;commoner&quot; would engage in even if the world was a utopia. Some of these elites engage in drug abuse, child abuse (extremely twisted type of indulgence), power tripping, invading countries and making life miserable for billions of people to varying degrees just to have a monopoly on wealth and power. It&#39;s sickening.</p>

<p>I still think there is some element of satanism being practiced due to its history (sacrifices and other evil shit) but not all mafia style thugs engage in this. Some are just in it for the perks I guess.
I&#39;m just trying to figure out how we could possibly reason with these people or if they cannot be reasoned with at all. Hence some people believe archons control some of the most psychopathic ones.
Just curious.</p>

<p>Raging out and not having an ego isn&#39;t the same. Not having an ego simply means you can become whatever the situation requires you to be. Jim Carrey talks about this. It&#39;s like that.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s a fine line to walk on. You can have too much of it and it will destroy the society around you and then there&#39;s having too little of everything. That&#39;s not much of an option these days, isn&#39;t it? If you don&#39;t like something, leave. Literally no one is holding you back. You are what you make of yourself.

<p>Your assumption is faulty. ALL people get power trips. ALL people will become corrupted, given the chance. You just have to nudge them correctly and soon people become addicted to this. Just because everyday people that you see around you don&#39;t talk about this or don&#39;t engage in this means nothing. Don&#39;t trust people like that. Trust those that have seen the power, that are aware of the power they have, that are able to control it consciously. They are significantly less pleasant to deal with but they will shower you with their version of the truth. Talk to enough successful people and you&#39;ll see most, if not all, talk about the same thing. Regular people will just lie to others and themselves to feel better because the truisms I talk about are fucking harsh.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, some people are tripping balls over the power they have. I cannot deny that. However, don&#39;t automatically assume all powerful people are like that. Sure, most have seen or heard really weird shit and have experienced things happening to them significantly worse than getting a gun pulled on you while thinking you&#39;re safe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m just trying to figure out how we could possibly reason with these people or if they cannot be reasoned with at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a dangerous assumption because it has no basis. There is a reason why cults have existed across borders for significantly longer than any society without having to change that much. Who are you to tell that you or other regular people are the voice of reason? Regular people don&#39;t have a good track record of survival over time. Most regular societies get manipulated and warped into an image of a ruler who acknowledges most truisms. There&#39;s no way around that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I read your comments some time ago so maybe I&#39;ve forgotten some details, perhaps you were referring more to medium level elites and not the top level, I&#39;m not sure. But curious to hear your view anyway.</p>

<p>Being a member of the &quot;elite&quot; class is a binary thing. You are a member or you aren&#39;t. The rest is determined by the amount of money, connections and willingness or do what&#39;s necessary of you. It doesn&#39;t matter what you do, what&#39;s your gender, what&#39;s your race, how beautiful or fugly you are. All of them understand the truisms and live by them in their own ways. Regarding not being able to get out, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a wise thing because then you&#39;ll have to engage with people who don&#39;t live by the truisms and that in itself is a torture. There is a reason why HR and PR departments exist.</p>

<p>I&#39;m propagandizing the concept of having universal truisms that are not bound by culture or history.

<p>Of course, everything is not black and white, but I&#39;m willing to take my chances and use my time and energy on deciding other things that can immediately better my life by bettering the life of those who are involved. There&#39;s just not enough time to consider all the possible combinations, so I go with stereotypes. So far it works. Also, I&#39;m not offended when people assign a stereotype to me. I and others do it as well. Why be offended about it?</p>

<p>You are free to believe whatever you want. Just make sure to practice it and aggressively explore all the possible shortcomings. Political system matters very little when it comes to long lasting societies and truisms. Democracy is just a form of societal management. It still means people will lie about serious issues when it comes to country, their friends or themselves, most of the population will be misinformed, and most of the value will be created by groups of people working towards a common goal aka a corporation.</p>

<p>Fundamental truths are simple and primal and there is very little possibility to misunderstand them.

    <div class="md"><p>Well the only thing I can share about that is that you need to consciously start applying it. However, you need some credibility at first. Make a track record and show openness and willingness to learn. Be humble about it. Over time acting with authority will come naturally. Then you can start changing the language people use around you and when you&#39;re not around. The goal - so that people will remember about you because they used that one word, one joke, or one phrase. That literally is the only reason. Pick words that you want people to associate you with, repeat them often enough and make sure to do so when you&#39;ll reward them. Do that enough times and people will feel rewarded just by saying the words you used. Damn Pavlov and his dogs. Brilliant man.</p>

<p>Having a big picture is about knowing what you&#39;re willing to like, what you&#39;re good at, what you&#39;re bad at, and where the world is going. It means simplifying your life and your persona so that you don&#39;t have to think as much. Chance are you are seriously overthinking all your decisions and things. It just means you don&#39;t have a system of thinking. A method to your madness, if you will. If you really want to improve your life, please, please, please watch Jordan Peterson. I&#39;ve met him in a private event only to thank him. He literally is trying to shove down these truisms down people&#39;s fucking throats and they&#39;re calling him a racist. Bunch of fucking braindead morons. Sure, he might have a slip-up or two but listen to what the man is saying. Those are the teachings what the so-called elite is living by.</p>

<p>Fuck news. As a person who is paid to analyze all that stuff, for the love of God, stop reading the fucking news and start talking to real, successful people. Don&#39;t know any successful people - figure out why the hell not and what&#39;s stopping you from doing so.</p>

<p>i think this is very cultural dependent. also depends on how strong your relationships with your family and relatives are, so if you had a good childhood these bonds are more likely to be stronger than if you had to fend for yourself from an early age. but yes, changes in status can lead to changes in attitude and relationships, and there&#39;ll always be parasites disguised as family members trying to leech off of you if you&#39;re successful.</p>

<p>thanks for the Jordan Peterson rec, i know he&#39;s a popular name around these parts but never explored his work. will start rectifying that asap</p>

<p>i have one last question: can you say with any degree of certainty what the elites&#39; end game is? i&#39;ve read so many plausible theories that i can&#39;t decide if one is more valid than the other. surely it can&#39;t be something as simple and vapid as wealth acquisition, as they already own the world whichever way you look at it. is it the implementation of the Kalergi plan? one world government? depopulation? transhumanism? a combination thereof? too many possibilities..</p>

<p>i think that&#39;s something important to know, because the more we understand about the elites&#39; goals and what they&#39;re doing to accomplish them, the more we understand how our lives are affected and what measures we can take to minimize the effect of their actions (e.g. vaccines, racial tensions, etc.)</p>

<p>Every single answer you read will be a theory. Sure, some might be more justified than others and yes, there might be genuinely bad people roaming the wild, but most aren&#39;t. I remember reading a greentext in 4chan about this very thing. These people just get addicted to being red-pilled which is an unimaginably sadistic way of looking at things. They are willing to go past their egos only to be able to go &quot;Heh... wow.&quot; But that&#39;s not so interesting isn&#39;t it? Most people want to hear about manufactured wars and everything. Wars are manufactured since the old times. Most battles were fought because of an agreement to fight to seem that threat is inevitable so that kings would get to keep their wealth and status. Both parties won. Plus it helped to rid the society of mentally retarded as it would seem bad to kidnap them and execute them. It&#39;s all about sex, which means growing your population and keeping it healthy. It&#39;s also one of the major reasons why wars seem to come easily to the Middle East. Sure, there are resources but the amount of inbred people with low IQ&#39;s are terrifyingly high. Good luck finding a modern scientific paper talking about this issue. The last one I recall reading was from 1993 [I think]. Jordan Peterson also talks about IQ and he&#39;s right about it.</p>

<p>I wish I could give a definite answer to this question. Historically it was done to keep people in order not because they didn&#39;t want them to think (how do you improve the society if you don&#39;t think and it&#39;s also a great PR move to align yourself with thinkers and be susceptible to some criticism), but because what will you do with all the thinking people? You will end up with a lot of educated people who are forced to do something that makes them miserable and their productive capacity will be turned into hatred. It&#39;s wasted potential and it diminishes the value of the society. I kind of described the state of the Western civilization right now.</p>

<p>The idea behind debating issues and getting a higher education is a great and novel one and being able to do so freely is of paramount importance. However, it has been romanticized. You don&#39;t need a formal education. You don&#39;t need to be a great thinker (whatever that means). You need to figure out what you can and are willing to be great that, do it over and over, rinse and repeat. You don&#39;t see that being taught much these days. Become a fucking plumber and be the best god damn plumber you can possibly be. Get positive referrals, go to bigger objects, start presenting yourself not as a smelly, worn down plumber but a one that actually gets the job done, is pleasant to look at, and can hold a reasonable conversation. Do that enough times and you&#39;re bound to strike gold. It&#39;s that fucking simple. And now with the invention of the internet. Jesus. The potential a person can have is unlimited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the occult imagery used is hermetic in origin, But I don&#39;t think they are devout anything, They have more access and time to study older religious philosophies and the money and power to create an extravagent ritual, But an atul belief in anything other than their own importance,No.</p>

<p>They have fell in love with their own ego, Embodied it and stuck symbolism to it, But they aren&#39;t elite, Or enlightened or anything so grandiose... </p>

<p>They are the swine that has had the pearls cast in front of them!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think similarly to you.  I feel like its more a means to an end.  By having all the other powerful people involved in the same dirty shit nobody can bring you down without fucking themselves. Mutually assured destruction. It forms a bond and trust between psychopaths. </p>

<p>I believe they are groomed from a very young age to be psychopaths. If you rape your kids and force them to participate in ritual Abuse Wether you actually believe in it or not it shapes them into the kind of psycho that&#39;s needed to rule a country.. Or at least be the kind of evil bastard that will rule a country their way. When you don&#39;t have to worry about sympathy or empathy for the poor,  starving,  dying people you have more time to focus on making your billions,  playing the world like a chess game. Working towards the end game that&#39;s been in place decades before they were even born.  </p>

<p>*** Hitler was very interested in the occult,  was looking for religious artifacts and books about such things.  If Hitler was openly looking for that sort of thing what do you think other scumbags in power are doing with their time and energy? </p>

<p>You&#39;re 80 years old, have billions in the bank,  many houses, land and property,  plenty of heirs,  at a certain point you start to think about your own mortality and then myths about fountains of youth aren&#39;t so silly.   Maybe there an old map that has directions to an ancient one,  you can afford to look so why not.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s all kinds of stories about Worshipping certain beings and taking power from them.  If you have nothing to lose,  why not give it a shot? </p>

<p>All gangs have entry rituals, the military &quot;haze&quot; each other, Street gangs have initiations, If you are the top of the tree, In one of the most exclusive clubs on the planet, then the entrance fee is going to be off the charts, Child sacrifice/rape/bestiality, anything really.</p>

<p>Very, although &quot;occult&quot; only means hidden, or secret, What you do with that knowledge once it is in your reach decides if it is evil or good, If you are searching occult knowledge to improve the life of yourself and closet friends then your intentions are good, If you are searching for it because you want to own the world, then you may be a little misguided.</p>

<p>You&#39;re 80 years old, have billions in the bank, many houses, land and property, plenty of heirs, at a certain point you start to think about your own mortality and then myths about fountains of youth aren&#39;t so silly. Maybe there an old map that has directions to an ancient one, you can afford to look so why not</p>

<p>Heres the thing, These are the ones putting billions into life extension technology! Why would you do that if you had been given special satan powers? If you were some kind of devil worshiping warlock you wouldn&#39;t give any fucks about extending your life through technology, Surely stan would give you some sort of ritual to extend your life?</p>

<p>I have a romantic interest in the occult, I know fuck all, which is about the same as them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they do.  That&#39;s why this world is full of nothing but lies.  All they care about is that you die without ever realizing that you need Jesus Christ&#39;s blood atonement to save you from the second death due to sin.  They are very smart about it.  They teach us false &quot;science&quot; in the education system and have false Church building versions of Christianity set up for people to get indoctrinated into or reject.  Even conspiracy controlled opposition is about about rejecting the need to the the blood atonement of Jesus Christ. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satanism is a philosophy more than a religion, worshiping yourself and self interests, and sparking evolution through that means.   Literally, this is the underlying idea behind the torment of theological hell - complete separation from God/Allah/theUNcreated.  The Quran describes it as being trapped in pitch black darkness during a thunderstorm of deafening noise where the only light comes from brief flashes of lightening that burn so bright that your eyes detect a searing white flash before being struck blind again - over and over, the flashes cause you to jump in terror and panic before cowering in fear, lost and hopeless.    The idea of our consciousness being in an eternal schism, displaced into another world (its creator having been created itself,  as necessarily you&#39;ve traveled away from the original source of creation, into one of an infinite number of echoing reflections of the source (the one uncreated infinite God).  Think of each of those reflections as having been triggered into existence - and thus created by a creator who was himself created.  </p>

<p>Imagine a virtual reality world constructed by a deep learning AI that is self teaching and self correcting, its code evolves and it in turn evolves.  The AI itself is the Creator deity for that virtual reality world, and its primal form was created by humans who were looking to create the AI just to give them a virtual place and society for their data/brain code to be &quot;uploaded&quot; into after dying.  All in an attempt to conquer death,  which necessarily means VOLUNTARY exodus from realm of the original creator/God in favor of one by a creator of our own making.   In much the same way, Satanism is about acting in and serving personal hubris, self interest, and physical sensation/pleasure - as opposed to serving the spiritual soul, nourishing via building our humility, loving others/good works, practicing loving submission, all characteristics of divine wisdom and the mercy of God/Allah.  Satanism rejects the lifeline Allah/God has with us as a mercy - the purpose so that we may reflect that mercy here and ease suffering.  Instead, the NWO/Satanists wish to escape what they perceive as the confines of being a created entity, in order to only have themselves to answer to.  In the satanists mind, this is the primary driving force , to evolve into a creator/god themselves (in order to control the afterlife experience on their terms, or rather, the terms of the creator they themselves created) or even to force an evolutionary crossroad for the entire species.  </p>

<p>Any wonder why there&#39;s a connection between those who decide the fates of the planet and billions of people with such an ideology?  These evil people have literally created the garbage truck society we have now, filled with poverty, environmental collapse, suffering, ignorance, isolation and loneliness, and with a big shit eating smile **proudly** tout the abundance of shopping malls televisions and iphones as a mark of our society&#39;s evolution, the endless quest to acquire and consume presented as the elixir to the gnawing hole of spiritual starvation within each of us.  And in the end, they will wear that same shit filled smile, to tell you that all of that suffering and despair defining the world **they** held all the power in was simply an inevitable byproduct of **everyone&#39;s** common &quot;human nature&quot;, the answer of which is to simply live in a perfect singular (or hivemind) algorithm controlled world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Over time I have quite a few businesses and in the main ones I&#39;m basically dealing with the analytical side behind propaganda projects and what you can call a matchmaking service (the secret club I briefly mentioned).</p>

<p>Recently I wrote a post about running a bot farm. It&#39;s not exactly what I do but I am well aware how things work, how it&#39;s structured, who makes orders, etc etc. You can model and predict quite a few things because it&#39;s basically regurgitating same old stuff while passing it as brand new.</p>

<p>Regarding matchmaking, I&#39;ve briefly mentioned it in one of my earlier comments. The general idea is that the only way you can become my customer is by being referred by one of my existing customers. Services range from consulting to actually implementing the whole data analysis system and managing it over time during which I introduce the client to my other clients and they create a network themselves. We have rather large gatherings/parties which end up being like mastermind groups where new opportunities are created. Just recently we had a gathering in Dubai.</p>

<p>I also own a few smaller businesses that are run by the people I trust. The more I think about it, the more it&#39;s like a mentoring program for people I believe in and I show it by helping them create companies. Most are related to IT, because where I&#39;m proficient in and I don&#39;t care about running other things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply!</p>

<p>any thing and every thing, because you seem genuine about your life experiences. I&#39;m not looking for anything in particular, but as you go things will manifest that I believe will be mutually beneficial to me, you, and any one else that is reading.</p>

<p>If you are looking for direction, or a specific question to go off of, how about what it means to hold this identity in public life and privet life. For example, how to you treat a stranger on the street, compared to some one you are trying to win over? </p>

<p>Thank you for you time!</p>
