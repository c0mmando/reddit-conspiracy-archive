       Believe it people, no one at CIA or NSA or anyone else gives a rats ass about conspiracy redditers. This place would put them to sleep even if they were watching. People like Eustice Mullins, G. Ed Griffin, Alex Jones etc. have been spouting off outrageous stuff on TV and radio for decades and they're still doing fine. If you're worried about being watched, try booking an airline ticked every once in a while. That will be your canary in the coal mine. No one gives a crap.

       Duh, because they're agents, anyone that's gone on TV to talk about conspiracies is obviously disinfo. I think we've well established the MSM is disinfo by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm not worried at the moment, but if it turns out they've been quietly compiling a list of undesirables who they plan to kill off in the future based on google searches, emails, reddit comments etc... then I think I'd have a reason to be a little worried.

       Hang on there.  Don't forget, the most damning evidence against the government
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       comes from the MSM.  Low-level reporters at all the networks do respectable journalism just like we were always taught to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM is not 100% disinfo.  There are too many people involved for all of them to be complicit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real disinfo is the big stories with the expensive computer graphics that get repeated ad nauseum on all the networks for days on end.  That's how you know it's propaganda, because they really try to beat it into you.

       I don't know about Mullens, I believe it of Jones, but I've never seen anything to make me distrust Griffin, just things that make me disagree with him.  Griffin has also taped some really informative interviews, one with aa former KGB guy talking about "demoralization" and another with Norman Dodd who investigated the tax exempt foundations which is one of the most important hours of video I've ever seen.  Nowhere in The Creature from Jekyl Island or any of his work did I get the feeling he was pulling punches, just that his focus is more pro-free-market than most people writing in the same field.

       Calling Griffin a shill based
       <em>
        solely
       </em>
       on him reaching different conclusions is the kind of useless bullshit that makes this line of inquiry so pointless.  First of all, its a misrepresentation, as his focus is on the banking sector primarily and (in Creature...) with Fabian Socialists.  Both groups are CFR linked, but so is fucking
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       .  I personally have seen very little convincing evidence of Vatican (since ww2), or Knights of Malta (as a group) involvement, and not huge evidence for the centrality of the other 2 groups, so you'll excuse me if I don't call him a shill for reaching the same conclusions.  I would essentially have to extend that accusation to most "conspiracy" writers I find most well-sourced who also don't focus on these groups and who, therefor must be disinfo artists if they agree with Eric Jon Phelps.  A man whose reputation is considerably less than that of most of those he impugns.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How much evidence do you need?
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The Illuminati was founded by Adam Weishaupt, whose father was a Jesuit professor, and who was trained at Jesuit schools since he was 7. He graduated from a Jesuit university (Ingolstadt University) and went on to become a Jesuit professor of Roman Catholic Cannon Law at that Jesuit university. He was reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church on his deathbed.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The Bilderberg Group was founded by Joseph Retinger, a well-trained Jesuit priest. This was revealed by MI6 whistleblower John Coleman, in his book "Conspirator's Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of 300". The co-founder, Prince Bernhard, was a Knight of Malta.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The CIA was founded by William Donovan, a Knight of Malta who had been awarded the highest award in the Roman Catholic Church. The first director of the CIA, Allen Dulles, was a Knight of Malta whose nephew, Avery Dulles, was a prominent Jesuit priest. CIA directors William Colby, William Casey, John McCone, Allen Dulles, George Tenet, and Leon Panetta have all been either Knights of Malta or Jesuit-trained.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The FBI was founded by Charles J. Bonaparte, a Knight of Malta who served on the board of trustees for the Catholic University of America. FBI directors Louis Freeh and Thomas Pickard are devoutly Roman Catholic and Louis Freeh is an alleged member of Opus Dei.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) The man at the center of the plot to overthrow Franklin Roosevelt was John J. Raskob, a Knight of Malta. Prescott Bush (Jesuit-trained at Stonyhurst College) was also involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) The fascist movements in Italy were Vatican operations. The Grandmaster of the P2 Masonic Lodge that took over Italy and backed Mussolini was Licio Gelli, a Knight of Malta. X-Mas, the Italian fascist terror group, was led by Prince Borghese, a Knight of Malta.
      </p>
      <p>
       7) The Jesuits control the US Military. The head of the Defense Department, Robert Gates, was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University, as was his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld. Peter Pace, the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University. The current Chair and Vice Chair of the Joint Chiefs are both Roman Catholic. David Petraeus and George W. Casey, Jr., the generals who commanded US forces in Iraq, were both Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University.
      </p>
      <p>
       8) At the center of the Iran-Contra scandal were Ronald Reagan, George H.W Bush, William J. Casey, Robert Gates, Oliver North, and Alexander Haig. All of them, with the exception of Robert Gates (who himself was Jesuit-trained) were Knights of Malta. Casey and Haig were Jesuit-trained, as well, and Haig's brother, Francis, was a Jesuit priest.
      </p>
      <p>
       9) The Rothschild Family are listed in the Jewish Encyclopedia as "Guardians of the Papal Treasure", meaning that they are Vatican financial agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       10) The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a Jesuit operation. The first director was Tom Ridge, a devoutly Roman Catholic Knight of Columbus. The real power behind the DHS was John C. Gannon, the head of it's intelligence unit. Gannon was Jesuit-trained at the College of the Holy Cross and is a member of the Jesuit Volunteer Corps. The deputy director of the DHS from 2005-2007 was Michael P. Jackson, who was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University. Bush's first pick for the second DHS director was a Roman Catholic man. In the end, he chose Michael Chertoff, who is married to a Jesuit professor (Meryl Chertoff). Under Chertoff, the head of the DHS' immigration was Emilio T. Gonzalez, a Knight of Malta. The new DHS director (Under Obama) is Janet Napolitano, who was Jesuit-trained at Santa Clara University.
      </p>
      <p>
       11) The PATRIOT Act was written by Viet Dinh, a Roman Catholic professor at Georgetown University, the Jesuit University of Washington DC.
      </p>
      <p>
       12) The current head of the CIA was Jesuit-trained at Santa Clara University. The current head of the DOD was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University. The current head of the DHS was Jesuit-trained at Santa Clara University. The current head of the ATF was Jesuit-trained at Boston College High School.
      </p>
      <p>
       13) Blackwater (Changing it's name to 'Xe') was founded by Erik Prince, a devout Roman Catholic. It's Chief of Operations (until recently), Joseph E. Schmitz, who previously worked for the Pentagon as the former Inspector General of the Department of Defense is a Knight of Malta an Opus Dei and Jesuit trained at Georgetown Preparatory School and Georgetown University. He was also a Professor at Georgetown University. Author Jeremy Scahill linked the Knights of Malta directly to Blackwater. Blackwaters founder, Erik Prince is also a Knight of Malta and has recently been implicated in the murder of individuals who were cooperating with federal authorities investigating the company. A former employee also alleges that Prince "views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe," and that Prince's companies "encouraged and rewarded the destruction of Iraqi life."
      </p>
      <p>
       14) Paul Volcker, William McDonough, E. Gerald Corrigan, and other top Federal Reserve officials have been Jesuit-trained. The Federal Reserve is controlled by the Rothschilds (Vatican banking agents) and was founded in 1913 after the three men who opposed it were 'erased' when the Titanic sunk.
      </p>
      <p>
       15) The Jesuits sunk the Titanic. A Jesuit priest, Francis Browne, was aboard the ship. He took photographs of everyone aboard. The stop before it's sinking, he received a message from his Jesuit superior that stated "GET OFF THAT SHIP -- PROVINCIAL". When it sunk, the three men who were the biggest forces against the Federal Reserve and WWI died with it.

       Ex-Jesuit priest Alberto Rivera said that under the extreme oath of the Jesuits, he was told that a secret sign was to be given to Jesuits world-wide when the ecumenical movement had successfully wiped out protestantism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sign was to be when a President of the U.S. took his oath of office facing an obelisk.
U.S. Presidents had always been sworn in on the east side of the Capitol, but for the first time in U.S. history, the swearing in ceremonies were moved to the West front of the Capitol, and President Reagan faced the Washington Monument. This happened January 20, 1981. Every U.S. President since has been sworn in from the west side.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other significant thing about this is that the Vatican is situated on the same latitude as the U.S. Capitol building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now note that the Capitol building faces directly West towards an obelisk/sun dial and the Vatican faces directly east towards an obelisk/sun dial. So what this means is that when the President takes the oath of office he looks directly out towards the direction of the Vatican (and also the Pope if he happens to be holding Mass at the same time)
      </p>
      <p>
       The original name of the area of which would eventually become Washington, District of Columbia was Rome, Maryland. Specifically, Rome was the original community name of Capitol Hill, upon which the United States Capitol Building sits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thomas Jefferson insisted the legislative building be called the "Capitol", rather than "Congress House". The word "Capitol" comes from Latin, meaning city on a hill and is associated with the Roman temple to Jupiter Optimus Maximus on Capitoline Hill.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1663, the property that would become the Capitol's site was inscribed in the Maryland property records as “Rome,” its owner was a man named Francis Pope. The southern boundary of this property was shaped by a river named for the river that runs through Rome, the Tiber.
      </p>
      <p>
       The community was part of the ten mile square tract of land which would become the American capital Washington, D.C., and its owner, Daniel Carroll, transferred the community to the federal government after the amendment to the United States Constitution sanctioning the building of the new United States capital city was ratified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Daniel Carroll was the chairman of a three-man commission appointed by President George Washington to find a suitable location for the capital city. A signer of the Declaration of Independence, Daniel Carroll was a Roman Catholic educated by Jesuits in Maryland and France. His brother John Carroll became the first Catholic bishop in America he also founded Georgetown University (The Jesuit Georgetown University is actually the real powerbase of America)

       "The Illuminati was founded by Adam Weishaupt,"
      </p>
      <p>
       Who was a close personal friend of the first prominent Rothschild, a
       <em>
        Jewish
       </em>
       family with a considerably more prominent list of connections to conspiracies than any other.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The co-founder, Prince Bernhard"
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always seen him as the primary founder, supported by Queen Beatrix's unbroken attendance.  So Bernhard was [a] founder of Bilderberg, a Knight of Malta, a member of the Dutch royal family, an SS volunteer and people are disinfo agents because they fail to focus on
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       of those?  I will read the rest of your post out of interest, but my point is made.  You can look at several aspects of Bernhart, Rockefellers, Rhodes etc and focus on some to the exclusion of others without being a liar; however the simpler the inference, the more contradicting points and people and politics you can find.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're assuming attending Georgetown means Jesuit training.  That gives you a long list of people who may have simply attended one of the US's top foreign policy schools.  What's actually illustrated by the Georgetown/Quigly/Clinton/Jesuit thing, I think is that it shows a split between two real groups (one with a mainland European tone, the other Anglo-American which may have paralleled a split in the Rockefeller family, a break between the Rockefeller and Rothschild families or neither) and the real European based group, subtly exposing the "Anglo-American Establishment.  The idea that the AAE is a fabrication of Jesuits is untenable.  So, in my opinion, you're looking at one very real group but attacking others for focusing on other, equally real groups.  That there are at least 2 major factions (Anglo-American and mainland European) is clear to me, but they abide to an extent by the Rockefeller doctrine "competition is a sin".
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: the Knights of Malta, some of the members you list were never attendees to meetings and simply received the title.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a Jesuit operation"
      </p>
      <p>
       Ah yes, that dedicated Knight Michael Chertoff, Jesuit trained in Israel...
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Federal Reserve is controlled by the Rothschilds, banking agents of the Vatican"
      </p>
      <p>
       That's quite a claim, which I have never seen a shred of support for (the second part, I think its entirely likely they control the fed).  Also, why no inclusion of Rhodes, by far the most important person funded by the Rothschilds (I can see why you think everything ties to the Vatican if you think the Rothschilds are controlled by them, because virtually everything does tie back to the Rothschilds).
      </p>
      <p>
       With one exception, your quotes about Jesuits are pre-20th century, the one that isn't stops it reckoning at 1931.  American politics had two major realignments of elite power in the first half of the 20th: Wilson's presidency and the WW2-Truman-Eisenhower era.  You could argue that Jesuits now control the new institutions, but with the exception of a few which you've listed that seem sound (Xe for example shows no contradictions and a strong crypto-Christian bias), most of those are circumstantial and based on people attending Georgetown, which lots of prominent people did.
      </p>
      <p>
       "a secret sign was to be given to Jesuits world-wide when the ecumenical movement had successfully wiped out protestantism."
      </p>
      <p>
       Really?  Catholic vs. Protestant?  That went out with the unification of Germany and WW1.
      </p>
      <p>
       "name of the area of which would eventually become Washington, District of Columbia was Rome"
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually heard that recently, and while I think it likely signifies nothing but a coincidence, it is telling as to the repetitive nature of politics ("The empire never ended." -Phillip K. Dick)  I've read pretty in depth accounts of the discussions and compromises that led to the placement of DC, I've also seen shows "prove" that Masons are satanic by various signs and street layouts etc in DC.  I don't give any of this stuff much credence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, listing all Georgetown and Jesuit University attendees as conspirators really does make them seem influential.  I'm not saying there's no such thing as a covert Jesuit network, just that they were likely never the only such group meddling secretly in politics and they certainly aren't now.

       Let me first say, yes there are other groups as you say.
      </p>
      <p>
       First you have Israel, the masonic Zionist state which is a decoy scapegoat that's seen as the ones in power by the people who have bought the disinfo. Yes the masonic Zionist Jews are involved, but no they aren't in control. Israel is completely controlled by the United States, Britain and Rome. The CFR controls Israeli policy from the United States. Britain created Israel and had been seeking it's creation for a long time because that's what the Freemasons want ofcourse and Britain is where the Freemasons come from so they are a large force in Britain. So Britain has a strong control of Israel through the Masonic Zionist Jews there. The Masonic Zionist Rothschilds also have big ties to Israel and paid to build Israel's Supreme Court (which is filled with Masonic designs), they also want to fund the rebuilding of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. Also lets not forget Mossad is controlled by MI6. Rome controls Israel through their Jesuit trained Shimon Peres and through Knight of Malta King Juan Carlos 'King of Jerusalem' who controls the Knight of Malta network for the Middle East. The New World Order's completion is when Israel is given to the Pope, where he'll rule the world from, once his temporal power is restored. We have a few steps left to go till that happens though.
      </p>
      <p>
       America is the country the masses think rules the world. America is controlled by Britain and Rome. American policy is controlled through the CFR. The CFR is part of the Round Table Network in Britain. The Round Table Network completely controls Britain and America. The CIA is controlled by MI6 (as is every intelligence agency) and ofcourse you have, Freemasons, Knights of Malta and Jesuits throughout the intelligence agencies too as another layer of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Britain is the country that for the people waking up appears to rule the world, they have their Round Table Network and MI6 does control all the other intelligence agencies. They're the ones that control the world's (for the most part) media and are the ones setting this Police/Surveillance state, that we're all heading towards. Britain is controlled by Rome though. The Roundtable Network is controlled by the Queen and she takes her orders from the Grand Priory of England, which is the British faction of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The top level of control in Britain though is the Jesuit Center at 114 Mount St., controlled by the 4th vow (the ones who have taken the extreme oath) Jesuits and Black Pope in Rome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rome is the hidden power controlling the world through her Jesuit spies, her Knights of Malta and her Freemasons and to a lesser extent the Knights of Columbus and Opus Dei. Until the Pope is openly given control over the whole world, the Black Pope (i.e. the Superior General of the Jesuits), is the most powerful person in the world.

       The Sovereign Military Order of Malta (aka Knights of Malta or simply SMOM) is a sovereign subject of international law, with its own constitution, passports, stamps, and public institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Order has diplomatic relations with 100 countries - many of which non-Catholic - and missions to major European countries, as well as to 
European and international organisations. The Order of Malta is neutral, impartial and non-political, which is why it can successfully act as a mediator between States.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also have special observer status at the U.N. along with the Vatican.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Knights Templar were dissolved in 1312 and much of their property was given to the Knights Hospitallers, who are today known as the Knights of Malta.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the Templars members also transferred over to the Hospitallers.
The Archbishop of NY controls all the Knights of Malta in the United States and they must obey him by their oath.
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of the SMOM include, George H. W. Bush and his father Prescott Bush, Ronald Reagan, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Pat Buchanan to name a few.

       These ad-hominem attacks on Phelps are ridiculous and I can't believe people are still parroting them about. I didn't expect you would be spreading this crap too Xander.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Phelps's wife buys diamonds from an Israeli company, big deal, it doesn't prove that anything he says is wrong and Phelps implicates the Zionists anyway, so how does it make any sense that he's a "crypto-zionist"?

       I buy stuff from America, which is part of the conspiracy does that make me one of them too?

       How about before we call them disinfo, we get
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       other points on which we disagree with them.  The cases against Jones or Cooper have large components based on far more than what they assert; I don't categorically believe or disbelieve either argument, but it least they're not comprised entirely of "He said Jews don't run US foreign policy; shill."  "He said the CFR doesn't matter; shill."  And other things that are really just matters of opinion or personal viewpoint.

       You think Alex Jones is a disinformation agent? Now I'd agree that a lot of those types get used by disinfo agents (see Linda Howe and her drone fiasco) but I think it's a stretch to think that Jones is actually on someone's payroll.

       If I were the NWO I would have a character like Alex Jones as my last line of defense.  If you've figured everything out already and I can't make you trust me, I can damn well scare you shitless.  Either way you're my slave.

       No. You have absolutely no idea what the NWO is. The NWO is "a bunch of bankers and bespectacled intelligence dorks in the G8 countries"? No, bankers are involved in the NWO yeah, but they're no way behind it in the slightest, they're just pawns.

      <p>
       I've lived here in China for a long time.  I can tell you without equivocation that there is NO control grid here.  None.  China doesn't even have phone books, much less a government database that keeps tabs on every citizen.  The infrastructure just doesn't exist.  All services here are prepaid because all people have to do to vanish completely is change their phone numbers and move.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also foreign banks are not allowed to operate inside Chinese borders.  Did you know that?  They know what's up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if Russia is part of a global elite why is the global elite trying so hard to surround them?

       Sorry Neo, if you believe everything Alex Jones says the matrix still has you.  The "global" elite is in fact only a financial elite and nothing more.  They're a bunch of liver-spotted old farts with a lot of influence.  Anything more is a fairy tale written to scare you.

       Initially, Jones was a god to this subreddit.  As time went on, it became more and more clear that much of what Jones had to say was either made up, or embellished to the point that it might as well have been made up.  To save face, conspiracy theorists began claiming that Jones was a disinformation agent.  It happens again and again; one person gets proved wrong, they're a DI plant.  A theory gets proved wrong, either the proof is a further conspiracy or simply move on to a new theory (I'm looking at you, thimerosol).

       Well that's one reason, but there's his whole over-the-top persona that makes it hard for most people to take him seriously or his blatant fear-mongering or his idiotic antics and distractions like the Obama-Joker stuff, his website is stuffed with ads for shit for you to buy, he's the "alternative media" gatekeeper that's successfully gathered a majority of the people that have begun to wake up, feeding them his watered-down, sanitized, dis/misinformation. He has consistently refused to discuss the Jesuits Order or Zionist involvement in political history (he doesn't even say anything about the Freemasons usually either).

       , Alex plays somewhat ignorant ("I don't believe the Jesuit Order runs everything"). Just check-out Bill Coopers stuff, he exposed Alex Jones and then look what happened to him, they took him out. He's just complete bullshit disinfo making out that it's the bilderbergers who run the world. He's simply doing what all disinfo agents do and that is protect the Vatican. His job is to feed the public anything they'll listen to, so long as the papacy remains protected.

       Not to mentioned he's been exposed throwing up the "gang signs" (as I call them), showing who he really has allegiance to.

       Why? What makes you think that? I think "the stuff" many of us believe is that yes one of the things they are preparing to do is to lock people up in camps, but I don't think anyone's claiming that's already happening in America. So how can you claim that we're wrong?

       Hitler Stalin and Mao are all pawns, they're not the people running the world, the Jesuit Order who put them into power are the ones running the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joseph Stalin was educated by Jesuit monks at Tiflis Seminary in Georgia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mao Se Tung was Jesuit-trained and put into power by a Jesuit priest (Tielhard de Chardin).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nazi regime was controlled by the Jesuits. Hitler came from a Roman Catholic family and praised the Jesuits in Mein Kampf. Hitler was brought to power by Franz von Papen, a Knight of Malta. Himmler (Head of Hitler's SS) was a Knight of Malta. Goebbels (Head of Hitler's Propaganda Ministry) was trained at a Jesuit college. Gehlen (Hitler's Intelligence Chief) was a Knight of Malta. Hitler's allies were almost exclusively Roman Catholic. They included Franco, who had many Opus Dei members in his government and who kissed the Pope's hand, and Mussolini, a Knight of Malta who was advised by a Jesuit priest. Another of his allies, Tiso, was a Roman Catholic Priest. Hitler's financiers (Abs and Thyssen) were Knights of Malta. Hitler said "Above all I have learned from the Jesuits. And so did Lenin too, as far as I recall. The world has never known anything quite so splendid as the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church. There were quite a few things I simply appropriated from the Jesuits for the Use of the [Nazi] Party." he also said "In [Heinrich] Himmler [who would become head of the Nazi SS] I see our Ignatius de Loyola [Founder of the Jesuits and the first Black Pope]".
      </p>
      <p>
       Communism was created by the Jesuits. Karl Marx was trained by Jesuits for nearly 30 years at the British Museum. Vladmir Lenin was trained by Jesuits in Geneva, Switzerland.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fidel Castro is an undercover Jesuit. He attended three Jesuit schools and went on to graduate from a Jesuit 'preparatory' university (Where his brother, Raul, also attended). From here, he went to law school. After graduating from law school, he joined the Christian Democrat Party, which was actually a Roman Catholic party that was founded under Pope Pius in the 1920s. Cuba is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic now, and Roman Catholics are allowed to join the 'atheist' Communist party. Alberto Rivera, the former Jesuit priest who came public (now dead), said that Castro is a 4th degree, professed Jesuit.

       Fr. De Chardin S.J. was working on behalf of the Vatican to implement Liberation Theology and a single Gaia based religion worldwide (i.e. the new age religion) to the exclusion of all others and promulgated the rise of Mao Tse-tung in China from 1929 in coordination with Fr. Pedro de Arrupe de Gondra S.J. then of Nagasaki Japan who both after the War were deployed by the Vatican, Fr. Arrupe to Rome and Fr. De Chardin to the New York Province of the Society of Jesus under Cardinal Spellman and Fr. Vincent O’Keefe S.J. of Fordham University.

       So therefore Teilhard de Chardin brought Mao to power. Brilliant. You win, then. I give up.

      <p>
       EDIT: Also, just so you know, Marx was a communist long before he ever set foot in the British Museum and met his alleged Jesuit teachers; heck, he wrote the fucking Communist Manifesto a year before he was forced to move to England.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, the idea that he (or Hitler or Stalin or Mao or any of the others you mention) was some sort of pawn of the Jesuits is laughable enough, but in this case you might at least want to make sure your goofball alternate history at least matches up with the basic facts of Marx's biography.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, granted, here in the conspiracy subreddit you might convince a few people with your bullshit, but you might want to keep this in mind in case you ever talk to anyone with actual knowledge of history.

I wasn't fooled by your foolish assertion, because I know

       Considering that one of the larger threats to the government is organised resistance (whether by force of arms or votes), then forums such as this only present a concern if they are enabling groups to organise IRL. Starting something similar to Anonymous' Scientology gatherings is what it takes to get noticed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also a subsidiary concern about mindshare, but I think contributors do a pretty good job of getting in each others way without any help.

       These ad-hominem attacks on Phelps are ridiculous and I can't believe people are still parroting them about. I didn't expect you would be spreading this crap too Xander.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Phelps's wife buys diamonds from an Israeli company, big deal, it doesn't prove that anything he says is wrong and Phelps implicates the Zionists anyway, so how does it make any sense that he's a "crypto-zionist"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I buy stuff from America, which is part of the conspiracy does that make me one of them too?
      </p>
      <p>
       You won't find many people better at exposing the conspiracy than Phelps, (I can only think of one myself).

       If you know of anyone better I'd sure like to know who.

        For any single person "exposing the conspiracy" that you name, I can find a bunch of lunatics on the web "exposing" that person as a crypto-zionist, jesuit, neo-nazi or Draconian shapeshifter.
       </p>

      <p>
       Maybe those lunatics as you call them are disinfo and are trying to throw people off listening to the people actually exposing conspiracy, have you ever thought of that?

        This labelling of people as "disinfo" is mentally unhealthy and not conducive to education or development.

      <p>
       The people that are disinfo need to pointed out and exposed, if we are to make any progress in waking people up, if you don't agree with that I can only conclude that you must want people to be mislead.
