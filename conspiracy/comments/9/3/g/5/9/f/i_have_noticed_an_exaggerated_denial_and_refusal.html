<p>”our tendency to share other people’s opinions without arguing our own beliefs, combined with a decrease in willingness to hear those of others is seriously damaging our ability to discover new truths that are <em>not colored and tailored by an existing paradigm through which to see the world..</em> This is what ideology is: a paradigm that explains and offers solutions to everything <em>from a certain perspective.</em> It is different from an opinion: an opinion is a particular idea or vision on a certain topic.”  —From link in your comment. </p>

<p>Having some difficulty understanding “ideological possession.”  It is discussed in the link but not defined for “dummies” (non philosophy savvy ppl).  But, I think I got a bit of understanding when I saw virtuous ideas being exploited for political gain (“a certain perspective”) and destabilization of society —like Black Lives Matter.  What’s more worthy of promotion than social justice?  Until you see the nefarious object is not improvement but chaos.  I think I recognize it in the young women “resisting” with their pink hats but are unable to articulate what they are protesting.  Can you clarify further? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more when you define yourself so completely by your causes that you can&#39;t even consider another opinion.  It&#39;s when your politics become your identity, and any attack on your politics becomes an attack on you.  For anti Trump people, if he does something good, they cannot let themselves admit it because they see, psychologically, as a game.  And if Trump gets a point, he&#39;s beating <em>them</em> and not countering their platform.  It becomes personal.  People who lead with emotion are not using their whole brains.  You can&#39;t think clearly when you&#39;re seeing red.  Both sides do it on the fringes.  I used to be on the fringes of the left.  I was red-pilled by Trump&#39;s win.  I then removed myself from social media for the better part of 6 months and recovered my sanity, and can now observe politics without being emotionally damaged.</p>

<p>But the real question is why are conservatives wearing underwear in the first place?  (Get it?  Because humans didn&#39;t used to have underwear 100,000 years ago.).  I guess all the conservatives are really liberals.  Damn, and some of them even drive cars -- just vote democrat for them, they are obviously lib.  </p>

You hit it with everything modern medicine has: radical mastectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy. Seems to help for a while, but the cancer returns. Chemo, chemo, chemo but it&#39;s metastasized to her bones. Leukemia. There&#39;s nothing more you can do. She dies before the age of 43.</p>

<p>If you face the truth... you murdered your wife, in one of the cruelest ways possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This may be true, to an extent.  There are pieces of conspiracies that are not well documented. And one can say, hmmmm?  But there are others with expert opinions or scientific papers presented.  Many users are experts in their fields and lend valuable context to questioning narratives. Not that they can disclose their credentials here. I think about one sandy hook investigator that was a safety expert, for example,  and questioned several irregular processes in how it was handled.  He is on YT. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I experience this myself. I evaluate data from a number of sources, for example about 9/11, or the Las Vegas shooting and despite the feeling that the mainstream narratives are not true - I seem to hold the idea that they are true and that they are untrue simultaneously. I think this is because of the implications. If for example - 9/11 was orchestrated by US and Israeli intelligence services to manufacture consent for Mideast wars - and at the expense of human life - I should be doing something about it. And yet I go to work, pay my taxes (funding future operations) watch some TV and browse Reddit. I am apparently okay with trading liberty for peace and comfort.</p>

<p>But if you look at other countries, citizens are not somehow castrated from connecting these dots and protesting to defend themselves.  I remember and like Iceland (?) removed their Prime Minister for being implicated in that huge money scheme that implicated almost all wealthy worldwide. Nobody else reacted. The whistleblowers were incredulous.  I remember Assange assuring that HC would go to prison. So much garbage has been exposed about that corruption, and she probably still has security clearance. It’s just beyond normal. Why is this happening ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure how that fits in (Iceland population).</p>

<p>But, you can contemplate and even accept it <em>may be true</em> we live in a world with ppl that are so evil as to put the country through 9/11 while pretending to be upstanding citizens. You also recognize your lack of ability to respond in any coherent, effective or civic manner to the information.  These are worrisome problems and need to be discussed as well. But It’s different than responding with aggressive, angry denials and avoiding even discussing the possibilities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When there is no evidence to support the claims, they are difficult to buy.</p>

<p>The truth is most conspiracy theorists are blogs making shit up to capture an audience and have nothing really concrete to back up their claims.</p>

<p>The &quot;MSM&quot; at least has standards and they have journalistic ethics and hard news, like long form investigative newspaper journalism is required to have sources and corroboration and that evidence is reviewable by the readers.  They cant publish without it.  There&#39;s a legal liability if they do even when they have hard evidence  The critical thinker can see that evidence and determine for themselves if the narrative of the author is properly representing that information.  The thing is most people have no critical thinking skills anymore and news is simply entertainment targeted to drive clicks and deliver advertising.  The lines between opinion/commentary and hard news are so blurry they hardly even exist in the cable/tv/internet space.  Newspapers are no longer profitable and context no longer matters, only the soundbite holds any weight.  Our disposable culture has us more interested in Khloe Kardashian than extrajudicial activities related to ICE enforcement.  Everyones so drowned out by the tonnage of shit that hits their consciousness on a daily basis that they no longer have an attention span that extends beyond the next 24 hours.  People are so tuned out that only 50% of the people who can vote decide to show up.  They just want to get what&#39;s theirs and we&#39;ve been so turned around we&#39;ve turned other Americans into the enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I can see this —an identity and self worth that is dependent on believing the world is as it is presented. But I don’t understand it. How can acknowledging the lies imply the deceived are less of who they are?  It should validate their intuition and critical thinking that they were able to see through it. But they fight it instead.  </p>
