      <h1>
       Why is the Nephilim (Giants) hidden from modern day archaeology &amp; history?
      </h1>
      <h1>
       The Nephilim /ˈnɛfɪˌlɪm/ (Hebrew: נְפִילִים‬, nefilim) were the offspring of the "sons of God" and the "daughters of men" before the Deluge, according to Genesis 6:1–4.
      </h1>
      <p>
       When people began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them, the
       <strong>
        sons of God
       </strong>
       saw that they were fair; and they took wives for themselves of all that they chose. Then the Lord said, “My spirit shall not abide in mortals forever, for they are flesh; their days shall be one hundred twenty years.” The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went in to the daughters of humans, who bore children to them. These were the heroes that were of old, warriors of renown.
      </p>
      <p>
       — Genesis 6:1–4, New Revised Standard Version
      </p>
      <p>
       The story of the Nephilim is further elaborated in the
       <strong>
        Book of Enoch
       </strong>
       . The Greek, Aramaic, and main Ge'ez manuscripts of 1 Enoch and Jubilees obtained in the 19th century and held in the British Museum and Vatican Library, connect the origin of the Nephilim with the
       <strong>
        fallen angels
       </strong>
       , and in particular with the egrḗgoroi (watchers). Samyaza, an angel of high rank, is described as leading a rebel sect of angels in a descent to earth to have sexual intercourse with human females:
      </p>
      <p>
       And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: "Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children." And Semjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: "I fear ye will not indeed agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin." And they all answered him and said: "Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this thing." Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it. And they were in all two hundred; who descended in the days of Jared on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they had sworn and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it ...
      </p>
      <p>
       In this tradition, the children of the Nephilim are called the Elioud, who are considered a separate race from the Nephilim, but they share the fate of the Nephilim.

       ANNUNAKI
      </h1>
      <p>
       In his 1976 book The Twelfth Planet, Russian-American author Zecharia Sitchin claimed that the
       <strong>
        Anunnaki
       </strong>
       were actually a race of extraterrestrial beings from the undiscovered planet Nibiru, who came to Earth around 500,000 years ago in order to mine gold. According to Sitchin, the Anunnaki genetically engineered homo erectus to create modern humans to work as their slaves. Sitchin claimed that the Anunnaki were forced to leave Earth when Antarctic glaciers melted, causing the Flood of Noah, which also destroyed the Anunnaki's bases on Earth. These had to be rebuilt and the
       <strong>
        Nephilim
       </strong>
       , needing more humans to help in this massive effort, taught them agriculture. Ronald H. Fritze writes that, according to Sitchin, "the Annunaki built the pyramids and all the other monumental structures from around the world that ancient astronaut theorists consider so impossible to build without highly advanced technologies." Sitchin also claimed that the Anunnaki had left behind human-alien hybrids, some of whom may still be alive today, unaware of their alien ancestry. Sitchin expanded on this mythology in later works, including The Stairway to Heaven (1980) and The Wars of Gods and Men (1985). In The End of Days: Armageddon and the Prophecy of the Return (2007), Sitchin predicted that the
       <strong>
        Anunnaki would return to earth
       </strong>
       ...

       Are these just Conspiracy Theories or are they reality? If they're reality, why is it being covered up -- especially when it would prove the existence of GOD or even extra-terrestrials IMO.

       Can any learned legend clarify something thats been bothering me lately as i dig deeper into the whole Annunaki/Nephilim sagas and perhaps straight up history?
      </p>
      <p>
       In particular the distinction of Marduk, as he is both a specific Annunaki figure
       <em>
        from
       </em>
       Nibiru yet is also referred to
       <em>
        as
       </em>
       Nibiru...not to mention Mars and Jupiter but thats another story so yeah...what is the go there? Even Sitchin references him both as the planet that destroys Tiamat and as the Annunaki figure from the planet itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if ones a literal representation and the other a fable, then which is which? Sorry if this sounds rambling and doesnt make sense I gotta look this stuff up more when im not stoned lol...

     <div class="md">
      <p>
       With regards to Annunaki, Nephilim &amp; Bible, here's my conjecture from what I've learned &amp; pieced together:
      </p>
      <p>
       Anu, the leader of the Annunaki, is the father of Enki &amp; Enlil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enki came to Earth to mine Gold that was needed to repair the atmosphere of their home planet Nibiru.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enki created Man to help mine the Gold, so technically he can be considered the God in the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some Annunaki under the command of  Enki must be Fallen Angels that taught man &amp; slept with the Daughters of Man to create Nephilim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enlil was sent by Anu to punish Enki for creating man &amp; to destroy the Nephilim &amp; Man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enki helped save some men (such as Noah).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Enlil ruled over Man as their God.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to make sense of this, the final Christian Bible may be a combination of 3 entities into 1 (ie Father, Son &amp; Holy Spirit = Trinity).
      </p>
      <p>
       ---------------------------
      </p>
      <p>
       OR even more blasphemous:
      </p>
      <p>
       Enlil threw Enki out of Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enki was punished for disobeying his father Anu -- leader of the Annunaki.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would imply that Enki is now Satan in the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christian's God is Enlil, while Islam's God is Enki?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Annunaki will return one day to make things right or enslave us?
      </p>
      <p>
       ---------------------------
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the Bible &amp; Annunaki are most likely completely unrelated.

       That's Stitchen's version. In my understanding, it was Enlil that sent 'the flood' to wipe out the undesirables that Enki created without approval from Anu.

       I'm not going along with everything Stitchen said about the Annunaki. They wanted to mine more &amp; faster to save the dying atmosphere on their planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       They most likely had superior tools based on the Ancient Structures they left behind that they created with what was available on Earth. Some of these structures that we can't duplicate with our own modern tools today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enki is the Sumerian god of water, knowledge, mischief, crafts, &amp; creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wasn't supposed to create Man to help. When the Anu found out about this, he sent Enlil to clean up Enki's mess.

       Not familiar with the Sumerian sources, but your attempts to line them up with Christian ideas do not work historically (history of ideas) speaking.  The Old Testament was edited into a whole around 600BC, by exiles to Babylon.  The Bible stories you are trying to line up were deliberately written to have these NOT line up.   Babylonian accounts have all these deities, but the Jewish account has precisely 1 deity who was responsible for both Creation and the Flood and for saving righteous men.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding Satan, his opposite in Jewish traditions is Michael, who is not the creator, but the commander of heaven's armies. So if you want to line up Enlil and Enki, you can do that very speculatively, but in Jewish traditions, many of the deeds are taken away from them and put on the One God.  Trinity meanwhile is a 1st century development and does not unify these already divergent accounts.

       Ancient Mesopotamian religion was practiced in the civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia, particularly Sumer, Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia from 3500 BC before Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many biblical stories that are today found in Judaism, Christianity &amp; Islam were possibly based upon earlier Mesopotamian myths, in particular that of the Creation, Garden of Eden, Great Flood, Tower of Babel, figures such as Nimrod &amp; Lilith and the Book of Esther.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's most likely lots of lost knowledge &amp; history that predates Ancient Mesopotamian religion too that was only passed down by spoken word IMO.

       I was referring specifically to the matching of Sumerian gods with Jewish/Christian entities.  It does not work because God subsumes the role of all the gods.  The other elements of the story sure they can correspond.

       Well it does make sense that ancient man would worship or treat Fallen Angels &amp; Nephilim like gods. One god like Anu or Enki or Enlil could've assumed control over humans &amp; eliminated all other deities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exodus 20:3
You shall have no other gods before Me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exodus 20:5
You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on their children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would GOD be jealous of other gods &amp; deities if they didn't actually exist, don't exist &amp; it's only him?
The 'iniquity' means that of the 'Fallen Angel' fathers who passed it on to their progeny who were taught to hate God IMO.
Finally, how could 'Satan' feel confident enough to start a rebellion &amp; set his throne above 'the most high', if God was all powerful? Why would other Fallen Angels follow him too against a God they could never defeat? It makes no sense IMO.

       Good point. The Igigi could be like the Nephilim or even the Fallen Angels themselves.

       I don't buy Sitchin's interpretation.  The simple explanation is that Marduk and Nibiru and all these others are planets with multiple names each, just as we know Jupiter and Zeus are the same.  I don't remember which is which.

       As far as I know Christians are doing everything to hide or erase Nephilims from the bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was raised as presbyterian fundamentalist, was Christian for decades. Churches don't teach about titans in the bible, never mention them, if they bump into the Nephilim part, they just ignore it and pretend the verse doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I ask about Nephilims, they answer it's a metaphor for Angels, not actual titans.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never heard any Christians admit the existence of Titans in the bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's not just TPTB, Churches don't want us to know the truth.

       What if that was the original sin? Aliens getting it on with humans that collaborated with mankind's enslavers. The snake, Set/Satan, the forbidden fruit, Rh factor. The garden was an allegory, but figuratively true, perhaps.

       I have always been taught about the nephilim and the giants in the Bible you cannot ignore any part of the Bible how else would one read the description of Og of Bashan and that bed and David and Goliath. My church doesn’t shy away from it either however my pastor has a different take on how the appearance of angel human hybrids come back in the end times which seems biblical when researching.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a Christian the whole story of the Nirubu other planet visitor theory is not something I follow. However I do know my pastor and my grandpa who is 85 (he has spent every day in the Word his whole adult life) they both teach about ancient mythological beings and how they were fallen ones and nephilim.

       Thanks will check it out for sure it’s funny I have said it before but my pastor has a whole sermon about the idea of a conspiracy and why there are CTs It was a real eye opened because I have been a huge truth seeker I have never went down a rabbit hole that wasn’t in some way confirmed or proven by the Bible. The one I am working on now is this whole quantum computer AI singularity idea see a few links in Revelation already but maybe this video will have an answer of two that might help.

       It definitely makes sense that the Fallen Angels, Nephilim &amp; Elioud are the ancient mythological beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in ancient mythology, they weren't all considered evil. In fact, many of them were helpful to man, while in the Bible &amp; Book of Enoch, they seem to be portrayed as mostly evil IMO.

       I come across so many beliefs in CT forums honestly it has strengthened my faith I never knew so many distortions of the Bible were out there and I had no clue there were so many offshoots like anti Pauline or Gnostics and serpent seed and so on but Christians should seek truth and in this day and age the first place is the Bible and the next places like this.

       Well that one was possibly off then. of course, Artemis's brother Apollo was the one who bore the godhood of the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       They called him the shining one...
      </p>
      <p>
       Amaterasu's name comes from amateru, which means "Shining in Heaven"
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know the etymology of the word Annunaki?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Sons of the Shining One"  the name Anu, the Sumerian god of the sun, meant "the shining one".
      </p>
      <p>
       And in the Egyptian book of the dead we see:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Oh Ra (2) who art shining this night : if there be any one among 
thy followers, let him present himself living as a follower of Thoth"
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the sun shine's in the night through the agency of the moon god.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then later:
      </p>
      <p>
       "BOOK OF THE DEAD. 283

      <p>
       The storm of the sky which raises the god,

       Based on mythology, Cronus was a Titan (or Nephilim as you imply) &amp; Zeus (an  Elioud) was his son that he didn't eat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree that "the most high" in Genesis, Creator God is Cronus because who are the Fallen Angels then?

       The Annunaki may be where the Fallen Angels came from IMO.

       Maybe. Probably. I've not been down this rabbit hole in almost a year. But honestly its everywhere and we just don't see it. There was a Vatican translator that asserted that an honest translation of genesis is actually depicting the genetic engineering of the human species.

       I haven't read it all but at first glance, another Conspiracy Theory pops up:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Japanese-Jewish common ancestry theory (JJCAT)
       </p>
       <p>
        The first Japanese-Jewish common ancestry theory was not the brainchild of a Japanese or a Jew but of a Scot named Norman McLeod ... McLeod explained that he was publishing the present volume in anticipation of that magnum opus, which would improve upon Kaempfer's work by giving "a more accurate and detailed account of the origin of the Japanese, with a description of their Jewish belongings."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Engelbert Kaempfer was a "
       <strong>
        German"
       </strong>
       naturalist, physician, and explorer writer known for his tour of Russia, Persia, India, South-East Asia, and Japan between 1683 and 1693.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that was the case, why would the Nazis that were also into occult things, paranormal &amp; conspiracy theories, ally with Japan in World War 2, while also committing "The Holocaust" against Jews? It makes no sense IMO.

       Also, keep in mind, the narrative has been fragmented, over the span of 5 millennia. It can't be exact, because much has been lost, and meaning is constantly in metamorphosis. There are distortions, but there are also so many resonances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look to the Dogon, to the worshipers of Dagon with their mitre hats, the Djinn of middle eastern myth, Jainist southern asia, Diana of the wild beasts, Dragons of the far east.
      </p>

       One story, one language, fragmented by space and time. There are even traces in the Ancient Mayan religion.

       The PTB clearly don't want to encourage any form of a  belief in God or in the possibility of any extra-terrestrials, no matter what amount of evidence turns-up in their favour.

       May not make sense to you but they very clearly do.
      </p>
      <p>
       A belief in God is a belief in a higher power than theirs and divine retribution for sins committed and a need for moral and ethical behavior on the part of the believers in order to avoid that.

       See this is where I lose the logic though. If there is a god, and he is a higher power and capable of divine retribution, and their whole game is to stop us from knowing that.. why don't they fear that divine retribution? You're pushing that they know there's divine retribution, but are completely cool with whatever it is they'll face after death because their power here and now is more important than whatever they'll face FOREVER.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either God isn't a higher power capable of divine retribution, or this theory is shot in the foot from jump. It's highly irrational. Same with the Alien angle, if they know Aliens are real and we have no effective ways of dealing with them, why handcuff themselves by limiting the knowledge pool (keeping people in the dark) and having to  secretly carry out tests? It seems counter-active tbh unless the end game is just to stay in decadence till the invasion, not to ever try and stop it. Thats the only thing that makes Aliens more plausible than God for me..people would fear eternal retribution more than just being wiped out.

       They know it and they hate it. Many are in fact Satanists and Luciferians who've sold their souls in no uncertain terms and allied themselves with dark and evil forces that they also believe in and they'd rather you didn't know about.

       That's the higher power they worship because the gains they see from it are NOW in this life... power, wealth, fame, and any selfish pleasures no matter how vile or reprehensible their utterly corrupt and blackened hearts desire.

       But people can behave in a moral and ethical manner without a belief in God.  If a belief in God is the only reason one behaves morally and ethically, then there are more serious issues.

       Virtually all moral and ethical precepts have their roots in religion with the idea that looking out for and taking care of one another is what God has ordained and is most pleased by instead of simply and selfishly looking out for yourself and Devil take the hindmost.
      </p>
      <p>
       People can behave in a moral and ethical manner without having any religious convictions that prompt them to but they are few and far between and the rewards for the behavior are intrinsic not material... and as we know only too well, there are significant and often huge rewards for immoral and unethical behavior if you are rich and well-connected enough to other equally unscrupulous people to get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Society itself is big on punishing immoral and unethical behavior but otherwise does very little to actively encourage, promote, or reward the best examples of it when it occurs.

       Could moral and ethical behavior come from the family unit?  I recall reading that humans would form into groups of about 30 to 60 people, who are related.

       Ideally, the most important feature of any normal and healthy family life and arrangement would quite simply be it's members natural love, affection, and caring for one another and by extension caring for others outside of the family. If we define ethics as an honest effort to be respectful, considerate and fair to one another in general that's the most likely place for it to start.

       Most people need some sense of belonging or a reasonable facsimile of belonging to some kind of group or others that they can readily identify with. That comes in a lot of different forms. Religions do it for some.

       Don't mean to split hairs here, you obviously have some thought invested here, and well-spoken by the way. But moving from end to beginning of that last, followers of Christ I know, (myself included), claim no authority of our own. I'm talking regular joe up to the pastor. Having said that, I go to a church that barely survives, supports a couple of missionary families, and is self supporting. Secondly, truly following Jesus in my opinion has to do with the belief in his teachings; that the Holy Spirit of God is with us and guides us in tumultuous times of right/wrong decision making. That the "right" thing to do is done simply because it is right, and has nothing to do with the avoidance of hell.

       I think churches being tax exempt is bullshit, so many megachurches that are basically big businesses actually tell people how to vote. If you are trying to tell people how to vote you have to pay taxes. I'd rather people find themselves spiritually on their own than be told how to by a book rewritten by man over and over again and it many cases just being a form of social control. TPTB want you to believe in a god that was completely fabricated to keep you thinking inside the box, the way they want, dont think for yourself just believe this book I wrote.... errr i mean god wrote yeah...

       In order to be tax exempt they must incorporate as a businesses. So in reality they really aren't "churches" in any true sense or separate from the state that will tax them if they don't incorporate, instead of it being the other way around.

       You can't be serious.  State-approved religions are a great way to control people.  Outside of some possibly allegorical references to Rome, the New Testament barely touches on citizenship and when it does encourages obedience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protestant Christianity especially is a very inwardly-focusing faith, despite the heavily-Nationalistic brand we have in the US now, it still encourages peace and focus on the state of the soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comment completely disregards the multitudes of examples of the state or various ruling bodies leveraging faith to sway huge parts of the population for things like imperialism.

       The state and organised religion are merely two of any number of devices used to control a generally confused, deliberately misinformed and divided public and in keeping it that way and they were both subverted and co-opted for that purpose almost right from the very get-go.
      </p>
      <p>
       But like it or not the dominant and real philosophy in American society certainly isn't any religious one. It's abject "Materialism" with selfishness, greed, and extravagant and excessive lifestyles constantly being praised and promoted as if they were virtues.
      </p>
      <p>
       To that you can add the atheism of scientific materialism that basically reintroduced the wholly discredited philosophy of Materialism by the back door and is the only smart, modern and sophisticated way to look at life or anything else according to all of your educational institutions and the media... and the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Christianity encouraging peace or any focus on the state of one's soul that certainly doesn't jive with a nation that spends more on making war and the weapons of war than the rest of the world, friend or foe, all put together. A nation that has caused the deaths of at least 25 million people outside of it's own borders since the end of WWII.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also plenty of regular church going Christians who have any number of excuses for their own involvement in that.

       Who are exactly "they" in a country that's 80% Christian and boasts the strongest religious presence in the entire western world? A bunch of a-religious suits? Some overly-strong faction of non-christian religious? Actual devil-worshipers?
      </p>
      <p>
       From a power/money perspective, revealing something like this as the "truth" would MASSIVELY boost the influence of whatever group that revealed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we imply that "they" know it's real and fear the rise of true faith: doesn't that already reveal that they're beyond caring anyway, seeing as they'd _stop being meanies if they knew God was real and feared the consequences_? Positing a full-blown Luciferian conspiracy - boasting "honest-to-god" devil worshipers that don't fear hell whatsoever - you'd think they'd find a way to reveal the truth of annunaki AND exploit it to its most grotesque expression.

       That doesn't make sense to because suppose the Canaanite god Moloch associated with child sacrifice is real, all that sacrifice &amp; worship proved to be in vain &amp; futile because look at his old proving grounds now -- it is in utter ruins. The worshipers clearly were shafted.

       Also, the Nephilim were offspring of rebellious Fallen Angels that most likely forced themselves on daughters of man &amp; most likely died giving birth to giants too. They're the bad guys. The bad guys lost. What a glorious history for humans to have defeated giants right? Or maybe God eliminated the bad guys for us -- which is also good news. This is all only bad news for the bad guys IMO.

       We've literally got hundreds of years worth of history where the words of a man who explicitly said " you are all one in Christ Jesus" in a statement of inclusion, have been used for the extermination/subjugation of other human beings.  We've got dudes at this very moment using Jesus - a man who eschewed wealth, is on record vilifying it - to push the claim that "God wants all'a y'all to be filthy rich": and they're making millions doing it.

       There's a non-insignificant part of humanity as a whole that clearly doesn't read to much into their respective religious documents. Any group powerful enough to supposedly
       <em>
        work ceaselessly and globally to prevent even grassroots movements from so much as digging up a bone in their back yard
       </em>
       should be more than capable of messing with whatever message the "truth" would bring.

       There's many ways to interpret the Truth. 
With regards to children, I think they become what we teach them &amp; show by example. Children aren't born to hate &amp; be racists. Go to any playground with babies &amp; toddlers, you'll see they all play together -- unless they have other issues. 
Also, as another example, should we eliminate all Pitbulls because they will always grow up to be bad &amp; hurt people? Or can they be raised to be loving too?
Usually, I think it's GREED &amp; FEAR that drives people to act bad.

       Based on Conspiracy Theories that I've heard of the Nephilim, they're giants with fair skin, have 6 fingers, 6 toes &amp; red hair. Are all 'red heads' evil in your opinion? I've never met any giants with multiple digits. Also, when men couldn't feed them anymore because they ran out of resources, the Nephilim started eating people like cannibals. Well Satan is considered the great 'deceiver' &amp; 'accuser' for the purposes of dethroning God.

       I also think that GOD's true words could've been twisted &amp; corrupted by man. How can we tell when even the Book of Enoch is a forbidden book &amp; not accepted by main stream Christianity -- especially the Catholic Church?

       Enoch isn't forbidden, it's just not considered canon. No one considers it blasphemous except for maybe some of the Jewish sects.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is only one direct reference to Enoch in the rest of the canon texts, and this reference is often disregarded as the part of Enoch that is referenced is believed in of itself to be a reference to Deuteronomy

       You're right. I think Book of Enoch was not included because there's references to "Lord of Spirits" &amp; "Son of Man" that makes things confusing IMO.

       Tanit was the child sacrifice goddess I think. Moloch was a title meaning "messenger" or "angel". The biblical hebrew term is MLKYHWH (Angel of God or Messenger of God). Some have also translated it as "King Yahweh".

       Buzz Aldrin was in Antarctica &amp; he was medically evacuated right around the same time they discovered the Antarctica Pyramid &amp; the "Ark of Gabriel" was discovered &amp; transported to Antarctica too. They're just a bunch of Conspiracy Theories on top of Conspiracy Theories that can be connected by strange coincidences IMO.

       If you accept that dinosaurs once roamed the earth until they were wiped out 166 million years ago, you would have to ask how anyone could reconcile this with the 7 day theory as well as megaliths and ancient structures like Gobekli Tepe which is confirmed at 11,000 years old.

       7 day theory could be a 'metaphor'.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting that you mention megaliths &amp; ancient structures because we can't duplicate many of them today even with modern tools.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it is that you can believe in God(s) &amp; also believe in scientific methods. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because there's many things that science can't explain perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So scientists do their best to try to understand &amp; even re-create God's work but every time they fail, they realize that there's something more at play that is beyond their understanding through scientific method.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientists have recently discovered the 'God particle', 'antimatter', mapped the human genome &amp; 1000 years from know, maybe we too can create things like Annunaki or Gods.

       There are plenty of conspiracies which have been proven to be true, but they are still called conspircy theories though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say in 15 years some team like wikileaks releases documents, pictures, locations of dig sites, and all the possible info to prove that there really were giant humans 1000's of years ago. It'd still be a conspircy theory. There would just be evidence to back up those claims. Same as the US government poisoning alcohol during prohibition. thers plenty of proof of that, still called a conspiracy theory though.

       Also 36 feet is just ridiculous. The tallest human ever recorded was
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wadlow">
        Robert Wadlow
       </a>
       at 8ft 11.1 inches. He had trouble standing on his own, had little no feeling in his legs and feet, and died by age 22.

       It would do your research a lot better to go through sitchin’s work and look at his works cited. He gives nothing useful to show where exactly he got and his interpretations from. Like which scroll/page number, which is standard for others wanting to follow up on his work. Very disappointing when you see how concrete he presents his work but hides the exact places he got that info. Tread w caution

       Anything that supports the biblical narrative will be suppressed and twisted by the god (small g) of this world.  That includes evidence of giants and biblical cosmology.  If it weren't this mass deception there would be no such thing as agnostics, nihilists, and atheists.

       I remember being intrigued by Sitchin's translations. They seemed to tie in with my biblical understandings at the time. But ... other scholars dispute those translations, and some parts of Sitchin's translations don't seem logical to me.

       E.g The mining of gold. Is it not safe to assume that a society with the capacity for interplanetary or interstellar travel would have easier ways to get some gold? Flying to another planet and creating an enslaved race of people seems like a lot more work than scanning asteroids until you found one
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/433_Eros">
        like this
       </a>
       which contains an estimated 20 million tons of gold.
      </p>
      <p>
       If labor was the issue and if these guys had the capability to bio-engineer a humanoid to work on this planet, couldn't they also bio-engineer a humanoid suited to working on an asteroid? The ore concentration would be magnitudes higher. It would take less time and labor to mine the asteroid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or if there was some reason they couldn't do that, why not crash the asteroid into the planet and mine it here?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why dig tunnels into the earth and miss some of the richest gold deposits on the surface? Read up on gold rushes through history. People found places where they were tripping over lumps of gold. Why not go after the easier deposits first?
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't make sense to me.

       Sitchin is full of shit. But that doesn't factor in really. Book of Enoch is still canon in Ethiopian Orthodox church. It's a trippy read too!
Sitchin can't translate Sumerian though, does a lot of guessing and relie heavily on his hebrew school lessons. These days there are more complete and understanding scholars of sumeriam cuneiform who basically just shake their heads at Sitchin's shitty "translations".

       CHECK. OUT. DR. MICHAEL. HEISER.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is quite the scholar and dispels the idea that Zacharia Sitchin's translations are legitimate. Dr. Heiser does acknowledge the idea the giants existed and uses the Hebrew scriptures to back it up. He also agrees with the Hebrew scriptures on where the giants came from, fallen angels.
      </p>
      <p>
       IHMO: The "Ancient Alien/Annunaki" theory is correct in the context of other human-oid beings that appear to have been altered but is completely wrong on why it happened and that its all for our own good. They are conditioning us to believe that Aliens are our Gods and the truth is...they aren't. In order to really grasp this concept I would suggest you look into (Tom Horn, Rob Skiba, and NYSTV).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a nutshell:
      </p>
      <p>
       God (YHWH) created all things, including angels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Angels rebelled against God and created a subset of humans (Genesis 6).
      </p>
      <p>
       These offspring were half angel/half human and as were never supposed to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the Israelite's are commanded to kill certain people, they were descendants of this evil experiment (read 1Enoch and Genesis).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the giants were killed off their spirits were "wandering" which is where demons/evil spirits come from.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the pagan gods are really the same entities (Fallen angels and their offspring) just talked about from different perspectives/cultures. (check out Rob Skiba)
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest reason in keeping these things secret is because it throws the idea of evolution (in the scientific sense) out the window. When you study this enough you will also come across the idea of flat earth. Yes, there are crazy flat-earthers but Dr. Michael Heiser does indeed admit that the Hebrew writings describe our cosmology as Geocentric and yes, enclosed/flat. This in and of itself is very polarizing but if people knew the truth they would understand that there is a creator and he is the God of Israel, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  Imagine the way our governmental laws and societal structures would fall apart if they knew that we lived in a huge terrarium. Yes, God is that close and we are still living out his final plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of our current situation is the end result of this angelic sin and the sins of Adam and Eve. God (YHWH) is trying to restore things back to the way they were supposed to be. Read the bible and get saved.

       I doubt there's going to be any real giant skeletons available for viewing &amp; testing that are over 9 feet in height.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I wonder how many archaeological skeleton finds would be in the 'unidentified' or 'questionable' based on existing matching methods?
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than the old skeletons, I'm more interested in  'The Kandahar Giant' conspiracy theory because it's about U.S. soldiers fighting &amp; taking a 12' - 15' red haired with 6 digits giant in Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's conspiracy theories about very tall super soldiers. Are they or have they weaponized giants for war?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they found the 'Fallen Angels' in Antarctica, they may want to control them, use them, or even weaponize them too IMO.

       Suppose ancients had iPhones 10,000 years ago, would they survive for us to examine today or would they be dust &amp; gone without a trace? Do you think your iPhone will last 10,000 years outside?
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't even replicate some of the megalithic structures today. We've tried replicating smaller models the way they supposedly made them but failed, resorting to using modern tools &amp; failing again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the megalithic stones used weigh as much as 1,000 tons. Modern engineers have said that they have no idea how the stones were moved, much less placed with such precision.

       This is my understanding as well. Angels (fallen or otherwise) are spirits - or better yet, inter-dimensional beings - and can take on  physical form similar to ours. Like the two angels that went to Sodom (Gen. 19) seem to be the size of normal humans, although far more beautiful.

       Maybe 'unicorns' &amp; 'dragons' are metaphors?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, when I refer to 'unicorns' or the image in my cover photo, I'm talking about the 'perfect girl':
      </p>
      <p>
       That girl that you can't catch. Everything about her is so perfect (divine, if you will) getting with her is unfathomable. She is truly a blessing from God. LOL ;p

      <p>
       God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Numbers 24:8
      </p>
      <p>
       God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deuteronomy 33:17
      </p>
      <p>
       His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Job 39:9-12
      </p>
      <p>
       Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
      </p>
      <p>
       Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?
      </p>
      <p>
       Psalm 22:21
      </p>
      <p>
       Save me from the lion’s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psalm 29:6
      </p>
      <p>
       He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psalm 92:10
      </p>
      <p>
       But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isaiah 34:7
      </p>
      <p>
       And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
      </p>

       It's not entirely implausible that if Annunaki created men, they would've experimented more, created more, and messed around by  mixing &amp; matching existing creatures creating chimeras.
I'm sure if our medical scientists got the green light, they too would be trying all sorts of crazy things IMO.

       Unicorn is found in the KJV. More recent translations use 'wild ox'.
My Stong's Concordance gives the word 'wild bull'.

       If the Annunaki had the technology to come here from another planet, how could a rise in sea level destroy everything and force them to leave.  That makes zero sense.

       Idt you even know what trolling is. He started a discussion and i gave an opinion. You just dont like people saying things you dont agree with. Get over it. Op is the type to worship some disinfo shill and quote him like the creator of the universe himself said it

       Ironic you say that considering conspiracy theorists main goal is to change the world by revealing the truth about one thing or another. And no, nobody will ever take this sub seriously when this is the shit this gets voted to the top. "12 foot giant fighting for iran military" my friends and i are all conspiracy theorists but i would instantly never take anything you say seriously

       Do you believe that the Fallen Angels are trapped beneath the ice of Antartica.

      <p>
       Watching the first transformer movie and Megatron is trapped under the ice, and in the other movies "The Fallen" and pretty much all the movies have many symbolisms. The cube that sparks a war could allude to the cube of saturn many interesting things in those films.

       You say that as a joke, but there's a theory that the story of Odin killing the Giants is actually a retelling of the true story of Woden (Odin) killing a group of Nephilim shortly after arriving in Northern Europe.

       I've never heard about Nephilim shifting &amp; invisibility? I've heard of Reptilian shapeshifters &amp; entities from other dimensions may have such powers too -- especially if they are projections. 
Now that you mention it, it makes sense why there's a Conspiracy Theory of The Kandahar Giant with soldiers being told 'weapons high'. If Nephilim's bodies were more resistant to bullets &amp; the only way to kill them effectively was to shoot for their head but they could cloak or disguise themselves ...
      </p>
      <p>
       "They kept telling us to keep our weapons high, which normally means it’s two to the chest, one to the head, but they kept telling us to put it towards a man’s head, and put it higher. So we would question, why would they want us to shoot higher than a man’s head?"

       You should check out the book  Encyclopedia of Giants in North America.  Its pretty much just newspaper articles about giants being discovered across the US.   Creepy as hell.   There were so many reportings.

       You're right. Also, there's Native American myths about cannibalistic giants that they fought.

       I wish there was more info on denisovians.   Check them out. Not a lot out there but my theory is the giants were actually denisovians or something along the line of that species. The tooth they found is huge

       That's definitely very possible. At the very least, they were genetically watered down progeny of Nephilim &amp; Elioud.

       There were giants in Greek, Norse religions, and in old wives tales in Scotland... some of the Scottish hillforts, which scientists and anthropologists of course don't know hot to replicate, were said to be the shelters or "cow pins" of these giants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in the Odyssey, Odysseus and his crew narrowly escape a giant.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's incredibly likely there were giants, even if they were just 15-20 feet. All our ancient and long respected sources talk of them.

       Enoch isn't forbidden, it's just not considered canon. No one considers it blasphemous except for maybe some of the Jewish sects.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is only one direct reference to Enoch in the rest of the canon texts, and this reference is often disregarded as the part of Enoch that is referenced is believed in of itself to be a reference to Deuteronomy
