       I have no doubt that this place is brigaded and astroturfed.  It’s pretty obvious.  And i’m not going to name sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s what I don’t get.  The only person I talk to in real life (and that includes real life people on Facebook) that takes Reddit seriously is my wife, and she only knows this place exists because of me.  Other than gaming forums and other niche interest groups (sports team, advice on any practical subject), I dont really think many people are either here or actually belive this website is anything more than entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have die hard political supporters on all sides, friends that are conspiracy buffs, and they’ve never heard of this sub and don’t use this site.  Even people the wife and I have met through certain subs for our swinging endeavors think this site is silly.lnand only use it as a last resort to procure sex at the last minute when flaked on.  Literally everyone I talk to has:  (1) never heard of Reddit; (2) has heard about it but never uses it because it’s a weird teenager thing (I’m 37 btw), or (3) uses it for gardening or other practical interest tips.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which leads me to this...why are the masterminds behind the astroturfing even bothering?  They aren’t changing the minds of people who are here organically, and I highly doubt that most “normies” are going to change their minds even if they wander to this sub.  Because the CIA labelled “conspiracy theories” as crackpottery after JFK, I would put good money on the fact that most normies avoid this place even if they stumble upon it because they were conditioned to belive that we are all raving mad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which begs the question - is Soros’/Russian money well invested here?  I can’t imagine it is.  The only people in this sub are people so interested in Conspiracy stuff we’d be labelled lunatics by everyon in our lives (no opinions being changed here), and shills.  I honestly don’t get it.

       Does that really change anything?  Have you changed your political beliefs because of Reddit?  Or do you reinforce them through echo chambers that this site (unintentionally, or perhaps intentionally) allows/creates/fosters?  Or echo chambers within echo chambers like threads on this sub?

       They should be fired, because their tactics are obvious to anyone paying attention (which organic users of this sub do very well).  But maybe not - my wife has watched exposes on how Supermakets use strategic product placement, and, knowing this, will still make impulse buys.  Hmmmm....    maybe the follow up question should be “Are we really all this stupid?”

       That remark was directed at this website in general. Much of the profit is derived from advertising revenue.

       The shills in this sub are most likely here to gaslight people, manufacture consensus, dissuade you and to make you feel powerless and isolated. They do this in many ways. As for the greater Reddit? Well, similar but it's more about marketing to be honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because someone says they do not know about this place, does not mean they are telling you the truth. They could be lying for a number of reasons. The rule about reddit user names is you never tell anyone what your reddit username is.

       In my opinion they are not interested in shutting us down here because they've tried that and we just crawl under another rock. And neither is it marketing to sell products. No, their shilling by necessity is a lighter touch and it's multifaceted. Some of it is still predictable. The JIDF swarms anything negative about Israel. Corporate shills obfuscate about Monsanto/Bayer, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But pay particular attention to the OPs for polical posts. That's where your value for money is. You can push an agenda simply by calling attention to certain facts and conveniently ignoring others. Similarly you can create tribalism and push people into group-think by pushing divisive issues.

       They do change minds and opinions. They change the narrative. But as God as my witness me and others will keep the truth alive. The birth of life begins with a seed, a singular cell.

       Our thoughts here trickle down into the minds of the people of this world. And so, do not take this place lightly. For here is where thoughts can begin, where seeds are sown.

       For those of us that know better, the shills work on different grounds: to make us feel we're alone, isolated, crazy, ignorable minority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone that is too busy to verify sources or at least make a solid  foundation for how the world works will be easy to confuse, solely on involuntary ignorance. Raising above that involves reading full pages scattered around the net, most people dont have the drive, mood for devoting that type of time.

        Dependent Intelligence: comprises most with university degrees. It manifests as a fact-based erudition, knowing lots of stuff about many things. This intelligence doesn't depend upon one's own mind or one's own senses; these can be delegated to the collective, the identity group. Its level is measured at the linguistic proficiency at repeating and summarizing, in a more or less elaborate or subtle way, what everyone agrees other intelligent people think. These are usually people educated beyond their intelligence (it does that)."

The loudspeaker is the TV. The screaming is daily. The picture shown is that of a lunatic. The dependent thinkers are thus immediately taken care of, as they rely on other people's minds, and such other minds have spoken.

       They also have the deceiving capacity to impersonate every preponent in a serious discussion to control the conclusion that is reached. Literally talking to themselves over and over again, sometimes they are caught when switching between accounts ... impersonating both sides of the discussion, sometimes they pretent they are on our side, with the intent of weakening our side of the argument, make it mild, diluting the discussion, or worse, make it sound too crazy, ridiculous --- (see Al3X J0NES or other control oppositon)

       This sub is a place for armchair investigators to solve crimes and uncover conspiracies (to no real end) and to bitch about rage-inducing news articles, especially political ones. There is no reason for anyone in power to be remotely threatened by what gets posted and commented on here. That said, I'm sure they have bots and shills here because it's sweatshop labor and why not try to change a few lurker minds? They're going to shill everywhere because they have the money and the cheap labor. Many groups are behind it, including reddit itself, and each group would have their own goals from the astroturfing here or across all of reddit.

       There is also value in creating ideological community mobs that can be triggered to unknowingly brigade for TPTB. The vast majority of shills don't believe they are shills. They aren't paid; they are conditioned to respond a certain way to certain ideas that hurt their frailly constructed worldview.

       Some of them are literally paid shills, but they undoubtedly come from one of three "networks": 3rd world country Multi-level marketing firms (Clinton had some of these working for her campaign; they're usually either just dirt poor and trying to feed themselves or they've been exploited within an actual religious cult into doing this), spooks, and hedge fund managers/crypto-currency consultants who utilize forums like this to cause marginal shifts in the state of the market.

       Most of what folks think is shilling is the age old reddit war between the liberal majority of users and the conservative/alt-right internet folks that have always been very upset they can't take over the liberal forum by shitting it up.

       If a company is incorporated in Deleware or New York, the executives of the company are legally obligated to chase profit to the extent that the law allows, even if it is immoral.

       After I wrote this, I checked wikipedia, and it said... Reddit is located in California with no listing in New York. I thought this rule might now apply... then, I looked on Bloomberg, and it listed 'advance publications, inc' as the parent of Reddit... the holding company... and where is that incorporated?

      <p>
       Let me say, first of all, that it probably is well-invested here, or else they would have stopped doing it. It's reasonable to assume these are rational economic actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, starting from that point, why would investing in subterfuge here on reddit, and more specifically in the conspiracy forum, pay off? You say:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I have die hard political supporters on all sides, friends that are conspiracy buffs, and they’ve never heard of this sub and don’t use this site.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But the beauty part is, they don't have to use this site to be exposed to the spread of lies. A post here could be the spark that lights a fire which spreads to other social media, gets mainstream press coverage, and eventually becomes a part of our culture that your friends know about even if they never use the internet at all. Undoubtedly some of the people here are 'influencers', people with large social media followings who post frequently and who lean hard in a specific political direction. If I wanted to, for example, smear a political candidate, I could post a 'theory' here that they had committed some shocking crime, watch my lie morph into a genuine meme (in the classic meaning of that word, not the 'picture with words on it' meaning), and sit back while my useful idiots do the real heavy lifting.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, there's no particular reason why any of your friends should have ever heard of QAnon. But maybe they have now, because in the last twenty-four hours Q has gotten major press coverage, in part because of some people at a Trump rally.
       <em>
        Those
       </em>
       people probably knew about Q from reddit or 4chan. But now someone's gramma who never uses the internet is reading about it on newsprint.
