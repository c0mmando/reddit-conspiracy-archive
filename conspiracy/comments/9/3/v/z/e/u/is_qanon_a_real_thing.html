       Its right wing larping.  Now that they have seen this administration plunge us further into debt, not fix anything actually become more corrupt make inept leadership choices it's time to find a new boogeyman that further takes them out of responsibility of the choice of still supporting this madman.  Trump is fighting the boogeyman deep state and Qanon is in deep cover helping and sharing what he can.  It's not even good enough to pass the sniff test much less logic or facts. it's just leaps of inconsistent babble and do I think Trump plays into it?  Hell yeah He knows there is a contingent of his base that are crazy hence the relationship with Alex Jones and the like. but basic fact is this.  He can declassify anything. He hasnt.  He wont fully declassify the JFK files.  He is just focusing on keeping his buddies out of jail somehow and deflecting and playing into this type of hype.

       So you don’t personally think that there’s a secret pedo ring within the top level of our government, nor that trump is fighting the deep state.  Is the deep state real in your opinion?

       Seems to me like you already have an opinion. I’m not sure why you’re asking the question if you are already a believer? Are there pedo rings and sex trafficking yes, in government and the general population, it’s definitely a problem in all spheres of society. The only thing Trump is fighting is his mental health and the lack of sanity. Deep state, nope.

       Deep state is just a term to describe unelected groups influencing government.

       What you describe as 'strong corporate influences' could be considered a 'deep state.'

       Some people have said the "deep state" is also government workers/agents that are anti-trump.

       I really like your point about "strong corporate influences". I don't believe that there's a secret society rubbing their hands together and plotting. But there are some shady people in this world doing some bad stuff through lobbying and other forms of legalized bribery

       Im not saying there arent elite illuminati-ish aristocrats who dabble in pedophilia and other sick occult like behavior because its probably true and history shows us that the elite are pretty out of touch with the decency of humanity BUT
      </p>
      <p>
       what q crowd does is way overboard. they basically accuse everyone and anyone, mostly their political enemies, of being pedophiles with incredibly vague and usually poorly connected evidence to support their theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is q real? I highly doubt it. Is trump the enemy of the illuminati cartel thats in control of portions of our government infrastructure? Most likely he is in some way putting up a struggle against them but it is in no way as described by the q community. Trump, just as any other president or world leader in fact is just another pawn, another puzzle piece in the overall agenda of these elitists who will in some shape or form use him to their own advantage and gain in the long run.

       That argument would work except... it did pay off.  Huge amounts of sex-conspiracy related arrests.  Historical North Korea peace talks as projected.  Russia de-escalates after decade of crazy escalation.  Untouchables such as Podesta and Soros put in hot water now.  From the perspective of a hardcore Q follower, what you're saying wouldn't falter them.

       That's a false dichotomy, but it is happening on all sides. The corporate media is playing pied piper for most of the population between propaganda outlets like Fox News or MSNBC, and Q anon is playing pied piper for some of the people who didn't get captured by the corporate media.

       yes but the real question to ask is psy-op or not, which parts are half truths, and whether you agree with his alleged MAGA movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for me, I was at feeling this was real and positive around November, then I called it out as a psy-op to "tread cautiously" over months later (trust Sessions what the fuck?), but after the whole peace w/ NK and Russia events I'm kind of on mostly on-board with this Q thing.  I figure Q still isn't giving us the entire truth about his agenda, whether it be for a hidden transfer of power or what - but if it can bring about some de-escalation and peace like I've never seen then it's good enough for me.  I'm pretty much a classical liberal, don't like conservative culture but I can agree with peace and any form of decentralization.  iow I'm for the dismantling the deep state, if that's really happening.. but Trump movement looks to be a replacement of the deep state rather than a dismantle, eh I'll take what I can get.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's definitely not a LARP though, anybody who can't read between the lines enough to figure that one out is pretty much weeded out from this movement, and will probably subscribe to mainstream left cancer or mainstream trumpism which is also cancer.  Funny thing is a lot of Q followers act like cultists which I also find a complete turn off.  But eh, if it's Q cult vs the deep state, I'll side with the former because the latter starts wars and undermines democracy.

       I also want to add that Q makes alludes vaguely towards a lot of hot conspiracy topics.  Aliens, nazi history conspiracy, etc...  I don't trust most of what he alludes to or suggest.  That's what I mean by half truths.  Seems more like a way to appeal to the chan boards and become viral.
      </p>
      <p>
       Filter out the noise and bottom line is this:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Q is here to round up Trump faction and MAGA faction support.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Unlike any political group we've seen - Q shows a governing body of power willing to communicate directly to the people -  which even if it's a psy-op, makes this both a historical use of modern communications technology as well as rare gesture of respect towards the feelings and thoughts of common people via a grassroots channel of communication.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Those are the only 2 things that matter to me.  Q is real, but I treat his words as noise.  The "faction" he supports seems clear enough.  The means he's using is an honor.  Support him if you support what Trump-faction has been doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what exactly is Trump-faction doing?  Well perhaps the purpose of Q himself is to answer that question and circumvent the cancerous noise MSM and our now-controlled social media creates.  And that once again brings us back to: how much can you trust in what Q says his agenda is?

       Hard to say, to me Trump's unwavering Israel support and hiring of Neocons/Zionists Bolton and Pompeo disproves any narrative about him fighting the deep state.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, wanting to talk face to face with NK, Russia and now Iran are steps in the right direction.

       Earlier today there was a photo being taken of trump and a whole bunch of other people.   Trump said: “this is the calm before the storm”.... and then played it off by saying thank you and telling the media to leave.  Will there be large scale military action used against other nations? Will another 9/11 like even happen? Will I meet the girl of my dreams? These are questions I want to know

       The original Q possibly..but he was hacked and then moved to 8 change after his last 4chance post said he was done and comprised,no more comms.

       So some randoms start posting as him on 8 chan and they all just so happen to be the board owners/moderators and started up youtube channels right at the exact same time. They are all swimming in money now too...do the math..

       Q is bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       At best its a pysop designed to passify people interested in researching the deep state but new enough that they are easily gulled into believing someone close to Trump is posting cryptic messages on a fucking image board. At worse, its to rile up these same people and eventually it'll be used by the MSM to demonize them, thereby further dividing this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hint: You don't need Q. Do your own research and you'll far surpass whatever Q has leaked.

       Its definitely a "real thing" as in its actually happening, someone is posting things under the name "Q". As for its legitimacy, that is up to you to discover yourself.  Read the drops, (
       <a href="https://qmap.pub">

       ), peruse r/greatawakening, read some other non-MSM stories about it.  Make up your own mind.  Something is up, thats for sure.

       It's a rarity that an outlet with any sizable audience shows they
       <em>
        care
       </em>
       . WaPo, NYT, CNN, they have infinitely deep coffers but constantly spread self-serving lies and half-truths. Alex Jones never showed any signs of care for his audience, it's all about shilling his bone broths and supplements. Whoever Q is, whatever his agenda, he has already shown more care for his audience than all those four combined in their entire existence. Go on, mock me, you half-baked cynic.

       Of course it is fake bullshit. Now that it has become a popular following for casuals, like joking about big foot and flat Earth, it is starting to become a powerful brand/grassroots group. They saw how powerful a brand like Pepe could be and are sure to co-opt, infiltrate, slander, and destroy any brand that might be positive for their political rivals, just like poor Pepe.

       When someone tells you that they are going to tell you a mixture of truth and lies, but never tells you which is which, I just don't think they are worth bothering with.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since there isn't actually any point to Q's ramblings anyway, I wonder why anyone gives him the time of day. I mean, I'm sure it's addictively interesting trying to solve his stupid clues on a daily basis. That's why newspapers print crosswords.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the thing about crosswords is that there is no greater purpose than the satisfaction of solving a puzzle. Tomorrow, you'll be presented with a new puzzle. And so on, forever. Pardon me if I don't sound enthusiastic about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, the minute Q says something that's both accurate and important, I'll pay attention. But my money is on him never saying anything of either.
