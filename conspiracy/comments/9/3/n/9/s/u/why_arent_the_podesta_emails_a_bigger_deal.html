<li>The vast majority of people don&#39;t even know what the &quot;Podesta emails&quot; are.</li>
<li>The only time that the media mentions these emails, is in the context of &quot;DNC was hacked by Russians, election tampering etc etc&quot;, at which point most people assume that there was nothing more to it than supposedly some voting machines probably being hacked and something something Russia Collusion™</li>
<li>The moment you mention &quot;Pizzagate&quot; and/or anything sacrificial, 99.9% of people automatically tune you about because the person most affiliated with that entire movement/theory is Alex Jones who has destroyed everything he touches. e.g. what can be a solid factual investigation about real things happening in the real world, he instantly turns into some 5th dimension psychic vampire child molesters at which point anyone who isn&#39;t completely insane, laughs at him, rightfully assumes that 100% of what he says is bullshit and moves on.</li>
</ol>

<p>3.1 If someone is paying him behind the scenes to discredit any and all conspiracies, they&#39;re definitely getting their money&#39;s worth.</p>

<p>TL;DR 99% of people don&#39;t know and/or are misinformed on the subject and insane people like Alex Jones destroy any hint of credibility the movement/theory has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m talking about when I say that Alex Jones destroys anything he touches.</p>

<p>The &quot;gay frog&quot; story, was about how various companies were dumping chemicals into the water and as a result of those chemicals some species of frogs were changing genders.  A story that a number of other outlets also covered. Then Alex Jones gets involved, goes off about how the &#39;government is turning the frogs gay&#39;, and the entire story turns into some bullshit that everyone is laughing at.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve noticed over the years is that whenever he focuses on any story, there is almost always something real there, something that someone is actively trying to cover up.  And Alex Jones is, for the lack of a better word, unleashed onto it as damage control, where he takes the story, turns it into a joke and focuses all the attention on himself, the person delivering the story rather than on the story itself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same strategy as with the DNC emails - don&#39;t talk about the contents of the emails, instead talk where they supposedly came from about how scandalous it is that something something Russia something something.  Now it&#39;s all Russia Russia Russia and everyone has forgotten about what&#39;s actually in the emails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Donna Brazille is no longer head of the DNC. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz is no longer head of the DNC. Amy Dacey, Brad Marshall, and Luis Miranda were fired from the DNC. The candidate they cheated to help lost the election. Their acts were made transparent and are known to the American people. Their fundraising has suffered rightly and deeply for their actions and they can&#39;t pose a significant challenge to the RNC in that department.  They&#39;re still dealing with lawsuits over it.</p>

<p>Only people who don&#39;t pay attention to the news or politics at all have no clue about what occurred.  Their convention was turned into a shitshow of protests, both inside and outside the convention hall because of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DNC is a non-profit.  What they did was immoral, reprehensible, and dishonest.  However, being immoral, reprehensible, and dishonest isn&#39;t illegal.  Legally speaking, you can say that they violated their charter and bylaws.  They did.  How many examples can you find me of high-ranking people within a non-profit who saw the inside of a jail cell for violating their charter and bylaws?  Not many, if any.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s not an example of the DNC escaping accountability so much as it is an example of the flaws of our system.  You can&#39;t expect criminal prosecution for something we in this country rarely, if ever, criminally prosecute.  I&#39;d absolutely agree that we need better laws so that people will see the inside of a jail cell for doing what the DNC did in the future.  I&#39;ve personally been calling for that since the revelations.  Do you hear a single Republican politician advocating for a new law to make what the DNC did criminally prosecutable in the future though?  Nope.  It&#39;s beside the point of this conversation, but have you ever wondered why?  </p>

<p>Yes, Hillary Clinton is still doing Hillary Clinton things, though I&#39;d argue that whenever she speaks publicly, she hurts Democrats more than she helps.  Yes, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz got a job with the HRC campaign.  That too became known publicly and was protested at the time, most notably at the Democratic National Convention.  And though I don&#39;t know percentages, there&#39;s a healthy chunk of Democrats who think that the DNC did nothing wrong, or at least, that what they did was justified.  You&#39;re always going to find idiots like that, just like you&#39;ll find idiots on the right who think what Russia did was acceptable and justified and shouldn&#39;t be treated seriously or even investigated because it exposed what the DNC was doing.  That&#39;s one of the downsides of living in a hyper-partisan country.</p>

<p>The issue is they broke no laws. It was all bad perception at political manuevering. Likewise there is no law saying you cannot be hired after being fired from a job. Neighter is getting fired prohibit you from making book deals.</p>

<p>I understand that you hate those people, and you think that&#39;s reason enough to lock them up forever. But, at least for the time being, you have to commit a crime in order to be throw in prison. And the problem you have is that none of the people you&#39;re ranting about have committed any crimes. There&#39;s no reason to throw them in jail. You can&#39;t lock people up just because you hate them. </p>

<p>You are free to pour over all those stolen emails and flog them until you are blue in the face, but you have to come to grips with one simple fact: There isn&#39;t any evidence of crime in any of them. I know you and Fox News and a millions-strong horde of wingnuts who make up the Republican base have been <em>pretending</em> there is evidence of crime for years. But there isn&#39;t. And that&#39;s why there isn&#39;t a single thing you can respond to me with that shows there was any criminal wrongdoing. There is <em>barely</em> even evidence that the DNC did anything to materially influence the election in Hillary&#39;s favor. The entire body of evidence you could cite consists of a handful of emails with some annoyed-sounding DNC members complaining about Bernie late in the primary season (May and June; I think there is one from the last week of April.) They were complaining that he would not drop out even though it was obvious he could not possibly win (mathematically, based on the number of races he lost).</p>

<p>So, again: You&#39;re free to hate people as much as you do. You&#39;re free to fantasize day and night about them being locked up.</p>

<p>But at least for now, you still can&#39;t lock people up just because you hate them. I know you are trying to change that. I know you are hoping Trump turns this into a very different kind of country -- one where you <em>can</em> lock up and even murder all the people who aren&#39;t in your deranged cult. But for now you will have to just bide your time and wait until your cult leader turns this into the kind of authoritarian dictatorship that you dream about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im sure many people do not and/or would not &#39;buy it&#39; for the simple fact that it came out of Alex&#39;s mouth. To counter your points...  1) When Monsato (or any other agrochemical/biotechnological corporation) introduces product(s) that have negative effects on our environment and do nothing to repair or reverse its effects, one can surely view those actions and inactions as intentional. These companies do their homework, they know the science, the know the impact, and yet in situations like this, nothing is done to correct the problem. 2) When the EPA is notified of such problems in our environment and they do nothing about it, one can surely assume that there may possibly be an agenda here to look the other way. Regarding assistance, the US government has funded these companies in the 100s of millions via tax breaks, grants, subsidies and loans, either directly or indirectly through farmers across the country. 3) No one is talking about Obama as it relates to &#39;gay frogs&#39;, but if someone is, I&#39;m willing to at least listen. If things are happening under your watch then there&#39;s a level of accountability present.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, too much sensationalism is happening in the media. They will look for anyone similar to Alex Jones, prop that person up as &quot;representing all conspiracy theorists&quot;, then take a clip out of context, point and laugh at it, then everyone else is conditioned to now point and laugh at AJ or whoever else they target.</p>

<p>Which is why I think it is more effective to just tell the truth and lay out the facts/details on something. No need to start talking about Psychic Vampires from another universe controlling us all, though personally I do love the imagery of Pyschic Vampires controlling stuff. Would make an interesting show, they control the USA and Buffy is reborn to slay them or something lol.</p>

<p>But surely, that&#39;s all a coincidence. Couldn&#39;t be the case that the person who had the emails first handed them off to the person who had them second after that second person specifically requested that type of data and said they could release them with bigger impact. </p>

<p>Also, you literally didn&#39;t mention Wikileaks in the comment I initially replied to. You just look like you&#39;re moving goal posts because you were wrong. It shouldn&#39;t be surprising that people would say there was doctored Podesta shit being released when doctored Podesta shit had already been released.

    <div class="md"><p>So... you think Guccifer 2.0 was actually Seth Rich? I mean, that could explain the shitty Romanian accent. Doesn&#39;t really explain how he continued to communicate with the media and release data after his own death. Was he communicating from beyond the grave, or what? </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of other loose ends you&#39;d have to tie up and plot holes you&#39;d have to fill before you can expect people to buy the Seth Rich story. Well, no actually, the Seth Rich BS contradicts so much that is already public knowledge, I gotta wonder if people who still believe it are just way too deep in a bubble of their own making, or actively and intentionally spreading misinformation in order to confuse people. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re kinda fucking up the narrative. We&#39;re talking about Podesta emails and their release. Podesta didn&#39;t work for the DNC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, mixed up my two WikiLeaks there.  In fairness, they both came out what, 2 or 3 months apart, and both exposed top democrat lewdness and corruption.  Hopefully I&#39;ll get a pass.  </p>

<p>But doesn&#39;t this just kind of tie the fuckiness all back together?  The &quot;Podesta&quot; emails, and The &quot;DNC&quot; emails, are both believed (by MSM and their dolt followers), to have been hacked by &quot;The Russians&quot; and largely &quot;influenced by Trump&quot; (read: MSM thinks Trump paid for the hack) to &quot;help Trump win&quot; the election (Obviously, patently false.  If Russia wanted one side to win, wouldn&#39;t they want the side who helped to transfer all that uranium over to Russia via Uranium One?  Where Mueller delivered the Uranium in person?  The side who would continue to cut funding to our military, and continue down the globalist path?  Curious to your thoughts on this)    </p>

<p>I think this begs a larger question - why would they (DNC/Podesta, which, in essence are the same fucking thing) try to jumble both of these messes into one mess?  Perhaps if they can blame &quot;both&quot; of these &quot;hacks&quot; on &quot;The Russians&quot;, then can cover up for the murder of Seth Rich?   </p>

<p>Appreciate the call out - and willing to admit that I made a mistake.  I don&#39;t know for a fact that Seth Rich had access to the Podesta emails, but he 100% had access to the DNC emails.  Assange had hinted multiple times in interviews that Seth Rich was the person who leaked to him - going so far as to saying that his source for the DNC email link had been killed (I believe this snippet was on Hannity)  </p>

<p>Either way - there&#39;s a whole lot of fuckery afoot in both of these email dumps.  And as quoted above, Podesta (inadvertently?) admitted that the emails were legitimate with that tweet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By looking at the &quot;last modified&quot; portion of metadata compared to when they were downloaded and their size a DL speed of 20-25 megabytes per second was estimated.  Absolutely not confirmation of a USB being used as nobody knows how many times the files were moved around prior to being released.</p>

<p>Now some will still argue those speeds are too fast for upload/download speeds.  Maybe for the Comcast residential line going to your house yeah.  But a corporate internet connection or cloud network can absolutely achieve those.  You&#39;d also assume Russians attempting to take sensitive information from a US server would use a high speed connection as well.</p>

<p>So while it&#39;s possible a USB was used the evidence is equally likely to point either direction.  Taking into account the other evidence I don&#39;t believe it was an insider but this discussion was specifically about the USB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even on some pizzagate shit, but all of that (true or not) was a huge distraction from all the first hand verifiable evidence in the emails. The tldr is because people didn&#39;t read them and the media and Hillary&#39;s followers hardcore buried it. All the stuff about the dirty on Bernie, the scripted &quot;impromptu&quot; interviews and question filtering, the CTR stuff, lying about the server, the in bed with news groups, the terrible way she dealt with a high pressure situation, missing evidence, complete internal incompetence, hoping to prop Trump as the opposition because they thought that would be an easy win for her without Bernie, etc etc, that all got buried by normal channels and pizzagate. Also, I&#39;m not saying other politicians aren&#39;t just as bad or worse, but we had actual first hand evidence that hasn&#39;t been denied on this very rare occasion. So, media, pizzagate, hysteria, and ignorance is why nobody cared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The part that got me was the astroturfing of pro-Bernie groups on social media, and then flipping those in co-ordination to give the impression that he&#39;d lost the primaries well before he had. To this day people repeat the &quot;here&#39;s how Bernie can still win&quot; meme, but the reality is that he *could have* when that meme spawned - and it was his supporters who were paying attention to the actual numbers rather than the astroturfed social media groups that were being made fun of.</p>

<p>That or the &#39;pied piper&#39; strategy used to try and secure Cruz or Trump as the Republican candidate, which didn&#39;t really pay off as the Clinton campaign intended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t believe that. This election opened my eyes that the democrat party is a mesh of other parties all currently working as a voting block.</p>

<p>From the outside, Bernie <em>should</em> have won CA. He didn’t. </p>

<p>The truth is that a lot of ex-republicans are now Democrat ‘centrists’. Basically it’s the Republican Party from the 70’s, but socially liberal. They were forced out (by the hyper religious wing) and became democrats. These are the CA democrats. They aren’t as ‘liberal’ as people like to claim. </p>

<p>Clinton, for all intents and purposes was one of those “socially liberal republicans”, and that’s why they voted for her. </p>

<p>In a way, it’s a good thing the democrats lost. A massive blue wave at the time would have caused a ton of infighting in those groups, and the Dem party would have fractured into factions, with the Wounded Republicans jumping in and crushing them (especially with the predicted resection coming soon).</p>

<p>This way, the Republicans prove themselves ungovernable and tear themselves apart, then the blue wave happens, the. The fracture, and we finally have more choices in our representation.</p>

<p>Well, unless you’re a social conservative. Then you’re getting left behind, and for good reason.</p>

<p>To some. Again, &#39;the democrats&#39; aren&#39;t a coherent party. They are a mashup of all the non-crazy platforms all at once.</p>

<p>Once they fragment, you might have a say on those policies. But only if the Republican&#39;s aren&#39;t there to drag us back to the early 1900s... who also support those policies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, look at the history of what happened ahead of CA. The AP announced a day or two BEFORE the CA primary that the primaries were done and HRC was the winner. This was of course arrived at by combining the stated positions of super delegates that wouldn&#39;t vote for another month. The effect was a seriously depressed voter turnout.</p>

<p>Then you had them decide to just not do exit polling on CA - weird huh? The exit polling was so far off in other states that didn&#39;t use caucuses. The only exit polling was done by raising funds and having supporters organize it themselves where possible.</p>

<p>Then you had masses of votes going missing -  like <em>MILLIONS</em> of votes. There&#39;s actually an entire documentary about it. Tons of people had to use provisional ballots - the same general bullshit we saw everywhere of likely Bernie voters getting flipped to other parties, etc.</p>

<p>So - despite what HRC allies would have us believe - CA was hardly a clean win. It was very frustrating to watch in realtime, but also helped wake me up to the fact that our elections are rigged, but it ain&#39;t Russia doing the rigging.</p>

<p>We need paper ballots and human counters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>see, this is a perfect example of people latching onto specific phrases, changing it to sound more nefarious, and then repeat it without context. </p>

<p>read the email chain</p>

<p>podesta and friends go look at vacation homes with a realtor september 1st before noon. they look at 6. september 2nd and 10am, the realtor sends out an email saying someone left a black and white handkerchief on a kitchen island in one of the 6 houses and she found it while doing a walkthrough. then a member of the tour group emails podesta asking if he wants it back.</p>

<p>so in order for that to align with pg beliefs, you need to believe that podesta: toured 6 houses in the morning, picked one without telling the realtor, had a pedo party that night, cleaned up and left the same night, but also left a glaring piece of evidence in a cum rag in plain sight on the kitchen island, which was then found and not recognized by the realtor who offered to mail it back, all in code. </p>

<p>oooor</p>

<p>they toured vacation homes and accidentally left a handkerchief on the counter while touring one of the houses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fun fact: none of the phrases actually occur in the emails. You will not find a single instance of &quot;cheese pizza&quot; in those emails. Anyone telling you otherwise is lying. The narrative falls apart if you start talking about set &quot;secret phrases&quot; and then immediately switch to instance where only parts of those phrases are in use. What I mean is that according to 4chan, &quot;cheese pizza&quot; has a secret meaning. However, that secret meaning exists in an idiom. You cannot divide it, i.e. into &quot;cheese&quot; and &quot;pizza&quot; independently, and still retain the original meaning because a part of a set phrase in isolation cannot retain the meaning of the whole phrase. </p>

<p>Pizzagate was contrived bullshit to spin something from innocuos stuff. Coded language was applied to everyday words which were supposed to mask pedo actions (although drug use would have been much more plausible as masked code). Then contents were attributed to Podesta although he was just a recipient of mails and not the author.</p>

<p>I like attractive women and I try better myself by abstaining from alcohol and drugs. My life is actually quite interesting. Monday night I go to a local dance club with a couple roommates after a recent breakup and I run into a friend that I hadn&#39;t seen in 2 years. It was great. My roommates knew no one but I have friends wherever I go. It was nice to dance in public after this serious breakup you know. Felt good. I&#39;m still healing from that experience you know. </p>

<p>I admit that I have my political biases, but I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m wholly partisan on this.  For example, I didn&#39;t think much of the Denny Hastert allegations when they first appeared.  I believed the Anthony Weiner stuff immediately.  </p>

<p>The pedogate movement has their political and partisan biases too though.  You don&#39;t see them going after Jim Jordan or ICE eventhough there are allegations against them, do you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve read the emails and yeah they sound pretty weird at times, but why Satanic pedophile rings? When I was a kid I used to order “pizzas” from my weed dealer on the phone. It could be code for anything, and I’d assume corruption before “Satanic pedophile cabal” that conveniently includes a “shocking” performance artist and bunch of stupid celebrities who don’t like Trump (even though they probably voted for him cause they’re rich). Politicians are gonna do shitty and illegal stuff for money and power, somehow I am skeptical that they have time for devil-worship and ritual abuse if they are that power-hungry. I’m not saying there aren’t pedophiles in positions of power (Hollywood’s shown us this), but the Pizzagate stuff is reeeeally a stretch. </p>

<p>Even when it was being covered by the MSM, it was always about “the Russians” or “it’s illegal for you [the viewer] to reas these”. Never once was the content examined. And that’s what most people wanted, I think.</p>

<p>Just searched my inbox which was scrubbed in the last year for &quot;pizza&quot; sure enough multiple hits for me being invited out to pizza parties and and office party with free pizza. The PizzaGaters could have a field day with the office thread. If I was a Democratic candidate, I&#39;m sure the pizzagaters would have a field day if that thread was leaked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree, but the podesta emails include a lot more than just proof of being in bed with the media. And context or not, there&#39;s clearly a code. I don&#39;t like the assumptions in the widespread anonymous translations of the code, but it&#39;s definitely a code. The way you worded that seemed to be undermining the importance of what&#39;s found in the emails..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we agree more than we disagree.  I personally think the being in bed with the media is the only really shady thing in there where i&#39;d use the word &quot;proof&quot; rather than &quot;evidence for&quot;, so that&#39;s why I used it as my example, but yeah, there&#39;s stuff in there on the Clintons&#39; relationship with Saudi Arabia, some stuff about politically motivated donations to the Clinton Foundation, etc.  Stuff that I wouldn&#39;t quite call &quot;proof&quot;, has far more evidence within the Podesta emails than a child trafficking ring.</p>

<p>The stuff in Hillary&#39;s &quot;private speeches&quot; that were released through the Podesta dump about Syria and her globalist ideology were especially disturbing to me personally.  </p>

<p>All of that stuff could have and should have been further followed up on.  IIRC she was actually asked in one of the debates about a passage from one of her private speeches, her &quot;dream for a hemispheric common market with open borders,&quot;  and then ... nothing.  Pedogate sucked up all of the Oxygen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t have any strong feelings on the pizza stuff, but the emails clearly demonstrated that Hillary was fully aware of Saudi Arabia and Qatar helping to fund and support ISIS while she was at the same time taking millions of dollars in donations to her foundation from the governments of both countries.</p>

<p>To me having someone that high up in government taking money from the same people who are fueling the supposed worst bad guys in the world is blatantly criminal, but it didn&#39;t even make a ripple on the pond thanks to the media being in the bag for her.</p>

<p>There was a gangster some years (USA somewhere, maybe 1960&#39;s) ago who owned a bakery. He and his gang sold guns, drugs etc but everything was in bakery lingo.  </p>

<p>One day he knew the police were listening and arranged a delivery of buns, filling and flour. The police assumed, correctly, that this was guns, ammo and drugs.</p>

<p>The sting was set and when he was arrested they found a van containing choux buns, cream filling and self raising flour. He walked away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, the biggest thing in the Podesta leak was the DNC conspiring with Clinton to run the &quot;Pied Piper Plan,&quot; orchestrating major media outlets during the early stages of the primary to go completely dark on anyone they felt might be a threat to Clinton and go completely balls covering people they thought Clinton could easily beat. Email was sent two weeks before Trump declared, and identified Trump as the primary person the media was being instructed to focus all their coverage on, since Hillary was sure Trump could never win. A few days after the email was sent, Bill Clinton called Trump up to convince him to run, and after a few weeks of constant coverage, Trump decided to jump in. </p>

<p>Then, during the R primary, nobody could figure out why all the coverage went to Trump and not to anyone else. </p>

<p>Then, Hillary face planted. It&#39;s like the entire election was &quot;play stupid games win stupid prizes.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate came up one night talking with friends, when it was fresh. I said something like, &quot;it&#39;s kinda cool we have people trying to investigate crimes on the internet, but you know now that people are getting shot over this it&#39;s time to stop.&quot;</p>

<p>Guess what, I fell for a psyop coverup. the shooter shot a computer and was connected to the owners in multiple ways. Sure enough, other people used the suspicious gunman &quot;independent investigator&quot; meme to shut down discussion. You know, ridicule, shame, the usual propaganda and sophistry. Media talking points make it easy. &quot;Independent research = misguided dangerous vigilantes. Let&#39;s shorten that. Independence = danger. The herd feels safer, right?</p>

<p>So I realized that not only was I wrong about pizzagate being R propaganda, I had even fallen for a conversation stopping meme. I don&#39;t like to let things rest as dogma and keep challenging ideas, so I dug. And dug. I scorched my soul learning the truth behind my suspicions all these years.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t people believe it? I had a friend tell me straight up he didn&#39;t think people were capable of that level of evil. Others think God won&#39;t allow it. Ultimately it&#39;s emotional, their minds have been conditioned and their feelings can&#39;t handle the awful truth.</p>

<p>But... feelings and conditioned reactions don&#39;t determine facts. Pedophile networks, ritual torture, occultist elites, bloodlines... all the evidence points that way. </p>

<p>You deniers can scream insults and twist my words, but it won&#39;t change what I saw, and your feelings don&#39;t determine truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, people here (<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) and elsewhere <em>usually</em> lack emotional fortitude. They are unable to handle uncertainty, especially when the ideas presented cause emotional discomfort on their own.</p>

<p>So, they are unable to take an intellectual and emotional stance that is sane. That is, consider all available, credible evidence, and consider the possibilities without committing to belief nor disbelief without proof.</p>

<p>To believe or even consider an idea can cause an emotional response. To avoid these feelings, people will deny evidence, so they can deny the ideas the evidence suggests so that the emotions won&#39;t be expressed. </p>

<p>Although, many of them would accept the ideas with proof and feel like crap as they should, which motivate them for corrective actions. Yet, we need people who will suspend belief and disbelief to investigate the evidence in order to find that proof or these less emotionally self-controlled people will never be intellectually and emotionally activated for corrective actions.</p>

<p>The first two emails below reveal that the Podesta/Clinton team fully understood that Qatar and Saudi Arabia finance ISIS and international terrorism. These email exchanges in this post took place immediately after the Wall Street Journal/Grimaldi article titled &quot;Foreign Government Gifts to Clinton Foundation on the Rise” By James V. Grimaldi and Rebecca Ballhaus</p>

<p>Link to full post featuring most revealing geopolitical Podesta emails showing Clinton and Podesta discussed taking millions in payments from Qatar and Saudi Arabia while being fully aware that those countries were financing ISIS: </p>

<p>The real reasons for Russiagate are many fold. Covering up US support for terrorists in Syria (FSA, al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda, ISIS, White Helmets) is why the entire charade is being carried out. The rabbit hole goes much much deeper.....and Trump is in on it also. All is a show, a grand charade. Those that think they are woke still have much further to go to become awake to the truth. Both US political teams and their puppets perform for the same owners/masters. </p>

<p>I mean, Hillary LOST!</p>

<p>And Trump is ORANGE!!!</p>

<p>Surely you realize that means that the democrats are literally all saints, and if not for the interference of young people, black people, anti-feminist-women, facebook, deplorables, Bernie and his bros, the Electoral College, 4-chan, Pepe, Russia, and Assange, then literally everyone on earth would have ascended to heaven already, without even losing the shirts off our backs.</p>

<p>Now can we get back to the matter at hand? The actual crisis on our hands? The question is obviously &quot;Is Donald Trump literally the landmass of Russia?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m talking about when I say that Alex Jones destroys anything he touches.</p>

<p>The &quot;gay frog&quot; story, was about how various companies were dumping chemicals into the water and as a result of those chemicals some species of frogs were changing genders.  A story that a number of other outlets also covered. Then Alex Jones gets involved, goes off about how the &#39;government is turning the frogs gay&#39;, and the entire story turns into some bullshit that everyone is laughing at.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve noticed over the years is that whenever he focuses on any story, there is almost always something real there, something that someone is actively trying to cover up.  And Alex Jones is, for the lack of a better word, unleashed onto it as damage control, where he takes the story, turns it into a joke and focuses all the attention on himself, the person delivering the story rather than on the story itself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same strategy as with the DNC emails - don&#39;t talk about the contents of the emails, instead talk where they supposedly came from about how scandalous it is that something something Russia something something.  Now it&#39;s all Russia Russia Russia and everyone has forgotten about what&#39;s actually in the emails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, people here (<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) and elsewhere <em>usually</em> lack emotional fortitude. They are unable to handle uncertainty, especially when the ideas presented cause emotional discomfort on their own.</p>

<p>So, they are unable to take an intellectual and emotional stance that is sane. That is, consider all available, credible evidence, and consider the possibilities without committing to belief nor disbelief without proof.</p>

<p>To believe or even consider an idea can cause an emotional response. To avoid these feelings, people will deny evidence, so they can deny the ideas the evidence suggests so that the emotions won&#39;t be expressed. </p>

<p>Although, many of them would accept the ideas with proof and feel like crap as they should, which motivate them for corrective actions. Yet, we need people who will suspend belief and disbelief to investigate the evidence in order to find that proof or these less emotionally self-controlled people will never be intellectually and emotionally activated for corrective actions.</p>
