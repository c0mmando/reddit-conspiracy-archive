       This has most likely been talked about or asked in certain ways, hopefully not this way...
      </p>
      <p>
       For long term conspiracy minded people (minimum 5 years, before Trump), there was a general theory, and I use the word theory lightly as it was well talked about and written in many "old books" (Lucis trust etc) that;
      </p>
      <p>
       To usher in the age of the New World Order (NWO) people would have to first revolt against the old order. To do this they would expose the crimes of the politicians, businessmen, authorities and priests. My opinion is that the smart people who could, for example, see 9/11 was a false flag or other plausible conspiracies are the ones REALLY being played, their not sheeple but get played. They would shout "9/11 was an inside job" from the highest buildings
       <strong>
        virtue signalling their intelligence.
       </strong>
       They were not lying either, this is why they were so passionate. The movement would grow into the rebellion we see today. Do you really think the Government knew Jimmy Saville was doing what he was doing without collecting the evidence, ready to expose it in the future? Do you really believe 9/11 was done ever so stupidly to look like an inside job that it would not be used against the perpetrators when the time was right?
      </p>
      <p>
       The people would "be thankful" and cheer as the NWO comes to fruition. A saviour would come i:e Trump and expose it all. Even Alex Jones talked about this idea in the old days and as soon as Trump came along he joined the bandwagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally what I am getting at is that everyone is cheering and clapping for the old guard to die or go to jail (I can't agree more with this) and for the NWO to come into play. The NWO isn't so scary, it's just a new term for new rules and ways of doing things. I FULLY agree with a version of a NWO, but I was taught to be on guard for when it comes and although we may have a good few years to come, the scary end is what was always going to be. I AM A TRUMP FAN and if I lived in America I would vote him and join your pro Trump rallies, this is the mad thing about it. Trump is the saviour, but what comes after? Does Trump understand and maybe an accessory to what I am saying as he was in bed with all these lot many years ago.

       The NWO is open borders, one government, one new culture. no representation, no freedom of speech, no self defense, disposable workers, depressed wages... basically the EU on a global scale.

       The one world "overall" government comes later, this will still require different regions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you should not use the term NWO so factually, this is just your opinion. I think the time you talk of is when litterally Lucifer is running the world. Yes there will be pockets of what you are saying all over but not the dark "NWO" you assume.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example if the UN allowed Germany, India and Australia with some others to have equal status of the 5 permanent members this would technically be a NWO. A NWO came after 9/11. A NWO came into play when Trump got elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do like what you say though :)

       I made it clear he wasn't, he could well be a part of it, or even "guided by God / spirits", and the bad things will come later.

       Personally I think he is a part of it and willing accomplice to bring the old guard down.

       Saviour figure for a LOT of people i:e the silent majority. He does come across as one.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has exposed the idea of fake news / the deep state / western corruption on a massive scale to the masses. You and I may have known about this for years but the general public is much more sceptical of the MSM.

       Has it really been exposed to the general public? The Deep State is still considered a conspiracy theory, only now it's associated with "Trumpian Alt-Right Nazis."

       If the majority is silent, how do we know he has saved them or even helped them one bit?

       The old order was not pushing for it's own destruction for the last 50+ years. The old guard was pushing for world domination. That is the NWO they wanted. One government to control them all.

       I like to think of the old guard as 2 sides of the same coin. One was willingly / stupidly planning and doing bad things, thinking they had control. The other half either watched and recorded or even pushed them to do silly things, again to record it. Things will be exposed.

       There is a plan but it's "gods" plan. If what the bible has been INTERPRETED to say then maybe the last few weeks on Earth would have the low population.

       The other side is a mass kill by the elite to rule over us but this is conspiracy bull as no matter who lives after 90 + get killed there would be nothing to maintain the world with and we would lose all knowledge.

       The last theory is uploading our consciousness into cyborgs. This would be HELL, sold as an initial paradise, if it were ever possible.

       Personal opinion -  Lots of people will get killed off to get the world fixed. Africans, Indians, Chinese, south Asia and northern Latin america are hot spots for collapse and war.

       Why is this the only text in bold?

       &lt;Do you really believe 9/11 was done ever so stupidly to look like an inside job that it would not be used against the perpetrators when the time was right?

       Arrogance will get you caught or killed. Unless you control the catchers and killers. An the bushes do. Dick cheney assumed the role of commander in chief while baby bush read a book. This was an OG babykiller bush, an OG triple OG cheneys operation. Which to this day I hear very few people ask why if the president of the United States was not dead,or unable to make decisions, was it cheney running things in DC. Cannot have the stutterer in chief fucking up cheneys Pearl Harbor.

       It was the only text in bold to hopefully reinforce this concept (truthers getting used). This leads on to my second point of 9/11 was a deliberately bad false flag. This gets the "smarter" people who can see this to shout from the rooftops and generally spread mistrust in government...which with all the other "bad things" getting exposed will force the change needed to implement a version of a NWO. I think their "the authorities" arrogance was part deliberate part stupid.

       Personal "conspiracy" - 9/11 won't be exposed until after Dick Cheney's death.

       I disagree with it all. An the bold type using recent (past yr or so) news-speak to describe people comes across to me as a negative label. I appreciate your faith in this country, but it can go through a total rebellion and survive without the nwo, an that is why they spend so much time and effort to keep us divided because they know that.

       Power always shifts, this is nature. The deer is swift and graceful, it keeps the grasses low, the forest free of fuels for the summer fires. The mountain lion pounces from the shadows, kills the deer and it's body feeds the grasses. When the grasses are plentiful the deer overpopulate and die from disease, the cougars breed and infringe on the bear's territory, then the fires come and wipe the slate clean. It's no different for us.
