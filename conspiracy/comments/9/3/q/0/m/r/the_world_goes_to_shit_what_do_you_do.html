       Say something really bad happens (I’m thinking “The Road” or similar dystopian scenarios) on/to the planet, will you be able to survive? Will you be able to feed yourself? Do you know how to hunt/forage for food? Can you defend yourself to keep yourself alive? Because I sure don’t know what I’d do and it scares me. Those elite bastards might have a whole life for themselves planned underground in a worst case scenario but where does that leave the rest of us? Anyone have any advice? Anyone give thought to this kind of stuff ever?

       One thing that's for sure is it's coming.  It's Biblical in nature.  If you don't want to have to worry about this just repent and believe this:

       Well if you’re all going to die and go to heaven and spend eternity with Jesus, why do you care what happens to the planet either? I don’t believe in God in the sense that you’re probably referring to it but I do want people to be happy for future generations to come regardless of religious standing

       That's incompatible with Bible believing Christianity (KJV).  The scriptures teach that the whole world will go to crap and then a powerful man will bring peace (antichrist) and the world will love and worship him but God's wrath will be poured out on everyone who hasn't repented and believed Paul's gospel (the narrow path)
      </p>
      <p>
       From my perspective, I don't really care what will happen to the world because I know that Jesus Christ is going to melt the entire thing and create it brand new.  The whole eternity in heaven thing is a misconception.  It's right here on new earth (with access to new heaven).  I just don't want you to miss out on it and spent an eternity in a lake of fire when you don't have to.  You only need to repent and believe this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;

      </p>
      <p>
       God came to earth in the flesh of Christ Jesus and died for us to atone for sin with his blood.  So we don't have to pay for our own sins with the second death:
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

       Blah fucking blah. All I can say is what’s the hold up then? People like you remind me of people like my dad. Always talking about the end times but yet nothing ever happens. You guys were sold on a story that’s not gonna happen. And if it does what’s the hold up? Waiting for all the stars to align perfectly? It just all seems like a stupid game at that point if God is just waiting for the right moments.

       God is patiently waiting for as many as possible to repent and trust in Christ Jesus.  His patience is on another level and time doesn't work the same for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       2Pe 3:8  But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
      </p>
      <p>
       2Pe_3:9  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

       It's not God that is downvoted, it's the particular brand of Christianity often gets peddled. It's a highly commercialized, wish fulfilling brand of Christianity that exchanges infinite life for your ability to think for yourself. The notion that when you die, if you "believe" in Jesus, you go to heaven and live forever with God. That's one way to interpret the Bible, one I find to be theologically bankrupt. Most of the people spouting this shit are incapable of articulating important philosophical concepts, such as the nature of belief, and can't begin to then extrapolate what that means in terms of believing in Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 Corinthians 5:10
      </p>
      <p>
       "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad."
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Christians are judged. Without judgment you can't be transformed into a Christ-like being, which is what eternal life means. Learn Greek fluently, study ancient Greek, and read the Greek Bible. It's completely different from the Protestant brand of Christianity sold to the modern world. No one knows what happens after death. All the Bible says is that it will be trans formative, and you will be forcefully aligned with the logos. Christ is the embodiment of the logos in human form, so obviously, if you are a Christian (a disciple of Christ) your forceful alignment with the logos will be more pleasant when you are eventually judged. What happens next, who the fuck knows. Hell is what happens to you when God judges you and you are completely maligned with truth. It's kind of why a conception of Purgatory exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason "God" gets downvoted is not because people hate God, or don't want to have conversations about God-they're just sick of the same regurgitated, zombie-like, irrational drivel that people diarrhea across reddit's canvas like a modern "painter". Well, that, and of course, no one can agree on the topic of God without complete religious conformity.

       Well actually, a large part of it stems from people themeselves not reading the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus did not want praise, he wanted everyone to praise God, not him. Several times within the Bible Jesus separates himself from God to show that there is only one who is Good.

       Yes and when people say that Jesus lived a sinless life, I can't help but think how that is literally impossible. Our existence in this material world is fundamentally and inherently sinful. Jesus was the best we could aspire to, or damn close. He upheld the truth and paid for it with his life.

       He was the son of God, the first thing that God created before all other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Matthew 19:26 King James Version (KJV)
      </p>
      <p>
       26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, the wages of our sins are is death since Adam and Eve ate from the tree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus did die therefore, Jesus was born into sin as we all were. This was to show how humble God can be, that he would send his first creation to come and die for the world. That he sent his most prized possession to literally come down here to earth to be murdered. Of course, he was resurrected by God and brought up into the chariot but he still experienced death.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must remember that Jesus could have changed the world by force and simply took over to rule everyone. But that is not how God works. Balance is what God is. For the world to deserve a savior, first it must experience hell (our current situation). That way when the messiah finally comes we deserve the hero we get.
      </p>

       Faith is how we see the things can't be seen.

       God did not create Jesus. God is Jesus, just as God is The Father, and The Holy Spirit. They are all primordial forces, personal aspects of the same entity, like the faces of a cube are all part of the same cube, and are all unified in that they are all squares, in different places on the cube. God is the cube, the whole cube is everywhere, and we conceptualize the places that God is, by looking at the faces of the cube, which allows us to understand the ways in which God manifests.
      </p>
      <p>
       John 1: 1
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
      </p>
      <p>
       John 1: 14
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth."
      </p>
      <p>
       That is referencing Jesus. Jesus, as the man, made flesh by the holy spirit coming unto Mary. In this way, the holy spirit is kind of a heavenly mother (kind of). She bides within us and works through us, almost as if through mind control, like a mother's teaqchings passed subconsciously to her children. Regardless as to whether you believe Mary was literally a Virgin, physiologically speaking, the holy spirit coming unto her was preparation necessary for Jesus to be made manifest in flesh through a man. Jesus did not begin existing at that point, nor was he ever created at any point. Just like the Holy Spirit and The Father, he just was.

        God did not create Jesus. God is Jesus, just as God is The Father, and The Holy Spirit. They are all primordial forces, personal aspects of the same entity, like the faces of a cube are all part of the same cube, and are all unified in that they are all squares, in different places on the cube. God is the cube, the whole cube is everywhere, and we conceptualize the places that God is, by looking at the faces of the cube, which allows us to understand the ways in which God manifests.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That is referencing Jesus. Jesus, as the man, made flesh by the holy spirit coming unto Mary. In this way, the holy spirit is kind of a heavenly mother (kind of). She bides within us and works through us, almost as if through mind control, like a mother's teaqchings passed subconsciously to her children. Regardless as to whether you believe Mary was literally a Virgin, physiologically speaking, the holy spirit coming unto her was preparation necessary for Jesus to be made manifest in flesh through a man. Jesus did not begin existing at that point, nor was he ever created at any point. Just like the Holy Spirit and The Father, he just was.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Mary was not a virgin. Joseph was Jesus's physical father but the spirit that went into the body was the first creation. This again is a tatic of the devil used to deceive in order for the masses to worship the anti-god I.E. Satan. God himself is a man.

        That is part of the meaning, but only part, and only the literal interptetation, which doesn't really stand on its own, or really have any value to someone that actually wants to know what Christianity is about in a more substantive way. Christ's "sacrifice" was less about God giving up anything. God can't have prized possessions. God can't lose anything. God is not capable of this, if God were, it would by definition violate the conception of God as a perfect being, an embodiment of truth. The sacrificial component of Jesus' Crucifixion was sacramental, not 100% analogous with sacrifices Jews had made to God. Jesus' sacrifice was a visceral display of man's malignment with the word, the logos. It was God showing man how fucked up we are and saying still, "and yet I will have mercy".

        God didn't humble himself. God didn't need to be made humble. God is perfect. It was man that needed to be made humble, and surely man that was made humble by this act. Look at how far we have come since. Sure, we're still fucked up, we are sinful by naure, by virtue of flesh as necessary in our material being. Even Jesus as a man was incapable of technically sinning. He was just the best that is possible in our material reality. The Jesus within God is devoid of sin. That is actual Jesus, not the crude construction shown to man- like a black mirror turned on our own sins, showing us our true selves in how we treated Jesus. The world we created since then shows that The Holy Spirit abides within man now. Eventually this will all come to an end, and the day of judgment will come upon man. That day will not come because we have failed God to some greater extent, having passed some Golden Age of obedience to God. It will come because that is when God must come and judge us. That is when we will be ready to be transformed by truth into what God has planned for us. Just because we will be judged does not mean that judgment is coming at some point of ultimate depravity. There has always been and always will be depravity wherever there is freedom. That's not the point. We always deserve to be judged.

Him sending the first spirit back again will show that even though the world killed his grand creation, he will have mercy on the earth.

       You're a KJ only kind of guy. It is impossible to believe what you believe and also believe the bible is the word of God. Personally, I don't think the bible is the word of God. I think the bible was man's attempt at accurately archiving truth as per incredible experiences, such as the history of the Jews, and the life of Jesus. God gave us free will, even free will to say a book is completely true when it contains some falsehoods. The bible wouldn't be the only book that does that, in fact, it is in good company. You however, as a King James' only kind of guy, have no such luxury. And many of the things you suggest are outright impossible if you take the bible to be the literal word of God.

       God. Think of a human playing a videogame, and you have an avatar, a playable character you inhabit. Then an NPC asks you, "are you a human player?" and you respond, quite literally, "No, you are interacting with my avatar, but I am being controlled by a human". Jesus was the man, and the word, the logos, the component of the trinity which we now call "Jesus" (even though Jesus the man is dead and no longer on Earth) is a divine component of God. The part of God that "played" Jesus, as a character, was the logos, the word, we just call him Jesus, because that is how we interacted with him. Make sense? Good.

       This world
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       sin. Being here is sin. Jesus just didn't violate the ten commandments. He did about as good as a human can physically do in this material world, as per the constraints of the human biology. God is not a physical, material being, at least not as far as we can conceptualize him, as existing in our perceivable, three dimensional reality. If he was, he could be destroyed, theoretically. A perfect being, something which perfectly embodies truth, could not be destroyed. It must exist beyond matter and entropy, beyond these dimensions of existence, outside of the mortal prison. I conceptualize God as a conscious being which exists in dimensions so much higher than our own and anything else, that the nature of its existence is unique defined by itself, "I AM". Completely impossible to conceive in relation to our experience, unimaginably more advanced. Compared to that, simply being here is sin. Sin is missing the mark, falling short of the glory of God. Jesus fell short of the glory of God. For one thing, we could begin to articulate what Jesus was. We could see him, touch him, even kill him. Not so with God. By virtue of not being equivocal, Jesus was by necessity sinful. He just kept the commandments and did what God expects from us, the ideal human.

       This is like the one thing the bible makes more clear than just about anything else. An angel tells Mary she is going to give birth to Jesus, and all the other shit that will follow, you know, the whole forgiving of sins and stuff. She then asks, "how, I'm a virgin". The only logical reason for her to ask this, is if she was confused by the whole, oh I don't know, understood biological impossibility of conceiving a child without

       It says exactly nowhere that Jesus is Joseph's physical son. It is more likely, from the context of the bible, that Jesus was the son of someone Mary slept with before Joseph, except the bible clears up the fact that Mary was a virgin, so that's impossible. Joseph actually thought Mary slept with another man before him, because he didn't sleep with her yet, and she was pregnant. His plan was to divorce her once she had her child, to preserve his reputation as a righteous man. He didn't want people thinking he consummated their marriage before they were married officially. That'd ruin you back then. Then an angel came to him and told him his son was going to be Jesus, and all that. The bible is pretty explicitly clear on this.

       I tend to wantonly reject most of the old testament in a literal sense, primarily because it contains the most self-referential, logical contradictions. Well that, and all the references of God as having human characteristics, like in pagan mythology, from which Judaism borrows heavily. The OT says a bunch of ridiculous and illogical things, like that god demanded Moses put a man to death for picking sticks up off the ground on Sabbath. Not just cruel or brutal, also unnecessarily cruel and brutal. It served no end, it achieved no purpose. It was just senseless stoning of an innocent man to death for no reason. For collecting sticks. One time. One Sabbath. Might as well just smash a big rock over the head of anyone that gets up out of bed that day. Rising from sleep is too much work for the holy Sabbath day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I regard the OT as a rougher, more flawed, less accurate, more
       <strong>
        human
       </strong>
       conceptualization of truth and God, at least in the literal sense. In many ways, the religious and psychological truths of the OT are very profound, just like pagan mythologies, from which Judaism clearly evolved.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of crazy shit in the OT that no one believes (and rightfully so) nor practices. If they did, they'd be convicted for capital punishment in every court system in the world except maybe some radical muslim countries where you can stone people for just looking at you funny like a fucking primitive ape-man.

       By the way, I was going to mention it earlier, but it is more perfect here. This God you are describing, is the Demiurge, according to gnostic belief. The god OF and IN the material reality, the self imposed prisoner-God of the wave-particle construct we exist within. Just saying, the Gnostics believe the God you believe in was an evil Demon of the old testament that the Christians you seem to criticize call would Satan.

       You are very confused. There is no conception of God that fails to stand in the face of logic more than yours. Even mainstream christians have a more logical notion of God than you. God doesn't have wrath or compassion, or hatred, or love. God just is. He's a primordial force like Gravity, as conscious as a sentient being. If God's relationship with us can be characterized as loving or compassionate or merciful, it's not because God personally feels love or compassion or mercy (he can't, he doesn't have a material form, let a lone a human form, from which we create these subjective interpretations). The relationship between man and God is such that it is viewed as loving, compassionate, and merciful, because that is what is true. That is what is necessary. This is the relationship that must exist between us for God's plan to unfold, for the time being. That's how we view it, from our perspective, how Jesus could help us conceptualize it. You can't begin to have compassion for an electron, or a proton. God can not have compassion for a human. His existence is unimaginably beyond comprehension and conceptualization within our three dimensions. There's no way we can attribute these human characteristics to God and it hold up to the definition of an entity actually fitting of the classical definition of God. Ancient Israel for example-shit would get destroyed as a consequence of the stupid choices of stupid humans. Those humans would say, "God is wrathful". No, God just is, and you made stupid choices that resulted in destruction. Ancient people would attribute everything they didn't understand to God, and what they did understand, they would mythologize to pass on to future generations as collected, ancient wisdom. Over several thousand years, we finally got some stuff right, thanks in large part to Jesus. That guy really understood wisdom. He probably was divine in some meaningful way. This is kind of how God works. We turn him into a person because we are people.

The OT says a bunch of ridiculous and illogical things, like that god demanded Moses put a man to death for picking sticks up off the ground on Sabbath. Not just cruel or brutal, also unnecessarily cruel and brutal. It served no end, it achieved no purpose. It was just senseless stoning of an innocent man to death for no reason. For collecting sticks. One time. One Sabbath. Might as well just smash a big rock over the head of anyone that gets up out of bed that day. Rising from sleep is too much work for the holy Sabbath day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I regard the OT as a rougher, more flawed, less accurate, more
       <strong>
        human
       </strong>
       conceptualization of truth and God, at least in the literal sense. In many ways, the religious and psychological truths of the OT are very profound, just like pagan mythologies, from which Judaism clearly evolved.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of crazy shit in the OT that no one believes (and rightfully so) nor practices. If they did, they'd be convicted for capital punishment in every court system in the world except maybe some radical muslim countries where you can stone people for just looking at you funny like a fucking primitive ape-man.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       By the way, I was going to mention it earlier, but it is more perfect here. This God you are describing, is the Demiurge, according to gnostic belief. The god OF and IN the material reality, the self imposed prisoner-God of the wave-particle construct we exist within. Just saying, the Gnostics believe the God you believe in was an evil Demon of the old testament that the Christians you seem to criticize call would Satan. You've got it exactly backwards to just about everyone.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A humble man shows mercy. Just as a humble King would do.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't think God shows mercy because he is humble. For one thing, that makes zero sense. What would God be humbled by?
      </p>
      <p>
       humble: having or showing a modest or low estimate of one's own importance.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's God. There's nothing to be modest or have a low self estimate about when you're completely, entirely perfect and the absolute embodiment of truth itself. To be humble requires you to measure yourself to something better than you. That's literally impossible for God to do.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Humble is a large part of being balanced, it's why he teaches us to do the same thing written within the book. To think that God is not humble is to say he is the opposite. The Lord is both Prideful and Humble when the situation requires for that is perfect balance. Him sending the first spirit back again will show that even though the world killed his grand creation, he will have mercy on the earth.
       </p>
       <p>
        He is a fair God, letting even the wicked have a time of rule.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You are very confused. There is no conception of God that fails to stand in the face of logic more than yours. Even mainstream christians have a more logical notion of God than you. God doesn't have wrath or compassion, or hatred, or love. God just is. He's a primordial force like Gravity, as conscious as a sentient being. If God's relationship with us can be characterized as loving or compassionate or merciful, it's not because God personally feels love or compassion or mercy (he can't, he doesn't have a material form, let a lone a human form, from which we create these subjective interpretations). The relationship between man and God is such that it is viewed as loving, compassionate, and merciful, because that is what is true. That is what is necessary. This is the relationship that must exist between us for God's plan to unfold, for the time being. That's how we view it, from our perspective, how Jesus could help us conceptualize it. You can't begin to have compassion for an electron, or a proton. God can not have compassion for a human. His existence is unimaginably beyond comprehension and conceptualization within our three dimensions. There's no way we can attribute these human characteristics to God and it hold up to the definition of an entity actually fitting of the classical definition of God. Ancient Israel for example-shit would get destroyed as a consequence of the stupid choices of stupid humans. Those humans would say, "God is wrathful". No, God just is, and you made stupid choices that resulted in destruction. Ancient people would attribute everything they didn't understand to God, and what they did understand, they would mythologize to pass on to future generations as collected, ancient wisdom. Over several thousand years, we finally got some stuff right, thanks in large part to Jesus. That guy really understood wisdom. He probably was divine in some meaningful way. This is kind of how God works. We turn him into a person because we are people.

       Unless you’re talking nuclear fallout, in which case we’re probably already dead, live like the natives did? Growing food is easy. Find a body of water. Find a mountain. All those dystopian films show people just walking down old roads and killing each other. The most conducive way to live would be in agrarian communities. Of course people will try to steal. Communities can build defenses. Problems don’t go away. They just change. But they’re still manageable.
