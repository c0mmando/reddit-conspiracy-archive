<p>Just last year, on this very board we were talking about how things were going to come to light. It seems like that is now the case with the abusers and pedophiles being outted every day. And also everything else happening in the world.   </p>

<p>Or is this all purposeful disinfo by Q to &quot;confuse the deepstate&quot;? What about the &quot;Trolling is fun&quot; thing? </p>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t Q brought up Israel in any meaningful way like he has with the left side of the political spectrum in the US?</p>

<p>Podesta is under investigation, it was revealed yesterday. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s really interesting that you note the problem of misinformation... </p>

<p>While I agree that it’s important that the Pope apologized, it’s not really unique. The Pope has “apologized” for lots of things. Previous Popes have apologized for lots of things. But that a bad May does not make. </p>

<p>Podesta is under investigation for foreign lobbying. Nothing to do with Pizzagate or any of the “crimes” he’s often accused of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Podesta has been accused constantly of foreign lobbying. It’s been open and obvious for a while, especially after Podesta left his lobbying firm last year in the midst of these exact allegations. What generates more discussion is the less obvious stuff that people are more curious about and gets less MSM coverage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 2 podestas btw. The brothers started a firm together, tony and john. Tony became chief of staff for bill clintons white house, left the firm to his brother, and ran the hillary election campaign/ &#39;the pizza gate guy&#39;. John was incharge of the podesta group when the manafort charges came to light. John was working WITH manafort in the efforts that got him charged. In responce, john podesta resigned from and closed the podesta group the same weekend.... Basically john podesta was doing exactly what paul manafort was up to in ukrain.... And his brother tony is the weirdo with creapy child artwork all over his house related to pg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the clarification! I&#39;m aware that there are 2 Podesta&#39;s - and I know I&#39;ve read on this sub, as well as other articles littered throughout the internet, suggestions that both Podesta&#39;s were involved in nefarious activities, including Pizzagate and the McCann disappearance. But you&#39;re 100% correct that I should&#39;ve been clearer in my first comment.</p>

<p>Give it time! This shit&#39;s got to unroll slowly for the normies and so the professional disinformation types are gradually exposed for the liars and frauds that they are. Be patient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prosperity scams like QAnon are built around allusions of great change and major, world-shaking events. They offer tantalizing secret knowledge of the events to come, available only to those who believe fervently enough.</p>

<p>Then, when nothing happens, the scammer invents another layer of lies to put around the initial lies as an effort to explain why nothing happened.</p>

<p>This is why these scams get more elaborate and weirder as they go forward - they have to invent reasons why the change didn&#39;t come.  </p>
