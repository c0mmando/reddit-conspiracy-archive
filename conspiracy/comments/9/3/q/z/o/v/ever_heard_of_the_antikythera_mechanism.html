       SS: I remember reading an article here and there on it, referred to as the oldest computer ever found, but I really didn't know much about it. Then I came across this BBC documentary. They explain how they found it, how they reverse engineered it, and how it all worked. So, then you might ask, why are you posting this here? whats the conspiracy.  Well, i'm one of those "craaaaazy people who doesn't believe we live on a globe" and I'm told over and over and over again, by people who argue with me, that without the heliocentric model, we would not be able to predict solar or lunar eclipses. This device is over 2000 years old, it can predict solar, lunar eclipses, down to the HOUR, COLOR, and DIRECTION of the eclipse and wait for it, ..... it was based on the geocentric model, with earth in the center. Now, this documentary by no means is a flat earth documentary, not even close, but the idea that we need the heliocentric model to predict things accurately doesn't have any feet to stand on. Anyway, it's a documentary that both FE and GE community could enjoy. Take what you will from it.

       Your premise is incorrect. A helicoentric model is not necessary to predict eclipses assuming that the moon is still believed to be closer to the Earth than the sun.

       I've been a "conspiracy theorist" since 2002. One day, my buddy back then,  gave me my laptop back, after filling it up with music, (we all backed each others' MP3s) with one extra folder called, 911. there was a video there called in plane sight. It's been a long time. almost 20 years of "conspiracy" research. sometime around 3 years ago, I came cross FE and i avoided it for a long time. Then one day i decided to look into it. took me 3 years to get comfortable with the idea, and I'm still not 100%, but i'm pretty god damn sure we are not on a globe. You want me to give you all my info, (it's all connected) over a reddit comment. Although we live in a matrix like world, I can not upload all my relevant data from 20 years to you in one serving. Just not possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       just watch this quick vid to just get familiar with the idea.  Then do your own research. Or don't. Some people should stay away from the topic. It can become a bit scary at first. but you'll get used to it. just like anything else.

       Just for starters: Ah, another video that cherry picks one particular airplane path that could be explained by one particutlar flat-Earth model, but ignores 1.) That the flight path is just as explainable with a globe-Earth model (see Great Circle routes), and 2.) Ignores the many, many airplane routes that simply don't work with any flat-Earth model. Flights turn out to have the wrong duration, don't fly over the right places, have distances that exceed the airplane's range, and so on. With a globe-Earth model, all the airplane flights fit the model. Not one flat-Earth model I've yet seen explains more than a couple of flights.

       I have no idea what you are talking about. The map you linked shows connectivity between points in South America and Africa which are clearly in the Southern Hemisphere of a globe-Earth model.

       You said " No connectivity between points in southern "hemisphere"  ". I in turn pointed out that this isn't so: " The map you linked shows connectivity between points in South America and Africa ". You did not originally say anything about Australia, nor did I.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for why there are no cables between Australia and South America, it probably doesn't make economic sense. That's 6000 miles, while Hawaii is only 4000 miles away and connects to North America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the North Atlantic cables are all longer than they would be if your flat-Earth model were correct, and all the trans-Pacific cables are shorter than they would be if the flat-Earth model were correct. Interestingly enough, the distances match the globe-Earth model.

       This isn't a "problem for the globe model". A problem is when something that exists cannot be explained by the model. An example of this is why the cable lengths for the existing trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific are significantly different from what a flat model predicts. I point out again that the lengths match what a globe model predicts.

       I suppose is we fall to the extreme of accepting only that which we directly verify ourselves, we can ignore a great deal of reality. Since you fall back on the "I'll only believe what I can test myself" mantra (while patently ignoring that you haven't measured any of the undersea cables either so can't actually say I'm wrong) I suggest you watch the series of videos beginning with
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;amp;v=JgY8zNZ35uw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;amp;v=JgY8zNZ35uw
       </a>
       . You won't appreciate the tone, I'm sure, but the series presents a number of observations that you can make yourself which will show you that a flat Earth model fails to predict observational reality.

       1 minute in and the "proof" is because it looks like it, except when it doesn't, which we can ignore because somebody else saw it. With this standard of "proof" you are going to get to believe anything you want. If you can accept this sort of reasoning, well, good day to you.

       Spheres are a natural consequence of gravity acting on matter.  That is why other celestial bodies are spheres and not giant fucking squares or rectangles.

       Considering you think the surface content of Earth somehow makes it exempt from the laws of physics, Ill try to keep this at around an 8th grade level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lesson 1: All matter in space has mass.  Planets have mass, "those tiny dots" (called stars by the way) have mass...asteroids, dust, atoms and everything else, has some measurable amount of mass.  These are facts.  Im sure you can agree with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lesson 2: Gravity exists.  It is one of the fundamental forces of the universe, and it acts on
       <em>
        everything.
       </em>
       Theres no way around it, and you can't
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       believe in it because it's quite demonstrably keeping your ass on the ground.  Once again, you really have to agree with me here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lesson 3:  Like I said all objects are subject to the force of gravity.  The larger the object, the more susceptible it is to gravity.  If an object is large enough, gravity will be what defines its shape.  Now you've heard the phrase, center of gravity right?  Of course you have.  The mass of a large object will create a gravity well theoretically centered in the midpoint of the objects mass.  Now the universe likes to be neat and consistent.  So as gravity pulls matter towards other matter, a sphere will form.  Because only a sphere allows every point on its surface to have the same distance from the center, so that no part of the object can further "fall" toward its center.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I would get into sacred geometry, Holographic Theory, Toroid fields, and tetrahedrons but i'll let you work your way up to that.  Just know spheres are an integral part of the building blocks of the universe, on all scales.

Did you actually watch the fucking YOUTUBE link i posted? It was  a NOVA doc. Youtube is just a medium. You can actually go back in time and listen to admiral Richard Byrd tell you what he saw in Antarctica! DO YOU FUCKING UNDERSTAND? How did you gain your "knowledge"? in a classroom from a guy who gets paid as much as a bank teller? parroting books published by who knows, edited by who knows, and distributed by who the fuck knows? You think they have YOUR best interest at heart?   lol that's adorable.  Knowledge doesn't come easy these days. You have to actually search for it. If it's given to you, you can bet your ass it's probably BS. Also, I've done my own research looking for the supposed curve over water. IT DOESN'T EXIST! I saw a beach that should have been at least 15 feet behind the "curve" and there it was. I was looking at it.

       thats where you are incapable of wrapping your little mind around it. STOP COMPARING EARTH TO THOSE DOTS IN THE FUCKING SKY! they are not the same thing! They exist! I see them. I take pictures of them! I don't compare them to earth. You are the one who is actually in a cult. cult of scientism.

        Good day to you, Mr. Ostrich. I look forward to the day you post this trash in this sub again and someone 100x smarter than myself, perhaps an actual astrophysicist, rips you a new asshole on an asshole-ripping level i could only ever dream to achieve.

       ASStrophysicist don't argue with flat earthers because they would get fucking owned. Their stupid little tricks don't work on us. Now go back to your video games and TV shows subs since thats clearly your favorite thing to do on reddit. This topic might be a little too difficult for you.

       PS:, stop beating down on yourself. You're not ugly. Just a confused little boy right out of highschool, not that bright and a little sheepish. Other than that you're good. it looks like you're about 25 years old. I've been researching conspiracies since 2002 working at a telecom company out of college. You were only 9!. fuck outta here boy.

       Actually, there a quite a few observations any and all of us can make that are easily explainable with a globe-Earth theory, but which are not explainable with a flat-Earth theory. I'll not repeat them all here, however, the "Testing Flattards" series on YouTube (

       ) among others does a nice job. Warning: these videos are rude to those who believe in a flat-Earth model. If you may be offended by rudeness towards your beliefs, try some of the other videos that also explain the many problems with a flat-Earth models.

        it was based on the geocentric model, with earth in the center. Now, this documentary by no means is a flat earth documentary, not even close, but the idea that we need the heliocentric model to predict things accurately doesn't have any feet to stand on.

       With what they could observe, and the mechanism is based on observation, not on theory, everything indeed could be explained by a geocentric model. Also, both models are wrong, simply because they are arbitrary points when you can't take the full picture in account. These days we have the computing power to make the gravitational calculations in way where we can put the 0,0,0 on the XYZ-scale anywhere we want. We could make a mars-centric model and it would still fit...
