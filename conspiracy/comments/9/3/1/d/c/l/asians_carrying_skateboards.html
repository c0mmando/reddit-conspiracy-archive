<p>Now we know that China is the gold medalist in propaganda, and they can stoop to mind-bogglingly petty levels of propaganda. But would they go this low and trivial?</p>

<p>Both Australia and the US have ramped up the anti-China rhetoric lately, so could China go this low?</p>

<p>Well, these particular Asians didn&#39;t look very sporty or co-ordinated. Nor did they have any &quot;rad&quot; fashion or tattoos. And their skateboards did look rather shiny and clean.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know the answer, but it&#39;s a very real possibility that this is a new low in Chinese propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me get this straight: Asians... in Australia... are somehow purveyors of Chinese propaganda? Do you really think that the Chinese are sending skateboard-wielding agents abroad to somehow convince the West to ease their anti-Chinese rhetoric? I’m absolutely open to the idea given more evidence but you’d need to present it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, China does have a $10 billion foreign influence campaign, that ranges from buying into Hollywood, to Confucius Institutes in Western schools, to an endless array of United Front operations that mobilise the Chinese diaspora to influence their local governments, etc. The question is: would they stoop to this level of petty propaganda? That&#39;s the burning question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of those means seem like they would be much more efficient/effective in promoting Chinese propaganda. I don’t think they’d waste money sending young skateboarders (a type of person that the older generations, who hold most of the political power, already judge/dislike) abroad. If I were them, I’d continue mainlining cash into the veins of West via the aforementioned methods. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a rational and reasonable interpretation of China. But time and again, I continue to be surprised by the scope and pettiness of Chinese propaganda, much of which seems pointless to us.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s because (a) China has billions in cash to splurge on propaganda and (b) the Chinese mindset is like a game of Go, which involves few rules apart from overwhelming your opponent with sheer numbers, using the maximum number of pieces on the board to surround your opponent. The Chinese mindset leaves no stone unturned, and leave no rack in the cue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, they probably have the skateboards to enhance their chances of a successful &quot;fight or flight&quot; if ot is necessary. Australia is known to have skme pretty deadly wildlife, and my friends down there have ahown me extensive material of outright violance to minorities there. Im not just talking people on working holidays or international students either, I&#39;m talking about your distaste for your new orleans visitors as well as your natives.
