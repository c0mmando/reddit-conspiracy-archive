    <div class="md"><p>SS: I know the internet allows people to do ungodly amounts of trolling, but I really feel whenever I discuss conspiracies to my friends and families they actually are empowered to do more research.</p>

<p>The most receptive conspiracy I always mention is 9/11 and it typically has the least amount of push back. I was wondering what&#39;s everyone&#39;s experiences with trying to explain conspiracy theories to your friends and family? Do they shut you down for the most part, or are the intrigued and do research on the subjects themselves?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main issue is 99% of conspiracy theories are complete bull crap with no evidence backing them up to hide real shit. Thing&#39;s like the moon landing and flat earth and free energy are designed to be easily disproven but widely pushed so the real conspiracy theorists who do their research and look into actual issues and corrupt people and possible government black sites get clouded in the mess of crap and it makes things like mk ultra and 9/11 and even massive 100% proven things like the paradise and panama papers just fly under the radar for most. Seriously panama papers should have changed the world when they were leaked millions of rich people hiding money to not pay taxes and call poor people leaches and everyone just forgot.</p>

Theories coming from the mouth of less reputable people don&#39;t hold much weight, unless they are masterfully articulated and all counter theories are sufficiently disputed. Unfortunately we are very prone to authority as humans. Authority takes many human attributes, whether it be skill or trait.

    <div class="md"><p>I have learned to explain these rabbitholes im going to list and I feel they are the quickest way to understand this upside down dark reality we live in. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Politics and how democracy is an illusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Ancient history and example of the Giza pyramides, ( how dark forces have surpressed the research and hold on to the official narrative , refusing any other explanation than that the pyramids were tombs ( bullshit , been to egypt 3 times , I will never forget the increadible sights , not only in egypt but every where around the world with ancient history is this going on, see Graham Hancock for better understanding , they are lying to us gentlemen</p></li>
<li><p>FOOD , how the western food culture is a big fucking diesease feeding cancer and this ofc connects directly  to the giant big pharma and western healthpractice of cutting flesh and giving lab made , man made disgusting pills.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Dr Sebi can open your eyes , he was an blessing to all of us , an holoistic doctor spreading the word : all diesease is originally from mucus which comes from the acidic food we eat , the way to go is alcaline whole food plant based diet.</p>

<ol>
<li>WHO CONTROLLS THE MONEY ? 
Also  usually my first opening line to someone and an effective question were you can use the socrates method effectivly , ask them about central banks, fractional reserve banking and WHO THE MONEY MASTERS ARE? </li>
</ol>
