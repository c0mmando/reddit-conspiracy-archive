       Think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the weirdest thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       People were rallying all over without fact checking anything. Plastering cities with posters. All the YouTubers telling their fans about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And one of the most memorable facts about the whole thing was the organizer getting arrested for drunken public masturbating. In my experience, whenever KONY 2012 comes up, it's always one of the first things acknowledged -- "Kony 2012? .....Oh yeah! Wasn't that the thing where the organizer guy got arrested for masturbating or somethin?" is usually how that starts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway. Randomly remembered it when I found an old Cards Against Humanity holiday gift sticker collection thing. And then thought about how the next election was dominated by that kinda stuff.... Weird...

       I just rewatched a South Park that references the San Diego nudity incident and decided to remind myself about what all happened. I think you’re on to something. I’m wondering now if some kind of mind control device was targeted at the director that caused his break down. Lots of people get famous from films they make or even silly viral videos but they don’t completely freak out like this guy did.

       When you say things like “pretty sure” and “must have” you don’t exactly inspire confidence in your comment. If you have a point you’d like to make, please do.

       It was uncovered that the amount of money that went to actual charity work was something like 1/3 or so. The organization was very spend happy and spread a lot of money around, but made it seem that all of their dollars were going to the cause.

       I knew that guy back in the day and he comes from an interesting family life / background. My sister had been following his charity work for a lot longer than the Kony thing was big, so I sort of knew that he was building towards something. Only recently has he come out of his exile and made some steps on FB to move ahead.

       That's not how TMZ works. They buy footage random people take with their cell phones. Do you also think a guy from YouTube recorded all of those videos?

       was suggesting was that TMZ got tipped off, that someone knew this breakdown was going to be taking place and wanted TMZ, and the world, to see it.

       I low key think that the shift on reddit from cats to dogs, specifically pitbulls, is a demonstration by a marketing/idea shaping group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, we can manipulate these idiots bring dangerous animals into their homes, maim, traumatize, kill their existing pets and family members, and then defend them to anyone who speaks sense. We've demonstrated results on this issue, more than online. People now bring their "emotional support" pits to grocery stores, restaurants, anywhere in public, exposing vulnerable people and blaming them when something goes wrong. And everyone else is too afraid to even speak out. What do you think we can do for your candidate? Your company? Your dangerous product? We'll have consumers begging for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a powerful selling point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if they'd done it with bobcats? Large reptiles?
      </p>
      <p>
       People are so pliable. It takes so little to make them feel like part of a group and take up the cause.

       I recommend watching the documentary "Century of the Self" to get an idea about this stuff (advertising psychology and PR). I can commiserate with you regarding your opening statement; the idea that insanely subtle, inconsequential cultural pushes can actually do
       <strong>
        anything
       </strong>
       is personally hard for me to believe as well but remember that you or I are not everyone. Any idea implemented throughout a society may only be properly understood by accepting we are on a bell curve and an advertising technique that doesn't work on you simply means you're not in the 'target audience'.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason so much goddamn money is spent on perfecting tiny advertising details to trigger
       <strong>
        the average
       </strong>
       American's baser instincts, it's because it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend never using the logic "this wouldn't work on me so who would be stupid enough to think it could work?", it's myopic and silly.

       i worked for an organization that tracked kony, he was largely irrelevant... even by 2012, he was on the run and not able to sleep in the same place twice. i thought the whole kony 2012 thing was comical given my inside information. theres no way this would have caused any military action from any country, we all knew kony wasnt worth the time.

       When I saw the video I remembered everything in it sounded very familiar and then I remembered I read about Kony like back in 2006 so that is where I knew it from and while it did seem suspicious that out of the blue this Kony guy who no one had heard from for years was now this huge problem what really seemed liked a red flag was the part in the video where the guy talking says "this video expires in 1 year".  It just screamed scam.

       Maybe not Diabolical, but it was a plot by the Creator of Pokemon. He saw computer gamers as being unfit and socially inept, he came up with a game to get them to go out and make friends. Each iteration of the game required a bit more social interaction, until he finally got sick of people not getting the damn hint and made a game that required you to go outside and get some damn exercise.

       Yea I guess I just sort of think when I hear “conspiracy” I think nefariousness. 
That doesn’t seem evil, it seems like a great way to get people active.
Even though he may have “conspired” to that end, I don’t think the word fits.

       Or is Conspiracy a neutral word that doesn’t HAVE to be negative. Genuine question

       I think that there is something to this theory. The Invisible Children folks came to my college in late 2010 or early 2011, and there were a few students, older and non-traditional who made comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those students were pretty much like "it sounds like you're trying to put boots on the ground in another part of the world when we're already stretched thin." Most of the younger and more social media entrenched students booed the question. The answer from the IC presenters was a boilerplate answer about doing what's right and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       Roughly a year later and Kony 2012 was trending like wildfire. I remember that incident because the older student who made the objection was a real piece of work, but he had a point.

        Uganda, AFRICOM, and the Kony Boogeyman
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When oil executives announced the discovery of the largest onshore oil reserves in the Lake Albert region of Uganda in July 2009, the landlocked, oft-neglected East African nation of Uganda went from relative obscurity to a key partner for multi-national oil conglomerates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although buoyed by the news, the people of Uganda were naturally cautious, having seen how oil finds in Nigeria and Angola have brought more violence, bloodshed and instability than peace or prosperity.
       </p>
       <p>
        These worst fears of Ugandans were lent further credence late last year, when President Obama announced he would be deploying US troops on the ground in Uganda, ostensibly to help capture Joseph Kony, the charismatic leader of a small rebel force that has been accused of murders, rapes and kidnaps in Uganda for decades. The timing of the deployment, however, coming at the exact same time as accusations that some of the highest officials in the Ugandan government were guilty of accepting bribes from international oil companies, only further confirmed that the deployment had less to do with Kony, an elusive figure who in fact left Uganda six years ago, and more to do with the securing of American oil interests.

       That's definitely what Kony was about.  It was all test psy-ops operation.  Kony was probably already dead and even if the wasn't, he wasn't active anymore.

       I mean, the guy might've just found an easy way to make bank using social media manipulation and strategies ahead of its time. He made the big theatrical video that surprisingly held the attention of a younger audience, who themselves were the audience of the said youtubers. It may have been a test by something higher up, but I think it's just a crazy smart dude whose crazy got the better of him.

       This conspiracy was broken wide open ages ago, everyone knows this was a known astroturfing social engineering campaign to con ignorant close minded people into spreading it further, kony was a photoshopped identity since there was no real soldier named that, pretty scary what you can do with a creative mind and a few adobe suite programs, will get even worse once AI becomes easier at faking videos and audio as well.

       site. It is a site that tracks known Russian bots and what narrative they are pushing. Or, things they want people to focus on. It is extremely interesting to watch it and see what they are doing. They love divisive topics

       didnt the original Kony2012 promoter have a mental breakdown in which he ran in the streets naked after people started criticizing him. makes me wonder if it was just a whole bunch of sjw hipsters that had no idea of what to do except make good social media campaigns.

       I remember in the video when they show a pyramid, turning it upside down, saying that the people had the real Power now, with the internet,  plus the association of democracy. I saw immediately something was wrong. 
I remember also the guy interviewing his kid for some reason, making the spectator at the same level. It was so obvious this whole campaign was forced.

       The thing is a lot of the people participating don’t know what they are even signing up for. I mean even the actual people organizing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When these types of tests occur, if they are tests, then they are made under the guise of something else and the people organizing are kept in the dark of the true intentions.

       It’s like how there was that “accidental” nuke warning in Hawaii. Now there no proof that it was done on purpose but it wouldn’t be wrong to think, perhaps the government did it just to see how people would react.

       This was happening while I was in my last stretch of undergraduate school. I couldn't help but think the same thing WHILE it was happening. People were going NUTS over this Kony movement. There was even a group of African kids who came to my school to lecture us and try to get us to get behind the movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       They played a slideshow of people who have already donated and sponsored and it was just riddled with, well let's just say, 'western elitist' companies and organizations. There were posters throughout my entire school and I specifically remember the Kony 2012 posters being the SAME EXACT colors of the red/blue gradient that was used for U.S. elections around the same time.

       There is DEFINITELY something to this theory and I'm glad, 6 years later, I see someone is on the same page.

       Yea I guess I just sort of think when I hear “conspiracy” I think nefariousness. 
That doesn’t seem evil, it seems like a great way to get people active.
Even though he may have “conspired” to that end, I don’t think the word fits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is Conspiracy a neutral word that doesn’t HAVE to be negative. Genuine question

       The creator of Pokémon is Satoshi Tajiri and he's autistic and made pokemon only for the collecting aspect... the social parts seem more like they were forced by Nintendo or someone else at the pokemon company.
