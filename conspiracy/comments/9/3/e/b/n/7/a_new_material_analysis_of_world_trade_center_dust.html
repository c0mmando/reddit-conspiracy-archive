       I study the World Trade Center dust. I have a theory about how the dust was produced on 9/11/2001. Technically, my work is not a conspiracy theory, although my results force a change in mindset about who the real perpetrators could have been. I'd like to talk about this theory. It's based on a new material analysis of the World Trade Center dust. I called it a "new material analysis" both because it is a new analysis, and also because it's a new material. The WTC was largely turned into iron-rich powder at low temperature, and I'd like to talk about that and suggest a new physical mechanism that might explain it.

       What usually happens is that people get caught up in their own idea of who did 9/11, and they never want to talk about the physical evidence that I can produce, at a trial, if necessary. I'm a scientist, and I've spent the bulk of my time the last 17 years on this study. It's not well appreciated, yet, but it isn't a fraud. I might be wrong, but I'm sincerely wrong, if so. I'd like some sincere conversations, if possible.

       Drop 500 tons of rough material on something made of meat.   And then set it on fire.

       You're not going to end up with anything that even looks like meat.

       Erm no. Steel beams don't disolve or get thrown 10s of metres by fuel, or 1000 plus bodies with no identified DNA (no skin, blood, body parts). Or iron burning for 6 weeks in the basement

       Ok but steel dissolved and burned for 6 weeks according to satellite data. So is that scientifically explainable? Maybe 1000 bodies plus could be burned how? The fire was restricted to a few floors, the collapse happened then the fire burnt 1000 people to ash? Ok

       Ok so over 1000 bodies that are supposed to be there, and that's because they were squished? Oh and the 10ft hole (before the facade fell in) in the Pentagon was an airplane . Ha, love you you are so required

       Idk why youre so fixated on "1000 bodies" but its been proven that being crushed and burning is gonna make you ash and goo basically, I mean you can literally crush another mans skull with a rock what do you think tons of falling debris is gonna do to our meatsack bodies

       It won't shatter them. Bodies are recovered from collapsed buildings all the time. They are squished and broken, but still bodies. That's really not much of what we saw on 9/11. The bodies of the victims inside the building ended up as fragmented as the building itself.

       He's not wrong. The DNA was not burned up by a fire of any sort. I have WTC dust samples, and they still contain DNA all these years later. The people were as shattered as the building was. The shattered remains of people are mixed in with the WTC dust.

       The contents of the WTC as well as the building itself was turned into powder. It's not easy to verify the remains of people when their bodies have been so completely destroyed. The WTC dust contains organic material, which is, sadly, probably remains of the people.

       Yes, I will. Thank you for asking. I earned my PhD in a field of biochemistry in Houston, but I always wanted to live in NYC, so after I graduated I moved there in January of 2001. I was living downtown when the attacks took place. On the first day, I knew something was wrong about the story of a plane crash causing near complete destruction of the WTC .... from a chemical perspective. There's just not enough energy in a plane crash/jet fuel splash combination to turn these steel buildings into powder, but I didn't know what was able to do this. 9/11 humbled me. I knew I'd have to learn something new in order to understand 9/11. By day 2 after the attacks, I was interviewing survivors and searching for WTC dust samples. I eventually found a gigantic amount of the WTC dust, collected it, and conducted a material analysis of it.

       I tested the WTC dust for radioactivity, and there isn't any (above background). I'm not sure if Israel had anything to do with it, but I know two things. One, an entire country can't commit a crime, so we need to be talking about individual people and the actions that they did that contributed to the crime, not whole countries or groups of people. Israeli people might have done 9/11, but I'm waiting for evidence of this. What evidence am I waiting on? That's number 2. The evidence must be about advanced weaponry used to turn the WTC buildings into iron-rich powder at low temperature, or I won't have much to say about it. My research indicates that it was a low temperature process, and the dust is iron-rich (far richer in iron than has been previously reported).

       I spent 400 hours helping Judy Wood write her book and gave her $2000 to pay the filing fees of her Supreme Court case. I'm not Judy Wood, and her work has nothing to do with me. I supported her work. She was not involved in my work at all. We aren't the same type of scientist. She derives things from mathematical principles. I am the type of scientist who digs in the dirt to find samples. She is an engineer type. I'm a biology chemistry type. Our work shows it. No one who is familiar with both of our work mistakes the two.

       A recent nuclear-911 post here talked about steel absorbing high energy neutrons shattering individual molecules but converting them to stable heavy isotopes of iron, explaining lack of radioactivity in the dust. Or the process of instant sublimation of steel and subsequent condensation into micro droplets of iron that the dust consisted of. Reports indicated the dust cloud was hot, but maybe not scorching hot. It's also possible the contents of the building were crushed mechanically from an immensely powerful shockwave emanating from underground. Either way large shallow underground nuclear explosions seem responsible for the damage, as evidenced by extremely high temperatures under all 3 buildings emitting (radioactive) vapors for over 3 months, despite massive amounts of water and radiation suppressants being dumped into them.

       Reports indicate that the dust wasn't hot. If the dust were as hot as 100 degrees C, that would boil the lungs of anyone it landed on. Also, nobody who got caught up in the dust cloud was burned. Also, paper is found unburned mixed in with the dust. Also, the iron-rich powder isn't composed of iron droplets, but rather sharp-edged iron fragments. High heat would have made droplets, not shattered fragments. Also, high heat would have completely eliminated any organic material in the dust, but the organic material is still there (in addition to visible paper). Also, the seismic data do not support a gigantic explosion at any point, but I'm not an expert on this part of it. What you call "vapors" lasted more than 3 months. They were fully intense for at least 3 months, certainly, but they were still going strong more than a year later. With all the water and dirt being thrown on the pile, this is strange. Plus a full year that included a very cold winter? Heat doesn't really hang around like that.

       I suspect that the energy for destruction came from within the material itself, and that human beings have advanced technology enough that we can tap into the energy of matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember Marty McFly and the Professor's "flux capacitor" in Back to the Future? The Professor pours a beer in, then the beer can, and a banana peel. It doesn't state specifically in the movie, but it implies that to get the energy to run the car, all you need is matter.

       The above is speculation. It's a guess. This is very different from my findings that I'm not guessing about. The WTC was destroyed at low temperature, over time, from the inside out. 100% of my findings are consistent with this hypothesis. I have been studying the physical remains of the World Trade Center, the WTC dust itself, in order to come to these conclusions. I'm a chemistry type, not a weapons type, so not an expert in weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       What TYPE of weapon did the damage is a guess. I think it was a weapon that uses magnetic energy because magnetism can work without a significant change in temperature and for other reasons.

Not really. I posted a lot of it in a long, long thread on the skeptics website, but nobody really wanted to discuss it. They all insisted that I was a stupid crazy liar, and the discussion went nowhere. I've also been banned on 9/11 truth on reddit. There's a lot of hate in the 9/11 research movement.

        I think you're missing something here about people: they don't like their time wasted. Why would anyone engage in long drawn out discussions pertaining to some evidence that you supposedly have but will not produce? That's probably why people are acting this way, it sounds like a larp.

       You didn't furnish evidence then and still won't.  Why?

       This is hard to respond to, because you've already counted me out. You're already saying I "still won't" provide evidence. My instinct tells me I shouldn't work hard to try and explain things to you because of this aggressive attitude. It doesn't seem like you sincerely want to find out what I've discovered about the WTC dust. I'll focus on talking to people who seem sincere instead of people who discount me.

       Ok but steel dissolved and burned for 6 weeks according to satellite data. So is that scientifically explainable? Maybe 1000 bodies plus could be burned how? The fire was restricted to a few floors, the collapse happened then the fire burnt 1000 people to ash? Ok

       The contents of the WTC as well as the building itself was turned into powder. It's not easy to verify the remains of people when their bodies have been so completely destroyed. The WTC dust contains organic material, which is, sadly, probably remains of the people.
