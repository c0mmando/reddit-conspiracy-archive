        The city allowed people to return to Manhattan after the collapse of the World Trade Center towers even though officials were told the air was not yet safe, according to an internal memo from a New York City Health Department official. "EPA officials were aware of the severity of danger at Ground Zero in contrast to their public statements at the time." NYC allowed people to return after the collapse of the towers because the mayor's office was under pressure from business owners to open more of the "red zone."

       A lot of details about how incompetent and evil some officials were about failing to inform the emergency workers and the surrounding public about the dangers of toxic dust after the government knew full well that it was extremely toxic:
       <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/new-docs-detail-how-feds-downplayed-ground-zero-health-risks">
        Records obtained by a New York worker-safety group describe how officials in the Bush administration as well as federal agencies removed health warnings and misrepresented test results on air quality
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At least 1,000 people – and probably many more – have died often lingering, painful deaths resulting from illnesses related to their exposure to debris that spread from the wreckage of the World Trade Center towers in downtown Manhattan. More than 37,000 are officially recognised as sick.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Within the next five years we will be at the point where more people have died from World Trade Center-related illnesses than died from the immediate impact of the attacks,” said Dr Jim Melius, a doctor at the New York State Laborers Union

       Many people claim the government couldn't have had any involvement in 9/11 because they would not kill their own people. This is obviously false as you can see from my post.

       If you want to talk about the government being a corporation or whatever, that's fine, but maybe make a separate post for that.

       No, I agree with you. I was just posing a question to those who have never considered any of these kinds of possibilities. In this day and age “your” government might not necessarily see you as “their people”. Was all.

       This isn't an online link or a scientific article, but if you're interested in Chernobyl at all, you should read "Voices from Chernobyl" (available in pdf form

       ), which features interviews with all sorts of people who worked in or lived around the plant. It discusses a lot there what the "regular" people were told and how workers would get sick and die from radiation poisoning. It's disturbing but very interesting.

       Yeah they hand that out to the uninformed who live near the plant in my home town. The best thing those tablets do is create the illusion of radiation safety. If the shit ever goes sideways Iodine is going to be akin to the Coyote umbrella versus a Steinway.

       Well, you'd have to take the iodine very early on in the emergency and at a very specific time with regard to the amount leaked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the government's first (and second and third and...) move is to lie about what's happening and what's being released, by the time anyone knew to take the iodine, it would be too late.
      </p>

       But, as you said, they provide

       They needed the number to echo the number killed (allegedly, I guess) at Pearl Harbor. So many of the deaths are probably fabricated entities. All of them? I tend to not think so.

       This is definitely one thing I don’t understand. Throughout the course of modern history, almost any time there is any sort of situation where some man made material source is making people sick, it gets dealt with...
      </p>
      <p>
       ..except for this one. There are first responders that have died from just being there searching through the rubble for the first few weeks, or even days...something happened at GZ—some sort of dirty fusion, or whatever type of devices were used or planted for the attacks, giving off radiation, as well as turning two materials into one (fusing objects like iron etc)—that left people who were there for any extended time, extremely sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this ever were proven to be a false flag 100% without a doubt, the amount of damage done would stretch generations...no wonder it’s gotta be played so close to the chest of these government officials.

       I remember reading somewhere that there was a point where the specialists called in said that the building wasn’t safe and might collapse, but instead of evacuating they told everyone to stay in their offices and even stationed security to keep them from leaving
       <sup>
        citation needed
       </sup>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason was that they knew there was almost 20,000 people in the building, and they didn’t want them clogging the streets of lower Manhattan making it impossible for first responders to do their job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignoring the immense irony of that statement, and whether it was their true motivation or not, it does make me wonder what the logistics of evacuation Manhattan island — or part of it — would be. Say the air isn’t safe to breathe ... people try to leave. How long does it take? How many people would it take trying to leave at once before everything jams up and no one can get anywhere? How many more people would die in this process?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no clue what the answer to this thought experiment is. Maybe someone smarter than me can make a guess.

       Yes. Read the links in my post. There were many different chemicals in the air, such as asbestos, PCBs, dioxin, etc.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The result was very high … EPA is saying it is one of the highest levels they have ever seen." The level was about 1,000 times higher than normal for dioxin.

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Worthy also to note that among rescue workers
       <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/11/health/911-cancer-treatment/">
        cancers are not predominantly of the lungs
       </a>
       (which negates the shill-argument firefighters get sick because they "inhaled a lot of ash" on 911).
      </p>
      <p>
       We are rather seeing
       <a href="http://nypost.com/2014/07/27/cancers-among-ground-zero-workers-skyrocketing/">
        prostate, thyroid, leukemia and multiple myeloma.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Firefighters know how to deal with "ash". That's basically their job. They have masks. They had nothing to protect them however against the high level of radiation at ground zero that day (and that continued for weeks/months thereafter). That's why they're falling ill, and why their symptoms/ailments are congruent with the hypothesis of radiation exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "ground zero" had no other definition at the time than being the site of an atomic blast. Watch
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Lec9giab90I?t=14m1s">
        this

       , or read Khalezov's book linked in the video description, if you're interested in the hypothesis of a nuclear demotion.

       I just watched a vid showing pictures of the cavities underneath where the towers stood. Smooth, rounded and marble-like in texture. All swirled together. There is no way in hell nano thermite can get hot enough to do this to bedrock. I’ve always kept an open mind to the possibility of nukes being used, but now more than ever I’m convinced. Of course we still see thermite charges before they collapsed. The question is whether they were used in conjunction with the nukes, or just as a distraction for the masses to bite on in the years to come. The think tanks that pulled this off know what they’re doing. This post will get downvoted of course because it’s forbidden to discuss this angle here, but if you look at what happened to the bedrock underneath the towers, it is pretty obvious.

       The cavity you mention has been there for thousands of years, it's a glacial pothole in the Manhattan schist. It was nowhere near the Twins, not even quite inside the "bathtub" and much closer to WTC4.

       "Nukular 9/11" may sound plausible at first, but whenever you look at the evidence presented more closely, it crumbles to dust.

       And where’s your source for that? Explain the swirls found specifically in the bedrock under ground zero.

       Explain the presence of strontium, barium and other nuclear elements in the dust samples found all around Manhattan, with the highest concentration found in the sample closest to ground zero.

       Other than the sickness reports (which come from government sources) and the video footage (which came via MSM), what have you got?
      </p>
      <p>
       What evidence exists for a nuclear 9/11, or indeed
       <strong>
        any
       </strong>
       9/11, that
       <em>
        wasn’t hand delivered

       via some government mouthpiece or other?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you realise the implications of this, you’ll stop focusing on trivial, unprovable, unverifiable details and start pulling back on the whole charade to look at the whole picture.

       Not the way you probably think of it.

       Ask yourself what proof exists, then, look into that proof. How can it be verified?

       9/11 was a brilliant scheme, most probably something to do with alerting those who pay attention to the
       <strong>
        absurdity
       </strong>
       of the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nukes, death rays, terrorists?! All nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was just staged, a straightforward smoke and mirrors act. What actually happened on 9/11 was absolutely mundane by comparison. A controlled demolition in a cordoned off section of downtown Manhattan, dressed up via the magic of the controlled media to be the 9/11 we all know and love.

       People had to get to work. Nobody just got the day off and was told to stay home due to hydrant flushing or whatever.

       There are numerous accounts of evacuation drills of various kinds happening that morning. Of course, few people would recall such details clearly given the events that transpired...

       September Clues remains the best documentary dealing with the comprehensive co-ordinated media fakery that was required to pull off 9/11. I always recommend the

       What is the source for all of these claims? Can you verify the source? Has anyone verified it?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it’s a government agency, or mainstream media... then it’s unreliable pish.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the evidence presented to the public arrived via the very same channels that broadcast the laughably fake live plane strike video clips, and which later broadcast various “amateur footage” clips, all of which tie back to people in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the evidence is trustworthy, all of it is likely fabricated or tampered with. Watch September Clues. The video evidence is a proven forgery beyond any reasonable doubt. The same is true for all the photos of “toasted cars” and whatnot, which gradually trickled into the mainstream media long after the event itself had unfolded.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rock I can explain though. All of Manhattan looks like that, if you visit Central Park you can see more examples just like it. I’ve personally verified it with my own eyes.

       Everyone was watching TV, or the first damaged tower. Almost nobody was paying attention to the tower without the gaping hole and flames, and what they could see was a (literal) smokescreen anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to surprise yourself, look into the number of verified “eyewitnesses” who are on record as having seen and/or heard a plane. Look at the initial video clips of people on the street which never aired a second time. They refer to an “explosion”, not a plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody actually saw any planes hit anything on 9/11 because it didn’t happen, that was only on the TV screens.

      <p>
       A bunch of empty towers in a secure,cordoned off and fully evacuated area of downtown Manhattan were brought down in a conventional controlled demolition under cover of military smokescreens. The rest is all fairy tales and nonsense.

       At the end of the day, 80% of the towers turned to dust in mid air, that isn’t disputable. That isn’t consistent with a typical controlled demolition, particularly the aftermath which persisted for 100 days.

       Dmitri khalezov makes some good arguments. I just watched the 4hour video recently and read it on his website.  If he's legit then he's got plenty of experience with nukes.
      </p>
      <p>
       His explanation for the dustified towers makes more sense than death rays. In the 60s and 70s it seems they had a more open mind about nukes and I saw a funny picture showing the usefulness of nukes.  It showed 4 different explosions,  1 In the atmosphere,  1 on land,  1 under water,  a 1 underground..  Under a tall building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing pics of the bedrock under the towers is convincing too.

       Ok, but that is why there are numerous 9/11 compensation funds and rescue workers receive millions of dollars for these injuries.  What more do you want done?  We can't reverse the injuries.  But they do get a fair amount of money for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, even if you did prove it was a "nuclear demolition," it would not change the compensation these people are getting.   I just don't see what your point is.

       Those diseases and injuries are already covered under the  Health and Compensation Act of 2010.  There is no "truth" to expose.  It is already known, exposed, and being paid for.   You can read about it here:
       <a href="https://www.vcf.gov/pdf/VCFPolicy.pdf">
        https://www.vcf.gov/pdf/VCFPolicy.pdf

       Radiocative materials are commonly used for various commercial and medical uses.  For instance, smoke detectors commonly have radioactive materials. (
       <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/radtown/americium-smoke-detectors.html">
        https://www3.epa.gov/radtown/americium-smoke-detectors.html
       </a>
       ).  You are not exposing any hidden wisdom with the fact that the 9/11 Towers contained these materials.   You are not exposing any hidden wisdom that people suffered injuries from these radio active materials.  That was well known, and the people are being compensated for radiation injuries form 9/11.  Sorry, you are about 8 years too late with your "truth."  But, you should be happy that the US Government exposed in 8 years ago.

       That's what happens when you breath
       <em>
        irradiated
       </em>
       asbestos dust -- it sticks in your lungs and exposes you to radiation through the entire decay cycle. This was known, planned, ahead of time.... part of the greater purpose of 9/11: It was a small-scale test to see if they could induce cancer to the population and cover it up with the media and medical industry. It worked, so we've seen the plan rolled out en masse. This will be remembered as a very dark time in human history.

       One of my clients is a retired NYC firefighter and basically his whole family were firefighters.  He lost his cousin on 9/11.  His brother died a few years ago from lung cancer despite never smoking cigarettes.  He’s terrified that he’s going to get cancer too and gets checkups several times a year.

       My father was a fire fighter present during 9/11 and during the cleanup for months afterwards, now he has lung complications (difficulty breathing in the cold, needs a machine to breathe in winter). It’s only a matter of time, all of his friends there with a very few exceptions have either died on that day or have since succumbed to any number of horrifying cancers and diseases. He told me a few months after 9/11 he responded to a sauna spa on fire and he was exposed to the steam in one of the sauna rooms, shortly after that he began violently coughing up “grey goop”.

       Sorry for your loss.  There are numerous 9/11 compensation funds and first responders are routinely compensated for 9/11 related deaths, even this many years later.  If they have not already, they should look into the various 9/11 compensation funds because they pay significant money for cancer victims.  Nothing is going to stop the injury they suffered, but there is substantial compensation and medical care freely available.

       You can tell most people seek to balance their own self-interests with others, because they find it so hard to understand the simple psychopath. I say simple, because the psychopath is a subset of what all of us could be. It's just a self-serving machine deficient in empathy and emotions. If we just look past our emotions and concerns for others and see the world as gain and loss for ourselves exclusively, we perceive in the way they do. It takes mental and emotional work for us to suppress our better parts, but  it's natural for these self-serving robots.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we do poorly at detecting these beings and their machinations, because they play a game of manipulation chess all day every day with others while we try to get along with them in balance. In order to overcome these predictable self-serving machines, we have to predict them and that takes mental and emotional work to an extent.
