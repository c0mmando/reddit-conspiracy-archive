    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to separate cause and effect there.  If people start abandoning transit for automobiles, wouldn&#39;t the mass transit system lose riders and then funding, slowly withering away due to lack of demand?</p>

<p>The GM/streetcar conspiracy isn&#39;t so much an argument for eliminating mass transit as it is a shift to buses.  I think buses get a rap for being worse than rail systems like streetcars because at the same time GM squashed streetcars, the public decided it liked driving cars a whole lot more and the transit systems withered from lack of use, creating the impression that buses are worse.</p>

<p>You can make an argument that buses are better than streetcars, since they can alter routes much more easily.  You can adjust routes easily because you don&#39;t need to build train tracks when you move the route.  You can mix locals and express buses on the same route without worrying about the local getting in the way of an express; a rail line with an express and a local needs parallel tracks or complicating switching and timing at stations to share the same set of rails.</p>

<p>Rail systems with dedicated rail beds can beat buses in speed because they don&#39;t mix in traffic, but the costs skyrocket for segregating rail traffic from street traffic.</p>

<p>IMHO, the typical city bus mostly sucks because the local routes will stop at every corner for new and departing passengers, making the ride very slow and time inefficient.  If buses would only stop at designated stops every few blocks, the routes would be much faster and eliminate a lot of excess stopping.  My pro-transit friends say this is discriminatory against old and handicapped people because they would be forced to walk a couple of blocks to get to a bus stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your typical urbanist is very anti-car for a bunch of reasons.  The first is the general ideological overlap between urbanists and environmentalists.  Cars create bad pollution generally and especially in dense urban areas because you end up with a lot of them in the same place.</p>

<p>The next is that urbanists dislike the way that accounting for vehicle traffic affects urban planning generally.   It interferes with pedestrian travel, valuable real estate gets tied up in providing parking places, and requiring parking inhibits businesses who can&#39;t easily or directly provide parking and raises the cost of building new buildings that have to provide parking spaces as part of the structure.  This also adds to the cost of new housing -- a developer can add more units to a new building for the same money if they don&#39;t have to require a parking space for each housing unit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think many of these are <em>bad</em> arguments, but when urban planning meets an anti-car <em>agenda</em>, you can wind up with what amount to coercive, anti-car policies designed to discourage driving.  IMHO, this mostly backfires and feels like it targets ordinary people since the rich will still be able to drive and gain access to the remaining higher cost parking.  The ordinary people end up going where they can park, which winds up being outside the areas trying to engineer away car use, reducing economic activity.  Push out cars, push out economic activity.</p>
