        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Overton window, also known as the window of discourse, is the range of ideas tolerated in public discourse. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Wikipedia.</a></p>

<p>“The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum....”</p>

<ul>
<li>Noam Chomsky</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s not a surprise that the main stream media strictly limits the range of discourse that is considered acceptable. We are now moving into the meta stage of the Overton Window due to the Internet that has provided a platform for alternative information to flow into the once closely guarded minds of its citizens. But as they say, all good things must come to and end and the good old days before the shilling and the astroturfing are long gone. Even subreddits like this one is no longer safe. I mean who is to say that the same thing that is happening in the MSM(the purposeful limiting of acceptable discourse) isn&#39;t now happening here?</p>

<p>Are there topics on this sub that are never discussed or purposely buried? That&#39;s probably where we should be looking. </p>

<p>Well, if you look at forums like 4chan and 8chan where these conspiracies start, you also see a LOT of illustrated child porn. I think they&#39;re so comfortable accusing everyone else because they&#39;re guilty themselves, like a republican caught with a boytoy.</p>

<p>Owned? No, never bought a gun. </p>

<p>Operated? Enjoyed? Borrowed for extended periods of time? Cleaned? Shot empty gas cans out of the air while drinking beers and yelling like a red neck? Yes. I have absolutely no problem with guns or gun enthusiasts. </p>

<p>I have major problems with politicians and special interest groups that take advantage of those enthusiasts by whipping them up into an emotional frenzy over an invisible gun grabbing boogeyman in the most gun friendly country on the planet so they can secure their votes.   </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I put very little stock into what the media has to say but thanks for talking down to me. You shouldn&#39;t dismiss another persons opinion as irrelevant because it&#39;s different than yours. That&#39;s how we never learn. I disagree with your stance on the gun grabbing but I respect that opinion and don&#39;t dismiss it out of hand.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you familiar with dissenting opinion in Heller? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Fail to see any gun grabbing in it. The second amendment was upheld, as usual. As <em>always</em> in this country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you aware that it was a 5-4 decision? Do you know what would have happened if Hillary had won this past election and gotten two Supreme Court picks?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She didn&#39;t win. Enjoy your guns. The Courts upheld the 2nd amendment like they always have and always will. </p>

<p>If they ever stopped selling guns here the entire economy would collapse. Never mind the complete impossibility of ever being able to physically take them away from the population. There&#39;s just too many out there. </p>

<p>I&#39;m an old man, I&#39;ve been listening to the gun debate for longer than I can remember. I just don&#39;t buy that they&#39;re ever coming for them. Let me know if they do though, I could be wrong and am willing to admit that. Are you? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t give you the satisfaction since you don&#39;t seem to respect differing opinions. It would just be an exercise in frustration for both. </p>

<p>This has been a theory pushed for decades, started as a way to block gay marriage (if we let gays marry then kids will be next). Pretty sure at this point it&#39;s just everyone&#39;s imagination but it&#39;s a handy false dichotomy to keep people bigoted</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it&#39;s a known fact it&#39;s a disorder right? Did you go through those links because that&#39;s not about letting them act out but finding ways to let people be able to live a life with the condition so I guess there&#39;s a difference on what acceptance can look like. From the NYT  article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These people are living with pedophilia, a sexual attraction to prepubescents that often constitutes a mental illness. Unfortunately, our laws are failing them and, consequently, ignoring opportunities to prevent child abuse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see that as going towards a direction of letting pedofiles molest kids but total demonization doesn&#39;t open any avenues for a pedo to seek any help. If it&#39;s even possible to help them that is. But the articles  were about the system in place isn&#39;t doing enough to prevent the abuse from happening in the first place like it says in the vice article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She said if pedophiles were less stigmatized, they might be able to get counselling before acting on their urges.</p>

<p>&quot;How are we going to understand these sorts of people if we don&#39;t talk to them?... If they&#39;re too scared to speak up and say anything, how is it going to be prevented?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this the right way to go? I&#39;m not sure, but I&#39;m not sold that there is some covert movement to let minors be sexually abused</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there are shills all over the internet. Corporate marketing departments, PR/reputation management, think tanks, lobbyists, political action groups, non-profits, NGOs, media companies, intelligence agencies, military intelligence, other law enforcement and government, and all of the individuals who are dependent on the aforementioned groups for their livelihoods (post online about this, or else). Not to mention all the collusion between the shills and those who run the online communication platforms and publishing outlets (Reddit included).</p>

<p>The good news is that even trillions of dollars worth of shilling can&#39;t cover up all truth.</p>
