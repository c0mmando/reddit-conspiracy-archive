        The it was a joke shit is stupid too. He had many engagements with convicted sex predators and pedos but uses one case he left bc a pedo was there lmao... If you work with underage people and joke about that, you should be fired and not forgiven. Jared the subway guy made jokes like that and it ended up being true

       Yep, and they're stupid and not funny and I think Disney probably made the right decision.

       Still nowhere near as bad as confessing to raping a 13 year old. The fact that you don't seem to understand that is honestly a little frightening.

       Gunn was pals with Lloyd Kaufman and Huston Huddleston amongst others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Huston Huddleston was convicted of child pornography and recently sentenced. He was a facebook friend of Gunn. Here is a post from Gunn's blog which he tried and failed to scrub from the web during his rush to shutdown his blog on Friday.

       Alright, let make a scale then...
      </p>
      <p>
       What's off limits?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the rape of 1 baby objectively worse than the holocaust? Millions of people suffered, is that better than the suffering of one fictional baby? How about regular rape? If I make a joke about 10 people being raped is that too many fictional rapes? How many fictional rapes for the sake of a (admittedly, tasteless) joke is too many? Where do you draw the line? Are jokes about real world events not across the 'line', but jokes about baby rape that hasn't happened are?
      </p>
      <p>
       Comedy has no 'lines'. You obviously have to be conscious of what you're saying publicly if you work for a family company like Disney, but nothing is off limits in comedy.

       So being a comedian is a requirement to make edgy jokes ? Personally I found some of them really funny and didn't understand others at all , but like you said they might be inside jokes for all I know

       no, but being a comedian at least gives it some context and some reasoning behind those jokes. Also, a comedian usually has a target audience, like people who would get these so-called edgy jokes. Who was Gunn's target audience? Definitely not the PG-13 crowd.

        Dissociative identity disorder (DID), also known as multiple personality disorder,[5] is a mental disorder characterized by at least two distinct and relatively enduring personality states.[1] There is often trouble remembering certain events, beyond what would be explained by ordinary forgetfulness.[1] These states alternately show in a person's behavior.[1]

       Hollywoold is running damage control because they don't want to acknowledge there's a pedo problem in the industry.

       Gunn deleted 10,000 tweets and his blog, many posts contained posts normalizing child rape and paedophilia.  Of course now Gunn and his apologists claim these were all "jokes."

       I find it extremely interesting that Hollwood, James Gunn, and his supporters rushed to boycott and call for the termination of Roseanne Barr not less than two months ago.

       Don't mind me, just noticed the Roseanne Barr mention in your comment and wondered to myself whether you've ever posted something critical of Trump, or the right in general. It would appear not. I'm not trying to defend Gunn here, but it would appear this recent crusade of yours is more about defending Trump and attacking his enemies than anything to do with pedos.

       Great find. He also posted this comment just two months ago:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Epstein had close ties to the Clintons. Apparently Bill rode on the lolita express over 20 times documented, and Hillary was on it "unofficially" around 8 times.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I wonder if he has a problem with all the time Epstein spent at Mar-a-lago or this conspicuous quote by Trump:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Donald Trump told New York magazine in October 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”

       Look I think paedophilia is repulsive and should not be accepted at all. Epstein is a creep.  Bill and Hillary were frequent fliers on the pedo express. Bill Clinton visited pedo island regularly.

       I think pedophilia is repulsive also. Epstein is definitely a creep. Trump had tons of dinners with him, spent time with him at mar-a-largo, and praised him over and over again. That's a problem, right?

       I said it's most likely that Epstein was likely allowed to roam freely to get blackmail on others. You brought up Epstein not me.

       Now as for you comments, you're pushing a specific agenda without listing verifiable details.  You don't actually want to discuss child paedophila. You just want to goad me into criticizing Trump.

       You're the one banging the drum about Pedophilia. That's great- it's a serious issue. But if you care about it then you can't ignore Trump's ties to one of the most heinous pedophiles in recent history. The details are 100% verified. What else do you need to know? Trump and Epstein were so close that the FBI found
       <a href="https://alliedprogress.org/news/trump-terrific-billionaire-new-labor-nominee-went-soft-sex-case-involving-underage-girls/">
        ...“14 different phone numbers for Trump, including numbers for his security guard and houseman” "

       Personally I think that Trump had awareness Epstein was a creep.  I do not believe Trump partook in Epstein's child buffet, unlike the Clintons who actually appeared to be involved in the sex trafficking racket.

       Bill might be. I don't know for sure but his time spent with Epstein is definitely suspicious and should be investigated. I've no love for Bill or Hillary Clinton so I don't know what you're so worked up about them for. Anyone who spend that much time with Epstein should be investigated. Especially Trump since he has such a long history of sexualizing young woman and sexual assault- I mean he was already accused of raping a 13 year old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh well, at least I got you to admit he's, at best, a pedophile enabler. I'll take that as a win and hope you come to your senses later. I've got bad news for you though- Bill and Hillary Clinton's crimes don't make Trump's disappear. You'll have to learn that one day.

       It's very funny you talk about 'deflection' but completely deflected responding to Trump's VERY SUSPICIOUS ties to Epstein. No one is arguing with you about the Clinton's. You're arguing with yourself. We're talking about Trump calling Epstein terrific and how much they enjoy women 'on the younger side'. Address that please.

       Well Roseanne made a racist comment aimed at a real living person, that day. James Gunn made shitty edgelord jokes about no one person 10 years ago. Even if you agree with the outcome, the situations are not the same. Is it really difficult to tell the difference?

       Why is that an excuse? It's pretty clearly racist to compare black people to apes. Couldn't James Gunn use that same excuse. "They were jokes, actually raping children wasn't ever in my mind!"

       Weak fucking excuse either way you slice it.

       Why? That was 6 years ago. You don't think someone can become racist in 6 years? There are KKK members today who weren't racist/KKK members six years ago. People change.

      <p>
       Irregardless- it's still a racist comment. Full stop. If she doesn't hold racist beliefs, that's great but she still said something very racist. Why would she get a pass for that? Wouldn't letting that slide be normalizing racism?

       Roseanne says she didn't realize the person she was comparing to an arp was black and that she thought she was Jewish which would make her fair game in Roseanne's eyes since Barr herself is Jewish.

       I'm not saying that racism is a good thing when in fact I am surprised it is still going as strong as it is since I was taught everyone is supposed to be equal when I was growing up.

       Yes, everyone has the right to free speech. But that means freedom to say what you want without government persecution. That doesn't mean freedom from all consequences. ABC is private company, they employed her if they want to fire her because she is bad for their brand/image they had every right to fire her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like Disney had every right to fire James Gunn. I think the circumstances were different, and if it were me i'd be more lenient on Gunn because of how old these tweets are, but I don't fault Disney for exercising their right to protect their brand. They had every right to fire him and I don't blame them for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do find it funny that people are bending over backwards to make Roseanne's comment okay. Speaking out of ignorance doesn't somehow make it fine. You shouldn't get a pass for being
       <em>
        accidentally
       </em>
       racist (If you even believe that excuse that she didn't know VJ was half black- I don't believe that at all and I don't see how anyone can). Roseanne had no excuse for not knowing better.

       Because nobody cared about James Gunn back then enough to look into his tweets, and the people who did were fans of his who understood the jokes he was making. Everyday people who are not fans of Troma and Super aren't going to get the humor and that's fine, but now these same people who don't understand are trying to hold him accountable years later as if they understand better than anyone. It's frustrating. I don't get a lot of pop country radio, but if people want to brag about sleeping with girls in trucks, that's their problem. No one was hurt by these tweets, just offended. Can we just let that be that and get over it?

       You do realize that Gunn worked for Troma for years and wrote Tromeo and Juliet? He was also an actor in Toxic Avenger 4.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, another reason people keep mentioning Troma is because some of the "offensive" tweets were part of a back and forth joke thread he was having with Lloyd Kaufman (the head of Troma).

       Yes, I was already aware of that. I have watched Troma movies for years.

       Why does everyone want to think there is a lot of pedo friendliness to Troma? There is a difference between bad taste, adult nudity, and then posting what Gunn posted to/with a convicted pedo.

       Looks like some modern day marketing to me. Any news is good news. Massive threads and controversy over your movie? More people going to see it. Briefly clicked on one of them (didn't read it) and saw the very nice looking signatures of famous actors at the bottom. Give me a break. This is paid bullshit marketing in the modern day, just like their Thanos snap garbage. Disney is good at what they do.

       Strange thing about those posts is they literally have an order of magnitude more comments than the rest of the front page threads. 5,000 comments each vs 250-500. Yes, what an important issue.

       Yes, because that's literally their job: to make up stuff, to say things they don't believe, to create non-existent people, make up stories that didn't happen, etc.

       Just like pizzagate, there is no solid evidence that James Gunn is a pedophile. No one has come out to accuse him of messing with them, or their child, no other pedophiles have said they consider him a pedophile; In America it is NOT illegal to be acquainted to perverts, but it is for obvious reasons frowned upon. The anger people feel about his firing is that Disney conveniently ignored it when he was hired years ago, and now it's suddenly and career ending offense, for no other reason than people brought it up again. I understand why it happened, I think it's unfair, but that doesn't make him a pedophile, and everyone jumping on the bandwagon because you don't like it, he can't go to jail just because you dislike him. You managed to get him fired, silver lining as far as I'm concerned is that it's another great director who will hopefully go back to making films where he doesn't have to constrain to a corporate image. Looking forward to the next Super.

       As I said before in another topic.  Disney was well within their rights to terminate Gunn.  Ironically Gunn supported boycotts and firing others for similar behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gunn deleted 10,000 tweets and his blog, much of which focused on pre-pubescent kids a little toooooo much including frequent "jokes" about child rape and sexual abuse of children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disney is a family company. They are well within their rights to terminate and blacklist a director that could harm their company image.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's happening now is a PR push by paedophile supporters in Hollywood to try and turn the focus away from Gunn and Harmon, whitewash their activity, and create public normalization and acceptance for paedophilia.

       You know what NAMBLA stands for, right dude? I'm 100% for the legal principle of assumed innocence; it's one of the backbones of a civilized society, but don't be so cavalier.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's, at best, a super fucking weird exchange with a registered sex offender and the topic was about their experiences at a organization built to foster sexual relationships between boys and grown men.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very possible that James Gunn just has a weird sense of humor. That's cool and perfectly legal. But to completely ignore such an odd exchange is dense, and I don't think you're dense.

       Still no solid evidence. And Gunn shares the same opinion as you, free speech isn't illegal, but companies can hire and fire you at their discretion. The public outcry is not to normalize pedophilia, but to avoid normalizing the punishment of directors for mistakes in their past that are not even illegal. It shouldn't matter that he's apologized or not(he has), Disney fired him because they thought people would not go to see a movie directed by him after they read tweets of his from before he started working with Marvel. People are trying to use their voices and the internet to say that they would in fact see another movie by him. Others are using their voices to say the opposite. The final decision is up to Disney, personal opinion is up to you and me, and my opinion is that it's unfair, and I would like to see Gaurdians of the Galaxy 3 directed by James Gunn. We can't always get what we want, but it can't hurt to ask.

       The hypocrisy is deafening in that Hollywood is circling the wagon for Gunn's frequent "jokes" focusing a little tooooo much on child rape and paedophilia, yet there was zero groundswell of support for Roseanne Barr.
      </p>
      <p>
       Barr was the Green Party Black Caucus representative. She's said more than a few times that racism never factored into her tweet that got her show canceled and fired.

      <p>
       Hollywood including Gunn raced to publicly lynch Barr.

       I’m sure there are some that fall into both groups, there are also a lot that realize the difference between tweets that are 10 years old and tweeting while currently employed. Had Roseanne been fired for past tweets it would be a better comparison, but rather, like Gunn, she was offered an opportunity to show she had grown since her offensive days and given a second chance with her new show, much like Gunn had been offered a chance to helm a major film and show he was more than a shock horror writer.

       I'm trying to focus on the paedophilia aspect because honestly that should be the focus per the self.text.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the hypocrisy is astounding.  The same people that viciously attacked Trump for a private consensual affair with stormy daniels and for a hot mic "grab em by the pussy" comment  that both happened over 10 years ago are the same group of people defending Gunn and Harmon for something far more reprehensible (and possibly criminal if suspicions prove true).
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes down to it, people defending and acting as apologists for Gunn and Harmon's frequent disgusting comments on child rape and sex abuse of children are simply normalizing acceptance of paedophilia.

       Well, USA overreact in general, I don't believe that neither of them diserved getting fired, maybe a public apology. On the other hand IDGAF about Roseanne Barr nor her show but I think James Gunn was doing a nice job with Guardians so I understand why people care more about him and Harmon, who are clearly no pedos, to the other lady who is not necessary a racist.

       Gunn made statements normalizing child rape and paedophilia in public over a period of years.  Of course these are just "jokes" right, who was his audience?  Huddleston (convicted of possessing child pornagraphy?) or other paedophiles?  I doubt Gunn wants to answer those questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       To contrast Trump made comments in private between him and Billy Bush. The comments were in poor taste.  Trump never expected a private conversation would become public and that's the basis of "locker room talk" statement.

       Sigh, nobody gives a fuck about Stormy. It’s the hypocrisy of the Christian Conservative crowd holding Trump to a different standard than every politician before him that upsets most, and the cover up and hush payments that probably came from campaign funds that bother some others. Nobody cares Trump fucked her. Also Trump was BRAGGING ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT not making a joke to Billy Bush. That’s twice now you’ve tried to make a false equivalence with a bad comparison about false outrage to justify your position, once with Trump and once with Roseanne, all to show off some sort of fake hypocrisy coming from the left. We get it, you’re mad Roseanne got fired for being racist and Trump got caught being kinda rapey, and it makes you feel better if rather than being bad people they were just targets of the some good old fashioned liberal hypocrisy, and if that means you have to willfully remove context or pretend you don’t understand what a joke is that’s what you’re going to do. And if that fails, well then it’s time to ring the ‘normalizing’ alarm. Just like murder has been normalized by Brooklyn 99, and incest normalized by Arrested Development liberals are joking their way to making baby fucking the wave of the future one tweet about water pressure at a time.

       Oh I agree, the general public does not care.  The MSM however was pushing it for months like it was a scandal of epic proportions like Bill Clinton getting blown by an intern (Lewinski) in the oval office.

       Jokes aren’t normalizing anything. People joke about killing people and it’s not to normalize murder. In fact the jokes rely on how reprehensible pedophelia is for their shock value. Harmon’s creepiest thing was actually a reference to Dexter normalizing murder and a commentary on how fucked up that was.

       Or we dont think he's a pedo? You can't just call anyone a pedo and then use that as an argument against defending them. You're just trying to create an echo chamber.

       You could use this logic to shut down a defense of literally ANYONE. Roseanne is a racist. Don't defend her, what are you, a racist? Trump is a sexist. Don't defend him, what are you, a sexist? Obama is a traitor. Don't defend him, what are you, a traitor?

       Sigh, nobody gives a fuck about Stormy. It’s the hypocrisy of the Christian Conservative crowd holding Trump to a different standard than every politician before him that upsets most, and the cover up and hush payments that probably came from campaign funds that bother some others. Nobody cares Trump fucked her. Also Trump was BRAGGING ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT not making a joke to Billy Bush. That’s twice now you’ve tried to make a false equivalence with a bad comparison about false outrage to justify your position, once with Trump and once with Roseanne, all to show off some sort of fake hypocrisy coming from the left. We get it, you’re mad Roseanne got fired for being racist and Trump got caught being kinda rapey, and it makes you feel better if rather than being bad people they were just targets of the some good old fashioned liberal hypocrisy, and if that means you have to willfully remove context or pretend you don’t understand what a joke is that’s what you’re going to do. And if that fails, well then it’s time to ring the ‘normalizing’ alarm. Just like murder has been normalized by Brooklyn 99, and incest normalized by Arrested Development liberals are joking their way to making baby fucking the wave of the future one tweet about water pressure at a time.
