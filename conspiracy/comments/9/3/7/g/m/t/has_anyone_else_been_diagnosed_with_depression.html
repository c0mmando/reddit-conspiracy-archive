    <div class="md"><p>Sadness, within limits, <em>is</em> a normal human state. We all go through the blues at times - but an official diagnosis of <em>depression</em> by a medical professional is something to be taken seriously. I&#39;m not arguing this kid should be given a strong dose of Prozac or checked into the nearest hospital - but I am arguing that sticking around on a subreddit as opposed to pursuing treatment options is probably not a good idea. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a Conspiracy subreddit or one dedicated to fishing or the Backstreet Boys - don&#39;t get your health information from the internet, especially one moderated by people who are not qualified to give that information.</p>

<p>There&#39;s such a chip on people&#39;s shoulders about mental health - the brain is no different from your heart or your lungs or your kidneys. If it&#39;s not operating efficiently (and I think depression would qualify as something that detracts from that operation), you do what you can to address and mediate that issue. The kid should pursue their options with a professional - someone who is trained to address mental health issues.</p>

<p>I’m not sure that’s why he came here - I don’t know OP and haven’t spoken at length in regards to their concern. Unless you have been corresponding via DM, I’d say you’re reading far too deeply into a rather short post. All OP states is that they have been diagnosed with depression and that they are concerned with the future of the world. Nothing about pharmaceutical companies or medication at all. </p>

<p>And I agree with you, that overmedication is a REAL thing. But the idea that the logical response is to instead push back and discourage medication no matter what is a very dangerous one. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That tells me that this person is anxious for a way to deal - nothing more and nothing less. And surely you can agree our forum has its own fair share of “whackos”, no? That’s not a criticism - in fact, that’s one of the reasons why I like this place. The diversity of belief and thought is fantastic - but I would never encourage someone to trust complete strangers with no medical background to determine whether or not they should address their mental health via a doctor. That is a decision to be made by OP - hopefully, with the knowledge and assistance of someone who deals with health professionally. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This sounds like you’re writing yourself - and your own hang ups with psychiatrists, the pharmaceutical industry, etc. - into this person’s post. OP stated nothing related to what you’re saying. </p>

<p>And yes, I am aware of how the pharmaceutical industry has negatively impacted medicine. But to come away with that idea and posit that medication, in general, is bad and not to be considered is very dangerous. You know nothing about OP (again, unless you’re friends or have been communicating further via DM) and yet you’re encouraging actions that could, conceivably, make this person’s state worse. As I stated before, I’m NOT advocating that this person be immediately placed on an aggressive prescription - this person may not need any medication at all. But you can’t know this - I can’t know this - the only person that MAY be able to know this is someone who is a medical professional. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Community is a fantastic thing - but don’t forget: this is the internet. This sub, like any sub, is a manipulated and artificial forum. Conspiracy theory has taught me a lot - mostly, to question each and every thing, including what I read here. This sub should not be immune to that type of critical thinking. If I’m having heart palpitations, it wouldn’t be very smart of me to post in the cardiac arrest forum expecting accurate medical advice. </p>

<p>In so many ways, the internet has both positively <em>and</em> negatively impacted society. When it comes to health, one should address their issues through the most effective means possible - consulting a medical professional is almost always going to garner a better chance of success than soliciting advice from complete strangers who have their own specific belief systems and mindsets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depression just means that your brain is mishandling the management of Serotonin. </p>

<p>Once you get that management aspect under control, the conspiracies are still there. </p>

<p>To do that you need to seek the proper help. Be that targeted medicinal (SSRI etc), theraputic intervention or holistic.</p>

<p>The medicine isn&#39;t the trap. How its prescribed is the problem. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is completely true. But for some people the medication can also help. </p>

<p>I personally feel that a small dose (say 10/20 micrograms per day), over a short period limited to less than a year, can be beneficial to people who find it hard to open up in therapy.</p>

<p>Large doses over sustained periods of more than a year, are not what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen people from the US speak of 140+ doses per day. Thats madness.</p>

<p>My doctor insisted on weekly visits for the first 2 months and was very hesitant about even the 30mg.</p>

<p>But I firmly believe that medical responsibility is significantly lower in the states, than here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you, I&#39;ve taken 1 1/4 of Ativan in my life.  Literally 1 pill and 1/4 of a pill in the span of 4 years.  One was for severe panic attack and the other was for a family member&#39;s wedding that I was in.  Lowest possible dosage along with actual counseling/therapy...but they don&#39;t do that anymore, do they?  I just personally feel that stress = evolution so if there&#39;s not this pain and confusion especially with these sorts of foundation-rocking revelations people don&#39;t change.  Imagine getting interested in conspiracies, getting a little upset and then getting on an anti-depressant.  There goes you caring as much.  There goes any possibility of exploring something that would have naturally and easily both transitioned you into other realms of truth-seeking and quelled your physical pains/issues.

<p>They way you are speaking I think you may be a bit confused on which medication is which.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve taken Ativen, which is a brand of Lorazepam. They are similar to Xanax, Valium and a host of other &#39;relaxers&#39;. They have an immediate and obvious calming affect on the mind and body and are used for anxiety, shyness etc. Sometimes they are prescribed to depressives in order to mitigate the side effects of their other medicines. SSRIs can give you random limb movements in the first few weeks, for example. A relaxer can control that.</p>

<p>SSRIs are completely different (Prozac etc). They are long term serotonin uptake inhibitors. They regulate the serotonin entering your brain so that you dont &#39;use it all up in one go&#39;... which sounds a little mad, but that&#39;s what depression is on a physiological level. </p>

<p>The regulated serotonin to your brain sets you to &#39;normal&#39;. It puts your mind in a place that allows you do do stuff. It doesnt make you happy or sad or relaxed, it just makes you capable of being a person without the crippling weight on your shoulders, that stops you even trying. </p>

<p>Taking one has no obvious affect on a person in the moment. It takes a 6 week minimum before any affect is achieved. </p>

<p>This is completely true. But for some people the medication can also help. </p>

<p>I personally feel that a small dose (say 10/20 micrograms per day), over a short period limited to less than a year, can be beneficial to people who find it hard to open up in therapy.</p>

<p>Large doses over sustained periods of more than a year, are not what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;you know what your problem is? you think about things too much. you need to stop worrying so much about things out of your control. perhaps if you werent obsessing over such dark things you wouldnt feel so depressed. yes, of course you feel alone, youre spending your time looking up terrible things, that NO ONE wants to be reminded of! Perhaps you should speak to a therapist, i don&#39;t know how to help you.&quot; (read, woah... wayyyy too much redpilling, i give up)</p>

<p>..... go to therapist. explain conspiracies.. at length. cite evidence. cia files. international treaties. pleadingly look to doctor. </p>

<p>&quot;you think too much. you need to stop worrying so much about things out of your control. these will help chase away some of your depression. you&#39;ll be feeling better soon. until then, i just want you to stop spending so much time doing your &quot;research.&quot; okay?&quot;</p>

<p>it happens. be careful. i was you twenty years ago. we were referred to as the prozac gen or the adderall gen. we were guinea pigs. the first gen to have access to the internet, ere go the first ones to explore the forest by sorting through the trees. good news is, you&#39;re here. where, if numbers tell the truth (they dont) you have over 500k people just like you. it gets dark. it gets scary. it gets remarkably lonely. IT IT WORTH IT. the only way we will beat this is if we stick together.  if you need help, i&#39;ve always got an ear. welcome to the other side. </p>

<p>So my advice is to picture what a happy and fulfilling life looks like <em>to you</em>. Society will make you feel like happiness is owning a nice luxury car and spending a ton of money of vacations and fine dining, etc. You may not need much money to be happy.

    <div class="md"><p>Stay in the solution. Act with love and patience. Empower your friends. Take up a cause. Often, depression is misdiagnosed. Life sucks. Especially when you’re 15. Chin up soldier. Read: the four agreements-Ruiz. Don’t keep using the word depression, thought + word = action. You create your reality with thoughts. Glad you’re here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What has helped me is realizing on a macro level here in 3d these rules of the game: predation, deception, parasitism, and manipulation. Baked into the system.. and that includes all creatures that swim crawl fly or walk. Plants disguise themselves to trick birds and insects into pollinating them...animals of all kinds use trickery to survive and breed. Apex predators always prefer theft to having to outright hunt. Even bacteria engage in it. Why would humans be exempt from this process? There is a consistency in nature. A huge percentage of humans are still driven by their primitive brains and not self aware or conscious in any larger spiritual way. The good news is many of us ARE self aware and this is a spreading phenom. We are trying to ascend, IMO, out of 3d and it&#39;s old school tough rules. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been researching the whole income tax scam and it&#39;s honestly pretty depressing to think that all these well-meaning people are forcing you to donate your money to the IRS out of some misperceived patriotic obligation. It&#39;s all voluntary and the IRS does their darnedest to convince you that it&#39;s not without actually saying it&#39;s not. Sad to think people are willfully giving their money away because they think the law requires it. So much money being donated to the IRS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have older coworker who arrived here a few decades ago from a war torn country. Sometimes we discuss conspiracies and often I’d remark that what’s eventually going to happen is terrifying to think about. He told me that the world has always been at war. The bankers and money-changers have controlled things for centuries and centuries, and eventually they will have to answer to their creator. We’ve known peace for the most part here in the West for the past few decades, but in the grand scheme everything, it’s been only a short time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im in the same boat and im 30!!! Its been 6 years of straight insomnia and depression for me and it got worse with learning more about the prevalent pedocracy that infects the planet this past year and a half. Im shutting my smart phone off soon because I realize it has a big impact on my being and want to be rid of it for a while and see how I feel. I think just this constant interaction and information at the palm of your hand all the time just drives you nuts. Its like your brain doesn’t have enough CPU power to process all your thoughts. The only good thing that’s come of it so far is it slightly pushed me towards going back to school and wanting to get into cyber security and wanting to catch the sick bastards through the dark web or something. Plus the fact that we have the resources to end poverty and everything else A thousand times over gets discouraging to go to work for very minuscule amount of money every day. Take care and best of luck to you. I know how you feel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depression, anxiety, and social isolation can all make somebody more likely to be interested in this kind of stuff. All that matters is what evidence leads you down what roads, and how you execute your delivery of shaping the world to compensate for the ignorance of others. Probably everybody in the world knows something that everybody else would be better off knowing in favor of discarding their knowledge of other useless information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh. After four or five years of being paranoid I began to realize that there were a lot of cognitive errors within my thinking and ended up pretty agnostic in regards to this stuff. Still pretty open minded but also aware that it&#39;s not always as bad as it seems and our brains are programmed to see tigers in bushes even if they&#39;re not there so be aware that you also have cognitive biases going on just like the sheeple and the world may not be <em>quite</em> as bad as it seems</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s not a popular view, but depression can be a perfectly reasonable reaction to a screwed up world (though we often delude ourselves about what is screwed up due to bias). I would advise (though I&#39;m not a head headshrinker) that you abandon hopelessness based on conspiracies and look closer to your own life. Life is clearly problematic. You are born you do some stuff and think some stuff and then you die and all the things that had meaning to you are put in double strength garbage bags and placed on the curb. You can be a kind and generous person. You can be a sad, hopeless person. There is no map. You make the rules. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was feeling pretty depressed and over everything. Finding out the truth has set me free. (Truth being the we certainly don’t know the truth) The made up world we live in makes no sense and can’t be worked out. Knowing that nothing is actually logical, totally explains why I feel like I am not getting it...... although I don’t always try to explain my world to others and am dead scared of going to a therapist. I only expose questions to those asking or needing them. I am scared my logical approach to problems would turn a therapist into a conspiracy theorist. Lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as this sub will make you believe this world is horribly corrupt, don’t let it get to your everyday daily life. Sally at the grocery store isn’t profiting from defense contracts by bombing your family; your family doctor isn’t ripping you off by lobbying for insurance/pharmaceutical companies (he might be part of the system but that’s not his fault); and Betty at the front counter of 53rd bank isn’t trying to take advantage of your parents through government insured mortgages. Most people are good people, it’s just a select few that fuck everything up. I’m glad there are young people out there willing to look at more serious issues when the media would want you guys to argue over which gender-bathrooms you can use or what trivial shit Donald did today</p>
