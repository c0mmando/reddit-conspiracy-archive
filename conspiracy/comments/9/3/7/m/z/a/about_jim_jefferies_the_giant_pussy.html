        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Can someone please tell me who it was who told Jim Jefferies he was informed on American politics, and who the fuck decided to give him his stupid fucking show, which he embarrasses himself on every time it airs? Who keeps giving these comedians a political platform to spew their bullshit onto all of us and in turn make the population dumber? There are way too many liberal bias talk shows on Comedy Central, how much more do we need? I thought Jim was funny until he turned into this LA douche bag talking down to anyone who happens to be just right of center, or in other words, a logical, non-retarded person. This is seriously getting out of hand and no one is speaking up to it. This stupid aussie puss needs to quit acting like America is not the greatest place to be. I cant stand people just shitting on our country while reaping the benefits of the entertainment industry, basically biting the hand that feeds your ungrateful fucking face. Anyone care to weigh in on this? I know i will probably get shit on about this because he is a funny man. Either way lets hear it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy is that the media pushes hard to spread liberal ideas, using &quot;comedy&quot; as the medium.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, but does the actual body of the post read like someone investigating a supposed media conspiracy or does it read like unfocused outrage over another liberal comic?</p>

<p>Because to me it reads like the latter.  This post isn’t about facts or even really focused on the conspiracy.  OP is using the idea of the media having an unspoken liberal agenda as an excuse to vent.  That’s al this is.  And for that reason, it doesn’t belong here.  It doesn’t further the collective understanding of the world for the users of this sub, nor does it build on previous posts of actual substance.  </p>

<p>Anyways, go listen to some good comedy like Bill Burr (for the angry folk), Doug Stanhope, Rory Scovel, Joey Diaz, Louis CK, Bill Hicks (also angry and woke AF, RIP Bill), George Carlin, Jim Norton, etc.</p>

<p>I think we all feel the same about a lot of these comedy Central shows wanting to be John Stewart but none ever will be and we all think they are programming Americans to be passive about any issue whatsoever </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the irony of it, the people who broadcast how left they are have started hating people with their same agenda. Jim Jefferies has just filled the void that was left from Jon Stewart, Colbert Report, and Letterman all ending. Jim has the taste and logic to not talk about Trump every episode. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modern conservatism is dead as an ideology: racism, xenophobia, drug war, tax cuts for the rich, climate change is a lie, and on and on.  All of it wildly unpopular and growing more so.</p>

<p>Progressivism is just starting, since late Obama, to gain traction again after so many years in the conservative American desert.  Legal pot, gay rights, metoo, income inequality, better healthcare all extremely popular.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha that&#39;s what everyone outside of America thinks of America. He is fantastic. He has been so blindingly honest his whole career, I&#39;m hoping he stays true and keeps on trucking. I don&#39;t like the anti Trump stuff (I&#39;m not American), but fuck its everywhere. I don&#39;t think Jim will be in Hollywood for a long time, and you better believe he will have some good material from that period. </p>

<p>&#39;There&#39;s a lot of guys up there who like wearing a suit or try doing jokes that they think will play to a certain crowd, or maybe get them corporate work. I&#39;ve always written jokes that I would want to hear. So, I&#39;m trying to entertain myself more than anything&#39; -Jim Jefferies</p>
