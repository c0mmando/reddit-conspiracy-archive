<p>High blood pressure causes tinnitus, adrenaline and stress (fear for example) causes high blood pressure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have paid close attention to this and attempted to eliminate confirmation bias etc. Happens very predictably sometimes. I used to be able to predict when it would happen after i sent a certain type of email on a dime. I would be perfectly calm and relaxed. I think its a form of telepathic feedback.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re right it happens predictably.  it also manifests as a step function - that is there&#39;s a distinct &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;.  thus i reckon there&#39;s a technical cause.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dunno.  I have had it after sending or reading an email, but that is usually if it is an important or consequential one.  Like if I have to send an email that says I am not going to meet a deadline.  Not extreme fear or anything but it happens with stuff like that.</p>

<p>Just my experience and the theory I have come up with that seems to make sense with biology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first video connects the ringing to gangstalking. Perhaps the stalkers themselves organically create this ringing in the victim through some mechanism unknown to us. The attention they give as a group creates some effect.. Odd that the Cuban sonic attacks have a similar feel. Weaponized wives tale courtesy of the CIA?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tinnitus. You get used to it. Eventually you won&#39;t even notice unless you think about it. </p>

<p>Although if you haven&#39;t you should go to en ENT specialist; there&#39;s always a chance it&#39;s something more serious and you could eventually go deaf. </p>

<p>And I specifically mean see a specialist. Regular GPs are notoriously bad at seeing problems with ears. </p>

I’ve seen three neurologists, two gastroenterologists, three pain management doctors, a sleep study doctor, not to mention my internal specialist and general practitioner several times in the past two years (NOT for the ear ringing, but a multitude of health issues.)

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t listen to it just for distraction. Find a good set of bass rich in-ear headphones, and start with low volume and low pitch. Bass sounds seemed to soothe me, and the buzz or hiss seemed to go away after listening to it, for a bit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I have a somewhat connected story, I&#39;m gonna share it, might help somebody. Sorry for somewhat bad english.</p>

<p>So, I had that ear imflammatory proccess that started like 10 years ago, caught it in my right ear, with car window draft and hot-cold sudden change, in summer. </p>

<p>So, the indications were mild buzzing, occasional pops (like those candies that pop), and very strong sensitivity to loud sounds (I had to wear some plug).</p>

<p>So, doctor said it was tinnitus, gave me strong antibiotics, said it will never completely cure, might as well get used to it (fuck that) as it will come back from time to time. So, with that antibiotics and plug, it went away about month later, sensitivity to loud sounds stayed for at least a year.</p>

<p>And occasionally, in next few years, I would get pain as if needle was going through my ear (pierced eardrum? Is that a diagnose too).</p>

<p>So, 6 or 7 years passed , everything was ok, and I get severe cold which I felt going up from my throat to my ear, and while cold got better, my right ear started buzzing and popping once again.</p>

<p>Month of pain in the ass (well, ear to be precise) and went to best ORL doctor in town, Prof.Dr at the Uni, all bells and whistles. He says there&#39;s nothing in my ear, no need for washing it out, gaves me the strongest antibiotic there is, says it&#39;s tinnitus, I&#39;ll have it for the rest of my life, some go crazy, some get used to it - his words.</p>

<p>Also, advise - no loud music, no in-ear headphones.</p>

<p>And I love music very much.</p>

<p>Antibio session passed, with no good result.</p>

<p>I suspected something is in my ear, even though he said it wasn&#39;t, and the sound of bass (not thumping, but constant) from in-ear headphones felt soothing and relaxing, as I didn&#39;t hear the hiss or pops when I listened to loud music.</p>

<p>So with my own music therapy, about month later, bass, cranking it louder, vibration felt good, something happened, and I have zero problems with ear for ... 3 years now.</p>

<p>Might help someone.</p>

<p>Next time you have to visit one and they&#39;re trying to prescribe you some sketchy pills you never heard about ask him if the piece of shit has an agreement with one of the pharmaceutical mafia corporations.</p>

<p>Thing is: Many western doctors have silent agreements to push experimental pills nobody ever properly tested for long term effects on you in exchange for $$$.</p>

<p>This is bad with European doctors already but guess what happens in the US. when you&#39;re being treated by someone who is maybe 50k-300k in debt, because they were tricked by the education mafia. That person has a lot of incentive to be a quack, like most western doctors are anyway, and give you those tasty poison pills.</p>

<p>People think here vaccines are bad, now you got to swallow the toxic-lethal concoction some crazy pharma-nazi from Bayer AG or [insert religious deity of choice] knows evil corporation comes up with.</p>

<p>Oh my [religious deity of choice] ... They&#39;re running ads and show openly who&#39;s their sponsor. That&#39;s really bold. I assume this is true at other places as well. Corporate America at it&#39;s worst (or best if you&#39;re a billionaire shareholder).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I had my appointment the guy spent the whole time bitching that I was late and that I had a bad attitude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ask if you should return some other time if at all, next time you have this type of argument coming up. If they refuse to treat you, they can&#39;t charge you and since all they care about is $$$, that could change the wrongful attitude of the physician very fast.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m like, look, I&#39;m in pain from a car accident, I&#39;m not having the greatest day...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or go to the next quack competitor. You&#39;re just another costumer to them, if you&#39;re not getting treated fairly, then the quack must feel that financially by loosing revenue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;Doc&#39; got super pissy when I questioned the more bold claims of his trade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re exposing their bullshit, it inevitably leads to them getting angry because they have nothing left to hide behind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I got sent home in pain each time. &#39;Doc&#39; said the pain he caused was normal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can&#39;t really help you there, do you have an Xray/Roentgen scan of your injury ? Let somebody take a look at that, whom you can trust.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Healing isn&#39;t just about playing detective, dogmatic traditions and buying pills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s all about $$$. They&#39;re not gonna sell you a single cure, if they can sell you a thousand treatments instead.</p>

So one day i decided i really just want to hear my song like a normal person so i turn it up real loud and the next day my ear is draining some paste but my hearing is miles better but more importantly. its even and voices, music backround noise all sound consistent.

    <div class="md"><p>This sounds like every case of tinnitus I&#39;ve had or my friends have had, I&#39;m a drummer and did it starting in elementary school and went all the way to junior year in college so I&#39;ve been around a lot of loud stuff often times with no ear protection and the coming and going is common for tinnitus because you do get used to it, your brain will tune it out and you won&#39;t notice it as much if you&#39;re not paying attention to it. Some people have it worse than others, there was a guy who had to wear earplugs even outside when we were in a stadium watching other groups his ears would hurt so bad but other people would put their heads next to drums for literally hours and be fine.</p>

<p>The hairs inside your ear drums also become damaged over time so you loose your ability to hear high pitch sounds, when you were a kid you probably heard a CRT TV whine when it was on but your parents or grandparents might not have because they couldn&#39;t, their ears are too &quot;damaged&quot; to hear it.</p>

<p>The weirdest thing about that story is giving antibiotics for tinittus which isn&#39;t a reversible condition really, it might get a little better as your ears become damaged and don&#39;t notice high pitch stuff as much and your brains tunes out the whine but you can&#39;t reverse it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I reckon antibiotics were for cold that instigated tinnitus buzzing, and I think he misdiagnosed me with it, since tinnitus supposedly never stops.</p>

<p>But they should study more into frequencies, since high pitch made me feel like someone was stabbing me in the ear ( ironically, female nagging seemed to hurt) but deep bass seemed to treat it, and finally completely to cure it.</p>

<p>As someone else said, at one point something seem to pop and leak out, and that was the end of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you also had an ear infection or something else? I remember having fluid in my ears when I&#39;ve had ear infections and some people even require tubes because there ears never drain.</p>

<p>Like I said high pitch stuff damages your ears so that might be why lower pitched stuff didn&#39;t really bother you, I know when I was in drumline being right next to snares was a lot less pleasant than being next to basses even if they were relatively the same loudness it was just a higher pitch. </p>

<p>You should hear Orthodox Monks chants, pretty similar to Tibetian, a bit more complex imho. But Tesla heard a lot of them since his father and uncle were orthodox priests. I believe there is a connection there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to do a full write up on this. I’ve had a pitch sound in my “mind” for a long time now and I’ve known its definitely not tinnitus. The ringing appeared randomly one day. Sometimes I even feel a physical “click” or “switch” in my head and suddenly the frequency sound changes pitch in one ear, giving me a warm, tingling sensation in my chest. It feels more like someone adjusting a radio station and my mood/thoughts/feelings change with it. Kinda scary to think what else could be done with that kind of thing. </p>

<p>I’ve been trying meditation to concentrate on changing the pitch and sometimes it works. I want to find a way to completely get rid of it but it seems impossible.</p>
