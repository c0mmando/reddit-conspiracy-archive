       Adrenaline.

       High blood pressure causes tinnitus, adrenaline and stress (fear for example) causes high blood pressure.

       I have paid close attention to this and attempted to eliminate confirmation bias etc. Happens very predictably sometimes. I used to be able to predict when it would happen after i sent a certain type of email on a dime. I would be perfectly calm and relaxed. I think its a form of telepathic feedback.

       you're right it happens predictably.  it also manifests as a step function - that is there's a distinct "on" and "off".  thus i reckon there's a technical cause.

       Dunno.  I have had it after sending or reading an email, but that is usually if it is an important or consequential one.  Like if I have to send an email that says I am not going to meet a deadline.  Not extreme fear or anything but it happens with stuff like that.

       Just my experience and the theory I have come up with that seems to make sense with biology.

       The idea that it is telepathic feedback clicked with me. My mother used to say : "My ears are ringing, someone must be talking bad about me." Googling that phrase brought up a ton of folktales from around the world like that. Here's a link to one:

       Thanks for the link. We know there is something going on, and we suspect the knowledge exists somewhere. We just need someone with the knowledge to explain what is happening. Chances are they are unwilling or unable to come forward with such information.

       The first video connects the ringing to gangstalking. Perhaps the stalkers themselves organically create this ringing in the victim through some mechanism unknown to us. The attention they give as a group creates some effect.. Odd that the Cuban sonic attacks have a similar feel. Weaponized wives tale courtesy of the CIA?

       It's someone talking abut you. It's a telepathic signal indicating someone is talking about you.  I can't remember but one ear is good things and the other is bad things.   It's very true.

       I’ve had a steady ringing for 3 years this fall. It is always there. Sometimes I hear different tones in both ears but there is a steady ringing tone in my left ear constantly. I had stopped watching tv for awhile before the ringing started. Now I listen to tv or videos just for the distraction from the incessant ringing.  How fucked up is that?

       Tinnitus. You get used to it. Eventually you won't even notice unless you think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although if you haven't you should go to en ENT specialist; there's always a chance it's something more serious and you could eventually go deaf.

      <p>
       And I specifically mean see a specialist. Regular GPs are notoriously bad at seeing problems with ears.

       Gads. I’ve seen three neurologists, two gastroenterologists, three pain management doctors, a sleep study doctor, not to mention my internal specialist and general practitioner several times in the past two years (NOT for the ear ringing, but a multitude of health issues.) An ENT would round things off nicely.

       Man google psilocybin mushrooms and the effects on tinnitus, I have it myself and was reading some cool anecdotes on forums just the other night but I ended up falling asleep. Havent tried it or anything but there was some really hope inspiring stuff. Apparently all psiolcybin mushies work too

       Don't listen to it just for distraction. Find a good set of bass rich in-ear headphones, and start with low volume and low pitch. Bass sounds seemed to soothe me, and the buzz or hiss seemed to go away after listening to it, for a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it wasn't severe as yours (pain or discomfort are hard to rate), it helped.

       Try it, there's nothing to loose, and possible peace of mind to gain.

       Ok, I have a somewhat connected story, I'm gonna share it, might help somebody. Sorry for somewhat bad english.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I had that ear imflammatory proccess that started like 10 years ago, caught it in my right ear, with car window draft and hot-cold sudden change, in summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the indications were mild buzzing, occasional pops (like those candies that pop), and very strong sensitivity to loud sounds (I had to wear some plug).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, doctor said it was tinnitus, gave me strong antibiotics, said it will never completely cure, might as well get used to it (fuck that) as it will come back from time to time. So, with that antibiotics and plug, it went away about month later, sensitivity to loud sounds stayed for at least a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       And occasionally, in next few years, I would get pain as if needle was going through my ear (pierced eardrum? Is that a diagnose too).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, 6 or 7 years passed , everything was ok, and I get severe cold which I felt going up from my throat to my ear, and while cold got better, my right ear started buzzing and popping once again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Month of pain in the ass (well, ear to be precise) and went to best ORL doctor in town, Prof.Dr at the Uni, all bells and whistles. He says there's nothing in my ear, no need for washing it out, gaves me the strongest antibiotic there is, says it's tinnitus, I'll have it for the rest of my life, some go crazy, some get used to it - his words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, advise - no loud music, no in-ear headphones.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I love music very much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antibio session passed, with no good result.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspected something is in my ear, even though he said it wasn't, and the sound of bass (not thumping, but constant) from in-ear headphones felt soothing and relaxing, as I didn't hear the hiss or pops when I listened to loud music.
      </p>
      <p>
       So with my own music therapy, about month later, bass, cranking it louder, vibration felt good, something happened, and I have zero problems with ear for ... 3 years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Might help someone.

       Next time you have to visit one and they're trying to prescribe you some sketchy pills you never heard about ask him if the piece of shit has an agreement with one of the pharmaceutical mafia corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is: Many western doctors have silent agreements to push experimental pills nobody ever properly tested for long term effects on you in exchange for $$$.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is bad with European doctors already but guess what happens in the US. when you're being treated by someone who is maybe 50k-300k in debt, because they were tricked by the education mafia. That person has a lot of incentive to be a quack, like most western doctors are anyway, and give you those tasty poison pills.

       People think here vaccines are bad, now you got to swallow the toxic-lethal concoction some crazy pharma-nazi from Bayer AG or [insert religious deity of choice] knows evil corporation comes up with.

       I walked into a clinic where the doctor's plastic nametags had a medication logo bigger than their names. Stacks of swag and samples lying around. When I had my appointment the guy spent the whole time bitching that I was late and that I had a bad attitude.

       Ask if you should return some other time if at all, next time you have this type of argument coming up. If they refuse to treat you, they can't charge you and since all they care about is $$$, that could change the wrongful attitude of the physician very fast.

       This just happened to me! For like 6 years i lost 80% of hearing in one of my ears. Loud sounds hurt real bad, popping sounds are common as well. So one day i decided i really just want to hear my song like a normal person so i turn it up real loud and the next day my ear is draining some paste but my hearing is miles better but more importantly. its even and voices, music backround noise all sound consistent. I have no idea what changed.

       This sounds like every case of tinnitus I've had or my friends have had, I'm a drummer and did it starting in elementary school and went all the way to junior year in college so I've been around a lot of loud stuff often times with no ear protection and the coming and going is common for tinnitus because you do get used to it, your brain will tune it out and you won't notice it as much if you're not paying attention to it. Some people have it worse than others, there was a guy who had to wear earplugs even outside when we were in a stadium watching other groups his ears would hurt so bad but other people would put their heads next to drums for literally hours and be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hairs inside your ear drums also become damaged over time so you loose your ability to hear high pitch sounds, when you were a kid you probably heard a CRT TV whine when it was on but your parents or grandparents might not have because they couldn't, their ears are too "damaged" to hear it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weirdest thing about that story is giving antibiotics for tinittus which isn't a reversible condition really, it might get a little better as your ears become damaged and don't notice high pitch stuff as much and your brains tunes out the whine but you can't reverse it.

       Yeah, I reckon antibiotics were for cold that instigated tinnitus buzzing, and I think he misdiagnosed me with it, since tinnitus supposedly never stops.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they should study more into frequencies, since high pitch made me feel like someone was stabbing me in the ear ( ironically, female nagging seemed to hurt) but deep bass seemed to treat it, and finally completely to cure it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone else said, at one point something seem to pop and leak out, and that was the end of it.

       Maybe you also had an ear infection or something else? I remember having fluid in my ears when I've had ear infections and some people even require tubes because there ears never drain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said high pitch stuff damages your ears so that might be why lower pitched stuff didn't really bother you, I know when I was in drumline being right next to snares was a lot less pleasant than being next to basses even if they were relatively the same loudness it was just a higher pitch.

       Oh, absolutely! Frequencies and amplitudes are something Tesla said there is a healing power to them. Electricity or sound. And since I'm from Serbia, we pray to Tesla as one of our gods ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
       You should hear Orthodox Monks chants, pretty similar to Tibetian, a bit more complex imho. But Tesla heard a lot of them since his father and uncle were orthodox priests. I believe there is a connection there.

       Have had tinnitus for many years now. At first it was annoying but as they say, I got used to it. Except recently, last year or so. Ringing seems louder, and at night sometimes that's all I can hear. Not sure what is triggering it to be more severe.

       In Manchurian Candidate the ringing triggers the MK change in behavior, just sayin. I could imagine you would have to center pretty hard to ignore something like that.

       I've always been able to hear a high pitched resonant whining.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was younger, and it was really quiet, I often couldn't control it. But now I can tune into or put of it at will. It's always there, but slightly changes tone regularly.

       I was going to do a full write up on this. I’ve had a pitch sound in my “mind” for a long time now and I’ve known its definitely not tinnitus. The ringing appeared randomly one day. Sometimes I even feel a physical “click” or “switch” in my head and suddenly the frequency sound changes pitch in one ear, giving me a warm, tingling sensation in my chest. It feels more like someone adjusting a radio station and my mood/thoughts/feelings change with it. Kinda scary to think what else could be done with that kind of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve been trying meditation to concentrate on changing the pitch and sometimes it works. I want to find a way to completely get rid of it but it seems impossible.

       I can feel pressure build up in a room.  When the pressure gets too high my ears ring.  I can almost literally will the sound away ("Not now, not today").
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm never sure if it's atmospheric pressure or some more complicated entity, as the sensation seems connected to what I am reading/learning/doing/thinking about.  And it almost feels like the gravity in the room lightens ever so slightly.  It's minorly trippy, not at all disruptive to my well-being, and not tinnitus nor as intense as OP.

       Could it be a mild form of anxiety, that makes you blood pressure higher. Sometimes when I feel pressure in ears, if I close my ear with hand, make a seashell like shape, I can hear my blood circulation pumping. Try it.

       I will indeed, thank you for the advice.  The higher pressure might explain how/why I've connected the feeling to what I'm reading/learning/doing.

       I have both tinnitus and this strange extra ringing. The tinnitus never goes away, but the strange ringing comes and goes and seems to be directional despite also appearing to originate inside my head. I haven't noticed any instances of gang stalking, however.

       Good job gathering those links. I experienced this as a T.I in Iran and it's triggered by doing certain things, they'll make one ear deaf for a second and then play a loud ringing till my hearing goes to normal in like 4 seconds, they did this once with both ears and also only play the loud ringing sometimes without making an ear deaf.

       There's an old belief that when you hear ringing in your ears it means someone is thinking of you.  I believe that.  It seems to happen when there's a psychic link.

       Thanks for the link. We know there is something going on, and we suspect the knowledge exists somewhere. We just need someone with the knowledge to explain what is happening. Chances are they are unwilling or unable to come forward with such information.
