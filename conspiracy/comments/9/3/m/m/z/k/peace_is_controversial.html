       People are falling right into the trap. Going along, doing their part to start a civil war, race war, class war, rioting in the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything along those lines, in the u.s., the same thing always happens. We've seen time and time again. The only thing u.s. does is ramp up militarism. That's the only answer u.s. has ever had. This militarism is never, ever, projected against evil, but against those who are trying to prevent greater evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talking of peace, of civility, of ethics, is suddenly controversial now. If we go along with what's trending in media, we're going to get martial law, or worse. We're going to speed up and exacerbate all the things we don't like.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution is to work together build and help each other each build an alternative. Peaceful revolution is the only way to prevent greater oppression. Other wise it's just different people making the same old mistakes, in the name of good, but actually creating evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       It make take hundreds of years, like it did in colonial India, but eventually lasting peace will win.

       We all have the same parts. They just look different. These minor aesthetic differences between ethnic groups come from our former genetic isolation, post migration.

       You obviously lack an understanding of basic modern anthropology. Please read up. I'm not going to educate you from scratch right now. Your whole line of argument is scientifically baseless.

      <p>
       Here's a wiki for you.

      <p>
       If you think you have a leg to stand on here, please show me what legitimate sources you have to support your argument. Looking for text books, scientific journals, actual respected expert interviews. I'd even take a wiki as well, because this is such a elementary fact. Please don't try and pass off some random fringe links you from hate sites and blogs as evidence.

       I explicitly addressed what you wrote by providing evidence for my argument. I addressed your writing as woefully misinformed and scientifically baseless.

       You know you're wrong. That's exactly why you didn't even bother to post any supporting evidence for your argument.

       Now you're plan is to just repeat yourself. Saying that I'm the ignorant one and wrong. With the hope that no one will notice you haven't said anything of substance, or even attempted to provide evidence.

       It is an example of peace and Rome did it well. I am a dog owner and I've trained my dog good barks from bad barks. She's not at peace though because it goes against her nature. Tension. Own a dog, train it then get back to me.

       You oppress things and people on the daily and probably don't even realize it. One persons oppression is another persons dominance. One persons peace is another persons oppression. How are you not seeing my point?

       I'm not seeing your point because you've been talking about how great you are at beating dogs basically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now comes the real talk finally.
      </p>
      <p>
       A system I'm forced into forces me to adhere to it, and this system forces me to oppress others. I realize it every moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can disagree and argue all we want. Just like family though, we help each other regardless. Will it be all happy and perfectly equal? No. Of course not. It will be peace though, not just turn based oppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because a thing won't be perfect doesn't mean we shouldn't try to make it better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically your present argument is, "Give up on improving civilization, it's as good as it's going to get."
      </p>
      <p>
       My argument is, we have to work together every day to make it better, and it will get better. Evolution takes time. As humans we have a very strong influence as to how we learn and evolve.

       Peace is possible.

       Beating your dog sounds like the furthest thing from a peaceful union like op describes in the third paragraph and mighty close to the way our current system keeps the peace. "You bark too much, Shut up and get in line."

       It's all about consideration and communication. Your dog may not know or care why it shouldn't bark. You probably can't explain it to the dog. However a human being can understand and consider how others would feel. This is a basis for peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we can resolve conflicts of interest without violence, we have peace. Intransigent nationally interested selfishness causes many wars. Also, there are self-serving people inside of countries that may even harm their own countries in order to profit themselves.

       Peaceful revolution isn't exact'y difficult. It's time consuming. Peaceful revolution is merely a lack of violence. Violence takes more resources than peace. Therefore it's easier than a violent revolution.

      <p>
       Corruption is also fucked.

       I respect the stated efforts of "represent us." I agree with it's stated three main goals, but strongly believe that simply won't be enough. You can't make people follow the law by just writing laws. The issues attempting to be resolved stem from a lack of enforcement, not a lack of legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not for me. Maybe others like it. Feels too corporate. Feels like just another "non-profit," who's going to use donations to pay bosses. If there happens to be spare change left over, then maybe they'll hire a lawyer or two to draft some legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feels like the google model of revolution. Start as an open source, friendly company working for the community. Gathering wealth and knowledge from the community. Then one day copyright and patent the communities efforts to make profit, solely for the bosses of "represent us." Then basically become absorbed by the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm wrong. Let me take a look at "the books" and we'll see.

       I respect your reservations, but they've got a ton of state level legislation passed. Check out what they've done in Maine and South Dakota. Represent.us and the anti-corruption act have bipartisan support, that's the key. I know of nothing else uniting greens and libertarians.

       Hard to profit if your shipments are constantly getting raided by enemies. Peace means these raids aren't happening. Peace maximizes profit.

       You obviously lack an understanding of basic modern anthropology. Please read up. I'm not going to educate you from scratch right now. Your whole line of argument is scientifically baseless.

       If you think you have a leg to stand on here, please show me what legitimate sources you have to support your argument. Looking for text books, scientific journals, actual respected expert interviews. I'd even take a wiki as well, because this is such a elementary fact. Please don't try and pass off some random fringe links you from hate sites and blogs as evidence.
