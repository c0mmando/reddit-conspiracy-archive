        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>People are falling right into the trap. Going along, doing their part to start a civil war, race war, class war, rioting in the streets.</p>

<p>Anything along those lines, in the u.s., the same thing always happens. We&#39;ve seen time and time again. The only thing u.s. does is ramp up militarism. That&#39;s the only answer u.s. has ever had. This militarism is never, ever, projected against evil, but against those who are trying to prevent greater evil.</p>

<p>Talking of peace, of civility, of ethics, is suddenly controversial now. If we go along with what&#39;s trending in media, we&#39;re going to get martial law, or worse. We&#39;re going to speed up and exacerbate all the things we don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>The solution is to work together build and help each other each build an alternative. Peaceful revolution is the only way to prevent greater oppression. Other wise it&#39;s just different people making the same old mistakes, in the name of good, but actually creating evil.</p>

<p>It make take hundreds of years, like it did in colonial India, but eventually lasting peace will win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not seeing your point because you&#39;ve been talking about how great you are at beating dogs basically.</p>

<p>Now comes the real talk finally.</p>

<p>A system I&#39;m forced into forces me to adhere to it, and this system forces me to oppress others. I realize it every moment.</p>

<p>We can disagree and argue all we want. Just like family though, we help each other regardless. Will it be all happy and perfectly equal? No. Of course not. It will be peace though, not just turn based oppression.</p>

<p>Just because a thing won&#39;t be perfect doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t try to make it better.</p>

<p>Basically your present argument is, &quot;Give up on improving civilization, it&#39;s as good as it&#39;s going to get.&quot;</p>

<p>My argument is, we have to work together every day to make it better, and it will get better. Evolution takes time. As humans we have a very strong influence as to how we learn and evolve.</p>

<p>Peace is possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peaceful revolution isn&#39;t exact&#39;y difficult. It&#39;s time consuming. Peaceful revolution is merely a lack of violence. Violence takes more resources than peace. Therefore it&#39;s easier than a violent revolution.</p>

<p>Corruption is also fucked.</p>

<p>I respect the stated efforts of &quot;represent us.&quot; I agree with it&#39;s stated three main goals, but strongly believe that simply won&#39;t be enough. You can&#39;t make people follow the law by just writing laws. The issues attempting to be resolved stem from a lack of enforcement, not a lack of legislation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not for me. Maybe others like it. Feels too corporate. Feels like just another &quot;non-profit,&quot; who&#39;s going to use donations to pay bosses. If there happens to be spare change left over, then maybe they&#39;ll hire a lawyer or two to draft some legislation.</p>

<p>Feels like the google model of revolution. Start as an open source, friendly company working for the community. Gathering wealth and knowledge from the community. Then one day copyright and patent the communities efforts to make profit, solely for the bosses of &quot;represent us.&quot; Then basically become absorbed by the CIA.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m wrong. Let me take a look at &quot;the books&quot; and we&#39;ll see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your reservations, but they&#39;ve got a ton of state level legislation passed. Check out what they&#39;ve done in Maine and South Dakota. Represent.us and the anti-corruption act have bipartisan support, that&#39;s the key. I know of nothing else uniting greens and libertarians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hard to profit if your shipments are constantly getting raided by enemies. Peace means these raids aren&#39;t happening. Peace maximizes profit.</p>

<p>Yes there are ways certain industries can make profit from war. That&#39;s a very narrow sector of the economy though. It&#39;s not sustainable long term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t disagree with you on that point. However I&#39;m sure that peace has it&#39;s place even for them. We&#39;re not constantly in conventional wars any more, so it must be of use to them as well.</p>
