       Once in awhile I drop in on the Q events as my friend will not shut up about Q, and counters every political discussion we have with the current Q narrative about the topic at hand. Sometimes r/greatawakening contains analysis of Q "drops" that are intriguing, if not backed by any evidence or apparent reality-- now the sub looks more like r/the_donald than ever, not in the sense of content but in the celebratory, ra-ra cheerleading element.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump had a campaign rally in Tampa, some Q devotees brought printed out "We Are Q" signs, and Q went on 4chan to send out digital high fives and "God Bless!"s to those spotted.
      </p>
      <p>
       A frequent Q position even amongst true believers is that "it doesn't matter if Q is 'real' or a psyop, the message rings true and is valuable." I'm starting to get what that looks like in the real world now-- it's rally material. It's cardboard signs and proliferation in crowds, mass belief based in a common cause and camaraderie, a greater mission and goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like a political campaign-- more like exactly like one, actually. It seems relevant that it's now a developing feature within the actual Trump re-election campaign, as if they go hand in hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's seemed pretty obvious that they do, now it seems pretty close to official.

       Clear definitions of words are what court is all about. You can't be convicted of "collusion" even if it did happen. They already know the case is won, they knew before they
       <em>
        allowed
       </em>
       the SC to happen. This is for show, and you're falling for the trap. Heels and faces, a script from a WWE hall of famer, master of kayfbe.

       Mueller has been a gray area. Rest assured, 45 has

       the SC for good reason. He can legally fire him at any time with no reprecussion.

       He’s been a gray area? So when it’s something bad against Trump he’s deep state, when this happens it’s all part of the plan?

       Maybe trump can fire him any time without legal consequence, I’d imagine there’d be quite a backlash politically

       Sorry that AIPAC exists and dictates USA foreign policy. Your savior could literally sell you on anything and the Cult of Q would eat it up and ask for seconds. Such dog-like obedience is only seen in NXIVM. By the way, how did that July happening go? The Podesta indictments? Is Hilary in jail yet?

       How in the world does war with Iran only benefit Israel? Do you forget who the aggressors are in that conflict? Do you forget that it is Iran's doctrine to wipe a prosperous country like Israel off of the map while it murderously oppresses its own people into poverty and hunger? Do you Jew-haters ever come back to reality?

       Oh please. Iran hasn't attacked anyone in centuries. The US and Israel are the aggressors in their "War on Terror." Back in the '50s, the CIA overthrew their Democratic government and has been sponsoring Islamic terrorism ever since. This is the reality.

       The CIA overthrew Iran in the 50s?? If you’re talking about the Iranian revolution that took place in 1979 get your basic facts straight. Before this revolution Iran was considered a beacon of stability in the Middle East. Once you learn that basic fact then teach yourself about how Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism on earth? Hezbollah? The Houthis? But the Jews!!!!!!!!!

        A frequent Q position even amongst true believers is that "it doesn't matter if Q is 'real' or a psyop, the message rings true and is valuable." I'm starting to get what that looks like in the real world now-- it's rally material. It's cardboard signs and proliferation in crowds, mass belief based in a common cause and camaraderie, a greater mission and goal.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       It's a psyop, by definition, whether you agree with it or not. Q-uestion is: is it being used towards a positive end?

       No, they were trying to use the rally as proof of q not being a larp. There was a picture of Trump pointing near (but not at) a guy holding a q sign and they were celebrating and saying how that was definite proof of q being real.

       We are celebrating months of unbiased research, investigation, and history. We do noy force any beliefs to anyone. We ask you that you see the evidence and decide for yourself. The mods are transparent. The people are wholesome logical and honest. And the MSM is making us looked deranged. Think for a second! All of you dont trust the MSM.

       No. Because I am not judging the members of the "deep state" by their political sidings. I am judging them by their actions. Here is where I shut you down:
1. Obama -  Fast and Furious Act. Look it up. He signed it himself. Also, most drone bombings and murders of innocent civilians of more than any president in history. Seriously. Obama, the nobel peace prize winner. Look up casualty rates from drone bombings 2008-2016.
2. Eric Schneidermann - Ex Attorney General of NYC. Ex persecutor of Harvey Weinstein. Ex representative of the #metoo movement. Right after his resignation following his rape and abuse allegations, Harvey was promptly arrested, the NXIUM case continued on, and the stand in AG approved Anthony Weiner's laptop to be released to the NYPD for investigation who after 1 second, turned it into the FBI as it has material of national security. LOOK IT UP AND FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF. SIMPLE AS THAT. I AM ONLY REFERRING TO SOURCES AND ARTICLES FOUND ON MAINSTREAM OUTLETS. These are not conspiracies. These are just people such as yourself, that is in denial. Deepstate? The bogeyman? Are you fucking serious? This is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . You are supposed to be talking about the deep state and the agents involved. Wtf? this isn't
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . This is where you question everything. Don't use your juvenile method of arguing to discredit the hours, days, months of research my team has put together to help uncover the truth and bring evil to justice. Check yourself. Seriously. And learn to actually read through material before judging everything.
