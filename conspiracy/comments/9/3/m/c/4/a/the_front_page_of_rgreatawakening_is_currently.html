        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Once in awhile I drop in on the Q events as my friend will not shut up about Q, and counters every political discussion we have with the current Q narrative about the topic at hand. Sometimes r/greatawakening contains analysis of Q &quot;drops&quot; that are intriguing, if not backed by any evidence or apparent reality-- now the sub looks more like r/the_donald than ever, not in the sense of content but in the celebratory, ra-ra cheerleading element. </p>

<p>Trump had a campaign rally in Tampa, some Q devotees brought printed out &quot;We Are Q&quot; signs, and Q went on 4chan to send out digital high fives and &quot;God Bless!&quot;s to those spotted. </p>

<p>A frequent Q position even amongst true believers is that &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter if Q is &#39;real&#39; or a psyop, the message rings true and is valuable.&quot; I&#39;m starting to get what that looks like in the real world now-- it&#39;s rally material. It&#39;s cardboard signs and proliferation in crowds, mass belief based in a common cause and camaraderie, a greater mission and goal.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like a political campaign-- more like exactly like one, actually. It seems relevant that it&#39;s now a developing feature within the actual Trump re-election campaign, as if they go hand in hand. </p>

<p>It&#39;s seemed pretty obvious that they do, now it seems pretty close to official.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Because I am not judging the members of the &quot;deep state&quot; by their political sidings. I am judging them by their actions. Here is where I shut you down:
1. Obama -  Fast and Furious Act. Look it up. He signed it himself. Also, most drone bombings and murders of innocent civilians of more than any president in history. Seriously. Obama, the nobel peace prize winner. Look up casualty rates from drone bombings 2008-2016.
2. Eric Schneidermann - Ex Attorney General of NYC. Ex persecutor of Harvey Weinstein. Ex representative of the #metoo movement. Right after his resignation following his rape and abuse allegations, Harvey was promptly arrested, the NXIUM case continued on, and the stand in AG approved Anthony Weiner&#39;s laptop to be released to the NYPD for investigation who after 1 second, turned it into the FBI as it has material of national security. LOOK IT UP AND FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF. SIMPLE AS THAT. I AM ONLY REFERRING TO SOURCES AND ARTICLES FOUND ON MAINSTREAM OUTLETS. These are not conspiracies. These are just people such as yourself, that is in denial. Deepstate? The bogeyman? Are you fucking serious? This is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. You are supposed to be talking about the deep state and the agents involved. Wtf? this isn&#39;t <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. This is where you question everything. Don&#39;t use your juvenile method of arguing to discredit the hours, days, months of research my team has put together to help uncover the truth and bring evil to justice. Check yourself. Seriously. And learn to actually read through material before judging everything. </p>
