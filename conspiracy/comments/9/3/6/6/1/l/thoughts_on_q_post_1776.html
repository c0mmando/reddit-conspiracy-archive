        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems pretty clear that QAnon is running out of gas. Since coming back, Q has put up about 70 posts, most of which are either self-referential gloating or random conspiracy nonsense. </p>

<p>Most recently, he spent a bunch of posts stalking Michael Avenatti, and just accused California of setting its own wildfires to cash in on federal disaster money.</p>

<p>I get the sense Q is burning posts off to get to 1776, which a bunch of believers think is going to be some HUGE revelation.</p>

<p>Given that the recent posts are such crap, and Q promised that July would be the month THE TRUTH would be revealed, I think we&#39;re seeing the beginning of the cult walking away.</p>

<p>My guess is that 1776 is Q unveiling some kind of subscription site or Patreon page for believers to pay to get the REAL intel, and that he&#39;s been holding back the real breadcrumbs on purpose. </p>

<p>Or maybe it&#39;ll just be some random picture of a guy&#39;s ass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree there&#39;s no harm keeping an open mind and hoping it turns out to be true,  but if it is a larp there&#39;s going to be some very pissed of people.</p>

<p>I&#39;m praying it&#39;s legit and Trump is actually trying to drain the swamp but the more I watch him kiss Israel&#39;s ass the more I know it&#39;s bullshit.  Anyone he kicked out is being replaced with Someone as bad or worse. Sessions? Haspel? Bolton?  </p>

<p>How is putting cunts like that back into important positions draining the swamp?  </p>

<p>But hey maybe even the Q army realizes there isn&#39;t going to be a Savior they pick up their own guns and start the revolution they want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid there won&#39;t be very many pissed off people.  If/when Q implodes, I think you&#39;ll have some people who laugh it off saying they didn&#39;t take it seriously anyway.  More who will flat out deny it and claim that the &quot;Real Q&quot; is hiding somewhere or got taken out by the Deep State (creating a virtual martyr which might be more dangerous).  </p>

<p>If it is a LARP.  It&#39;s possible there is some low-level computer jockey punching numbers for the state department who leaks out Q-drops in code on his lunch hour and days off.  That&#39;s still totally possible. </p>

<p>But if Q is proven to be a LARP or social experiment, there will be a large portion of &#39;Believers&#39; who will not believe it.  People in the throes of a cult will not see reason and sometimes cannot accept truth even when its in their face.   Historically things have not ended well for people enthralled by cult leaders.  </p>

<p>And Q - whatever they are - has created a cult.  </p>

<p>Q makes an assertion that a LEO was killed because she saw some &quot;file&quot; but that&#39;s pretty much baseless on its own. Then Trump honors them with an event/speech, the occurrence of which was publically known and this, in some cyclical reasoning, makes Q&#39;s previous post true?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know May 13-19 is national police week, and it&#39;s traditional for the President to make a speech that memorializes fallen officers, right?</p>

<p>You are telling me it is incontrovertible proof of Q because he guessed that a high profile killing of a police officer would be mentioned on a day devoted to mentioning police officers who have been killed?</p>

<p>Well in that case, I am also a secret agent with high level clearance. For proof I offer the unknowable fact that next January, President Trump will use the words &quot;Union,&quot; &quot;the,&quot; &quot;of,&quot; and &quot;state,&quot; ALL IN THE SAME SENTENCE in a major speech! I mean, only someone with the highest levels of access could possibly know that!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not exactly lucky, it was pretty obvious. Familia&#39;s killing was front page news. It was one of the most publicized police killings of the year. Furthermore, NYPD is the largest and best known police force in the country. Do you honestly think it was that big a risk to guess that a fallen officer from the most recognizable PD in the US would be mentioned? </p>

<p>Also, Q specifically stated that TWO officers would be mentioned.  What happened to the other one?  Did Q ever offer an explanation for this or admit in any way that he got it wrong? If he had guessed wrong and there were zero NYPD officers mentioned instead of only one, why wouldn&#39;t he simply ignore his wrong prediction and hope you didn&#39;t notice just like he did about his wrong prediction that two NYPD officers would be mentioned? </p>

<p>Is this analysis correct?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>QAnon says to look for officers that were assassinated</p></li>
<li><p>Trump mentions some officer</p></li>
<li><p>Qanon cultists mentioned said officer because they probably mentioned every officer that was killed</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore this is proof that QAnon knew trump is going to mention officer Familia</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I just did. </p>

<p>They&#39;re disjointed, incoherent gobbledygook.</p>

<p>QAnon said Hillary Clinton would be arrested last year. She wasn&#39;t. Over and over said something big was going to happen.</p>

<p>This is nothing new. Nostradamus followers do the same thing, creatively intrepret vague &quot;prophecies&quot; and only apply meaning to it after the fact. That&#39;s not proof of anything. </p>

<p>If I say &quot;something big is going to happen if October,&quot; there are a million things that could happen that someone who really wants to believe me could point to use as &quot;proof&quot; that I&#39;m right. Without defining &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;big,&quot; I vastly increase my chances of being right because I&#39;m <em>not saying anything at all</em>, really.</p>

<p>This is a very age-old tactic. It&#39;s how TV psychics, religious doomsayers, and all kinds of other shysters work. They throw out something vague, and you fill in the blanks for them, and it&#39;s so amazing how <em>right</em> they were!!!</p>

<p>Right now, QAnon is predicting &quot;Red October.&quot; But doesn&#39;t define what that means. I&#39;m going to predict exactly what will happen.</p>

<p>Something of note will happen in October, because something of note happens every day. QAnon&#39;s followers will latch onto <em>something,</em> and say <em>that&#39;s</em> what Q meant by &quot;Red October.&quot; That is not how this works. If you are &quot;in the know&quot; about something that&#39;s going down, then you would say what that is if you really wanted other people to know about it. If you know someone is plotting to burn down a theater, you would tell people &quot;so-and-so is planning on burning down the theater,&quot; not &quot;watch out for orange and cloudy skies in the theater district, sometime in April!&quot;</p>

<p>But I will give you a challenge, right now.</p>

<p>Tell me exactly what will happen in October. No vague code words or abbreviations. Tell me <em>exactly</em> specifically, what will happen. If that comes to pass in October, I will be a believer. If it doesn&#39;t, you agree to give up on this nonsense.</p>

<p>Are you willing to take that challenge?</p>

<p>Q &quot;predicted&quot; that Trump would talk about dead police officers in NYC when he had a scheduled speaking engagement in NYC on a day meant to honor police officers who died. Brilliant </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain the posting of ray.chandler&#39;s Instagram.</p>

<p>I forget this one, explain it to me? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain the deal made with North Korea</p>

<p>A dove was elected in S. Korea, and there were numerous peaceful overtures made on both sides leading up to, and during the Olympics. Any moderately informed observer could infer that talks were likely.  Following that, Q &quot;predicted&quot; that Trump had freed N. Korea from their secret CIA control?? He never said they would make a deal publicly, and either way, they have yet to make an actual deal with any specific obligations or objectives. </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t. Show me why you think he did? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain the Pope having a bad May</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Catholic church has been having a bad 15 years. Nothing new broke in May for anyone not desperately looking to retroactively confirm a blanket prediction. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain more sealed indictments than ever before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t true, and the number you&#39;re thinking of is conflating &quot;sealed indictments&quot; with all court actions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain pedos in Hollywood being outed like never before (including higher ups like Bronfman and Salzman).</p>

<p>The #metoo movement predates Q. NXIVM was a known creepy cult for years, and has nothing to do with Q, except retroactive gloating. </p>

<p>So your turn, why does Q post photoshopped pictures trying to imply he has access to AF1? If he wanted to prove his access, he easily could, right? And if he didn&#39;t want to prove that, why post it at all??</p>

<p>Why have Huma Abedin and the Podesta brothers been walking free for almost a year from their indictment? What ever happened to all those people who were supposed to packing Gitmo? Ankle monitors? Travel restrictions? </p>

<p>July is the month the truth comes out, right? Conspiracy no more! Has that happened yet? Or maybe Trump&#39;s rally tonight will be the key? What do you think will be revealed? </p>

<p>Just do a search for &quot;ray.chandler&quot;. Rachel Chandler is one of Epstein&#39;s handlers/underaged girlfriends. Q posted her instagram. This at least makes Q a pretty decent researcher, since none of the other anons found it, and she is a fairly major player. Her page was filled with images of abuse, much worse than anything found during the pizzagdate investigation</p>

<p>Even if you think Q is a larp, it is easily the greatest, most influential larp of all time. That in itself is worth discussing. How many larps have inspired dozens of mainstream articles, subreddits with enormous followings, SNL skits, etc.?</p>

It means he&#39;s a liar, and nothing he posts has any meaning or value in the real world.  It means that tens of thousands of people would rather live in a world of comforting lies than in reality, and those people call themselves redpilled with no sense of irony. </p>

<p>If he is just a &quot;decent researcher&quot; (I disagree strongly), why doesn&#39;t he just post his research as is, as a layman/amateur journalist? &quot;Hey guys, here&#39;s what I found&quot; Why does he need to mix it in with flagrant fabrication and self aggrandizement? Why does he try so hard to make it seem like he personally is so important, perhaps even the President himself? </p>

<p>All for a larp? Where he basically gets worshipped as a prophet? Has thousands hanging on his every word? Loudly calling for him at Presidential rallies? At basically no cost besides some time on 8chan (which he would be doing anyway)? Yes, con men throughout history have done a lot more for less. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the feeling most of the current Qult are people who came across him after the initial few weeks where Q was very exciting and engaging and ultimately a flop. I really don&#39;t think that anyone with two brains cells to rub together would have still been following (if they had been from the very start) after those initial couple of weeks.</p>

<p>I loved that shit at the start, it was a lot of fun... Now it&#39;s just scary.</p>

<p>&quot;And as I&#39;ve mentioned, we&#39;ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A friend of mine just &quot;revealed&quot; to me that she is into the QAnon stuff. Telling me how <em>literally everything</em> he has said has come to pass. But of course then it was &quot;oh well you have to interpret it right&quot; thing and that&#39;s where she lost me.</p>

<p>You either say what you mean or you&#39;re full of shit in my book. She asked me to look into it because she&#39;s supposedly shared this with her husband and brother and now they&#39;re on board, too. I agreed, reluctantly. I spent some time on it this morning and it&#39;s basically just a bunch of vague assertions and fill-in-the-blank &quot;predictions.&quot; She keeps telling me about &quot;Red October&quot; but it looks like this poster(s) has already failed a bunch of predictions. I think what I should ask her next is what exactly Red October is and if she can&#39;t tell me that then I&#39;m going to conclude this is just a bunch of B.S.</p>
