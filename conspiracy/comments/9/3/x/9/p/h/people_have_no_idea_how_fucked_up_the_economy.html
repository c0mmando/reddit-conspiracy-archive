        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I actually got banned from &quot;r/AskEconomics&quot; because I was pointing out how stupid people are...</p>

<p>The economy is basically set up for certain people to &quot;siphon off wealth&quot;, and they&#39;ve been doing a very good job at it, for CENTURIES (not decades, not years, but CENTURIES...) </p>

<p>The whole nature of the monetary system is the beginning of it all... Fractional reserve banking, the most fundamental scam on the planet, and literally THE cause of the MOST problems, here on planet Earth...</p>

<p>The whole economy is like a machine: an incentive driven machine... And the incentive is money... When you fuck with the incentives, you fuck with the machine...</p>

<p>Honestly, it is one of the most frustrating things to understand this all, just to have it &quot;fall upon deaf ears&quot; when I explain it all... </p>

<p>I&#39;m a 10 year conspiracy theorist, but I learned about the economic aspect right off the bat... To me, its almost unbelievable to see how many people sincerely think &quot;everything is all good&quot;, even after conspiracy theorists all over the internet have BEEN trying to tell people what&#39;s up, for years now...</p>

<p>Back in the day, it might have been excusable, since there was no &quot;internet&quot;, for people to maybe not be &quot;woke&quot;... But now, WE HAVE THE INTERNET, and damn near everybody&#39;s heard of &quot;the Illuminati&quot;... There&#39;s no excuse at this point... I feel like I have to say that people deserve what is about to befall them, as sad as that is...</p>

<p>I personally feel frustrated since I&#39;ve dedicated so much time trying to &quot;wake people up&quot;, while basically neglecting every other part of my life... But, personally, I just felt like I couldn&#39;t even TRY to live a &quot;normal life&quot; knowing what certain people had in store for us...</p>

<p>I&#39;m 29, no car, just got a shit job at Walmart, no financial situation whatsoever, just now starting, no girlfriend, barely any friends left, been through hell... Pretty much all just so people can still be retards, and have the same fate that I&#39;ve been trying to stave off, befall us... At this point, I feel like I should have just said &quot;fuck it&quot; a long time ago, because honestly: I can tell I&#39;ve made no difference...</p>

<p>People are retards. I know that a lot of conspiracy theorists want to have hope, but the majority of people are straight fucking RETARDED, like &quot;sit in a Las Vegas lawn while everybody else is running, before you get bullets ripping through your flesh&quot; stupid... Common sense, the sense of danger, is GONE... Its almost insane... Its almost SO insane, that I ALMOST want to believe the bible (&quot;In those days...the lawlessness will increase...&quot;) (Matt 24:11), but then, I can even read the bible, and I feel like its just a false hope for people, while they&#39;re all being fucked over...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve researched some pretty deep conspiracy theories, like &quot;maybe humans were genetically modified by aliens, to be slaves, and now those aliens want to control us, so we don&#39;t leave the planet&quot; type conspiracy theories... And honestly, that seems VERY feasable... And sadly, that makes me feel like a fucking piece of chattel...</p>

<p>Not to go too far off course here (I mainly came to say that the economy is fucked, and that everybody is going to be blindsided, because they&#39;re all ignorant as fuck...) I can see SO much potential for mankind... Like the progress were making with science (I personally love biology: its fucking AMAZING...) and other stuff... So I&#39;m like &quot;were better than &#39;chattel&#39;&quot;, but then I see how blatantly ignorant people are of the most obvious scams on the planet and I&#39;m like &quot;you fucking retarded people&quot;... It makes me want to fucking scream... And then if I do, I get called &quot;crazy&quot;, WHICH MAKES ME WANT TO SCREAM EVEN MORE!!!</p>

<p>This whole situation is just fucking insane, and I honestly don&#39;t know what to do about it... You have full-time, dedicated conspiracy theorists talking about this shit, ALL DAY, EVERYDAY, and EVERYBODY has the internet, and has PROBABLY HEARD... So I&#39;m just like &quot;If these guys have already done told everybody, and everybody&#39;s just like &#39;eh&#39;, then what tf am I supposed to do???&quot; I feel like were all fucked, sadly... People are just WAYYYY too dumb... The fucking pop culture retardation has worked WAYYYY too well... People have become irresponsible of some of the most fundamental parts of society, and ignorant of the most obvious dangers, and I feel like were all going to pay for it... SUCH a sad situation, and I honestly don&#39;t know what to do about it...</p>

<p>I feel like the only thing that will &quot;wake these people up&quot;, is when they&#39;re starving and dying, but, by that point (and this is based on research...) it will be too late... Those who look to enslave humanity are planning LIGHTYEARS ahead, and surely, they have plans for every &quot;fucktard reaction&quot; that might occur...</p>

<p>Idk man, just some shit on my mind, that I want to get off my chest, and I figured this is a good place to do it... I cant even answer questions on a fucking subreddit, cuz that shit&#39;s already censored... Before we know it, well be living in hell, and well only be able to look each other in the eyes and scream silently, because well probably be watched as we fucking shit... I don&#39;t look forward to a shitty ass future...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your frustration, sat at work at the moment, earning £8.65 an hour busting my ass off, boss comes down looking miserable as hell, says site is same since last time I’ve been. All the work we did was underground he’s a multi millionaire, pleads he is poor, but truth is he goes Las Vegas three times a year all out! I’ve tried telling my colleagues we’re slaves to make him fat and rich, all I get is “well you’d do the same if you had his money, if you was born into it like he was” .. it’s not the point I wouldn’t, I would look after people and respect them! I hate money and wealth! I’ve tried to convince my dad of 9/11 being an inside job, presented all the evidence to him and he still said you won’t convince me the American government did it for war, they could of done less devastating means, I try to tell him about Abraham Lincoln, JFK and why they were assassinated, why America are doing false flags and I honestly can’t convince anyone .. it’s frustrating and upsetting and In fact you feel like giving up! But this sub reddit has actually given me hope, like minded individuals like yourself .. stay strong, we can awaken people and if they don’t want to be, well we will have to stick together </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we as an generation only need to be patient, and have the time work for us. You are not alone, all over the world there are people waking up to this Alice in Wonderland, and seeing the things for what they are. But it is not fucked up, it&#39;s not bad at all. You should try to learn meditation, and see for yourself how beneficial it can be for you. There is no fear for the future. You are part of a so called &quot;make it or break it&quot; generation. it will take over 20 years, and maybe even more. But this world WILL change for the BETTER. people are THINKING of ways to make it better. And just by thinking and PROJECTING the positive thoughts of change, things will move in that direction. YOU ARE NOT ALONE, there are thousands if not 100&#39;s of thousands of you and me, and when the &quot;older generation&quot; comes to pass, we will take it over from them. And then things will start to move even quicker than it is doing now.</p>

<p>JUST.BE. PATIENT.</p>

<p>Much love and light and positive thoughts to you all, it is going to be an awesome life!</p>

But, honestly, people just seem so dumb, it seems hopeless... (and I am a little pissed that I&#39;ve spent this much time trying before realizing that...

    <div class="md"><p>You said it yourself, man. People have always been under the thumb of the wealthy. When they overthrow one wealthy class, another one just takes its place. What we are talking about is GREED and POWER, and the people who get molded by circumstance into sociopaths making them believe that&#39;s all what matters. That will never disappear.</p>

<p>Every generation believes that they can change the world, and every generation eventually realizes that the world doesn&#39;t want to be changed. My generation wanted tolerance and equality and the ability of the internet to make life convenient, and now that we&#39;ve gotten it, the new generation wants to push back on the bad parts of what happened. PLUS the old generation is trying to undo the good parts of what happened. So all you are left with is depressing.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to bring you down and I don&#39;t really expect you to believe me, I&#39;m just providing a perspective of a guy freshly seeing this transition play out.</p>

<p>Focus on yourself, make yourself the best person you can be, and hope that you get in a position where you can make a small amount of difference in your own community, because most every big difference you can make will eventually bite you in the ass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what you are feeling and expressed here most conspiracy theorists have felt at some point or going to feel if they spend too much time &quot;researching&quot; or trying to get people to listen. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 25 and I have been through this shit already, it&#39;s a severe mental drain and honestly man it&#39;s not worth putting yourself through. Just know what you know, keep paying attention but get some hobbies that allow you to switch off. (Working out, sports, video games, learn a skill etc) For your own sake. This isn&#39;t to say just ignore what&#39;s going on but don&#39;t make it the sole focus of your days. These three things helped me and I am still up to date with what&#39;s happening, I still read books about the history of this stuff but I don&#39;t try to convince people I just educate myself. </p>

<p>You say you are in to biology, I would recommend studying a bit of Psychology and Sociology, it makes this whole thing easier to uderstand why people are the way they are. </p>

<p>People don&#39;t want to know what&#39;s going on, they have their own problems to deal with and it&#39;s not your responsibility to save them or the world. You can only be responsible for yourself. The world is fucked but it doesn&#39;t mean your life has to be miserable.</p>

<p>The only advice I could give you is not to be so angry about it and stop focusing on everything that is wrong with the world, people don&#39;t want to be around that, it&#39;s depressing hence the no girlfriend and not many friends. Also you don&#39;t need many friends just 2 or 3 good ones that want to have a good time and are driven to achieve something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100 % agree here. I&#39;ve been where OP was, lost a girlfriend, maybe jeapordized a few friendships, all in the name of trying to help people wake up. </p>

<p>Nowadays I just wait for people to come to me. I don&#39;t hide that I am a conspiracy theorist and if people ask me questions I will answer how I truly feel about a given subject. </p>

<p>I think the only difference now is if I have friends over I won&#39;t start with: &quot;did you know that fractional reserve lending is literally the fucking devil and our entire financial system is a giant ponzi scheme? Also, the queen is a reptilian that gains life force to stay in our reality by imbibing on the flesh and blood of human children!&quot;</p>

<p>The point is for the OP, you can still do all the research you want but balance it with something that brings you joy, ideally something where you can make new friends. Personally I love board games more than any other hobby. If and when people reach out to you,  talk to them, but don&#39;t bang your head against the metaphorical wall trying to save them from their ignorant ways :)</p>

Without the Midwest, America’s story would be much different, for the worse. We wouldn’t have our own source of agricultural resources, we wouldn’t have access to the Missouri or Mississippi Rivers, let alone the Pacific Ocean (assuming Manifest Destiny never happened), we wouldn’t have the world’s finest freight railroad system, we wouldn’t have the world’s richest and most diverse railroading heritage, we wouldn’t have a ton of things I can’t possibly list here. </p>

<p>And how many times has the &quot;world been ending&quot; in the last 10 years? 50 years? Research that. How long has the &#39;jew menace&#39; and &#39;nwo&#39; been running everything and satanist panic and pedo world order etc been used as a McCarthyism type tactic?</p>

<p>Maybe spend a bit less time on the conspiracy theories and more time on yourself? You&#39;re not doing anyone favors being &quot;woke&quot;. There&#39;s 10+ times as much &quot;convincing&quot; psyop drivel out there as there is hard conspiracies.  </p>

<p>What good does any of this &#39;knowledge&#39; do you? If you spend all your time wrapped up in it you&#39;ll have no life, I&#39;ll tell you that now.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to make a choice &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;woke&quot;. Put yourself and your life first. Get your shit together, learn a trade (they&#39;re relatively cheap to learn, and make great money and actually <em>have unions</em>)</p>

<p>Make friends, find someone you care about. Move on with your life.</p>

<p>Do what you can to be skeptical in your free time. There&#39;s people out there who <em>GET PAID</em> to be skeptics, and they get ignored, and you&#39;re not one of them. Why are you wasting your time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to do this as well. Started waking up in 2005. I used to try to talk to people about things I had read. I learned that people just thought I was weird.</p>

<p>Then it progressed into talking about what I knew when others brought up a particulate subject. Say banking, I would interject a little bit of truth, hoping people would be open to an alternative idea. I found out from others that people would laugh at me behind my back for those comments.</p>

<p>Now I mostly just keep quiet. I still want to tell people stuff. But I&#39;ve learned that people just won&#39;t listen. I do it more now in a joking way. More covertly. </p>

<p>Case in point. I have a coworker that goes off on gun control and assault rifles. After he&#39;s done his rant about nobody should have guns I say something like. &quot;When seconds matter, the cops are only minutes away&quot;. Then I shut up and change the subject. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right that the economy is &quot;fucked&quot; but you don&#39;t make a very good case as to why. Some of what you&#39;re expressing is just frustration at your own lot in life which is totally understandable.</p>

<p>You&#39;re on the right track. I would advise you to &quot;change the channel&quot; in terms of your internal monologue. Try to see your opportunities within this messed up system. Think about how things could and should be instead of how they are, and you just end up laughing at the absurdity of it all.</p>

<p>Do the best you can at your new shitty job. Try to sock away some money (personally, I&#39;d save money in Bitcoin or silver, not in a bank) and pay off any debts. In a few years, you may have a different life more in line with what you want. The economy does, in reality, suck for the vast majority of people so take solace in the fact that you&#39;re not alone.</p>

<p>Best of luck.</p>

That said i think its very enticing to play the game of life and enjoy the spoils and i think that is your biggest obstacle to overcome in waking people. 
Nobody wants to be destitute in this world because anyway you look at it is unappealing. However once i got past my fears of never amounting to what others say i should have amounted to i have discovered that there&#39;s more to life than monetary wealth and happiness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude sounds like you are in a shitty place in life and depressed and channeling it all into conspiracy theories to avoid dealing with reality.</p>

<p><strong>I have a solution that will BEGIN to fix all of your problems at the same time!</strong></p>

<p>Stop worrying about spreading the word or researching this stuff.</p>

<p>Instead start <em>preparing</em> for the worst case you think may happen.  Not in an idiot, consumerist “buy lots of guns and MRE’s” but as in *learn actual survival skills such as identifying plants and foraging, get in shape, go hiking and camping and learn to trap and hunt game, learn how to grow food and start gardening, learn how to propagate plants from cuttings and seeds rather than buying them, learn how to do wood or metal working to make tools, and other skills needed for self sufficiency.</p>

<p>If the SHTF you will be better equipped to deal with it.</p>

<p>And if <em>nothing happens</em> you will be healthier and have some cool hobbies and skills that will make you feel good about yourself and even lead into being able to make more money (such as woodworking or carpentry rather than being a retail drone) and not be stuck inside your head obsessing over internet stuff.</p>

<p>You win either way.</p>
