       This past winter/fall, I worked with a fire ecologist in Lakeport, California, doing controlled burns and implementing other means of fire prevention. He had decades of experience doing this, and told us that there would be a terrible fire this year. He said a lot of different things could have happened over the years; that the way fire prevention in the area has been handled as a whole is nothing short of neglect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the fires are happening
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       as he described they would. He, along with other conscious property owners we worked with, all said the same thing: that the fires that have been affecting California for the past several years have been allowed to happen. Possibly even intentionally started. The fires that swept through Middletown and the surrounding area a few years ago supposedly had 8 different, simultaneous ignition points in a semi-circle to the north. Every property owner we worked with said the same thing: they're trying to drive people away from the area to secure the natural resources for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clear Lake is an amazing fresh water source, and in the coming years/decades, it will become immensely valuable. Additionally, one land owner and her husband said that there were valuable minerals and metals underground that could only be extracted if the population were not there. These same land owners also talked about the odd activity of the Coast Guard, specifically regarding HAARP. While we were there, there were days when our entire group's mood would just plummet. Like, I'm no stranger to having mood swings, but this was unusually powerful, and synchronous with everyone at the same time. She suggested that HAARP was being used to keep the population under fear, and while I can't say anything about that, there was a lot of unusual activity in the area that left a bad feeling in my mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes literally. There were days when there would be a rainbow halo around the sun. We commented on how pretty it was, but then we were told it was the aluminum in the air. I've never been a chemtrail conspiracy theorist, but
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       was putting unusual amounts of chemicals in the atmosphere, and the orchard- and vineyard-rich lands of Lakeport are no stranger to strange cloud streams from regular fly-overs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanted to share some of my experiences, because watching everything unfold as we've been told is unsettling. Of course no one's listening. There were people
       <em>
        watering there homes
       </em>
       and thought that would be enough to protect them. The majority of people in the area were very unconscious. Also, it was pretty much a police state while we were there. The number of cops patrolling the 5,000 population town of Lakeport was absurd. I'm concerned the people will just roll over, as is tradition in America, and let the land be taken over.

       It's interesting that you bring up Clear Lake and the fact that it feels they're being driven from their homes. They had a fire earlier this fire season and now there's two more fires eating their way towards Clear Lake as we speak from Mendocino.

       At first I was thinking, 'Good grief, they just can't catch a break.' Now that you're saying it's a possible valuable resource they want to keep to themselves.

       I think it's safe to say most people will just chalk this up to the drought and just being unfortunate. Like, this is something that blows my mind. People will be like "those sociopathic corporations will stop at nothing to turn a profit! We need more oversight!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Yea, those running them and our government would have no problem destroying the lives of a few thousand people for their personal gain. See 9/11, every war ever, most avoidable tragedies."

       Well, I don't know how long after a wildfire starts to when they begin investigating the cause. I know the 2017 wildfires that were around the Napa area were blamed on PG&amp;E, however there were numerous reports on Facebook of people claiming they saw a black car and a white van following each other around setting more fires. Nothing ever came of it either. People were posting pictures of the vehicles as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was the fire map for the area last year.
       <a href="https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2017/10/Cal-Fire-map-12-October-630x447.jpg">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I've come to learn that CalFire doesn't show all the grass fires on the map, they will have them listed on the website but will say 'This is not a CAL FIRE incident. Please click the link for more information.'

       Yep and to buy up the farms to have greater control over the food supply. If you wanna learn more about it look up the work of Rosa Koire. Reading agenda 2030 really puts the future into perspective for me and makes a lot of what's happening right now make way more sense.

       I'll read more into her. Seems interesting at first glance. And I totally agree about the food supply. We need more people growing their own food! Instead of lawns, we should be growing gardens, and those with the land should be investing in creating food forests.

       I agree! I just started my first serious garden this year and its so rewarding. The tomatoes seriously taste like a completely different plant than the store bought. So much flavor. My property management company had the gall to reprimand me for putting a garden in the plots of dirt that were filled with overgrown weeds before that they dont take care of even tho its their responsibility cause its a triplex haha. Fuck that next year im going even bigger

       I agree, gardening is very rewarding in a lot of ways. Kale is a great addition to any garden because the turn around is so quick and it can be grown for most of the year. There was one Thai restaurant we went to in California that had gardens in their parking lot islands. That's what we need to inspire more people to do: innovate and use the land that's available. We're not doing ourselves any good being reliant on the preexisting institutions.

       This is also a pattern which is discussed in
       <em>
        The Wikileaks Files
       </em>
       (Chapter 1 America and the Dictators, page 55) in regards to Latin/Central America:

      <ul>
       <li>
        One effect was to drive small farmers and peasants off the land, filling the urban centers with willing employees.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The Trump trade war will most likely have the same effect--soybean prices are down 12% (as of mid-July).

       Trump's trade war has also hit pork producers--supposedly the cargo ships are full of unbought pork.
      </p>
      <p>
       The small farmers will be hit hardest; the larger, corporate farms may weather it better.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only true winners will be the Wall Streeters who shorted US soybeans and invested in Brazilian agriculture products...and the USG which expects more money gained from the tariffs placed on Chinese goods.

       Been local to Mendo and Lake for the past 6 years. Every time we've had a massive fire I've noticed an unusually high amount of static electricy in the days leading up to the fires. I've not really encountered static electricy in the summers of California
       <em>
        except
       </em>
       for the few days to a week before massive fires break out.

       That's really strange. I totally believe it. I think they were putting some chemicals in the atmosphere to make it easier to reverberate a HAARP transmission out over a wider area; use the diffraction to scatter the frequencies and perturb a population's mental/emotional state. The general mood of Lakeport was terrible. Like, people had given up on life and were just going through the motions like zombies.

       Most definitely. The entirety of this year has been very turbulent mood swings for everyone on my hill. Lots of depression, general lunacy, horrid decision making and zombie motions. I've noticed sleeping indoors to increase irrational behavior in myself. Been truck sleeping and walking barefoot. Seems to help my demeanor but as I "vibrate higher", the people around me have been vibing lower, nearly almost going out of their way to jostle my mood.

       Glad you noticed the Sun halos..a few years ago the chemtrails I experienced in Covelo(a few hours north of Lake) were so bad they literally irritated my eyes and turned a chemtrail denier into a believer within a few minutes.

       There's a really interesting local to Redding "live" news report where the reporter explains that, in a neighborhood with no fires, cars were flipped over and roofs ripped off houses as if a tornado came through the neighborhood.

       The last month we were there we were camping on a property halfway between Lakeport and Ukiah. It was beautiful, and being that connected to nature definitely raises your vibration.

       The Carr fire burned so hot that it created it’s own weather system, which in turn caused tornadoes made of fire. I’ve lived in Ca nearly my entire life and this isn’t the first time, I’ve seen massive fires do this. Unfortunately it’s our new reality and it’s only going to get worse. I’ve been evacuated from my home at least 3 times because of fires and I wouldn’t wish that on my enemy.

       That's terrible. I'm sorry you have to put up with that. We need to get the people aware of what's going on/being allowed to happen. There is so much that could be done to even slow the spread of fires.

       Sometimes the fire starts and spreads so quickly that, you have only a few short minutes to get out. You learn what’s really important in life when have 10 mins to evacuate. We put clothes on and grabbed our critters, then we were out of time. 
     There’s a lot that can be done to slow the fires down, but it involves everyone following the rules put in place and unfortunately not everyone will. We cleared the brush around our property and kept our trees trimmed. Our neighbors didn’t and our house nearly burned to the ground because of that lazy neighbor. Most fires are stared accidentally, like the Carr fire was started by a malfunctioning car. Others are started by illegal camp fires. If people would use simple common sense then we wouldn’t have nearly as many fires as we’ve had lately.

       As MattIsMyCat pointed out. The fires burned so hot they created their own weather patterns, which caused tornados. Yet that doesn't explain a pic I've seen of a half a house burnt down which literally looks like the house was sawed in half. And a trampoline fully intact directly over the fence of a house completely burned down.
      </p>
      <p>
       There could be a fully reasonable explanation for the half house and trampoline not melting...tho how does a wooden fence and trampoline not burn when they are within 30 ft of an entire house on fire? Maybe some badass with a garden hose? Or they happened to be doused by a plane or helicopter? I don't have those answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I did witness was odd chemtrails the day of the 28th of July, when the Mendo Complex fires started roaring. Full lines across the sky with dashed out chemtrails in between. Layered about 5-7 chemtrails deep, starting and ending in full lines with the dashed lines in between.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even stranger, yet more anecdotal, my buddy was on the ridgeline as it was burning. He said he was watching some of the planes "make clouds" as he put it. Three planes would layer a spray or mist (not the red retardant stuff) in the same area and a cloud would form. Later we watched as the fire seemed to hit a microclimate, and most likely a fire break, and it would completely stalemate. Turning into a thunder head looking cloud like I've seen in Florida. Not the Pyrocumulous clouds I had watched it produce earlier.

       And there are people who would have seen this and would still deny chemtrails and weather manipulation.

       That's really weird about the house and trampoline. I mentioned in another comment that we saw a ufo on one of the offgrid properties, zipping around, seemingly defying physics. There's likely some tech development going on in the area.

       I'm a native from Ukiah.  All 3 of my kids were born at Ukiah general.  My kids dad worked for the sheriff's department there as did his did his parents.  My sister and bro-in-law and their families still live there. We all graduated high school from Potter Valley.

       Needless to say, I am just sickened by the fact that my hometown is in flames - again. And this year my daughter was forced to evacuate her home in Redding as well. But something is rotten in Denmark.  And I started smelling it during the Sonoma fires a couple years ago.

       I'd lay the blame directly on the UN Agenda 21 and 2030 which describes clearing the land and moving people to high rises and encouraging the consumption of insects as well as restrictions on travel. They are backed by the super-rich who want to fly helicopters and blimps over the pristine lands like the ladies and lords of England clearing the landowners of Scotland so they could ride their horses over the countryside, their own private park without pesky citizens.

       Legal weed starts up and like magic, the weed-growing regions get torched (although I noted up and down during the Napa/Sonoma fires that the fires have not actually hit any dense weed-growing areas).

       Yea, I imagine there was a large incentive to damage the weed industry to normalize the market, in their favor of course.

       While we were there, we were going to visit some hot springs but never got the opportunity. Glad we didn't then!

       I can't say either way how the town's culture developed. Regardless, there were very few people in town who would be able to piece together any conspiracy going on under their nose. We mostly stayed with the one fire ecologist, and branched out to a few communities and remote properties in the area. The people off-grid were at least awake enough to see the strings.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yea, because there is so much fuel everywhere. While driving to some properties, the ecologist would point out how the fire would spread. There are so many areas that should have been cleared out to slow down any encroaching fire. But they, weren't thereby allowing the fires to travel at top speed. The controlled burns we did in the mountains around Scotts Valley probably gives the town an extra day before the fires will reach there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure whomever allowed this to happen is also fucking with the weather to create these conditions. It's not like we haven't had the ability to do this for 50-60 years...

       There's definitely some shady tech development going on in the area. One night we saw a ufo at one of the off-grid properties we were at. Disc shape and everything. You could hear it distort the air as it zipped around to and fro.

       Totally concur the off-grid folks are wide awake.  The retirees and young adult walking methzombies are sadly sleeping.

       I had not considered tech being in the rural NorCal.  However it makes sense with some of the CIA connections up there.  One of those fake hippy compounds could easily be cover for this.  NorCal gets a fair amount of UFO stuff, usually tied to Mt. Shasta.

       I assume they've droned each and every off-grid property.

       Are you local NorCal?  My pet theory is the future social/cultural battle will be fought in NorCal.  Techies and Bionics and Statists (Bay Area) vs the Humanists (NorCal).  Humanists will not chip up and reject virtually all of the Statist stuff (GMOs, nanny state, wide array of issues).  This is seen at Burning Man presently as the tension between Darktards (NorCal) and Sparkle Ponies (Bay Area).

       You figure there would be secrets hidden in any heavily rural area. The less eyes = the less evidence can be collected by the public. I know there's a nuclear detonator fabrication plant somewhere north of Lake County. Not entirely sure where though, just heard stories.

       No, I'm from New York originally. My ex and I flew to Oregon to work with a nonprofit, which turned out to be a cult. We got completely blind-sided with the brainwashing and wound up sticking with a tentacle group after a planned schism to win back our loyalty. We traveled through Northern California, where we thought we were helping with permaculture groups, but in hindsight it was obvious they were looking to rip off people and get more mind-slaves.

       Sounds like NorCal!!!  Hippies (&amp; Rednecks) vs Occult.  And the occult look like hippies.  It's tricky.  All the back-to-earth hippies were essentially followed and drowned out by the occult front groups.  So decades later, now it's hard to tell which compounds, farms, etc are true or sociopath.

       I just made a comment about this the other day.
I lived in Whitmore for a year growing and was around Redding/Ono during some fires, as well as around Trinity and Humboldt counties. I definitely feel ya on the cultral battle impending out there.
I love the 707 and norcal in general, stuck in the midwest for now dealing with legal stuff but I'd like to move back west and raise my son out there. 
I saw how they allowed fires to burn and how there were tons of cops/feds around when the fires were raging around Ono and Igo, also in Whitmore and when i was in Hyampom.

       Or higher co2 levels along with warmer spring temperatures cause more vegetation to grow faster and bigger than normal,then higher than average summer temperatures dry out vegetation sooner than normal.

       We cleared out hundreds if not thousands of acres of dense brush over the course of months. If more people in the area made even a minor attempt to improve their lands, everyone would be in a much,

       better position. But, of course that's not beneficial to those waiting to grab hold of everything through eminent domain, so the local population has been kept in a sedated, zombie-like state, thus allowing this to happen.

       I am right next to the Carr fire. I have had conversations with a few of the locals that had their houses burn down. They were in the front line of the fire when it started and that Cal Fire stood there and watched their houses burn down. One person I met in line at Safeway told me there was 3 fire trucks at their house and they did nothing while it burned down. I have also heard Cal fire was ordered to stand down at the start of the fire. I think someone wanted this fire to get out of control.

       I have a nagging feeling that the central valley is one of the next ones up. There is land in between Sacramento and Stockton that is currently protected or used for agriculture that is prime real estate for developers here. With a more developed overlap of San joaquin/sacramento countis, you're looking at a smaller scale LA. The area is already being marketed as "the greater silicon valley" and developers in Stockton are pushing north(sacramento developers pushing south). These guys have been pulling scams for decades now, and are no strangers to using arson as a tool of devaluing real estate(check out the rash of downtown fires from a couple years ago). Hoping im just paranoid.

       Don't mind me digging this thread back up, but something interesting has come across my Facebook feed. This was posted on a page dedicated to local dealings around the county.

       So this woman admits to starting 11 different fires that have been happening around Berryessa. The thing that was the most interesting to me was... She works for the County of Solano.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "In interviews with Cal Fire investigators, Windholz admitted to discarding lit cigarettes and matches at the ignition points of several of the fires, Deputy District Attorney Agnes Dziadur said."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting to see someone, who works for the County, being capable of doing something like that. Something in the back of my head kind of wonders if it's something more than just that. If there wasn't a little help to push her to do it.

       It is a corrupted institution, and dangerous because they push their programs at local governments, city councils, zoning commissions, and school children. It's what's left of the Fabian Societies, and Malthusians.

       That's really weird about the house and trampoline. I mentioned in another comment that we saw a ufo on one of the offgrid properties, zipping around, seemingly defying physics. There's likely some tech development going on in the area.
