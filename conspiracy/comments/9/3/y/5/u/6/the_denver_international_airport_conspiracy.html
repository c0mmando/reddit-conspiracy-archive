        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think this one is really interesting. It&#39;s infamous for its (now removed, some of them at least) creepy looking murals seemingly referring to future military oppression and a one-world government, gargoyles, a statue of Anubis, a 32 foot tall statue of a giant horse with fiery glowing eyes (which killed its sculptor when it fell on him), it&#39;s kinda shaped like a swastika, ties to the Freemasons and Templars. The list goes on.</p>

<p>I mean, who would feel safe at an airport while being greeted by <a href="http://conspiracy-gov.com/images/dumbs/mural-in-dia_800.jpg">this</a>?</p>

<p>The fact that it exists in the first place boggles the mind of a lot of people since there is a perfectly capable one closer to downtown. Also it&#39;s twice the size of Manhattan and went $2 billion over budget.</p>

<p>One would think that if there would be something going on there they wouldn&#39;t be so on the nose with the imagery, that they&#39;d be more inconspicuous about it, unless it&#39;s what people say about Area 51, that the conspiracy theories about it was put in the ether by the &quot;government&quot; itself to divert attention from somewhere else.</p>

<p>One of the more crazy stories I heard about it was someone taking the elevator to a level below ground only to find rows of urinals which were way too big for a normal human, he heard a sound, freaked out and hastily returned to the surface area. Lol, yeah...</p>

<p>So what are your opinions on this crazy place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone here always says how weird and disturbing the horse is. It was pretty mild and out of place in person. And like I said the murals are definitely weird, but people here act like there is just this horribly creepy vibe surrounding the whole place that culminates with the murals. Idk I thought the airport was pretty cool and huge and never felt this creepy vibe from anything there. Then randomly there are the murals and it’s like well they’re weird, whatever. Then you stop looking at them and it’s just normal airport again. Honestly years ago I went through a phase of smoking weed all day every day and believing every conspiracy I could read and get a YouTube video on, and one of the ones I was like wtf about was the DIA. Then I get out of that phase and am at the airport and I need to remind myself it’s the place I’m supposed to feel creeped out and weird about, but really I just thought the place was pretty amazing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also the obvious pyramid shape and the fact they weren&#39;t allowed to build hotels within a certain mile radius so maybe there&#39;s tunnels under? Idk I don&#39;t know anything about building codes tho. There&#39;s also a placard outside that says it was donated by the new world order foundation. Seems pretty fuckin blatant lol. My guess is it&#39;s some sort of doomsday bunker or something. I took way too much edibles to go on a flight to Europe flying out of there and it was one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my life haha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has always been one of my favorite conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>I remember hearing an account from one of the contractors that was hired when it was being built. He said they installed a section of the facility deep underground and had to run a shit ton of cable. They finished one single level and were replaced with another contractor. He claimed they did this for the entire project to compartmentalize the knowledge of the whole layout. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always thought there is some sort of underground facility there. Lots of esoteric symbolism there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea it kinda goes hand in hand with the whole theory that all major military bases in the U.S. is interconnected via a huge maglev train tunnel network. Maybe they needed a base near Denver for one reason or other but it being so close to the city they needed a front, hence the airport.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of interconnected tunnel network is so badass. I actually don&#39;t doubt it for a second. So much black budget money goes down the memory hole every year, after all these years there&#39;s most definitely more than meets the eye.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always suspected that when Eisenhower built the interstate system, it was used as cover to develop an underground network to transport military equipment.  The full name of the interstate system is: &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways&quot;</p>

<p>As far as the underground network at the denver airport goes- Denver airport is where the planes go when continuity of government happens in the case a mass casualty event.  I suspect that there are tunnels leading to the cheyenne mountain complex, which is effectively an underground city by colorado springs, next to norad and northcomm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it wasn&#39;t a cover .. the interstates were specifically built to move heavy weaponry like tanks on flatbeds n stuff. we wouldn&#39;t have built them (yet) if not for the war .. </p>

<p>now if you&#39;re suggesting they built a second underground highway system at the same time as the regular one, and used contraction of the regular one as a front, then yes I could possibly see that.. barring any technological restraints of the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Denver and was just a baby when we were using Stapleton. DIA is HUGE. I have been fascinated by the conspiracy theories, but a lot of them are incorrect or can be explained away. </p>

<p>1) Those miles of cables? There is a metric shit ton of luggage moving equipment below ground. They have to be powered somehow. </p>

<p>2) I read some theory about DIA having barbed-wire fencing facing towards the running, as to keep people INSIDE the tarmac. Well, that&#39;s completely false, it&#39;s facing towards the outside as I&#39;ve verified close to 20 times now.</p>

<p>3) The swastika runway design. This is the dumbest of them all. The only people who have this argument are people who don&#39;t understand how aviation works. Our winds out here are SQUIRELLY!! They blow mostly from the west due to the &quot;chinook winds&quot; coming off the Rockies, but they tend to be all over the place. As to the aviation part of it, you always land/take off INTO the wind, meaning they had to design the airport to allow for the maximum amount of traffic to land/depart at all times. This theory is silly.</p>

<p>4) The artwork? Well, shit, I have no good answer for our demon horse, or masked-swordsman, or gargoyle, or masonic stones. That part is all weird.   </p>

A prominent Freemason also contracted all of the other artwork for the airport, the big horse, the murals, gargoyles, etc. The Anubis statue does not appear to have any Masonic connection though, it travels all over the place with the King Tut exhibit. </p>

<p>Seems pretty mundane to me. I&#39;m not a Freemason, so maybe there are some big secrets that aren&#39;t shared with the public, but the stuff out in the open has a simple explanation.</p>

I swear, if you want to meet some randos in the flesh to talk about DIA, just go!

    <div class="md"><p>I was in Denver visiting my family (grew up there) and went to check out the murals. I was looking and a girl came up to me and I said &quot;creepy, huh&quot;? She said no, they&#39;re beautiful.&quot; Turns out it was the daughter of the painter, and she was there with her elderly father visiting his work one last time. I put my foot in my mouth because I didn&#39;t want to offend them. They told me the paintings are supposed to summarize world history and where we could end up if things don&#39;t change and then rebirth. I ended up taking a photo with the artist in front of the murals, still have them saved on my computer. </p>

<p>I had sleep paralysis and the STRANGEST dreams ever that night. I get paralysis often, especially when I&#39;m traveling, but it shook me up. Not sure why any of this is relevant, but there&#39;s my story... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw the painter at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s bizarre to me is the amount of detail that went into building the airport: the floor of the main terminal features every known sample of granite from across the world. Why would this be appropriate? Imagine the cost of acquiring these materials when compared to the cost of using local granite. There&#39;s also tons of weird <a href="https://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/add-au.jpg?quality=85&amp;amp;strip=info&amp;amp;w=920">symbols</a> <a href="https://cdn3.whatculture.com/images/2015/11/ABbNwRou.jpg">like</a> <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cs6uAZGWIAExrVP.jpg">these</a> etched into the floor, where several thousand travelers move about daily, without a moment&#39;s notice.

Also, the place is so absurdly huge: 110 million cubic yards, or 8 Titanic&#39;s-worth of dirt was moved during construction, and DIA property covers 53 square miles, roughly the same amount of land used for large American cities like Boston and Dayton. Even still, massive renovation projects are currently underway, including a 3-year $780 million plan to revamp the main terminal and turn it into something called the &quot;Great Hall,&quot; and runway reconstruction estimated at ~$50 million. There is always something happening there.</p>

The full name of the interstate system is: &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways&quot;</p>

<p>As far as the underground network at the denver airport goes- Denver airport is where the planes go when continuity of government happens in the case a mass casualty event.  I suspect that there are tunnels leading to the cheyenne mountain complex, which is effectively an underground city by colorado springs, next to norad and northcomm.</p>
