<p>Whole area felt like it was under siege.  The aircraft sounded like they were going to crash.  They were not using lights.  My house shook because they were so close.  Can anyone explain?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This happened in Minneapolis a year or two ago.  We were told it was some kind of special forces training exercise.  I didn&#39;t see much because my house is on a direct vector to the airport runways about 5-6 miles away, but we did wind up with a Blackhawk that circled the neighborhood and then hovered for about 10 minutes, which meant that runway wasn&#39;t in use at the moment or flights got delayed so they could do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s why I specifically said the dense areas around DC. Sterling is pretty far west relatively speaking. Arlington, Alexandria, Falls Church, Bethesda, Rockville, I’ve lived in all these places and it’s a nightly thing.

    <div class="md"><p>Seen that guy!  Seen Rt7sucks (something along those lines.)    I guess I should have mentioned Alexandria, but I was there only briefly.  </p>

<p>And you are right!  Sterling and Ashburn are relatively far out..lol.  I moved a few years back.  Live south of PW county now and commute only as far north as  Manassasas (worst town ever, luckily just the outskirts where the techy stuff is) these days.  I have gotten used to hearing people call Sterling the city.  Guess it rubbed off.</p>

<p>I got family coming this week also.  They dont know that The DMV is Seattle now and rain is the new norm.  </p>

<p>Wow, went on a NOVA tanget there.  Wonder if this will attract any others.</p>

<p>I had a friend in High School who was doing special forces training in College and he told me there were a few times he was called in the middle of the night to head just outside campus, where he was picked up by a black helicopter that landed in a nearby field.
