    <div class="md"><p>Exactly what it sounds like, but beyond our realm of perception.  It&#39;s like a field or dimension that we enter into once we die.  From there, our beings may be guided very explicitly towards a point where we will just go right back into the cycle, with none of the knowledge or insight we gained during our time spent in the physical plane.  It keeps us all in a perpetual state of spiritual infancy - which is how these parasitic beings are able to stay in control.</p>

<p>The Archons apparently are the controllers/manipulators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only the body (flesh) dies.   The soul is eternal.  It&#39;s just a question where your eternal soul spends eternity.  The vast majority of humanity will spend it experiencing the &#39;second death&quot; which is here:</p>

<p>Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. </p>

<p>In order to not have that happen one must repent and believe the gospel of Grace which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>You got to understand that you are a guilty sinner (we all are) deserving of the 2nd death but God himself came in the flesh of Christ Jesus and shed is blood so you don&#39;t have to.  All he wants is for us to understand that and repent and believe the gospel.  Then your eternal soul will spend a timeless eternity on new earth with access to new heaven.  It&#39;s that simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about this question for many years. Many of my colleagues / coworkers believe that after you die, there is nothing - a state of nonexistence much like before you were born. They argue that this is the simplest explanation, so therefore it is the most likely answer. </p>

<p>However, I like to look to the rest of the universe and I notice that it is very chaotic and complex. The most simple universe you can imagine would be one with no matter, no energy, and no evolution - just empty space. Yet, our universe has galaxies, stars, chemistry, biology, complex life, conscious beings - a bunch of very strange things which don&#39;t make a whole lot of sense.</p>

<p>So my conclusion is this: the most likely state after death is not &quot;nothing&quot;, but instead will be more of the same - a bunch of stuff that doesn&#39;t make any sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occam&#39;s Razor has been extremely helpful and beneficial in some ways, but I don&#39;t know if it can be applied to something that in no way shape or form, has been measured definitively, or <em>can</em> be measured, as far as we know.</p>

<p>I agree with your overall assertion that whatever is going to happen when we die, it will be beyond our ability to perceive or understand.  Thus, we&#39;d be completely vulnerable and susceptible to any kind of influence.  Maybe that&#39;s why we&#39;ve been under control for so long - because we&#39;ve grown so out of touch with our spiritual side, and how to harness/achieve the act of active and continuing reincarnation, much like Hermes Trismegistus. </p>
