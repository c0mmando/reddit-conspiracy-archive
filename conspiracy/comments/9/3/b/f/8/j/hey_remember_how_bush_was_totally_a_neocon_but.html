        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Like when he supported Bush’s unconstitutional Patriot Act</strong> </p>

<p>In May 2011, Obama <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/patriot-act-extension-signed-into-law-despite-bipartisan-resistance-in-congress/2011/05/27/AGbVlsCH_story.html">signed</a> a renewal of the Patriot Act. </p>

<p><strong>Or increased the national debt more in one term than Bush did in two?</strong> </p>

<p>The national debt <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57400369-503544/national-debt-has-increased-more-under-obama-than-under-bush/">increased</a> more during Obama’s first three years and two months than it did during all eight years of George W. Bush’s presidency. </p>

<p><strong>Or when he agreed grees with Bush’s support of unconstitutional, indefinite detention of U.S. citizens without filing any charges?</strong> </p>

<p>In December 2011, ACLU executive director Anthony D. Romero  criticized Obama for signing a bill that gave the U.S. government the  power to<a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/president-obama-signs-indefinite-detention-bill-law">indefinitely detain</a> U.S. citizens without any charges being filed or any trial taking place. </p>

<p><strong>Or when he agreed with Bush’s support of unconstitutional, warrantless wiretapping?</strong> </p>

<p>President Obama has <a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Obama_Administration_quietly_expands_Bushs_legal_0407.html">defended</a> warrantless wiretapping. </p>

<p><strong>Or when he refused prosecution of Wall. St criminals?</strong> </p>

<p>Although Obama had <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/05/06/why-can-t-obama-bring-wall-street-to-justice.html">promised</a> to prosecute Wall St. criminals, during <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-wall-street-execs-werent-prosecuted-2013-1">his entire first term</a>, his administration did not file any criminal charges against any of the top financial executives. </p>

<p><strong>Or had four U.S. citizens killed without judicial process?</strong> </p>

<p>Obama had <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-acknowledges-killing-of-four-us-citizens-in-counterterrorism-operations/2013/05/22/7a21cf84-c31d-11e2-8c3b-0b5e9247e8ca_print.html">four</a> U.S. citizens killed without judicial process. </p>

<p>The ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/aclu-lens-american-citizen-anwar-al-aulaqi-killed-without-judicial-process">accused</a> Obama of violating the U.S. Constitution for doing this. </p>

<p>U.S. Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/65035.html">said</a> that Obama’s actions might be an impeachable offense. </p>

<p><strong>Or ordered private company to fire 1,000 employees?</strong> </p>

<p>In 2011, after Boeing had hired 1,000 new employees to work at  its new factory in South Carolina, the Obama administration ordered  Boeing to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/business/21boeing.html?_r=2">shut down</a> the factory, because the factory was non-union. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reagan was the charismatic uplifting face to win the ticket. Bush Sr was a stiff by comparison. Bush couldn&#39;t even win his own state of Texas.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_presidential_primaries,_1980">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_presidential_primaries,_1980</a></p>

<p>To contrast Jimmy Carter was challenged by Ted Kennedy on the 1980 Democrat ticket.   </p>

<p>Bush Sr needed Reagan, or Republicans would have lost the Presidential race. It&#39;s widely speculated that the March 1981 Reagan assassination attempt was actually initiated by Bush Sr or people close to him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton definitely pushed their agenda, with the NATO eastward expansion alone. There have been a <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/07/local/me-10464">lot of warnings about what could happen</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Diplomat-historian George F. Kennan perhaps said it most clearly when he wrote earlier this year in a newspaper commentary: &quot;Expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the post cold-war era. Such a decision may be expected . . . to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my opinion this was what enabled Putin to become President in the first place, like <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/1997_06-07/natolet">it was predicted</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Russia, NATO expansion, which continues to be opposed across the entire political spectrum, will strengthen the nondemocratic opposition, undercut those who favor reform and cooperation with the West, bring the Russians to question the entire post-Cold War settlement, and galvanize resistance in the Duma to the START II and III treaties; In Europe, NATO expansion will draw a new line of division between the &quot;ins&quot; and the &quot;outs,&quot; foster instability, and ultimately diminish the sense of security of those countries which are not included;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I guess that was the plan all along, and the results you see in the media every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good find actually. </p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious eastward expansion of NATO shifted the (eventual) battlefield east, which makes it less favorable grounds to fight on. It&#39;s not unthinkable that Russian agression towards the baltics is only met with further sanctions instead of triggering article 5, simply because US intervention would weaken the US so much it loses its world leadership.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Political theater is a distraction for plebs who think their vote matters</p>

<p>Most of the Democrat Party and Republican Parties are effectively controlled opposition for what is effectively a new corporate vanguard and  Aristocrat class.  i.e. the Rothchilds, Soros, Bezos, and other globalists like them that collectively own most of the world&#39;s wealth. The messaging outlets are fodder and red meat to control plebs (see 1976 film network)</p>

<p>Those at the top of the food chain hedge bets buying politicians from both parties. This is why policy, laws, treaties, and other aspects of government rarely change to benefit the common man.</p>

<p>The Russia Hoax is a fraud perpetrated on the American people because for once in a very long time, the puppeteers have their string cut and lost control of the executive.  Everything since the 2016 election has been one giant temper tantrum.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not dedicated to Bush being an idiot or not, all I&#39;m saying is that there is clear future benefit for the establishment to frame him as intelligent to reinforce any future president. I&#39;m sure Trump will get some of the same treatment from the MSM that throws dirt on him now, to further entrench the idea that the president actually decides on policy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assumed you&#39;d give one example explicitly related to foreign policy, where Bush really starred with his most neoconny act ever, misleading the public and launching an illegal war in Iraq. But for some reason you didn&#39;t, although Obama&#39;s foreign policy was mostly terrible and intervention-riddled. Instead you&#39;ve focused on domestic policy moves one would expect out of Bush but don&#39;t really fit the neocon ideology...which makes me think yr using it as a buzzword meaning Bad.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, has Trump reversed any of these shoddy Obama admin moves? Is the same game being played?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or increased the national debt more in one term than Bush did in two?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think debt is really the best metric here. Deficit is. When Obama was sworn in, the Deficit was at $1.4 trillion. In his last fiscal year, it was $665B. Should he have done more to reduce the deficit? Definitely. But the fact remains that the deficit was cut by more than half during the period he was President. It seems to me that the issue with Obama here isn&#39;t as much that he, himself, was spending like crazy, as it is that he didn&#39;t do a good enough job cleaning up the spending of his predecessor.</p>

<p>In contrast, Bush came in with a $236B SURPLUS, and managed to leave with the previously mentioned $1.4 trillion deficit. By just the end of his first term, the deficit was at $318B, meaning he added $500B to the deficit even before the financial crisis.</p>

<p>The problem was congressional republicans blocked all his efforts to really address this. </p>

<p>There were deals struck that increased revenues and cut spending that would have reduced deficits significantly, but the tea party fukwits blocked them all because of the revenue increases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Political theater is a distraction for plebs who think their vote matters</p>

<p>Most of the Democrat Party and Republican Parties are effectively controlled opposition for what is effectively a new corporate vanguard and  Aristocrat class.  i.e. the Rothchilds, Soros, Bezos, and other globalists like them that collectively own most of the world&#39;s wealth. The messaging outlets are fodder and red meat to control plebs (see 1976 film network)</p>

<p>Those at the top of the food chain hedge bets buying politicians from both parties. This is why policy, laws, treaties, and other aspects of government rarely change to benefit the common man.</p>

<p>The Russia Hoax is a fraud perpetrated on the American people because for once in a very long time, the puppeteers have their string cut and lost control of the executive.  Everything since the 2016 election has been one giant temper tantrum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t know any Lefties who supported Obama. I know some who tolerated him because it wasn&#39;t immediately evident he was the black George Bush but I don&#39;t know any who supported him the way the Left supported Jill Stein or Bernie Sanders. Is Obama even a Lefty?  Can we just go back to calling him a Democrat please.</p>
