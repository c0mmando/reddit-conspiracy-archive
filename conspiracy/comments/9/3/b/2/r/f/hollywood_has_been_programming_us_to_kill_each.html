       Think of every Hollywood movie and TV show that deals with the collapse of modern society, what do they all have in common?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer: Everyone in those shows reverts back to being a maniac that is out to kill other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe that this is because humans are 'naturally' like that at all. I think that whole image of man the savage creature is complete bullshit that has been fed to us by a combination of incorrect history and suggestive Hollywood programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Are humans historically savage
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure humanity has had its share of not too nice moments towards one another, but if you look deeper into this it is usually a result of manipulations by certain small groups, such as royalty or upper echelons of clergy. Almost all wars going back to the 16th century can be traced to being caused by financial interests. It's not that people are these bloodthirsty monsters just waiting for the chance to kill each other, it's almost certainly always the case that simple people are recruited into a larger force and are just doing what they are told. There even exists numerous studies and witness reports that in conflict scenarios most non-professional soldiers will intentionally miss lethal shots. Any wars before the 16th century I do not believe are reliable sources of information because after that point any and all history you read was written, edited and distributed by the Catholic Church, any thing contrary was destroyed and has been subsequently discredited by institutional universities which remain very much controlled by the established power structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, numerous historical accounts of civilisations conquered by colonial forces included overstated descriptions of the violent nature of those people. This was to justify the horrific actions of the colonial forces in displacing these people (these savages must be civilised!). Now don't misunderstand me, there does exist violent societies, violent people, and violent customs. But I do not think mankind is a 'naturally' violent creature. I think that historic viewpoint is based on incorrect labelling to justify conquest, assumptions that wars are the people's ideas, and the labelling of historical losers by historical victors to paint them in a negative light.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Hollywood image of post-society man
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost every show and film without exception has the image that we will all turn violent at the drop of a hat. Think of the examples; Mad Max: roving gangs of desert marauders intent on murder; The Walking Dead: survivors kill each other more than the zombies; The Road: the danger isn't starvation its other people; The 100: Various survivors of the apocalypse wage tribal war on one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       You get the picture. If there is a show that doesn't include these notions I haven't seen it and it's the exception. I believe this is a very deliberate manipulation on part of the controllers of Hollywood to introduce the idea into the reality of people that 'that's just what you do' or 'that's just how people are'. The benefits of this are fairly obvious, 1. It separates people from one another by fostering that dog-eat-dog mentality, so we don't see each other as neighbours and other people, but as opposing forces. And 2. So in the event of catastrophe, man-made or naturally occurring, elite survivors will have less people to worry about because we'll be too busy killing off what little survivors there are ourselves because that's what we've been conditioned to believe about ourselves. And it's worked! How many people have a zombie apocalypse or whatever plan in their head that involves killing other people? Most of the people I have spoken to about it.

       <strong>
        Do you feel like a killer?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Think to yourself if you want to go around killing other people. I don't mean the feelings of having a shit day and wanting to take it out on some faceless person (you shouldn't really be thinking like that anyway), but I mean in the way Kanye puts it, premeditated murder. I'd wager that most of us don't really want to kill another person at all. I don't. And I'm sure that out of those that did, once you dug through the edgy, juvenile, 'people are shit' attitude that a lot of people never seem to grow out of, I'm sure there wouldn't be a large amount of actual killers left.  It's not our natural state. Yes, humans had to get savage after the Flood thousands of years ago because resources we're scarce, but it's not the default setting of the Human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also doesn't mention that the best way to stay alive in a collapse type scenario is to
       <strong>
        work together
       </strong>
       . The lone wolf dies without the pack, and it's the same with people. If you trying to go all walking-dead on everyone after a social collapse you're not going to go the distance. It's like the old addage: live by the sword die by the sword. The way to survive is to band together with people and help each other out. It's how humans actually progressed through the last few thousand years. Those same intellectuals who will say with a high and mighty attitude that 'oh people are just savage monkeys' will also stand by the fact that humans only survived cause of our ability to work together. And don't think that only works up until a tribal level, entire societies and city-states have existed in the past via the ideal of lots of people working together for a common lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        When society collapses, don't be an asshole
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The gist of this whole thing is that in the almost inevitable event of the collapse of civilisation, don't immediately think you gotta get out there and claim your territory or some shit. Doing that is the best way to get yourself killed. Instead start speaking to your neighbours, get to know your community, have a chat with someone outside of the internet. Getting all mad Max is not only counter-productive to survival, it's also what the ominous 'they' want. A world with tiny pockets of survivors because the greater majority has been scoured clean because everyone watched too much fuckin television before the fall. That way they can come out of their bunkers to restart the world in their image or whatever sick plan they have concocted.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've read this far then do me a favour and just think about the plan or notion you have for the end of society, and then think about why you think that way. Are you gunna get out there and start killing because you think if you don't do it first you'll get done yourself? How do you think that helps anything? I believe this has been something in the making for a great many years and is a larger part of the grand conspiracy against mankind. Make us think we are evil killers with no love or compassion for one another. Shut off the heart centre.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't do it. Work together. Build communities. Don't kill just because you think it's expected of you. Because at the end of the day no one but you is responsible for what your soul goes through.

       It goes in the same exact direction as you: it shows how central planners, throughout our history, have inculcated the false notion that
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are the builders of civilization; that without their benevolent lordship, we would still be cavemen. Naturally, if the State disappears, we are presumed to revert back to our default mode.

       If you are using that definition then you are going off topic. The subject is whether or not in the absence of government people will murder each other like barbarians. The existence of the Trypilla culture proves that large numbers of people can get along without killing each other.

       Its just the definition, its not a trick definition. An isolated city is not less isolated because the population of the city is high. A primary function of government is to protect against foreign threats, so yeah, not having any foreign threats is a big flaw in your example.

       There is nothing to suggest what you're saying about lack of social organization. In fact, the only real mention of social organization in your links indicates the opposite.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Cucuteni-Tripolye had a somewhat sophisticated social organization, with densely populated settlements, which were destroyed and relocated every 60-80 years. A strongly organized society would be required for such regular resettlement of the entire community. Within the culture, the women are said to have been the head of the household.

        . Every household probably had members of the extended family who would work in the fields to raise crops, go to the woods to hunt game and bring back firewood, work by the river to bring back clay or fish, and all of the other duties that would be needed to survive. Contrary to popular belief, the Neolithic people experienced considerable abundance of food and other resources.

       I see what you're saying but there is just not sufficient evidence in my view to support your position. I think this idea of "pre-civilization" lacking governance or social stratification. All of our closest ape relatives all have it, why do you think  our very close human ancestors wouldnt?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, my experience of doing anything organized as a human, especially things that vary radically from what would be considered "normal governance", still has some form of stratification and governance.

       Your article seems to support my hypothesis more than it does yours. Please quote the part about apes having forms of government and division of labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bonobo society seems to parallel early man. They get along find without a government.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Frequently referred to as the “Make Love, Not War” primate, bonobos have a reputation for being docile and diplomatic in their social and sexual relationships. Their generally peaceful and cooperative society is attributed to the evolution of a highly complex social system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bonobo communities are peace-loving and egalitarian. Bonobos are considered to have a matriarchal society, meaning that females have a higher social status than males and social interactions are female-centered and female-dominated. Females have strong social bonds amongst themselves, but they do not exclude males.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bonobos, like their chimpanzee cousins, live in “fission-fusion” societies and therefore tend to vary in party size. Communities of up to 100 bonobos will usually split into small groups when searching for food during the day and come back together to sleep at night. Bonobos have a male philopatric society; males remain with their birth group whereas females migrate to other groups during adolescence.

       My usage of that term implies coercion, i.e. the initiation of violence by an institution acting to force its own pet notion of community.

       Of course, humans beings living in voluntary communities are righteous. Anyone should be able to form or join the utopia/society/social contract they desire, whether Marxist-Leninist, Fascist, or whatever else - as long as they don't force their views on anyone.

       When I read the title, the first thing that went through my head was "The Walking Dead".
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a major social collapse and breakdown of law and order. Some people are going to be holed up. Some will have a bit of food and security. But a lot of people would soon be wandering around, starving and searching for food and water.
      </p>
      <p>
       It occurs to me that those people wouldn't seem that much different than the walkers in the TV show. It also occurs to me that police, security and military people have been watching the same TV and movies as the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that many years of media conditioning, how do you think they'll react to an order telling them to "clean up the streets". How hard do you think it will be for them to do the same thing they see people doing on TV?

       Yep. OP is presuming water, food, sanitation services and medical supplies will be abundant. Perhaps is rural farming areas, and other remote parts of the US, but in the cities... Well let's just say that those who took the liberty to store food, water and medicine, also have a lot of guns/ammo body armor and many other goodies and are intent on keeping their shit. Plan is to bug in if in a major city, cause you sure ain't getting out. Well not at least until the majority leave, or die.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree with OP's overall mentality, but if you've ever been without food or water for a couple days(not on drugs) and not getting great sleep, then you'll know you're not yourself.

       I don't know... Think about some of the biggest natural disasters that happened. Fukushima earthquake, Texas flooding, the fires in California. People came together to help their fellow strangers despite losing everything. Or when there's a mass shooting, people will help you and not leave you shot and dying. Yes there are  bad apples who will loot, etc but those folks are despised, no one defends or excuses that behavior. So I do agree that our instincts are good. And I believe there is an agenda to make the masses selfish and greedy and scared of one another, because "the powers that be" survives in a society in disarray instead of unity.

       there won't be anyone giving those orders those people will be bottled up in their bunkers with their own food. Once things truly collapse there will be no going back because we are going to cling so hard to what we have that we won't slip off until the last minute, and then its gonna hit hard. Most violence will just be over food

       Anyone who does try to go 'Mad Max' is gone in a moment. Sharing everything gets them all through the days, caring is what they try to do.

      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, the poverty can be vicious and I am not painting it as a great and wonderful life, what I am saying is that cooperation is your saviour...

       The fact that we’re not savages is what makes us human and allowed us to build ourselves to such heights. Humans have a natural urge to band together with similar humans and help each other. This was the foundations for the first tribes, the first formal societies, and the first true nations. If everything went to hell, we would still have that natural urge.

       100% agree with you. That's a great example to counter the general feeling of a lot of people in that these behaviours are natural. Third world countries already live in this state and the majority of those people survive by working together and sharing what they have.

       Nah, hollywood may be furthering it, but humans are savage enough on their own. This is why americans believe owning and using firearms is a god given right. To protect themselves from any threat to them or their family. And yeah when shit hits the fan your going to have millions of people trying to scramble for food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Historically, do you know what happens when a large group of humans run out of food, they will do anything to survive, and that includes eating each other. When the main cataclysm comes around, the earthquakes, the storms, tsunamis, are going to kill 1/2 of us, easily if not more, then most of us will slowly descend into chaos and starve to death because your not going to be able to grow crops while all this shit is going down. It wont be good, and while I believe that good will always exist, so does evil. I have seen the thugs running around today, you dont think they are praying for a event like that to happen so they can rape and kill and do whatever the fuck they want, the only reason they dont know it now, is because we still have some kind of semblance of law and order.

       I agree, to a certain point, however, whether it's conditioning or something else I can't say, but... Some background first.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was raised, and live currently with the philosophy of Love first, don't he judgemental and help people in need. I don't hurt people or animals and struggle to be as calm and temperate in personality as possible. I didn't watch TV for the majority of my young life. I've always been non-confrontational and would rather use my brain and keep anything unpleasant to a minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, all of that said, I struggle with somethings because I hate people. I can cut people out of my life and have no remorse or qualms about doing so. I've never harmed anyone, but I have firearms in my home and the will to use them if necessary. I have basic skills for other weaponry and self-defense, and will use what I need to to protect my family. I feel that it would be far easier and emotionally acceptable for me personally to kill a person than animals. I have more empathy for them and their instincts than I do for Humans, partly due to my feelings in regards to higher brain functions versus instinct. Animals don't have self-control and the same reasoning we humans do. So, from my perspective, humans choosing to be monsters or uncooperative, not thinking for the whole and helping others, preying on everyone else for selfish reasons are lower forms of life. Ending their negativity breeds positivity in the world. It's an easy decision for me, if pressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it conditioning? Maybe, I find characters like The Punisher and similar people to be easily relatable to me, based on that philosophy. I was raised to forgive and all of that, and I know I should work on meekness, and that I'm not supposed to be judge, let alone executioner, but ... Thankfully I've never been pushed.

       Another way to look at it, is a parable of our current society. The 99% vs the 1%. They are the ones that have claimed "class warfare" and they are the ones doing all the attacking. The rest of us barely have time to survive and take care of our loved ones. Even when there are demonstrations of any size, many of us have to risk our job to attend, and possibly get arrested and incarcerated.

      <p>
       Two things that stand out clearly about this situation.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The system of law, and prisons are purposefully broken, to allow manipulation of the masses. For instance the drug war itself was started to attack political opposition.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Zombie movies are a great example of the masses, trying to feed off the few. Or the 99% of us, trying to get part of what the 1% takes.

       I disagree. Societies behave naturally like a predator. When met with an intimidating opponent they will be hesitant. If shown weakness they will slaughter and take everything their adversary has to give. There are numerous examples to support this. You will not see AC-130 hellfire raining down on any group that can actually fight back.

       A coach controls a team, but the team has to execute the operation. They have a will of their own, they are not marionettes. Why would this not be natural? This is the food chain, and the food chain is brutal.

       Incorrect analogy, the coach does not own the team. Dimantling, firing or replacing any the bad players fits ultimately in the hands of the shareholders that own the majority of the FC the team belongs to.

       Quit with the football. You are misconstruing a simple analogy with semantics. I am talking about how society works. I am talking about conquest and the slaughter of natives. The winners do not care. The victors act as if they are not savages, especially the ones that reap the benefits without doing any of the dirty work. This is all nature.

       I mentioned a coach and a team, not football. It was a basic analogy. There is a difference between sport and slaughter. My point is that it is the soldiers that slaughter. It is the followers that carry out the will of their masters.

       Much of history is about humans facing increasing odds against survival, but ultimately thriving and innovating through difficult times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with your assessment, but we shouldn't have any utopian delusions either.

       Hollywood is pushing everyone to give in to their animal side (aka emotions, sex, violence, etc). Without conciousness we'd be savages no better than apes. We should strive to be the best conciousness we can, not primate. The physical is animal but the soul is you.

       it all comes down to abundant resources... if you have enough for everyone, mostly everyone will get along, but as soon as you have enough food/water for 50% of the population, 100% of the people are willing kill for those resources
      </p>
      <p>
       this is evident from hunter gather communities while resources were abundant, they "thrived" and got along, but as soon as a lack of resources were apparent they would turn on each other, and these were tight nit communities, people that had known each other possibly their whole lives ... at the end of the day people will always put themselves/ their families first, specifically in a survival situation
      </p>
      <p>
       humans are animals, we're territorial, we're violent we do what we have to to survive, some times that includes working with others, sometimes it doesn't...our will to survive is not really a will ( not that we really have free will anyway) it's automatic... have you ever actually been in a stressful situation where you were in danger???? your instincts take over and you don't even think about what you're doing, during times of stress while adrenaline and cortosol are dumped into your blood stream it, significantly decreases activity in the frontal lobe of your brain, effectively preventing empathy and the ability to think and plan ahead...
      </p>
      <p>
       say you're a hunter gather and you know your tribe is running out of food, winter is approaching, and it is certain 50% of you are going to starve to death...most people in that situation will change drastically and instantly, and will do anything to not be in that 50%... at that point, the option of working together only generates hope, not food...and at that point, people will start considering betraying and killing others...because in the moment, the prospect of having all the food another person would have ate seems infinitely more beneficial than continuing to work with them...
      </p>
      <p>
       the main thing it comes down to, is how rapid and how intense the collapse is and how fast we can get shit up and running again before basically passing the point of no return...
      </p>
      <p>
       also, we are just savage monkeys, but guess what, even chimps work together, but they also rip each other apart when a "stranger" enter "their" territory
      </p>
      <p>
       you say that all bad things in history, more or less, are caused by small groups of people manipulating others, but if people can be so easily manipulated into doing terrible things, is our species really worth a damn?
      </p>
      <p>
       i agree with the general sentiment of this post... inherently seeing other people as threat in a collapse situation is probably not going to further your survival, but i think your fatal flaw in your reasoning is not understanding humans natural physiological response to stress and having to fight for survival and honestly, that humanity DOES have a dark,evil side...

       100% agree with you. I don't want to kill anyone in this situation but if my kids are in danger and food is scarce I would do whatever it takes. People will be armed, people will be hungry and desperate, bad stuff can happen. The best case scenario is that large groups form and we all work together to survive. Worse case: the strong survive, others don't.

       I'm not sure that that's true. I am not an anthropologist but a little googling turned up
       <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep45574">
        this
       </a>
       article about cooperation during resource scarcity. And really, it makes sense - the groups that survived periods of resource deprivation were the ones that worked together, resulting in a kind of cultural evolution. There's no such thing as "out-surviving" your tiny, extremely close-knit hunter gatherer band. I doubt that concept would have even been comprehensible to them, and certainly not desirable. Humans are social creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't doubt that violence was higher during periods of resource scarcity but you are making a lot of modern assumptions about "natural" human values and motivations that I would suggest are colored by the exact kind of individualistic cultural conditioning op is describing.

       Your still not getting it... in a survival situation you not going to care(because you have no capacity to care) if you can only live a few more days or weeks with out of your tribe...its not a rational choice, it's an automatic instinct..your brain will always make choices off of this

       We can rationalize and say, "I would never" and it may be true.  But when your kid is screaming because they're hungry?  All of a sudden a whole lot of impossible choices get put on the to-do list.

       Yeah but at the same time realize how easy it is to just start a small garden instead of trying to eat your neighbors babies and resort to barbarianism. I don’t know about you but I would resort to vegetation long before I ever looked at another human and thought. “Mmmm” people that starved hundreds of years ago from farming just had under developed growing/farming techniques. Today, we don’t have any reason for anyone to go hungry. There have been farming methods developed in such a way where nature doesn’t necessarily have an impact on how it’s grown anymore therefore things like drought and flooding are irrelevant.

       That was 6 years ago and I remember old breakdowns of people hypothesizing if we will see riots and unrest in the future.

       Sounds great in theory, but people desire entertainment so it is unlikely to happen.  Perhaps a more practical approach is to continually remind oneself that literally everything they produce is complete fiction.  If it is a historical movie, there will be an underlying agenda to "spin" the story so the sympathy of the viewer gravitates toward the character(s) that the producer desires.  Conversely, the "villain" will be hyper-demonized.  Documentaries are not exempt...literally nothing produced by Hollywood attempts to present both sides of any controversy equally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take, for example, Paramount's TV version of Waco.  In contrast to former versions of the story it is many times closer to the truth of what happened than previous portrayals...but in spite of humanizing the "victims" it still, nevertheless, portrayed the key ATF and FBI agents as more or less victims of policy and procedures themselves...as if the bureaucracy or public pressure had stripped them of any power to make independent decisions if that would lead to exceeding an arbitrary waiting limit.  In essence, it justified somewhat their decision to act while at the same time showing that the decision lead to horrific consequences that could have been foreseen by simply having a plan to extinguish fire.  As Hollywood history revisionism goes, it is hard to say if this was a rare exception to their default SOP of twisting facts, or if this represents a forced retreat from the official version because there was simply too much mounting evidence contradicting the original telling of this tale and they believed that they could garner credibility by conceding some of points that evidence and research subsequent to that day have rendered implausible.

       NATURE programmed us to kill each other in the event of the collapse of society.  Have you read a single history book, have you met people?  Hollywood didn't make us animals, we've always been animals.  Oh wait sorry all history books are faked by NWO and jews, my bad.

       The two examples of historical atrocities you provided were perpetrated by bankers and the church, so yeah I think I'm on the right track here. I'm glad your ignorance amuses you, maybe you should channel that energy you seem to dedicate to sarcasm and use it to research some of these basic notions of life you seem so certain about.

       Yes it does.  They were sent there by a ruling class controlled by a preisthood.  Those sailors were indoctrinated with the idea that natives were savages because they were not Christian so therefore it was ok to kill them without a second thought.

       All historical accounts from that time period are difficult to verify due to the intervention of the Catholic Church approving what history went on to become history.  Of course they want their monks to look sympathetic.

       I guess the message really got through because fantasizing about post-apocalyptic survival is half my day. Ideally I'd be in the old countryside ancestral home where I could grow/farm and pretty much everyone knows each other. But being on an urban environment most days, I won't lie and say I'd be helpful and social, because I know full well I'd trample any motherfucker that tried to steal my water/meds/safehouse etc.

       I think we are talking about different things here. I'm referring to the belief that nothing but the physical exists and humans and life are just a cosmic accident, gone as quick as it begins. If you feel the way you do about people does it occur to you that you fall into that description? And if you do, does it occur to you to change yourself first? Or are you a subscriber to the school of 'everything is cooked, nothing can change, can't beat em join em'?

       im going to give you a short view of how i see life on this planet from what i have experienced in my life .
      </p>
      <p>
       at a young age i started reading books on the world of the strange as i was different to the people where i lived .
      </p>
      <p>
       i come from Northern Ireland , a country i am sure you have heard of but know next to nothing about .
      </p>
      <p>
       every year on the 11 th of July they have a bonfire , on the 12th parades happen all across the country . this is to celebrate the battle of the Boyne , most people are ignorant to the events surrounding this battle , my self at a young age too..
      </p>
      <p>
       so i started looking into it while other kids were playing soldier or cops and robbers pretending to kill each other with toy guns..
      </p>
      <p>
       this battle was between  Dutch Prince William of Orange and King James II of England , why is this important ?
      </p>
      <p>
       well the orange order who marches on the 12th of July was founded by 2 Freemasons  and the sash they wear is filled with

       </a>
       the orange order projects its self as a protestant christian order . the battle was between a protestant prince and a catholic king . the royal black institution also projecting its self as a christian organization wear a shsh adorned with free

        masonic symbolism
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       why is this important ? well .. the battle its self or rather where it was i believe is also very important .. the

        Boyne vally
       </a>
       is a very special place in Ireland , a very spiritual place ..
      </p>
      <p>
       the battle its self was not what people like to believe it is , after a few years and my continuation to discover more of my country and what is really happening here i met with freemasons who have a lodge in the town where i live .
      </p>
      <p>
       i spent my youth looking into the occult arts and my passion grew , i got interested in freemasonry as the people i spoke to had the same interests in the wider aspect of the occult .
      </p>

       i can hear you say "what does this have to do with what i asked him"?
      </p>
      <p>
       the masonic tracing board checkers floor is the duality of man .
      </p>
      <p>
       he is both man and animal , good and bad . to masons . to Christians it is some what similar apart from one thing .  man is both good and bad but God set man above the animal kingdom .

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        change your self first
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       i did this a long time ago , my belief system was handed down to my by parents who had it handed down to them . my interest in the occult is what changed me for the better .
      </p>
      <p>
       i started to see things others my age didnt , i had insight into who this battle was fought in such a spiritual place . both William and James were freemasons ..  it was symbolic .. where it took place was symbolic.. freemasons told me it was a cull .. like every other war , just a cull of the poor .. they laughed about it .. i didnt .. they say everything is a rich mans trick .. it is .. partly ..
      </p>
      <p>
       there is a hidden aspect to this world . fleeting or by design . but we all know roomers of reptile beings  , knights Templar who created modern freemasonry worshiping pagan idols , digging below Solomon's temple .. remember Solomon was behind freemasonry .. and big on the occult ..
      </p>
      <p>
       i believe man has both well and free will .  i also believe at times this will is taken by God or his Angels and he has a plan for mankind and works through man and these reptile beings .
      </p>
      <p>
       i can see time being non existing and only being recorded by man . all events that happen are a fleeting moment in the great work of a God . be it a person , spirit . or force we can not perceive with our eyes but by our actions and dreams .  like we are a child in the womb dreaming yet to be born . being tested , we fail we do not get to be born .if we succeed  we get to see reality in a different light and see it for the first time .
      </p>
      <p>
       i also believe we live in the past and all events happened 20 or more years in the future , where the real present is and we just get dragged through it thinking we have free will and the choices we make are our own , when in fact the real us made them years ago , deja vu .. when we live through a moment we think we already lived through.
      </p>
      <p>
       i am not a christian or devil worshiper . i am an explorer of life .of the concept of reality , is it real or am i still in the womb dreaming of the life i have ahead of me ? when i am born will i do it right or make the same mistakes i am dreaming of right this moment ?

       i believe in the duality of man and his willingness to subject him self to the slavery of law , take 2 men and 2 women , place them on another planet and watch them live lawless until their off spring have grown in numbers and 2 tribes develop..
      </p>
      <p>
       watch how they govern them selves , if they decide on laws , how will they turn out / will murder and sex outside marage still be sinful ?

       Thanks for sharing this. If we are talking about a global collapse, I wonder how it would affect societies that are self sustaining and already distant from those that are severely more dependent on materials and technology. I imagine they would experience a less drastic change so long as their space were not invaded. When I envision dystopia after collapse, I see the US.

       Nice idea but no humans are just naturally cruel. You can we have been programmed through history in schools and through movies of war and apocalypses and violence but the fact is areas of the world that don't have exposure to all this still will fight and kill each other if they need to for survival. I am talking areas in the world with no internet no tv no electricity no school and no influence of the like and they still fight each other.

       And Japan during their big tsunami was the shining example that it doesn't have to be that way. No rioting, looting, robbing, assaults. When aid was provided everyone waited and made sure everyone got some. Take that mankind!
 Now is it because they are all counrtymen ie: Japan has almost no immigrants their culture virtually intact for thousands of years, does this change a society? I ask reddit.

       Hard disagree.  People turning into violent assholes during societal collapse predates Hollywood:  A Canticle for Leibowitz, Riddley Walker.  On The Beach and Earth Abides buck the trend.  So does World War Z, really, and its recent.

       i mean some movies don't even follow your logic.  miracle mile comes to mind.

       It has more to do with storytelling than any sort of insidious scheme to "program" people.  Conflict is compelling.  Violence is conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why westerns have gunslingers and bandits, when in reality it was mostly people trying to tend shitty land and raise cattle.  Hell, even things that are loosely based on reality focus on the lurid, violent aspects: Blood Meridian, for example.

       Why war movies aren't two hours of soldiers having a good time on leave.

       While I definitely see your point of view, does it ever occur to you why people want those sorts of movies? Why violence has become so ok while other topics such as sex have become so taboo in film, comparatively. Do you think a person that had never been exposed to violent media would share your enthusiasm for arterial spray and savagery?

       violence has always been less taboo than sex in western culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       lurid violence in penny dreadfuls or horror stories was fine (think about some of the body horror or sudden gore in Lovecraft's work).

       Hollywood is accurately depicting human nature. During an apocalyptic scenario, would I think twice about shooting someone to feed myself and family? Nope. Would I shoot someone to feed my family when I can sit here in my office selling advertising all day and buy groceries on the way home? Fuck no, why would I?

       Everyone assumes they would be so hardcore but in reality if society "collapsed" you would probably just shit your pants and then find a leader to rally around.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real fantasy is that it can ever actually collapse. If a pile of garbage "collapses" it is still a pile of garbage.

       I grew up hunting and fishing, joined the military at 17 with my parents signature and then worked as a government contractor after I got out. I keep enough guns, ammo, and plate carriers in my house to supply an entire military in a small third world country. I live 1/4 mile from the ocean and know how to clean a fish and drop crab pots. I think I would be just fine.

       That sounds great for you man, but no offence, you're part of the problem. If you're being honest you're the worst aspect of the problem. A person that has been raised to think killing is ok, even something to be encouraged. At the end of the day, you're going to be the one people are trying to avoid in a collapse type situation. Is that really the sort of guy you wanna be? Survival is going to get awful lonely.

       I like your post OP, but I disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that game theory dictates that the "copycat strategy" is the most effective way to win "the game" as it will inevitably be played.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is to say, if you encounter someone looking for allies, allying with them strengthens your numbers. But if you encounter someone looking to dominate you, you have to fight (lest you be subjugated). The only way to prevent subjugation under a tyrant is to fight them back, as a group. Sometimes, I think, you have to fight - not everyone you encounter will be good. It is, however, the better play to ally with those who are good, and not look for fights. Careful balancing act, IMO.

       Agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       This reminds me of the principle mentioned in Machiavelli's "The Prince"
      </p>
      <p>
       “A prince should never make an alliance with a more powerful ruler than himself simply for the purpose of attacking another, unless necessity compels him… If your ally conquers, you are in his debt, and princes should avoid as much as possible being in debt to anyone.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, Sun Tzu said:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states."
      </p>
      <p>
       It is wise to consider alliances carefully.  It might be appealing to be in the company of a group that can offer protection...but at what price?  The preexisting members of a group will share loyalty to the existing leader and once you have joined you may find that you are forced to accept conditions you despise in order to avoid  the group leader exercising his power against you.

       There's two types of movies about collapse, one that shows us the events and transitions, and the ones that start off long after its happened within the new world of survivors. My biggest problem with most I've seen of the first days of a fall agree with OP, how in a matter of days everyone is at each others' throats. I think you'd see a mix of all behaviors, from cooperation to hiding to quiet scavenging and of course some violence. A recent Netflix movie "How It Ends" had everyone already at a violent and untrusting state within a day or so, with some towns already under a martial law guard and attacking anyone who ventured near. OP mentioned "The Road", and while I don't remember what time frame that was in, I'm pretty sure it was well into years past. Also, it was indeed all about starvation and thirst (the water was undrinkable was the main plot), that's why other people were dangerous, they wanted either what you had or you. And while the plot of "The Walking Dead" grew stale for me, I think one part of it is accurate enough about how some people will cooperate and try to preserve communities, and others will try to take it away. Of course it has heavy plot devices to keep drama going, sometimes a bit ridiculous not to see for the characters. Maybe the most boring season with the farmhouse was actually more accurate.

       Agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, the problem is culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on the cultural background people will behave differently. During the Japanese Invasion of China the whole country was defacto a post apocalyptic wasteland. There was for the most part no electricity, no real central government and food shortages and the constant threat of barbaric japanese hordes who killed and raped with impunity. The chinese did rather well for themselves if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now fast forward to syria 2011. There you see the typical "Walking dead x20 post apocalypse". The difference there is not education, or technology. Its simply culture. Im not gonna open the can of worms as to why. But the problem lies within the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       having hollywood giving the people a defacto roadmap on how to (mis)behave during a national or international crisis is actually a threat to national security, you can turn it around however you like. People like to follow templates when faced with difficulties. If their first instinct is to Fortify your Perimeter and kill anybody for a can of Beans then this is the new law of the land.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the first instinct is to work together and rebuilt society then that will be that. The problem is, that if you make a zombie apocalypse movie in where people work together and industrially get rid of the zombies that would be a great show for anybody working in or with logistics.

       There's a japanese manga that goes into the logistics of surviving a zombie apocalypse and it's so much more interesting than anything from the walking dead. Japan doesn't have much zombie media but from the ones they do have, nearly all of them involve working together and are about trust rather than mistrust. US media is very divisive.

       Who do you think it was the conquered all of those people? Who controlled that society? I don't think it is a natural trait at all. It's a small group of luciferians that was calling the shots in each one of your examples.

       There were violent societal breakdown stories before TV and Hollywood ruled the Universe. The Bible even has them.

       It definitely became a trend in literature around 1950's. The Lord of the Flies being one of the most famous examples.

       I showed you how football obeys the same rules as in a conquest, with the soldiers doing as they are told, in order to get paid and get a rank up, a promotion, so they can retire early and set up a shop/brand based on their former fame in the entertainment war of sports.

       There is nothing to suggest what you're saying about lack of social organization. In fact, the only real mention of social organization in your links indicates the opposite.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Cucuteni-Tripolye had a somewhat sophisticated social organization, with densely populated settlements, which were destroyed and relocated every 60-80 years. A strongly organized society would be required for such regular resettlement of the entire community. Within the culture, the women are said to have been the head of the household.

       violence has always been less taboo than sex in western culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       lurid violence in penny dreadfuls or horror stories was fine (think about some of the body horror or sudden gore in Lovecraft's work).
