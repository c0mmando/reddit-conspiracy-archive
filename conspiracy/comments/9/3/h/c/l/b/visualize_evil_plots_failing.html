<p>I neither believe nor disbelieve in the power of intent and manifestation. If it works, my hypothesis is that it tends to work by the easiest path, like water. So just sitting and reflecting all by itself won&#39;t do much. However, if it gives you hope and energy, purposeful visualization has tangible effects.</p>

<p>If magic does work, then lets interfere in the spells and plans of the wicked. The mechanism is letting them experience their own consrquences. Oops, shouldn&#39;t have blurted out that detail of your plans...</p>

<p>(By the way, calling someone crazy says nothing about the victim, everything about the abuser.)</p>

<p>They will not succeed. The  control network is unraveling. This cracking is because of our will and actions to pursue the real behind the lies. We outnumber the ruling class like a million to one. They are incredibly dangerous within their realm, but their days are numbered. As long as we don&#39;t give up.</p>

<p>I project my love and support to you brothers and sisters pursuing truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what&#39;s happening is that the &quot;elite&quot; can pretty accurately measure where the public consciousness is at. The whole pedos in power thing is mostly out of the bag, so they can&#39;t keep hiding that and still be seen as credible. So they do some low-level clean-up and move to a fallback position. The more truth we uncover, the more pressure we put on them, and the more they have to reveal and adapt. Interesting game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Following the stories between the lines is much more interesting than the dumbed down entertainment we get. :)</p>

<p>Q is sketchy at best. My take: a COINTELPRO limited hangout, Bannon project, or maybe LARPing based on rumors around a military area (some of which are true). Others are predictions. The vagueness is a huge red flag because anyone can rationalize a narrative onto a loose framework.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t go for anything that looks like propaganda a past or sitting president.  The White House is and always will be a controlled aspect of the establishment. Trump bows to The VVatican and Israel. But supporting or denouncing a deliberately polarizing WWE character should not be our focus. Soft and gentle fascist Obama came as a rebellious liberator too. It&#39;s a common theme when it&#39;s time for the pendulum to swing back. The Freemasons know all about controlling revolutions. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really care who was voted for at this point, we all get tricked by media. A rapist crony is a rapist crony, they are all batshit dogshit at the upper levels. I care how we can come together and take meaningful actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m convinced that the greater game is for us all to align ourselves with truth and virtue. We can&#39;t really build organizations of any size or power without them getting corrupted. (I can&#39;t make a public subreddit with more than 10 subscribers before it starts getting shilled.) As we do this, we assemble a sort of super-organism that cannot be controlled by the Satanic system. This, I believe, is the real second coming of Christ which will lead to the defeat of Satan. I think this is what Christianity was originally all about -- not waiting around for some sky dude to rescue us, but rather building the Christ egregore by learning and spreading Truth (God) and rising above vice (used to control us). The Satanic system knows this and doing everything it can to prevent it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The “pedos in power” are showing up in sports teams, scout troops, school houses and church yards - heck just about anywhere you find children. That means everyday families are rife with this haunting and horrific behavior. The blogs that I read are all having unique “me too” moments where siblings, cousins, neighbors, and friends’ stories are coming out. These are little boys and little girls, in neighborhoods just like yours. But it’s not “the elite” who are doing most of the dirty deeds (although, yeah, probably some are responsible). Who is SUPPOSED to protect these innocents?</p>

<p>A technological solution falls into materialism and the NWO plans! It&#39;s a cool idea though. My take is that there is more than enough suppressed technology to solve our electrical energy problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad some people understand what I am getting at without a long explanation. If everything is energy, and information is a type of energy... well I don&#39;t think establishment science is the absolute arbiter of reality</p>

<p>Tangents ahead.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more wary of official science than I used to be, partly because of the money angle. What&#39;s odd here is that the people who deny an interconnected universe are disagreeing not only with mystics but mainstream science.</p>

<p>When the labcoats agree with the robes, I pay attention. When many of the most powerful people on earth try and fuck around with unseen forces, I pay attention. I&#39;m not on their side though, I serve love and the principle of truth. We have to be careful, thinking of who is teaching magic tricks and for what cause.</p>

<p>Most of education is based on some kind of massive appeal to authority.  I wish it wasn&#39;t. They teach math just fine, which is objective and serves technocratic instincts, but not logic which is just as objective.
 Logic is a tool they don&#39;t want the peasants to have. They don&#39;t want us to be able to understand and deflect the twisted sophistry that passes for reasoning. The don&#39;t want us to have the emotional fortitude to ignore the taunts and mockery of Horse Laugh and Ad Hominem. Conventional education and mass media have this top down structure that doesn&#39;t allow for thinking untamed thoughts. I believe as humans, living out original ideas is part of our purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are reasons both for and against, that&#39;s why my research is ongoing. I find that the more I entertain unconventional or wild ideas, the more I can learn. It inspires creativity too. Since hypnosis is real, certain techniques can persuade the brain to change the body or habits over time. To me that&#39;s a form of magic. Being able to understand and explain and teach how something works doesn&#39;t disqualify it from being amazing and powerful. If we want a more strict, conventional definition of magic that defies materialism, well what exactly counts? ESP has evidence to support it, does that make it not magic if it&#39;s real?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say I agree or like that way of thinking. It&#39;s not based on love or justice. Harnessing aggressive spiritual or emotional energy is dangerous and hurts you. If spirit theory is true then some really bad stuff is feeding off of hate and fear. The whole idea of good guys and bad guys is polarizing and used as an excuse to do cruel things. There are horrible people that need justice served, but revenge fantasies are the wrong path. I don&#39;t think we should imitate the enemy&#39;s style.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might not be conspiracy related, but I do belive in the power of visualization and a greater force helping it come to life. Be it God, or some other entity, something out there is listening. And That whoever it is is doing the most it can to help without obvious interference. I’ve personally experienced some things that I have no explanation for except for visualisation and a greater force acting it out for me, helping me guide it. I’ve never been a greatly religious person, but some of these experiences are making me believe. If anything, it’s a really, really comforting fact knowing that Him or someone else out there exists that’s listening. I know many people on here would not agree with the idea of a God, but for me it’s becoming more and more real. It could all be on a quantom level and things just allinging unexpectadly, but something is helping, and I am grateful for it. Sorry for the long rant that isn’t that relevant to the discussion, just thought to add my two cents to the visualisation argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I kind of think that&#39;s sort of the point of this. Not in a specific manner but enough people vibrating, thinking, meditating on and imaging love, peace, togetherness, etc. Not really focused at all on the evil and darkness. Being forgiving of all because you didn&#39;t realize you always had the power and always took part in manifesting this reality.</p>

<p>The second key part that I think you&#39;re missing, mixed in with the spiritual/mental side is the creation of some sort of forward motion/use of energy all with the same loving intentions. All of this creates more of the type of motion and energy that is needed.  And all that has to continue non-stop.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the manufactured political obsessions and divisions specifically targetting people amongst these types of communities is important as people start wake up and the reality changes some from that. </p>

<p>IMO Visualizing evil plots failing is visualizing a reality where those plots are still put in motion, on their way to happening and puts a strong emphasis on that evil/their plots, the negative energy and outcome, etc. 
Think about what you&#39;re saying here, if thinking and visualizing is the power then never even including  &quot;them&quot;  and their &quot;evil plots&quot; in your thinking/meditating/visualizing seems most powerful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spiritual momentum. I see what you are saying.</p>

<p>I could have phrased this better, certainly, and it is negative focused in the title at least. I get that you want to steer clear entirely of conflict energy and anything headed towards destructive black magic. Still, if someone wishes my brothers and sisters harm, I do hope they stumble over their own failings before they hurt us. I&#39;m coming at this with an energy angle of mischief, hoping for cosmic irony to befuddle and hinder the would-be predators. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not much anymore. I got a lot out of his earlier talks, but I think he&#39;s an agent of predictive programming, himself. In my consciousness, anyhow, he&#39;s seemed to follow the same pattern of &quot;good information to begin with, then lead them astray&quot;.</p>
