        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yo! Would seriously just flip the fuck out if the truth about our fake lunar landing in 69 ever became accepted mainstream. At that point I think I would deserve a full pardon. Spent five years in Federal Prison for conspiracy to steal and sell lunar samples from Johnson Space Center and not once during my very short and comical trail did they ever prove we landed on the moon. Totally a #mandelaeffect if you ask me <a href="https://youtu.be/n0T-D4jwwCM">https://youtu.be/n0T-D4jwwCM</a> </p>

<p>Interesting to note that during my trial the greatest tragedy and only missing piece of the Crime was Dr. Gibson&#39;s six green journals documenting 33 years of research on the lunar samples brought back by the Apollo Missions. Yo! Losing those green journals permanently was the crux of the whole heist! I was a dup, a pawn, and had no clue until my trial when I started putting two and two together <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_and_missing_moon_rocks">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_and_missing_moon_rocks</a></p>

<p>Not long into my prison sentence I was given an article saying that NASA had pretty well lost the entire 800 some odd pounds of Moon Rocks brought back, poof! Gone. Not a week later the news reported that the original film capturing our world&#39;s and humanities greatest achievement had been accidentally recorded over. Yep. Doesn&#39;t take much to see through the events here. </p>

<p>We never landed on the moon, folks. I can&#39;t wait to be granted a full pardon for the crime I did not commit. Yo! On a side note, I recommend the film #MoonWalkers with #RonPearlman just the fucking best. Operation Avalanche on Amazon was pretty good too, but the clincher, the ultimate is of course the documentary Kubrick&#39;s Odyssey, which I totally love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yge_LJ_IuhI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yge_LJ_IuhI</a></p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard there is somewhere around 7 billion people on earth who have never been to the moon.</p>

<p>Hey a thought occurs, statistically the number of people that have been to the moon, compared to the population of the earth, is essentially zero. So instead of trying to sell the cover up theory, just say &quot;Statistically the number of people who have been to the moon is zero&quot;, and you will be correct!</p>

<p>Very few people, as in less than a dozen probably, knew what the Manhattan Project actually was. Only the top people had the entire picture. Even parts of the same bomb were sent to different machine shops so that no one would figure out what they were actually working on. </p>

<p>Also the war against Japan had essentially 100% US support. No one would talk because it would be treason. Exactly why would people be quiet about a fake moon landing? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, you assume because of some &quot;space race&quot; or &quot;rivalry&quot; between the US vs. Russia it would have leaked. But that&#39;s just an assumption based on how you perceive(d) the time period due official narration as it &quot;looked&quot; that way.</p>

<p>But we just don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Before Sutton released his book most couldn&#39;t even imagine that the Wall Street/Rothchild connection installed the Bolsheviks in Russia and there were secret deals in place. Or that Mao went to Yale and was an agent of Skull&amp;Bones.</p>

<p>All these Space Agencies seem to be somehow connected using similar logos. Who says they aren&#39;t all run by interconnected Occult organisations. Have you never wondered how US space designs just popped up in Russia? From the early space station to the shuttle.</p>

<p>All just smart Russian intelligence or some hidden hand like how the US seeded the Israelian nuclear program.</p>

<p>Maybe it was in the Russian interest that the US wasted resources on it. Maybe they thought it was a good excuse to exit any expensive human moon program for their own public.
<em>Maybe</em> they had all a big deal in the background about a Secret Space program with the USA. Maybe they thought it was a great way to hide their own Secret Space program by limiting their &quot;conventional&quot; one and pretend they &quot;lost&quot;. Maybe they thought they hadn&#39;t the western media influence to convince the world.</p>

<p>You could also ask yourself why the Russians didn&#39;t reveal who killed Kennedy or that 11/9 was an US false flag operation? That the whole war of terror is a complete farce? That Isis is just an US proxy army outside of a few sarcastic hints?.</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t they shout it from the roof if your assumptions would be influencing the Russian government(s) mode of operation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever heard of Occam&#39;s Razor? Basically, when there is a dispute between ideas, the one that requires the least assumptions is generally true and should be accepted as such so long as further evidence doesn&#39;t disprove the idea. I think it applies here. It takes so many assumptions to decide that Russia was actually teamed with the US at the time and all of the other things you say to justify your claim than it does to decide that the moon landing actually happened as we hear it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can see satellites with your eyes, with telescopes, and via software defined radios.  The SDR will and I am using GPS as an example here show you via the Doppler shift in the received signals that the GPS transmitters are moving at a very high rate of speed.  Additional evidence is how GPS works via trilateration instead of triangulation like LORAN does.</p>

The jury was already bought and sold with Allen Shephard lying on the stand that he remembers picking up a specific rock that was in Dr. Gibsons collection Thad Roberts and Tiffany Fowler stole. Yo. The judge ordered the jury to side with the government on this issue if they had any doubts we went to the moon. Ha! Fucking hilarious.

    <div class="md"><p>Love this part. Hahahahaha! So true!</p>

<p>&quot; <strong>It has been my experience that the vast majority of the people who truly believe in the Moon landings know virtually nothing about the alleged missions. And when confronted with some of the more implausible aspects of those alleged missions, the most frequently offered argument is the one that every ‘conspiracy theorist’ has heard at least a thousand times: “That can’t possibly be true because there is no way that a lie that big could have been covered up all this time … too many people would have known about it … yadda, yadda, yadda.”</strong> &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I stole shit, but they didn&#39;t prove we went to the moon in court so I should be pardoned&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we never went to the moon, who left the reflective plate at the landing site that I shine a laser at during amateur astronomy nights? The moon shot wasn&#39;t even particularly difficult as far as rocket science is concerned. There&#39;s just nothing worthwhile up there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can see satellites with your eyes, with telescopes, and via software defined radios.  The SDR will and I am using GPS as an example here show you via the Doppler shift in the received signals that the GPS transmitters are moving at a very high rate of speed.  Additional evidence is how GPS works via trilateration instead of triangulation like LORAN does.</p>

<p>One can also download directly data from weather satellites and other such craft using an SDR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Central Florida 3rd District. We got busted just down the street from Disney World in Orlando. I had a very conscientious court appointed lawyer who went beyond the call of duty for me. Essentially, my crime was sending an email out. I did not break in, transport nor steal the lunar samples from Johnson Space Center.  It sure would be interesting, Dulles Did Dallas. It sure would be! As far as I know the jury did not pose the question. only my lawyer did. </p>
