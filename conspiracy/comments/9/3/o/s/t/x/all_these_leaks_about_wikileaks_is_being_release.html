        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For the people following the story since day one, it’s clear that the CIA took over Wikileaks during the election, and used a DDOS attack to block the dead mans switch after murdering Assange. Everything that has been released afterwards is a CIA psyop. How did we forget so fast. How did we side with the government ? The amount of fake comments about Julian Assange being a traitor, with the hashtag #hangjulian, is overwhelming. The guy is a hero, and I’m ashamed this is what the world has come to.  I think his death will be made public soon, but not in the way we think. They will probably stage an accident, or a rogue shooter to take him out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree that he&#39;s quite likely dead or otherwise neutered, the anomalies, as I&#39;ve often explained when they came up, are a simple artifact of an editing feature in premiere pro called morph cut, which tries to synthesize artificial frames to soften or ideally hide edits completely.</p>

<p>Still a powerful tool to change what someone has said, but I reckon the Pilger Interview was real but shiot before October 16th or whenever it was that he seemed to have vanished.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point I don&#39;t think it&#39;s about a few singular people.  There&#39;s hordes of people on both sides.  What Julian Assange provides is a convenient name that the public can latch onto, and both sides can have &quot;him&quot; release whatever suits their agenda, even if he&#39;s dead in real life.  I think if they&#39;re going to kill him publicly, you&#39;d have to wonder what is the benefit of that.  I&#39;d think the biggest reason to &quot;kill&quot; him is to prevent the other side from using him against you in the propaganda war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don’t understand how the FBI and the CIA were able to brainwash such a large amount of people. I mean I do understand how, it’s been on the front page everyday since the election, and on every television channel. But you would think a collective intelligence such as an entire country could spot bullshit from reality. This is all in retaliation for the pedophilia rings being exposed. They know if the people actually find out, they will all be hung on the streets.  That’s why it’s been made a mockery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the intelligence agencies and all parties in the various groups know what&#39;s going on pretty clearly.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s who is going to have the backing of the people?  I think a small minority who tries to go counter the best interests of the people needs to ensure that people can&#39;t tell who&#39;s &quot;good&quot; and who&#39;s &quot;bad&quot;.  If someone sends politicians to a military tribunal and then imprisons them for life, is that &quot;good&quot; because our judicial system is corrupt and needed to be bypassed or is it &quot;bad&quot; because tyrants are bypassing all the processes we have which are working well enough.  I think the reason we haven&#39;t seen the draining of the swamp to the extent most people would like is because as you say, no one wants to be hung on the streets if the other faction can convince the public that you are being too shady, and both sides look shadier if they make bold moves.</p>

And second, that doesn’t make sense at all. What the hell was he dishonest about? Do you even know what you are talking about? And yes it does make sense that dozens if not thousands of people are involved in order to control the most powerful nation in the world, and keep the population at bay and in the dark on some of the most horrific crimes ever committed. because that’s the way it has been done, and will continue to be done. The number of people involved doesn’t make or break anything. This isn’t even about who won the god damn presidency, this is about the deep state (another term made taboo by the media). </p>

<p>You believe that Assange gives you the whole truth, with no ulterior motives, and that anything negative about him is an attack from an alphabet agency.

<p>If Assange was dead, it makes no sense for the Ecuadorian embassy to be kicking him out. If JA is dead, then the embassy would stage a suicide or &quot;assassination&quot; and announce it to the public.</p>

<p>As for his honesty...
1) You are associating his own words/actions with WikiLeaks. You need to separate the person from the organization.
2) Lying by omission is still lying.</p>

Nobody cares that our voting system is corrupt anymore, nobody is paying attention, they are only paying attention to “the Russians” Everyone in America is falling for their story, and ignoring everything else, or disregarding it as fictional “conspiracy theories”. Pizzagate(aka pedogate) has been made into a joke, even though there is unbelievably large amount of information making it hard to deny. Nobody is paying attention, that’s exactly what they are trying to achieve. The same guy Muller, who botched the 9/11 investigation, is now hailed as a hero. You couldn’t made this shit up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if there was something in the leaked messages indicating a bias to one side, I don&#39;t see the big deal. The Russian hooker Piss Dossier was leaked to the press before the election, and it was biased as fuck. It was Democrat opposition research on Republicans. </p>

<p>I think this was the first article on the piss dossier: <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump/">http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump/</a></p>

<p>Date of article: Oct 31, 2016. The election was November 8, 2016. </p>

<p>The Piss Dossier was funded by the DNC and Clinton Campaign (previously, it was funded as opposition research on the Republican side against Trump, but the Clinton Campaign funded it and kept it going). <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/10/25/report-infamous-trump-dossier-funded-clinton-campaign-dnc/798237001/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/10/25/report-infamous-trump-dossier-funded-clinton-campaign-dnc/798237001/</a></p>

<p>You&#39;re gonna have a hard time finding leakers who aren&#39;t at least a little bit biased, and personally, I think Assange just wanted to prevent Clinton from becoming president, just like a lot of other people. Biased or not, the information was true. You can supplement that with the Steele dossier and all of those leakers who were in the Trump administration. The same people claiming Assange is biased are the people who lap up all the leaks on Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that JA and everyone that has contributed to WL are heroes. And I view the events of Oct. 2016 and much since with a lot of skepticism. But I don&#39;t think we can definitively say &quot;Julian is dead and WL is CIA&quot;. We don&#39;t know - we can speculate, but we don&#39;t know. There are many trusted members of the WL community (including Emma Best) that we&#39;re pretty sure are alive and well and still rooting for JA and WL.</p>

<p>The problem with the CIA infestation narrative is it discourages leaking. In the absence of any real WL competitors, it&#39;s still the best we&#39;ve got. There are a lot of very talented hackers and freedom of info advocates looking at and working with WL on a constant basis. I haven&#39;t heard anything reliable saying WL has been compromised.</p>

<p>In my opinion, I do think they found a way to defeat the deadman&#39;s switch(es), but I believe JA is still alive, probably only from fear that other switches exist. Sadly, I think we&#39;ll learn the truth soon enough.</p>

<p>And I view the events of Oct. 2016 and much since with a lot of skepticism. But I don&#39;t think we can definitively say &quot;Julian is dead and WL is CIA&quot;. We don&#39;t know - we can speculate, but we don&#39;t know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very well said.  Part of being a conspiracy theorist is a healthy amount of skepticism.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why when OP says something like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the people following the story since day one, it’s clear that the CIA took over Wikileaks during the election, and used a DDOS attack to block the dead mans switch after murdering Assange. Everything that has been released afterwards is a CIA psyop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It raises alarm bells in my head.  I&#39;ve been following the story &quot;since day one&quot; yet I can&#39;t claim to know exactly what&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>The fact that OP can so confidently claim that his narrative is &quot;obviously&quot; the correct one makes me believe he is more interested in pushing his narrative than applying skepticism and admitting that we can&#39;t possibly know all the facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A dead man switch would trigger if the &quot;key&quot; wasn&#39;t released, that&#39;s the dead man part. In order to keep it from auto-releasing something needs to be done, if you do nothing as in a DDOS attack to cripple the entire internet, the switch triggers. If you could just stop the &quot;key&quot; from propagating it&#39;s not a dead man switch and not how someone as smart as Assange would knowingly set it up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>During the election Wikileaks went silent, and Julian Assange went silent. People asked him to verify he was alive, and if he was he could have, but he didn’t. A batch of files was released to download, and could only be decrypted with key. The fact that these files were even released for download made it pretty clear that his life was in danger and the key was about to be released. This was his way of staying alive. The CIA must have figured out a way to stop the release, so him being alive was no longer a problem. During the time of his death a dead mans switch was basically a fail safe that would release the key and expose the entire world political infrastructure and corruption. At exactly the time of the blackout, a worldwide DDOS attack to place, crashing servers and not allowing the switch to be activated. His partner at the time died of “natural causes” Wikileaks released a cryptic misspelled message , which ended up spelling out the words “help him” . At exactly the same time, there was a bomb scare at the airport near where Julian Assange was being held, and the airport was evacuated. At this time eyewitnesses say Julian was transported from the embassy to the airport in black SUVs.  After this, Wikileaks seems to have changed completely. On 4chan, one of the employees said their was a gag order in place, and he went against it, and was now trying to release the switch himself manually. He said his life was in danger.  The podesta emails were then shortly released after the fact. This exposed a child trafficking ring within our government through cryptic lingo. The MSM quickly tried to destroy this narrative by giving it a name PIZZAGATE, and trying do the good old “they are turning the friggin frogs gay” switcharoo. Alex jones quickly destroyed the narrative, because everything that comes out of that mans mouth is disregarded by the public. Shortly after that it became clear that Hillary colluded with the DNC to steal the election from Bernie. The murder of Seth Rich’s murder started to circulate the internet, and they pulled the “you are being rude to his family” routine. Which made a bunch of liberals mad at the conservatives. This is where the divide started. r/the_donald (which used to be quite informative and civil) quickly got taken over by a bunch of racist shills trying to make the conservatives look racist and moronic, and this gave the liberals even more reason to hate them. All these police brutality videos began were circulating the internet, furthering the civilian divide. Meanwhile a narrative was brewing. The Russia narrative began, and almost instantly, everyone forgot about Wikileaks, the podesta emails, the pedophilia, the racism. The biggest distraction in our countries history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my problem with this whole theory. WikiLeaks began it&#39;s work in a pretty non-partisan manner. They hated warhawks on both sides of the American aisle, and yeah they hated Hilary but that&#39;s because she was a status quo hawk. </p>

<p>But then these suspicious occurances you listed happen, and this subreddit in particular immediately jumps to the conclusion that the CIA got to him. Except for immediately after these incidences WikiLeaks began openly supporting Trump via Twitter. Almost incessantly. When he would go on TV and talk about bombing families they didn&#39;t even bat an eye.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just amazing to me that the natural conclusion from these events is that the US was the one that took out Assamge and gained control of the WikiLeaks Twitter. </p>

<p>To believe that you must then also believe that the CIA preferred a Donald Trump victory. And no one on Earth thinks that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A dead man switch would trigger if the &quot;key&quot; wasn&#39;t released, that&#39;s the dead man part. In order to keep it from auto-releasing something needs to be done, if you do nothing as in a DDOS attack to cripple the entire internet, the switch triggers. If you could just stop the &quot;key&quot; from propagating it&#39;s not a dead man switch and not how someone as smart as Assange would knowingly set it up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you know how the dead man&#39;s switch was set up?</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying they are launching a permanent DDOS attack against a distributed set of servers since October that nobody in the world has detected?  Doesn&#39;t sound very feasible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how a dead man&#39;s switch works. It would have required JA to verify that he&#39;s alive for it not to be released.</p>

<p>Basically, if JA didn&#39;t input a specific code every night at <em>insert random time here</em>, the data is released.</p>

<p>Are you trying to say something else?</p>
