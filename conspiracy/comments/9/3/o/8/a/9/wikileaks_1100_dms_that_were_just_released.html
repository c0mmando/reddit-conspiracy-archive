       in the context of the Internet, you could be a dog for all i know. I'm not saying you are lying about being at work, but would you please understand what you are posting before you post it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because if you don't, then you could be unintentionally spreading a false narrative.

      <p>
       P.S. the above statement is neither acceptance or denial of this post, any and all post that you have posted to this thread, or any and all posts you have made in the past.

       P.P.S. I just what to make the point of checking what you post before you post it, for credibility and accuracy.

       You're absolutely right. That's one reason I didn't spout my opinion immediately. I just saw the information and checked a few other reports about it to see if it matched up. Just wanted to share it to see what people thought.

       The messages show that WikiLeaks wanted the GOP to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
      </p>
      <p>
       "We believe it would be much better for the GOP to win," the WikiLeaks account states to a supporter named "Emmy B" in one of the messages from 2015. 
Another Twitter message from the WikiLeaks account describes Clinton as a "bright, well-connected, sadistic sociopath."
WikiLeaks had been accused of bias against Democrats during the presidential race because of its release of hacked documents from the Democratic National Committee.

       I've felt that way since "we came, we saw, he died." I know she saw at least some of the same footage of Gaddafi's lynching as I did, and I was horrified. Yet there she was on camera, gloating about it like some kind of fucking psycho.

       She used to affect a southern accent when addressing southern crowds.
      </p>
      <p>
       She also made sure that some interviewer asked her "What's something unusual you keep in your purse?" To which she answered with what I'm sure she hoped looked like a mischievous grin, "Hot sauce." This of course is supposed to appeal to black American women who, as stereotypes would have it, carry hot sauce around with them wherever they go.
      </p>

       People who can't recognize her creepy insincerity for what it is are lacking some critical module.

       She was clearly the worse of the 2. She's also responsible for 10 million Muslims invading Europe, since she helped destroy Libya, and Qaddafi held is borders in check from the hordes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Europe is forever transformed and will be a 3rd world shitholes with terrorist attacks and civil wars for hundreds of years. Tourism is already down in Paris by 60% because it's just a Muslim shitholes at this point, and Sweden's rapefugees have created a rape epidemic there as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an absolute fucking nightmare what's going on Europe all because of this horrible Globalist bitch. I can't say for her to take her last breath and 100% shes going straight to hell

       As someone who was in Paris recently for a week before flying back home, I thought I was in a middle east country. You must be from a European country that didnt let any invaders in, or live somewhere far in the country side, immune from whats going on

       I think if you spend enough years going through school and then work denying your inner voice that screams how wrong everything is, then eventually it does go quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, by silencing that voice, one loses the ability to recognize psychopaths in action.  I think this is what we are seeing here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect there is a very strong overlap between people who felt great about school and people who like Hillary Clinton.  Likewise, an overlap between people who really hated school (regardless of performance) and people who see through that fake lizard smile.

       I'm not ignoring anything. He is in the embassy because he thinks he would be extradited. There is no official extradition notice about him.

       I'm not saying he is incorrect because as I said the Republicans and Democrats both dislike him. Even those that think Trump is a conspiracy savior can't explain why Trump wants to punish him.

       Does Trump not merit accountability?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about Russia? Plenty of evidence suggesting that Wikileaks omitted or opted out entirely of sharing information when it proved damaging to Russia. Lies of omission are still lies, especially when you try and hide behind the pretense of accountability. Some are apparently more accountable than others though.

       So it was a moral choice for them to with hold info? It seems pretty immoral to have this information and not release it. Wikileaks was founded on the principle of accountability, they seem to be failing this principle.

       Yet again, yes, people can choose morality first, and they have no rule at Wikileaks that says "release everything", do they?  Or "be fair to both American political parties"?

       Having a political opinion doesn't equate to bias. It may introduce bias, but it isn't evidence of the existence therof. That was the entire premise of the IG's report regarding Peter Strzok.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying Wikileaks isn't biased, but you can't use the fact that they don't like Hillary Clinton as proof of that bias.

       That's true that you can't use that fact alone. However, the key is that I am not using it by itself. The IG report showed that Strozk was able to do his job in an impartial manner. Wikileaks was impartial because they didn't release these messages. If they were impartial, they would release these messages and still have political opinions.

       nope i just find it funny that they are both essentially sociopaths except Hillary is sooo much worse for some reason. if you look at her education and career you would see why people say bright, also probably explains where all those connections were made. I guess you could say trump is smart too if you consider he does a great job at riling people up and pointing them in a direction away from himself. It really is smart but its definitely divided the people pretty well, no ones willing to talk to the other side because the other one is "evil". Now we the people wont get together and hold the government accountable for anything, its just democrats fault or republicans fault.

       Trump never strikes me a sociopath in the same way Hillary does.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5d8zop/serious_people_who_have_met_or_dealt_with_donald/">
        If you read accounts of people who met with trump before this election campaign he often comes across well
       </a>
       and I think that he likes to talk to people and generally interacts well with them, despite his oddities and mannerisms. Hillary on the other hand always comes across as forced. Perhaps Psychopath is more appropriate for both of them though as Sociopaths are generally defined as being more anti-social and less subtle.

       He's kinda thrown a wrench into both of their systems over the past decade or so. People act like he has always been anti-DNC and pro-GOP but he seems anti corruption more than anything else. I think Wikileaks preferred the GOP to win because they knew Trump couldn't hide their corruption while if the DNC won then it'd just business as usual. In other words Assange wanted this house of cards to come down and thought the GOP would expedite that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once Trump is taken down the GOP won't win another race for a long time. But by that time maybe some progressives will help steer the DNC towards less corrupt waters.

       i love how thinking hilary was a sociopath (which she clearly is) is considered bias against the whole party.
      </p>
      <p>
       wikileaks loved bernie, it wasnt about the democrats it was because hillary was scum and had already bought the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       if anything its a bias against parties corrupting the democratic process and ignoring the will of the people.

       They loved Bernie so much that none of the DNC manipulations against his campaign were published by WL until
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       he had already lost the primary to Clinton. Thereafter WL only concern re: Sanders was to try to get his supporters to not vote for the only remaining candidate who was partially promoting Sanders policies, while going totally mute on his polar opposite in Trump.

       We don't really know when that stuff was in their possession, and if part of the goal was to convince the public that maybe it was a leak by a disgruntled Sanders supporter, then of course they'd claim to only have received them after the primary was over.

       Interesting that they omitted the two messages in between those ones explaining
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       they favoured a GOP win in fall of 2015:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        [2015-11-19 13:46:39] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; We believe it would be much better for GOP to win.
       </p>
       <p>
        [2015-11-19 13:47:28] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; Dems+Media+liberals woudl then form a block to reign in their worst qualities.
       </p>
       <p>
        [2015-11-19 13:48:22] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; With Hillary in charge, GOP will be pushing for her worst qualities., dems+media+neoliberals will be mute.
       </p>
       <p>
        [2015-11-19 13:50:18] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; She’s a bright, well connected, sadistic sociopath.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Edit to edit another excerpt a little later in the convo:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        [2015-11-19 14:06:36] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; GOP will generate a lot oposition, including through dumb moves. Hillary will do the same thing, but co-opt the liberal opposition and the GOP opposition.
       </p>
       <p>
        [2015-11-19 14:07:15] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; Hence hillary has greater freedom to start wars than the GOP and has the will to do so.

       Exactly. They view the GOP as incompetent and were scared Hillary would be able to exercise the will of our oligarchs with much more finesse. It's not that the GOP is morally better, it's that they're too stupid to not get caught. Their idiocy will rally opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it looks like they are right. Progressives in the DNC are starting to clean house. They're reigning in their worst qualities so that they can stand as far away from the GOP as possible while the GOP is playing with matches near a tinder box.

       Hard to disagree with anything here, but it doesn't mean WL should not be criticized for trying to get Donald Trump elected. Publishing stolen emails wasn't enough even, Assange had to help launch the Seth Rich theory and promote Pizzagate and Spirit Cooking as well. Basically functioning as an arm of the GOP with both critical facts about Hillary and the DNC
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       unconfirmed, evidence-free notions. And zilch on Trump or any of the bozos in his administration. Sessions, Prince, Manafort, Council for National Policy...zilch.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing wrong with having a bias and preference. There's alot wrong with Wikileaks operating this way. They were even trying to coordinate info with the actual Trump campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention I'm pretty much disgusted with Assange for not considering or even mentioning the damage Trump promised to do to immigrants (of color, obviously). The lack of empathy present in such a zero-sum, macro view of things is disturbing.

       Check the timestamps, numpty. The primaries weren't even over yet. Trump wasn't the focus of anybody until he won the RNC primaries. He wasn't even the front runner then. Notice how they said "We believe it would be much better for GOP to win."? The GOP candidate hadn't been decided yet. They thought Hillary would have been worse than whatever candidate won the GOP primary. And I can't fault their logic.

       MuckRock also just got bought out by another fun and hilarious company so they can continue to do their “non profit” work.

       This is the most frustrating tactic deployed by the left, which is if it’s someone they don’t like they find a way to label every ism they can loosely tag to them as a way to discredit them. However now these words have been so abused they’ve lost all meaning.

       I think the whole point was to show WikiLeaks bias for trump but do you really need more proof after assange saying they also got some gop emails but then deciding for everyone there was nothing of interesting so he won't release them...

       Oh yeah, I know why they labeled him all these things. Assange clearly hated Clinton and didn't have anything he deemed worthy of release from the GOP. So now they find a way to call him a sexist, racist, homophobe, whatever else they can manage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see it all the time. They'll even go after fellow left people. Like Sam Harris, a respected intellectual who has an anti-Trump podcast every month, soon as he made his opinion clear that while Trump is the worst candidate in history, it's also clear that Clinton is corrupt and deceptive.... Boom he was being labeled all the isms and ists available to discredit him for criticizing the left. Just about every YouTube progressive host has met this same fate because they dared come out and admit that intellectually they believe Clinton is shady.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did the same with WL (Mind you I was in Berlin during their 10 year and met several staff who confirmed this). The reason Assange is every ist in the book is because that's how they discredit people. Even though Assange admitted "Yes I don't like Clinton" but he's also on record saying, "I think Trump is a total moron". It just so happened that Russia gave him a really good dump of emails which were of public interest. Russia didn't give him anything of value from the GOP. That's not within his control that he doesn't have anything interesting. He's not going to go "Oh we have leaks but we wont release them until we have leaks from the other political side, to keep it balanced!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a progressive liberal but super in love with capitalism.... So while I'm DEFINITELY left leaning, the hypocrisy and attempts from the left to censor and dismiss people who disagree with them is going to be their undoing. They are alienating useful people within the party who could help. Many people on the left already frequently talkk about how scary the fringe parts are, with their attempts at censorship and removal of free speech, which they use entirely for political reasons. All they do is go "I don't like this speaker, so I'm going to find a way to call him a sexist mysoginist.... Then I'll report him and try to shut down his event... Thereby preventing people from hearing his words."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's awful. I can't fucking stand it. If anything makes me go right for an election, it'll be over this issue.

       Not even necessarily progressives.... The Democratic party is the oldest average party EVER in the history of our country. They are all old and ancient... And they are all part of the same network who have just been recycling out positions of power and influence and fat lobbyist jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the old guard not wanting to give up. Imagine if Sanders beat Clinton? Sanders would have ripped apart the DNC from the inside out and reformed it. The old guard would have been replaced with a bunch of young progressives. All that power and influence would transfer to these outsiders. Can't risk that.

       The key metric is respect for the individuals. We all have opinions, but when they are to totally disregard human suffering, those with compassion don't wish to tolerate them. To tolerate such intolerance is to tacitly comply with such intolerance. It negates tolerance. If someone wants intolerance, they should be prepared to receive such intolerance. Yet, so many are not, being easily offended, claiming a right to free speech as they attack others with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can say what we wish, but shouldn't be shocked when it comes back to bite us. Freedom of speech is government to citizen relationship. Citizens can choose to react within the confines of the law to anyone else's speech. Deal with it, easily offended offensive people,

       Manning should have never been in the military. She was Bergdahl with a security clearance. They are both headcases who only got in because at the time the Army was taking anyone with a pulse.

       I can see how some people side with Snowden but she is no Snowden. For Manning it was a personal vendetta. She leaked indiscriminately(essentially everything she could get her hands on). imo she is a pos and should still be in prison.

       DC Leaks and Guccifer 2.0 are specifically named in the Mueller indictment as fronts for Russian GRU agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Wikileaks is not mentioned in the indictment, although some assume
       <em>
        "Organization 1”
       </em>
       is Wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, an indictment is not proof, and given that none of the indicated will appear in court, we are unlikely to see the supporting evidence.

       Wikileaks denies G2.0 as their source, someone claimed to be Guccifer 2.0 and denied being affiliated with the guccifer 2.0 twitter handle that claimed to be working with wikileaks...  There was a legit guccifer 2.0 but it was hijacked as a disinfo agency.  now it's supposedly GNU, but the moniker has changed hands so many times, the shell game has been crazy.

       I would love to source that for you...  It's a difficult thing to source for me in my current situation, however, I can comment further...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Guccifer 2.0 materials relate to the Access database from the DCCC.  This has largely been discredited because queries against the database were collated into excel documents with Cyrillic metadata.  I don't speak Russian or any other language written in Cyrillic, so I can't verify this, but I've heard that it was actually Ukrainian, not Russian...  Still, it's been widely circulated as a Russian hoax of epic proportions (the database contained things like Nancy Pelosi's credit card info, as well as hundreds of other DC elite's PII.  The chans devoured this information and did successfully order pizzas and make phone calls directly to people like Pelosi and Schumer.  This database contained incriminating information on both democratic and republican elite.  Including a clear papertrail for the TARP funds being used to pay Senators of every color, which would mean congress got kickbacks for doing that massive bankster bailout).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The materials Wikileaks published are said to have come from two main sources: one being a leak from someone with direct access to the Exchange environment.  It's somewhat possible that there was no direct access involved and some very shrewd trickery was used to make it look as though the access was a direct connection and not over WAN.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         John Podesta got phished.  He responded to "Google Support."  This could have been anybody and, as I interpret the legalese, the indictment of the "Guccifer 2.0" team was not connected with this particular "hack."  Those who submitted this material to Wikileaks remains a mystery.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Important to note that the Guccifer 2.0 indictments contain next to no (publicly available) evidence and there's very little chance the individuals named will be extradited to the united states to stand trial.  Therefore, the indictment could be merely symbolic and not reflective of any actual evidence or intention to prosecute.
      </p>
      <p>
       My full point, however, is that the Guccifer 2.0 materials are often conflated with the stuff that Wikileaks published.  This is just not the case.  As described above, there were 3 major leaks.  None of which can be substantially linked to Russian actors, ESPECIALLY not if you had any technical grasp of the ramifications of the Vault 7 leak.  Additionally, the Guccifer 2.0 indictment refers only to 1/3 of these major leaks.

       I was in Japan waiting out the election at the time of these various drops, so I'm working largely off memory.  I was in the threads and absolutely know, for a fact, that the Access database contained legitimate information regarding many many DC elite.  I'm back in the states now, so I will not comment on how I know the database was legitimate, but I'll certainly say that there were many people in those threads doing independent verification.  If the Russians sat on that information and organized it into an Access database fully in-line with the way US institutions organize their data...  I'm a conspiracy theorist, but I'm also an IT professional...  That hoax, consisting of personal information for thousands of DC's most protected people... If it is a hoax, the Russians are on another level and we should issue a prompt surrender in this information war.  Unfortunately, I don't believe the Russian hoax theory and instead I think there's clear evidence that hundreds of members of congress got major kickbacks laundered through a network of pizza shops and porno outlets from coast to coast as repayment for the TARP bailout.

       These are not all of Wikileaks' Twitter DMs, they are from a specific group where they spoke to volunteers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is mostly quite mundane. Volunteers bringing stories to the attention of WL etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       One interesting thing I realised when reading through was that the WikiLeaks Task Force Twitter account was created just a few days after people suspect WL was compromised (around Oct 20 - 25).

       Super interesting going through the week of 10/15/2016...the week JA's internet was cut the first time. They were very focused on the Todd&amp;Clare attempted pedo-smear campaign, and then people started showing up outside the embassy...

This is not an ordinary. It is a siege and a war zone of a kind. Still, calmness must prevail and mental space for strategy always. I say it here as I say it to myself.

       I was one of the first hundred or two hundred subscribers to r/WhereIsAssange- it was created because people in r/WikiLeaks, r/t_d, and r/conspiracy seemed to be ignorning the fact that weird stuff was going on with the WikiLeaks Twitter account, and anyone who brought it up was called a concern troll. I felt like I was in the twilight zone- hashes and pictures were being sent out but everyone was just ignoring it. So someone created the sub to talk about it, and it was just a few people at first and then it grew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it got turned into disinfo later, but it was created by well intentioned people who felt like everyone was ignoring some obvious weird stuff happening

       Yeah, I subscribed to
       <a href="/r/WhereIsAssange">
        /r/WhereIsAssange
       </a>
       from day 1. I agree 100% that it was created by well-intentioned people. But I do believe there was some effort to twist it shortly thereafter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope someday someone pulls this whole thing together into a digestible format so that we can see what's really been going on, because I think we're still in the dark about much of what's been happening with wikileaks/Assange since Oct. 2016.

       they spend a lot of time talking about specific theories - and methods of delivering them - and timelines for delivering them. and guess what? this subreddit has been a magnifying glass for much of it.

       remember kiddos: if you have hate in your heart or a brain clouded by self-delusion, someone will find a way to manipulate you.

       You're totally right. I read the front page of r/conspiracy every day, and that's where I first read about these texts being leaked/published just the other day. Not sure what the hand-wringing is about.

       r/conspiracy won't talk about it because this is a pro Putin/Russian government sub. In the messages, Wikileaks clearly wanted to the GOP to win just like the Russian government did.

       It sure seems to be becoming that way, but those users are implants.
I’ve been on this sub for 6 years and it was never like this.
I used to be able to spend literally all day following one thread down the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I barely want to read comments, because it’s the same re-hashed political bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I’m more concerned with
       <em>
        conspiracies
       </em>
       .
Not just politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I miss the underground military base posts, aliens, alt-history, etc.
All the things this sub used to be, can be found in other smaller subs, but this place used to be the hub. 
Now it just feels like a one sided political chat room.

       It's not flimsy evidence that a no-fly zone in Syria would have started a massive world war when Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford - the highest-ranking and senior-most military officer in the United States Armed Forces - also said that implementing a no-fly zone would require us to go to war with Syria and Russia.

       This might be true, although I don’t know what your basing this on. But they did give us the DNC emails and the NSA emails that we know are legit and factual. This alone should afford them the benefit of the doubt.

       That's a good point and people should acknowledge that, but lying by omission isn't the same to me as lying by restructuring, denial or out right fabrication, which is what we seem to get from the rest of the outlets.

       i want to see his dirty laundry aired

       i wanna know how much his plastic surgery costs, what kind of dudes he hooks up with (tillerson, for one), etc. stuff he doesnt want us knowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       also your logic confuses me. i know the clintons were dirty and was happy to see them exposed. it didnt change what i knew. are you suggesting that, if someone is plainly corrupt, we should just accept it as part of the deal?

       You're feeling attacked and I can understand why reading through this post. I don't believe you're really interested in the things you just said. My point is that you say you "knew" the Clinton's were dirty but you meant suspected. Now you know. Well, we know Putin is a murderous dictator and no new knowledge is going to change that. If the Russians want that to change, that's on them. It's not any part of the deal for me. You're just talking about vengeance.

       Thanks for explaining to me my feelings, Lieutenant Tim! I have oh so much trouble determining how I feel. I believe I’ve caught the vapors reading your post. Best set for a spell

      <p>
       I don’t have evidence of Putin even indirectly having anyone murdered. Could you send that? Even this last novichok one was sort of debatable.

       Well, there we have it. The real answer to my original question. If "actionable" evidence of state sponsored murder exists, I agree I would like to see it. Why did you say that other stuff? Just to get your Tillerson line out?

       you asked what i wanted to hear about Putin - i just listed stuff i could think of quickly that he wouldn't want to be public. if wikileaks exists to counter those who abuse power, why wouldn't they be working to expose someone that murders their colleagues?

       also seriously watch the videos of him with tilllerson if you don't know what i mean. there's love there. i mean that unironically

       wikileaks invites it.
      </p>
      <p>
       they should just claim what they are. an arm of russian intelligence. where are they when it comes to helping the russian people, the journalists, etc, anyone who opposes Putin lands in jail. surely they should be focused on those issues as well as american ones?
      </p>
      <p>
       no. they wanted donald trump elected, a move which helps russia and china, a move that hurts Europe, a move that hurts most americans. i hate hillary clinton but at least we wouldn't be enemies of europe and friends with a country run by a literal KGB agent.

       Well, if they're an arm of Russian intelligence then I guess we Americans owe a big debt of gratitude to Russian intelligence for

       The one where Assange talks about attaching someone, who was speaking against them, to the Rothchilds and Global Elites is disturbing. I mean, it was so non-chalant and wasn't true. He just knew that all he had to do was plant the seed of doubt.  To do against someone who is speaking out against you is no different than the shit you were supposedly against.

       Someone was speaking out about WL and Assange directed them to attach that person to the Rothchilds to make people not believe him. Or to discredit him by attaching them with the Rothchilds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange was an absolute hero to me for a long time but he is not the person he was years ago. That became apparent when he came out in support of the GOP, then only sends dirt on the DNC during the election. Then it comes out yesterday that he had shit on Manafort but didn't leak it. It makes me wonder what else he got that he didn't leak.  I do not care one bit that he was for the GOP and dony blame him for not wanting HRC to win. The problem with that is that it goes against everything WL is supposed to stand for. Here is the statement from Hazel Press on why they leaked the convos:
      </p>
      <p>
       "At this point, considering the power exercised by WikiLeaks, [disclosing] literally anything Assange says is in the public interest,” Hazelpress told The Intercept, including Assange’s political position during the 2016 election, since “WikiLeaks purports to be a neutral transparency organization.”

       One of my favorite wikileaks emails has to do with Israel/US, which I'll post below, but if you search
       <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?q=israel">
        'Israel" on Wikileaks
       </a>
       , you get 421,000 results. Obviously not all of them are going to be relevant, but there's a lot in there.

      <p>
       The decision to overthow Assad with United States intervention (arming/training "moderate rebels" and so forth) was made because it gives Israel a massive strategic advantage and reduces Iran's influence in the Middle East.

       The power structure that is beginning to form in Russia, China and Iran is starting to get a little worrisome to me. We have SA, Israel so any type of power we can take from the group in the Middle East is fine with me. China is starting to consolidate a lot of power around the world and cementing positions. The Petro Yuan is going to be a bit of an issue. Some people say it won't matter, some say it will. Since I truly have no idea how global economics work, I guess I don't know either. It is def something I have been trying to gain more knowledge on though.

       I think Wikileaks didn't need a front man should have stayed anonymous.  He had enough knowledge to achieve Wikileaks anonymously and I think although I respect the great things they have done for the world, his ego got him into the mess he's in now, anyone with that big of an ego is bound to have many flaws if you dig.

       I agree. He is an egomaniac for sure. And there is no telling what happens to you when you are in a virtual prison for years on end. I guess my biggest issues with him are how easily he would send out disinfo and the things he did in the election. I def think he worked out a deal with Trump. As in they would lobby for him, or get him out of trouble completely somehow. I also think he created and was originally Q.

       I have had a feeling that he was Q last year from the similarities in the way Assange and Q communicate to people. It really wasn't much more than that for a while. Then, the day before Assanges internet was cut this year, Q posts, "will be offline" or "will be offline for reason". Can't remember exactly. Then, his internet is cut and the next day, Q is posting on a different board. You would think that whoever was posting on the original board would say, "Hey everyone, I am moving my page to this place". Since they only communicate online, moving their page without any notice and the coincidences of the internet stuff, kind of cemented my theory for me. I posted this and was mostly mocked. To be expected at that point really. Then someone sent me a link showing that MEGANON had come out saying she had been larped and Assange was Q. When you see all of the stuff Assange did during the election for Trump and the stuff above, I think he got with Bannon and made up Q. He then said I will continue to push for Trump for a deal to get me the fuck outta here. He took the data from Breitbart and WL to see what got the base riled up and also get people that weren't Trump supporters to back him. Then crafted Q's narrative from it. I think that whoever Assange was working with, took over Q when his internet was cut. He may not have even wanted them to but they did. 
And I definitely see a difference in the stuff posted by Q now compared to what was being posted in the beginning.

       This is like one of those youtube rabbit holes, except for Reddit comments, where the theories make sense only if you're stoned as balls. The next one will be "Assange is running a transvestite midget prostitution ring out of the Ecuadorian Embassy to blackmail the security guards, all transactions paid in bitcoins and secret documents."

       Yes, also believe JA possibly Q, it makes a lot of sense.  He had a lot of time in that embassy to map out this elaborate tale.    Time well tell, I'm certain if it is him, he'll certainly have to let us know at some point.

       I agree 100%. The man is a narcissist and, when it came down to it, cared more about his ego than he did his principles, hence his support for anyone over Hillary Clinton. But even the election aside, Wikileaks would have been better off as an anonymous collective.

       So here's the conspiracy related to this release that I noticed: every article about it continues with the narrative that WikiLeaks preferred to get Trump elected. This narrative reinforces the idea that they were only releasing stuff on HRC because of that preference, and thus if they had anything on Trump, they held it back.
      </p>
      <p>
       But search for yourself; they clearly didn't have anything on Trump, and bemoaned this lack of leaks. They were upset that the media thought that they were holding back. And most of all - just because they preferred Trump, it wasn't because they liked him. They just thought he would be far more ineffective, held back by his own party, Congress, and his own stupidity.

       No one is shocked by this except T_D. Obviously WL isn't unhumanly unbiased. Of course they are going to have preferences about things, and they're going to have an agenda. Every single person on this fucking planet has an agenda. The question is, do you agree with their agenda, or not? I agree with their agenda, which at least in part seems to be to disclose atrocities (collateral "damage"), secret and nefarious acts (such as mass surveillance), etc. and stop that crazy bitch Hillary Clinton from becoming the leader of the free world.

      </p>
      <p>
       Even if those DMs are real, there is absolutely NO proof those DMs are real/from the real account. Those could have been from those common fake accounts(with letters in the name which look similiar/identical) existing for already many years, and thus fabricated.
      </p>
      <p>
       By this, this could also one of many CIA-OP to make WikiLeaks look bad.

       This might be true, although I don’t know what your basing this on. But they did give us the DNC emails and the NSA emails that we know are legit and factual. This alone should afford them the benefit of the doubt.

       I can see how some people side with Snowden but she is no Snowden. For Manning it was a personal vendetta. She leaked indiscriminately(essentially everything she could get her hands on). imo she is a pos and should still be in prison.

       Check the timestamps, numpty. The primaries weren't even over yet. Trump wasn't the focus of anybody until he won the RNC primaries. He wasn't even the front runner then. Notice how they said "We believe it would be much better for GOP to win."? The GOP candidate hadn't been decided yet. They thought Hillary would have been worse than whatever candidate won the GOP primary. And I can't fault their logic.
