        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Three members of the highly respected Nordic Cochrane group have savaged the <a href="http://ahrp.org/gates-foundation-buys-cochrane-integrity-for-1-15-million/">Bill Gates funded HPV study</a> in the British Medical Journal.  </p>

<p>The Cochrane HPV vaccine review was incomplete and ignored important evidence of bias
<a href="https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2018/07/27/bmjebm-2018-111012">https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2018/07/27/bmjebm-2018-111012</a></p>

<p>The key findings of Nordic Cochrane are as follows:-</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Cochrane human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine review missed nearly half of the eligible trials.</p></li>
<li><p>The review was influenced by reporting bias and biased trial designs.</p></li>
<li><p>Authors of Cochrane reviews should make every effort to identify all trials and the trials’ limitations.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Important Note: Cochrane and Nordic Cochrane are separate, Cochrane used to be good until they started receiving Bill Gates $millions, whereas Nordic Cochrane are still independent and will call out any corruption, bias and poor quality studies they find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Submission Statement:  The father of Bill Gates was the head of planned parenthood and appears to have passed down his beliefs to his son, Bill Gates admitted on camera that he was going to lower the world&#39;s population using vaccination.  A recent study found that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29889622">HPV vaccine is associated with a significant reduction in a woman&#39;s chance of giving birth</a>, the vaccine is to reduce the population by reducing fertility rates, no surprise that Bill Gates is paying out bribes to pay off researchers to pretend that all is well with the vaccine.  Fortunately there are still honest independent experts out there who won&#39;t stand for this type of corruption, long live Nordic Cochrane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so I appreciate, and am very interested in, corruption in the medical field. So first of all, thank you for posting this.</p>

<p>I have to ask, though, what is your very specific issue with Bill Gates? You seen to be very much against vaccines in general, which I assume has much to do with it, but every single post of yours I&#39;ve looked at is about vaccines and has a comment that goes back to Bill Gates.</p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m asking (no, I&#39;m not cashing fat checks from Microsoft) is because I always had a generally positive opinion of the Gates - I had thought of them as a good example of the potential power of altruistic capitalism.</p>

<p>Just curious, but braced for downvotes...</p>

<p>Overall there won&#39;t actually be a significant %, just coincidence with the ones you looked into.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Bill Gates is just one of many people involved in this corrupt agenda, while I am more concerned about the power of the industry as a whole, Bill Gates is still a key player.    </p>

<p>What many of the billionaires do to avoid taxes is setup charities and not for profits, any taxes they would have been due to pay can then be paid into these foundations because it allegedly goes to a &#39;good cause&#39;.  The reality though is that these foundations move the money around to help out other investments of the billionaires and also open up new investment opportunities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re missing the point once again. You don’t own or show horses so you can’t understand. Let me explain:</p>

<p>There was a time where it was affordable. We had A,B,C and schooling shows. When the super rich infiltrated, they started building huge parks and taking out the other shows. Because they are in USEF, they made rules where a recognized show can’t be within 250miles of another. This killed the shows that were affordable. You now have HITS, Classic Company and ESP which charge out the ass to show.  </p>

<p>The USA method is money driven while the European is not. The schmucks from the US are trying to make the Europeans go their way which would result in trainers going out of business. </p>

<p>Now riders with talent cannot show because of the expense while the ones with money and no talent continue to show and make the teams. </p>

In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die.</p>

<p>“If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda.</p>

<p>HPV vaccine is associated with a significant reduction in a woman&#39;s chance of giving birth</p>

<p>There&#39;s a big problem with that study you linked (full text below), namely that it <strong>doesn&#39;t control for women who used birth control</strong>. There may be a correlation between women who more frequently use birth control and women who also opted for the HPV vaccine.</p>

<p>This study also did no data-collection of its own, so there could be issues in the data collection from the studies its based on (haven&#39;t looked into it).
Also from that study:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Conflict of Interest</strong></p>

<p>The author filed a claim under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program on behalf of her daughter. The Special Master dismissed the claim due to untimely filing. The claim did not include the HPV vaccine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That &#39;study&#39; is interesting, but claiming it &#39;found&#39; something is misleading. Perhaps it warrants more research definitely, but there are a lot of factors not accounted for for it to be taken at face value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My daughters and son were basically pressured by their pediatrician! He was not pleased when I told him no thank you and my kids said the same thing when asked every time we went in.  When my daughters were older and went to the GYN, the wording was similar to yours.  “We will start your HPV series today with the first injection and then you’ll come back in 8 weeks for the second in the series, the third will be at next years appointment.”  I was very taken aback. If I had not been there or if my daughters were not well informed about the vaccine, they easily could have assumed that it was just normal procedure or something they HAD to do.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Michigan they mailed out a letter to parents of teens (me, for my son) telling them that their child was due for an HPV vaccine, and how to go about getting it and getting proof of it to the health department.  This was maybe two years ago.</p>

<p>I went off, and called the health department to bitch about it - since the HPV vaccine is not a &quot;mandatory&quot; vaccine for schooling in Michigan.  I did a little bit of background check and found out that this is part of an initiative to raise vaccination rates in the State, without having to resort to making it a mandate - making unaware parents just THINK they have to vaccinate without actually saying so.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really was.  I kept my letter for a while, but I tossed it sometime last year when I didn&#39;t hear anything more of it.  </p>

<p>When I got it, I went looking around online and that&#39;s when I found information within the department (it was online for some reason) that detailed the program in Michgian - some sort of national monetary incentive to the state, I think it was, to increase HPV vaccination rates.  </p>

<p>I was livid.  The poor lady who answered my phone call at the health department really got an earful that day.  Because I knew that this was complete crap.  Because I <em>knew</em> that this was not a mandated vaccine - but how many parents out didnt? </p>

All 3 of my kids, well the oldest 2 are boy girl twins so they were approached at the same time, were told they would get 3 injections total.

    <div class="md"><p>Mein gott, you don&#39;t see yourself as a psychopath do you?</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t evil any more than robots. It&#39;s just that most of us have emotions like shame and guilt and also empathy that keep us from feeling satisfied harming others. Robots and psychopaths are unencumbered by such restraints.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying we should do a witch hunt for psychopaths. There are millions of them. They are not all choosing evil. I&#39;m saying that those who are knowingly manipulating others to serve themselves, causing harm, should be restrained. If they aren&#39;t psychopaths, they&#39;ve buried those good self-correcting emotions under a pile of flimsy justifications. Psychopaths do it too. </p>

<p>We do cause harm to the environment, but to be honest, it&#39;s not a simple matter to correct and most people are not very aware of it. The media won&#39;t talk about it for their advertiser interests and congress won&#39;t address it because of their donors. Some of us do care about it, but merely recycling isn&#39;t going to fix the oceanic garbage patch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your lives they destroy to all your money they steal and hoard?
Because like in the movies and TV shows, they are heartless monsters that are so bored.
And whos better, the precious masses who riot and burn their own neighborhoods out of uncontrollable emotions?
Or so overwhelmed by guilt and pride that they go through such lengths in mental gymnastics hunting for targets on who to blame for their own foolish life decisions.
Oh the guilt that they cant pull the trigger themselves with excuses that they&#39;ve no might, so they let others do it for them so they can have flowery hand washed dreams at night?
Then wake up in the morning merrily relishing in the spoils, as others have been robbed of the fruits of their own toils.
People so addicted to their emotional stimulation and pampering that they would offer their coin, dignity and futures?
Filling the pockets of these merchants to lie and spoon feed them with what satisfies their trivial, banal desires.
And whatever saving virtue of the common man you may recite will just be buried by their colossal pride; 
So consumed by it, they turn their backs on facts that bite, to such lengths where the truth they themselves hide.
What they&#39;re so proud of and celebrating, is actually their greatest weakness leading to their undoing.</p>

if i had a vaccine and had an adverse effect my main doctor would never believe it was from the vaccine and would chalk it up to a coincidence of timing- which means it wouldn&#39;t have been reported to VAERS.  so i feel the instances are far underreported </p>
