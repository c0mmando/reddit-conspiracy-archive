       What do you make of the fundemental nature of what's going on here? Is the world a evil place? Are tptb trying to "wake up" the masses? When i look at how things work (everything is just a bunch of atoms vibrating, the only reason we walk on a solid surface is because it's atoms are vibrating faster than ours &amp; how we see in 2d and use shadow to made it appear 3d ) or quantum physics ( nothing is formed into anything until it is observed, atoms unobserved are in "super position", literally everywhere) it makes me wonder. Is it more like a VR movie?  I dig the holofractal site on here and see the parallels. I guess my question is, Are we looking right past the most fundamental conspiracy that ties the rest together??? Are we playing a metaphysical game? What is the fundamental nature of our "reality".

       Yes, and TPTB (or were) have hidden this knowledge for a long time and have kept it out of reach to us. Fluoride in the water =&gt; pineal gland calcification.

       I like to define "reality" as the summation of the perception of the collective consciousness, which is why MSM has so much pull, they direct many many minds to believe 1 thing, thus opposing viewpoints have an uphill battle

       I'm not an expert on this stuff, but I've read that the more they study the universe the more it resembles a computer program. Also, computer games are becoming increasingly realistic and will eventually become indistinguishable from reality, leading to the question... are we living in someone else's game?

       I realise I've basically answered your question with a question. Sorry, but it's a really difficult one haha!

       It is indeed a game. Trust your instincts. If you study the smart grid, I posted a video of Lockheed Martin engineers discussing vertical flight, time travel, etc. It red pilled me beyond my hyper woke state and clarified the game.

       Quantum / particle physics certainly has some very interesting properties:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         All forms of energy can be reduced down to a discrete elementary metric: the gluon.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         All forms of matter can be derived from gluon chain hadronization.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         All points in space can be reduced down to a discrete metric: planck length, as such the spatial universe can be described as a three dimensional matrix of discrete points.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The planck epoch forms the fundamental time delta as in the smallest discrete metric in which virtual particles can be exchanged to propagate elementary forces.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And the most puzzling, unanswered question of all:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Why is the speed of light ( the causality of time ) an exact constant? Why does our universe have this set limit?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The fact that our universe has 1) a set limit on causality and 2) space and matter are discrete forms a strong argument for a simulation theory.

       We don’t know what consciousness comes from however. It’s one of the biggest mysteries of science. We have all these connections in our brain and they’re really complicated; complicated enough to give us a self aware experience. The question is, does the brain generate consciousness, or does it tap into it like a radio?
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychedelics is one way to play with the consciousness (as long as you respect it and have a trip sitter for your first time, do research, etc). And i have had many revelations about the workings of reality and time on high doses of LSD.

       I wish I had your love for this existence. I suggest you look into the smart grid. Imho, this is the end game. I am not a doomsday truther, I'm a fact collector. Seems like they have the panopticon they sought. Also eugenics. I'm not scared, for the record. I'm disgusted.

       Yeah i have looked into it and i very well maybe. But there isn't much i can do about it in the present moment.  I realized though that no matter what i feel about something there is someone out there that thinks it's gonna be great. So... Who can say. I just say maybe it will maybe it won't. But whenever something comes up i try and attend to it in that moment. That seems to be all the control we have. To worry about things I personally don't know to be true, would appear to be less beneficial than to do nothing at all. At least thats how it seems in my reality tunnel.

       I love that. Great perspective. I am not worried, I'm angry. At TPTB, but more at modern society for casting me off as crazy instead of standing in solidarity. Not every day, but at times. Perhaps I am disillusioned, but I can do something. I can move away and create a community outside the smart grid which is my version of going out on my own terms. That's my only issue. I'm not going by subjugation or coercing. Unfortunately, the system has dry fucked me so hard, I'm no longer attached to anything aside from my honor. Certainly not this stupid human suit.

       When all is said and done, I would like to be remembered as the girl who fought the evil law firm that no lawyer would touch, and won. So fk it. I really appreciate your perspective and discussion. Cheers.

       I participated only because they took my little boy and my father, as well as irrelevant $$$, but it was simply a point of pride, similar to my desire to go by my own will. I would never have entered a court for any reason, had this not occurred. I literally couldn't let them get away with it. It is not a good game, and it sucked. That said, they said I couldn't, 200x, and the lawyers believed this. It's justice porn for the oppressed. That is all. More relevant, is my pursuit of living my truth 24/7 from birth till death. On my terms...within my control.

       Long ago, a group of people found that they could control and extract wealth from the masses, and they have been mastering these techniques for a while now. These people seem to be a bang on fit the definition of evil, whether you're religious or not.

       Their plans have been progressing nicely, and they have been moving towards their goal of a one world government where the vast majority of humanity is nothing more than slaves to them. However, the internet has thrown a big wrench into their plans and it has allowed for many of us to wake each other up.

       Forget everything you think you know about 'Reality'. We're a species with 5 senses; our experience is an instrumented model based on these 5 sense apparatuses. Our thinking and language is yet another metaphorical model based on this instrumented experience.

       I think there's a physical dimension and a spiritual/metaphysical dimension.
      </p>
      <p>
       And contrary to what people believe, the world is an evil place. I mean there's good and bad, but I personally feel there's more bad than good. Society itself is not destructive, but we live in a destructive society. We're being lied to by the media, the food is being poisoned with chemicals, tptb manipulate the currency and use it for their own benefit to destroy and control others. We're being distracted from these evil truths; if people ACTUALLY realized how fucked up the world really is, then they'd be acting differently. But we're bombarded with artificial opiates of every kind so we don't see past our materialistic bubble.

       That's what they want you to think they're trying to do. What they would love for you to believe is that there are mysterious doctrines hidden in all the great religions of the world dating back to Egypt or Atlantis that explain everything about our reality and that there have been two factions in relation to these doctrines throughout history: one that wanted to hoard this knowledge and the power that came with it for themselves and another that wants to share it with everyone and initiate a species-wide spiritual evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what they're going to try to make the New World Order look like by the way. It's not going to be this prison planet slave state that's monstrous on the surface; it's going to look like the most spiritually advanced thing you've ever seen and like the next step in human evolution. In that sense I think tptb are one faction playing two roles. One part of that faction basically being as evil as possible and intentionally misruling to such an extent that there is widespread anger and hunger for a saviour and another part of the faction externalizing and popularizing the things that the entire faction actually believes in order to pave the way for that false saviour. Look at where the New Age movement came from in the first place. The Theosophical Society, Annie Besant (who published a paper called Lucifer and whose Lucis Trust has consultative status at the UN , Aleister Crowley (his Aeon of Horus idea might actually be the origin of the term) etc. Timothy Leary was a CIA agent. Robert Anton Wilson idolized the historical Illuminati. Just recently there was a scandal at the Gaia Conference where a longstanding member named David Wilcock resigned because the Conference is dominated by Luciferians. The people pushing quantum mysticism and new age ideas are not your friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most dangerous mistake you can make is assuming that evil always looks like evil. The New World Order is going to be Luciferian not Satanic, Solar not Saturnic. Why else would the Bible, which predicted the New World Order at a time when it was almost unthinkable, say in Matthew 24:24 that of its signs and wonders that "if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect"? How else would the New World Order succeed in creating the one world religion talked about in Revelations?

       Clearly our reality is some kinda of artificial construct that is serving us experiences. For what reason could it be? Mere enjoyment or is there some goal we're expected to fulfill? I used to think it was about enjoying yourself, but now it almost seems like the Maze Runner. Everyone in regular society are like the people stuck living in the maze. Nobody wants to try and leave because their life inside is convenient for them, even though they are not free. Well, one boy wakes up, and that life is not convenient for him, so he sets a goal to escape and he overcomes it. If we just sit and enjoy life, then we are like the people in the maze. I guess there's nothing wrong with that, but if the point is to fulfill a goal, then the goal is likely not to maximize enjoyment and security.

       Yeah I can see that for sure.. I can see how the world steers people (ie. Die with the most stuff, etc...) It makes me think the opposite is probably closer to the truth. What is the least i can get by with. Idk just how it "feels".
