       I find that the more someone uses insults and gaslighting, the less likely they are to support their claims. If a claim is so obvious that "everyone knows" it should be a simple demonstration without resorting to schoolyard peer pressure and shaming.

       So, today's taboo topic: Prove the globe earth.

       Since the 15th century about 50 eclipses have been documented which feature the sun and moon both visible in the sky, in other words eclipses prove nothing for the globe earth.

       You're talking about solar eclipses, which by definition have to have both the sun and moon visible at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this cannot be the case with a lunar eclipse, as it's the Earth that is getting in between the moon and the sun.

       Well, in this particular case it is refraction. It's not my fault if you have trouble dealing with it.

       How are detailed explanations of the observed effects of light traveling through different mediums "hand-wave all problems"?

       Your failure to understand these issues is do to your refusal to examine how gravity and light work.

       Got anything from the last century?

       Also I would be curious to hear your opinion on why we cant model the next dozen eclipses using the FE model.

       Why do eclipses only become predictable when we use a globe heliocentric model?

       The ocean wouldn't stop, it would carry on as far as the eye could see. If you stick a boat on it you will eventually see the bottom disappear but the sails still visible.

       It's curved but you cant see its curved because it curves over the horizon. Which is my point. The horizon as we see it wouldn't exist if the earth didn't curve.

       I dont need to know the calculation's but tyvm for the lesson. Seriously i appreciate it. As i said somewhere else, if you watch a boat or ship go out to sea, you will noticed the bottom on the ship disappear before the top. The only way to explain that is curvature or the boat is sinking. Things wouldn't disappear

       There is a natural limit to how far you can see based upon the focal length of your eye. If you draw a diagram of the light we take in it spreads out (think of a torch beam) and naturally touches the ground at some point establishing the horizon (or at least the furthest point you can see). Standing on a ladder enables the angle to hit the ground further away from you giving the effect that you can see further. Using binoculars will also do this as their focal length is longer than that of the naked eye. Therefore, a ship that has seemingly disappeared over the horizon can be brought back over it by binoculars until it eventually disappears again, whereupon it can be brought back again using a telescope.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wanted to see right the way across a flat earth as some people claim, you would need ‘laser vision’ where the light did not spread out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the proverbial ship over the horizon is not the best test. Far better to ask how it is possible to still see a lighthouse from a ship that is 60 (sometimes even 100) miles off shore, when the curvature calculations make this impossible.

       How does this help explain your point?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes. If you get on a ladder you will see farther over the horizon because you are at a higher vantage point. Yes, if you use binoculars you can see farther and more detailed because that is legitimately what they are designed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does that explain why a ship disappears from the bottom up regardless of medium?

       The power is not the issue. It is the focus. Light spreads out. As soon as it does it is inevitable that it will hit the ground and go no further. Why do you need a laser? There is a body of water from America to Europe already. Water always finds its own level and cannot curve around the outside of a ball in any experiment ever conducted. Therefore see level is level at both sides of the Atlantic. Simple.

       Curvature is the easiest thing to prove. 8” per mile squared is easily measurable with modern technology yet there is not one single point on the Earth where is has been shown.

       I don’t put faith in FE. I’m examining the facts. It appears to me that if the earth is a globe it is relatively easy to prove. There should be hundreds of examples of curvature that don’t rely upon stories from old pilots. If the Earth was spinning at the equator at 1000 mph that is easy to measure. Yet we cannot.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have no solid proof anywhere of any of it. That puts doubt in my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the contrary, I know Water is flat. I know it finds its own level. I know it does exactly this everywhere we look. I can see the horizon is flat. I understand how optics and focal points work and what I observe is exactly that. I can see the sun cannot be millions of miles away and 400 times further than the moon by basic geometry. I can set out a scale model of the solar system and see straight away that times, season, night and day just don’t work on that model.

       I happen to think the default position is that is is flat. That is what is most obvious to me if I could get rid of the indoctrination. I don’t think the argument for a globe is strong enough to go against my eyes and logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that the argument for the existence of God is stronger than that of evolution. I know most disagree with me on that too. I think the globe argument is the foundation of the evolution argument. You are free to disagree because neither of us can prove the argument completely.

       The most obvious proof that the Earth is a sphere is the behavior of stars. They are different in the northern and southern hemispheres. If the Earth were flat, then it would be possible to observe all of the constellations visible in Australia from the west coast of Canada looking out over the Pacific ocean using a telescope. This is not possible, however, as the stars dip *below* the horizon, rather than merely approaching it. The stars also do not lose any apparent brightness as they do so, meaning they must be extremely far away.

       Copying from a youtube comment made on the source video your linked video is derived from.
      </p>
      <p>
       -------------Copied Comment Below----------
      </p>
      <p>
       And JAXA's earthrise is filmed from orbit, not from the surface. JAXA hasn't landed on the moon yet, unless you count crashanding. Factchecking, guys. It's kinda important
      </p>
      <p>
       RELATIVITY (1:27:15)
We can tell the difference between the earth spinning and the sun, moon and stars circling the earth because orbit requires force, while spinning doesn't. The two ideas are not symmetric. If everything is circling around the earth, then everything needs to have a force acting upon it to make it move that way. If there is no force acting upon a moving object, it will keep going in one direction. Now we could say that there is a dome spinning around the earth, and that could work. But that doesn't match our observations. Firstly, the planets don't move in a cirlce around the earth, but make weird loops now and then. Second, the sky is spinning counterclockwise on the northern hemisphere and clockwise on the southern hemisphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is of course different from Einstein's theories of relativity concerning gravity and spacetime. And while you claim physicists are moving away from Einstein, his theories have made many successful predictions and is generally held in high regard by mordern phycissts. Light has been demonstrated to be affected by gravity, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when you use an engineer and a doctor in biochemistry as examples of people debunking relativity... I mean, I'm sure they're smart people, but people study specific subjects for a reason. Anyway, it's a moot point, since the shape of the earth is not dependent on Einstein whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       THE PLANETS CHANGING SPEED (1:33:04)
First of all, that video is made by some guy. It does not necessarily reflect the scientific understanding of the universe in any real way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the planets aren't falling behind and catching up with the sun any less than the propeller blades on a plane are falling behind and cathing up with the hub. By your logic rotor blades on a helicopter would have to speed up to catch up with the center of the rotor and then slow down to get behind it, and the same would have to happen to the wheels on any wheeled vehicle. The planets are orbiting the earth the way we see it in most illustrations, while at the same time the whole system is moving together in one direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       COMET TAIL (1:36:40)
Why would the sun have a comet tail? You don't see light unless it hits your eye. Light from the sun continues away into space until it hits something. This is regardless of whether the sun moves or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       LIGHT BENDING VS. ERATOSTHENES (1:19:50)
Well, first off Eratosthenes didn't prove the shape of the earth, but it's size, assuming it's a sphere. Second, light moving horizontally through the atmosphere will obviously be more refracted than light coming vertically down from it, which you yourself has stated earlier in this video. interestingly, these impossible photos can only be taken at atmospheric conditions. You would of course explain it by saying the weather conditions are clear enough that we can see farther. I wouldn't accept your theory of vision, and you wouldn't accept my explanation of light bending, so I guess we're at a standstill.
      </p>
      <p>
       An interesting thing to note is that Eratosthenes' proto-experiment will give different results on a flat earth vs. a round earth. so if you really want to prove that the curvature doesn't exist, make some measurements of shadown at different latitudes and compare them to this:
       <a href="https://takethisskepticalblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/sun-angles.png">
        https://takethisskepticalblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/sun-angles.png
       </a>
       If the distance you have to travel increases to get the same increase in angle as the last step, then congratulations: you've proven a flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       ENGINEERS NEVER TAKE CURVATURE INTO CONSIDERATION (1:41:10)
I'll let Jeranism do this one for me: Just because you say they don't take it into consideration, doesn't mean they don't. (1:42:20). Besides, we've been over this one: the earth's curvature only has to be taken into consideration over great distances. You're not laying down one single track of rail 20km in length. You're gonna lay down several shorter tracks, and they're gonna comform somewhat to the terrain.
      </p>
      <p>
       SOLAR SUNSPOTS AND CREPUSCULAR RAYS (1:42:40)
Crepuscular rays are optical illusions caused by perspective. Even if it wasn't, it wouldn't fit with your model. If crepuscular rays were proof of a flat earth, they would only be visible around the area where the sun is, so from the tropic of cancer to the tropic of capricorn. I have seen these rays here where I live in Norway, and if I were to follow those rays to where they converged, I could have judged the sun to be just above Oslo. Are you telling me the sun is actually above Oslo?
      </p>
      <p>
       ZOOMING BEYOND THE HORIZON
Haven't seen any evidence of that actually happening yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       MAGNETIC POLES (1:47:20)
Don't really see any proof of anything here. The magnetic poles should be alligned with each other, and that's what we see. The magnetic poles do shift over time, but stay opposite of each other. I really don't see the problem here.
      </p>
      <p>
       RADIATION ON ISS (1:50:10)
Maybe instead of just asserting that the radiation is too high to be there, you could do some research and see what NASA actually says they do to mitigate this. You claim there are no shields for example. Well, there are, and there are special areas for extreme cases of radiation. There are also protocols they go through to make sure they are not overexposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say the radiation from the sun should easily be able to heat up the station to the same temperature as the air molecules. Well, the trick is to build space shuttles in a way that reflects as much radiation as possible. For example by making them white. They are also built to be very insulated, so temperature doesn't transfer from the outside to the inside. There are even special instruments to counter the problem of static electricity. I mean this is information readily available on the internet or in the library. It's not a big mystery. Even if the ISS and all the information about it is faked, your arguments are countered by that information.
      </p>
      <p>
       ANTONIO'S VIDEO (2:02:30)
It is interesting to see how reversed footage looks like. It's also interesting to see how Antonio has forgotten that the sjy does move counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere, not clockwise. So when he's "correcting" footage, he's actually maing it go backward. Just look at the little hill illuminated by the headlights at 2:15:10, and you can clearly see that the reversed footage makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the discovery channel plays some clips backward. So what? You don't have to trust discovery channel for this. You can watch this video
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TspCclcwkUo">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TspCclcwkUo
       </a>
       made by amateurs. Or you can contact someone living in the southern hemisphere who can film the sky for you. Or better yet, travel to Australia or Argentina or South Africa yourself and film the stars. That should be all the proof you need.﻿

       Off the top of my head the orbit of Mars is unexplained in the FE model without having it do loop de loops through the air.

      <p>
       Also as of right now the FE cannot model eclipses with any accuracy.

      <p>
       Using the globe heliocentric model we can model them thousands of occurrences in the future with precise locations. This is not possible for a FE supporter to do.

       Ah. So you don't believe that gravity pulls everything towards the center of a mass either? If the earth was flat and I was standing at the edge of the world and dropped a rock; that rock would drop diagonally towards the center.

       Gravity is necessary to explain the ludicrous notion of people in Australia literally being upside down right now. It isn’t need in FE where we are all the right way up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you dropped a rock off ‘the edge’ there would be nothing to act upon it to stop it, so assuming it was more dense than its surroundings it would sink as all objects do.

       Okay now you are just being obtuse and misinterpreting questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't say "off the edge". I said "straight down". Still "on the earth". Does the entire flat Earth have the same mass? So, are you saying that not only the shape of the Earth is wrong; but also gravity?
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, are you saying that basically the entire field of physics is lying because your theory is correct? Because if so, you better have some damn good actual evidence because otherwise you just sound like you are being a disingenous contrarian not acting in good faith.

       Have you never looked into FE? If not there are countless people who have spent hours discussing this with experiments, diagram and videos far better than I can do in brief posts. Look it up. I was as skeptical as you were and only watched for a laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       In answer to your question: Gravity is admitted by science to be as yet unproven (regardless of what all the downvoters will say in response). Think about that for a second. It’s 300+ years old! It simply is not required to explain physics on a flat earth, only to counter the obvious arguments when you present a spinning earth model.

       No, it’s not only useful for shorthand, it’s the agreed calculation for the earths curvature. It is accurate and any scale as ought to be the case with a globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I observe ships sailing away, then you are saying that there is a visible curve, yet you also state that it isn’t visible from left to right over the same distance from the same point. That would only be true if the Earth were a cylinder.

       So you claim that when looking at the eye level horizon, you are in fact looking downwards to something that has curved away from you enough to hide a ship? Then why is it that you can look out to see through a fixed, level tube that prevents looking down and still see the horizon? If the horizon is curving away from you it will not rise up to eye level will it?

       I gave the answer in your other post. Draw a diagram of the angle and see whether you hit the water in front of the ship first of the sail. Also, there is always atmospheric interference close to the water and less further up.

       I already proved it the other day but the mods deleted it because they don't want the truth to get out -- if we were on a flat earth people wouldn't have so many back problems. We're all sleeping on a ball curving outwards which is why our backs are sore.

       I made this account specifically so I could leave my main one to do shit other than debate FE peeps. They kept going through my history snd trying to dox me. So I made one for a specific purpose.

       I honestly think the FE movement is not organic and is purposely being pushed to get people to stop investigating space and everything above us. Its most likely a psyop a la Mirage Men (Good documentary if you havent seen it). Basically Flat Earth exists to muddy the waters and have people waste time and effort on dead ends that were knowingly spread by the powers that be.

       Not the first time someone explains that to him. He knows! Still he brings up that argument again and again. And this guy has the guts to paint others as shills. :D

       My comment history clearly proves I'm not just here to ridicule flat earthers. I have like a thousand comments on this still pretty young account and only a handfull of them are making fun of flattards. I'm contibuting a lot more than you do, just not in the form of posts. I don't give a flying fuck what any flattard thinks about me having zero posts.

       Not really. It doesn't make much sense. No, you wouldn't be able to see stars on a relatively low ceiling from 200 feet across a large room. Don't know what point the analogy of stars falling below the floor is supposed to make. You don't see stars through the earth.

       It's not hard mapping both celestial poles on an infinite plane. The stars are local and therefore affected by perspective just as everything else is, the closer you are to them the higher in the sky they get, the further away, the closer to the horizon they get.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the stars rotate, they also get closer and further away, again, being affected by perspective.

       Then try to model them on any FE map and see if it matches reality. Come on, don't you see the problem for flatties in the image that I linked? You can use whichever model you'd like if you don't believe in that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, perspective isn't going to make things magically disappear bottom first. But if you honestly think that the celestial objects follows any "law of perspective" that implies that they're close/local then riddle me this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that the Sun, allegedly close/local, doesn't change in either angular size or angular speed over the course of a day when viewed through a solar filter?

       In the end of the 19th century Alfred Wallace, the noted naturalist, and co-discoverer of natural selection accepted a challenge from some creationists to prove that the earth was not flat, and he did so by showing that large bodies of water are convex.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The iron parapet of Welney bridge was thirteen feet three inches above the water of the canal. The Old Bedford bridge, about six miles off, was of brick and somewhat higher. On this bridge I fixed a large sheet of white calico, six feet long and three feet deep, with a thick black band along the centre, the lower edge of which was the same height from the water as the parapet of Welney bridge; so that the centre of it would be as high as the line of sight of the large six-inch telescope I had brought with me. At the centre point, about three miles from each bridge, I fixed up a long pole with two red discs on it, the upper one having its centre the same height above the water as the centre of the black band and of the telescope, while the second disc was four feet lower down. It is evident that if the surface of the water is a perfectly straight line for the six miles, then the three objects—the telescope, the top disc, and the black band—being all exactly the same height above the water, the disc would be seen in the telescope projected upon the black band; whereas, if the six-mile surface of the water is convexly curved, then the top disc would appear to be decidedly higher than the black band, the amount due to the known size of the earth being five feet eight inches, which amount will be reduced a little by refraction to perhaps about five feet.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of course the experiment showed that the earth is curved, but the creationists do what they do and they moved the goal posts.  Which brings us back to a lesson that Wallace learned, and in turn we should learn from him.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Still, he'd done his best to, as Lyell said, "stop these foolish people." He'd learned a valuable lesson we would be wise to heed today: don't accept wagers from men who are religiously motivated to believe in easily-disproved notions such as the idea of a flat earth.

       The view examples are very provable. Go find an area that is level and construct a 6 by 6 by 6 foot cube. Paint it neon green. Then drive 6 miles away next to some building and try to spot the cube with binoculars. If the Earth is flat you should be able to see it. Finally when, you give up, climb on top of the building and stand on the roof and presto there it is!

       The prove a globe without being able to see a curve.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example... the flat earth "theory" claims we can not see past the horizon because of perspective and the limitations of vision.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how does moving higher allow you to suddenly see further?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is easily explained on globe Earth, but on a flat Earth you have to come up with some sort of reason why altitude makes perspective behave differently or eyesight become better.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no flat Earth explanation for this simple phenomenon that anyone can observe for themselves.

       Polaris is on the elevation above the horizon consistent with the latitude you are standing on. This is regardless to the longitude you are on (e.g. 50° longitude Germany and US have Polaris at the same elevation).
      </p>
      <p>
       And crossing the equator brings Polaris below the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is impossible on a flat earth but exactly what we would predict on a globe earth.

       Can you not prove the shape of your world with observations? You have to take a person out of context and use that instead?

       Has anyone come up with any real proof that it's flat? I mean all the FE people ridicule the Globers for believing "empirical lies", and I still haven't seen anything that even remotely proves FE..

       So when you see a planet through a telescope it appears as a circle correct? Are we to assume that
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       planet is flat and also just
       <em>
        happens
       </em>
       to have its face pointing directly at us? If you, why do things like the red storm of Jupiter move and disappear from time to time if not for a rotation?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you explain seasons? Or even days? Is the sun just a giant flashlight being moved by an invisible hand?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can disprove any flat Earth map and confirm simply by picking two points on it and measuring flight times between them compared to flight speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, no flat Earther has ever been able give me a definitive map of what our Earth looks like anyways within this "ice wall" to begin with...

       It's all in context, in order to prove round earth I must firat prove the theory of flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flad earth, much like the space fleet progrm, is dependent on the demographic discussing the idea. If your qhole life is that of a NEET (shut in, digital hermit) tham your whole life is comprised of a 2d surface. Your cellphone, television and computer screen. Chances are you fall asleep to netflix or Youtube, and check your instagram and twitter before pushing your gut to see if you need to take a shit. So, although subjective, flat earth theory is indeed a reality for some people. People who remain plugged in likely refuse to walk up hills, and prefer their walk to any level of commute to be flat as possible until they step onto a bus or other mode of transport.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the context of the flat earth theory has been blown way out of porportion. It was originally pitched as a psychological mindset, then people started to overcomplicate it with maths and conspiracy nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, proving the theory of a flat earth, to take a step back and look at what gravity-less existense of matter looks like. If you take magnetized sand, and allowed it to float, and surrounded it with magnets that reflect it, pushing it all into the center using reverse attraction (north north) although the sand would not magnetize to itself, it would have 2 possible outcomes.
A) it would settle into the center by achieving balance
B) it would remain unbalanced and sperratic, thus immirating an atomic reaction without atom multiplication.
      </p>
      <p>
       This explains why apace junk remains in belts together, and why, when conditions are perfect, the "anti matter" forms into "mass".
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everything has mass, but everything is matter.

      <p>
       Yes. If you get on a ladder you will see farther over the horizon because you are at a higher vantage point. Yes, if you use binoculars you can see farther and more detailed because that is legitimately what they are designed to do.
