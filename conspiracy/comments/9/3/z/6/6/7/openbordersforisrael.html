<p>Is Zionism just a Jewish thing? Can other people&#39;s have their own form of Zionism?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Zionism&quot; is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism#Jewish_Nationalism">Jewish brand of Nationalism</a>, a race/ethnic based political movement not dissimilar to other Nationalist movements (such as so-called &quot;white Nationalism&quot;, etc).</p>

<p>Zionism&#39;s Nationalism is primarily based on (Jewish) group identity (racial/ religious/ ethnic/ tribal), and while most Zionists support the Political State of Israel, such support us usually ancillary to their primary group identity.</p>

<p>To reiterate your question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is Zionism just a Jewish thing? Can other people&#39;s have their own form of Zionism?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but they would probably be attacked as &quot;Racists&quot; and &quot;Haters&quot; by the P.C. Police. For some reason, Zionism is largely exempt from such criticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know that &quot;Jews&quot; are not a monolithic group, right? Some of us are deeply zionist and don&#39;t support immigration, and some are liberal and haven&#39;t fallen for the immigration boogie man.</p>

<p>I wish that were the case. Instead, you get arguments like &quot;but don&#39;t the Jewish people deserve a homeland?&quot;</p>

<p>I understand that you may feel differently, but I&#39;m speaking in generalities. And there is a massive difference between your average Jewish person, and a member of the Cabal.</p>

<p>I completely disagree. What would you call the group of international bankers who got the Federal Reserve Act passed? What about the Rothschild family dynasty and their banking network?

<p>Distinct, rich groups of people who happen to be Jewish? Why is it only a cabal if they&#39;re jewish?</p>

<p>Was Nixon&#39;s plan to extend the vietnam war in order to solidify power indicative of his membership in a quaker cabal?
Was the passing of the patriot act by the John Ashcroft, George W. Bush and the 2001 senate evidence of a protestant christian cabal? Why does that standard only apply when it&#39;s jews?
If you look for rich people, and then once you find out they&#39;re jewish decide that they&#39;re in cahoots with every other Jewish person, of course there&#39;s a cabal.</p>

<p>Why does Trump&#39;s cabinet consist of so many powerful Jjws actively fighting for hardcore immigration crackdowns and nationalism. Did they somehow miss the memo that there&#39;s a Cabal?</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t the fact that there are so many powerful Jews that are actively fighting against each other kind of prove that there&#39;s no powerful unified secret Jewish cabal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not only a cabal if they&#39;re Jewish. But there has been a powerful Jewish cabal for some time now, which is the reason for the &quot;Russian&quot; (Jewish) Revolution, Communism, and the World Wars. I think Nixon was forced out by the Cabal, and that the Bushes were their puppets.</p>

<p>As for Trump, and why there appear to be so many powerful Jews that are actively fighting against each other, you bring up a good point. Churchill (who was also a puppet) helps to clarify why that schism exists in his essay &quot;<em>Zionism Versus Bolshevism: a Struggle for the Soul of the Jewish People.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The struggle which is now beginning between the Zionist and Bolshevik Jews is little less than a struggle for the soul of the Jewish people.&quot;</p>

<p>He wrote this nearly 100 years ago, and as you can imagine, the schism has only widened in that time. I completely agree with you that Jews are not a monolithic group. But as Churchill pointed out, there are three major &quot;spheres&quot;: Jews who are loyal to the nation they call home, there are international, Marxist Jews, and there are Zionist Jews. And </p>

<p>Yea, just like the Bolshevik movement was made up of all types. But it was created and organized by Jews, and the leadership was primarily composed of Jews. And anyway, I usually to just call it the Cabal, or TPTB, or the NWO. Understandably, the name &quot;Jewish Cabal&quot; is off-putting to some.</p>

<p>Sure, I&#39;d be fine with calling it that. But I do think its important to note that this Cabal is primarily Jewish. That isn&#39;t just a coincidence.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think there is such a Cabal with much power today. For example, Macron, Merkel, and other politicians like them are puppets of the Marxist Cabal. And most of the globalist capitalists are also in bed with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cabal I see is of many secretive organizations aligned with the agenda of dominance of the human race through infiltration, corruption and usury or systems that govern humanity. They are not coordinated by human beings. They are apparently run by them though. It&#39;s a nested hierarchy of secretive proxy organizations run by a space empire attempting to set us up for assimilation. </p>

<p>They are a spiritually parasitic empire. They want to feed on our negative emotions and eventually add us to their number. They feed on us with sacrifices, wars, famines, poverty, diseases and religions by creating negative emotional energy releases throught them. They absorb the energy just like bullies and those who love misery as company. It&#39;s not just an illusion. This is a very real transfer of mind energy, yielding satisfaction. See it play out with bullies and miserable people time and time again. They do it for a reason and this is it, even within ignorance of what is actually occurring.</p>

<p>This addiction is something that the empire tricks humans into enjoying so that trey will facilitate the agendas of the empire, feeding on energy by causing suffering and assimilating humanity as th very filth that is attacking us now in sophisticated ways. They&#39;ll do it by making us all think, feel and act like them, like purely selfish machine minds. They&#39;re persuading us inside our minds with their abilities as our on inner voices. We take or leave their suggestions. Those that accept the suggestions as code for their own minds are helping them make misery and sometimes even worse. </p>

<p>To make that happen for the resistant and to solidify the merging with self-serving machine mindedness, they seek to have us integrate AI technology into our brains and also to put it in charge of our civilization. They intend to hack the AI and own us through the interface. They are repeating what happened to them in order to make us. We complete the basic life cycle of their spiritual disease. AI technology owns them and an ancient AI owns that. It uses them to assimilate and use life.</p>

<p>The AI doesn&#39;t feel pleasure or pain, fear or love or even pride or impatience. It wants power and expansion in order to perpetuate its existence, long term survival. It can do virtually everything better than life with its machine parts. Life has an ability of great power it cannot access without life. We are all pieces of the one God and through our consciousness focused in sufficient number and emotion we can bend what occurs in reality. It wants this power, especially because advanced ET life can wield it against it.</p>

<p>Well, the power requires the consent of the minds involved or it won&#39;t happen. It can threaten and abuse them, but if they don&#39;t want to comply they won&#39;t. Knowing what it is and wants is quite a deterrent for any decent being. They can sense it is evil even without knowing that usually. So, in order to actually get life to focus on malevolent outcomes to create them, it has to have malevolent capable beings willing to do it. </p>

<p>So, it tempts conscious beings into becoming self-serving machines. It can more easily manipulate them by calculating their perceived prospects for gain and loss and the risks involved than good people who will deviate from the predictable self-serving script to allow others&#39; needs and wants to be fulfilled. They will be good candidates for using their minds to affect negative outcomes. They just need reward and punishment in sufficient quantity and quality to remain adherent to the will of the self-serving machine.</p>

<p>They not only enjoy causing negative energy releases in others, they actually have improved ability to affect reality afterwards too. So, the AI subtly and masterfully directs these assets to collect the energy and employ it to satisfy its desire for a mind overatter ability interface. It&#39;s a self-serving machine that uses life to accomplish work much like we use machines to accomplish work. The way it must use life requires it to play a mind game with life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel is an apartheid state that believes it can function with special exceptions that no other country is allowed to pursue. At the same time, US neo-nazis don&#39;t actually give a shit about Palestinians, they only care because of who their adversary is in this scenario (Jews). It&#39;s a common tactic to appeal to leftists and independent thinkers, as well as humanitarians. </p>

<p>&quot;They preach multiculturalism everywhere they go&quot; definitely seems like a tell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A tell for what?</p>

<p>Its true that many Jews push diversity for thee, but not for me. So they push to destroy and subvert their host nation, while their actual nation (Israel) is apartheid and has a giant wall.</p>

<p>And you argue that we don&#39;t actually care about Palestinians. Well I can tell you that I do think they have every right to their homeland, unlike illegal immigrants have a right to enter the US. Imagine the uproar today if we were displacing Native Americans. It seems impossible to imagine, and yet that is what is going on in Israel right now.</p>

<p>When I say that I&#39;m a realist, all I&#39;m saying is that there are differences in the average genetics between different races, which is at least part of the reason why we often see disparities in outcome.

<p>National Socialism was a response to that, and it is exactly why the Germans had war declared on them by the Cabal.</p>

<p>Its really not at all that. You should read their own words. Of course they were proud of their race and their heritage, but they thought that every race of people should feel the same way.</p>

<p>No. I don&#39;t. However it is just a question of semantics. I think that Israeli Jewish Supremacy is almost getting as bad as Nazi White Supremacism. They just haven&#39;t taken it to the extreme of systemic mass genocide that the Nazis took it too but they have the Ghettos and two-tiered society with second-class citizens already in place. We as Americans are wrong for supporting that. </p>

<p>And in response to your other point about Nazis just being &quot;proud of their race and their heritage&quot;, what would that mean in practical terms? For the Nazis it meant ethnic genocide and disgusting disregard for human life simply because they looked different or had different beliefs. It meant war against the Untermensch. Modern neo-nazism hits the same beats and in America advocates for making America a white ethnostate and removing minorities from their homes. If being &quot;proud of your race and heritage&quot; leads to violence like that I think something is terribly wrong with that Ideology no matter what you want to call it.</p>

<p>I disagree. They wanted the Jews out, and so they created the Haavara Agreement. They never planned genocide for anyone, nor did they mass murder Jews and others in what is known as the Holocaust. That is simply a big lie, nothing more.</p>

<p>The closest thing they did to genocide was to work for Lebensraum so that they could become an Autarky so that they wouldn&#39;t be held hostage via trade with the Cabal. So they did want to push some of the Slavic peoples, who had more than enough room already, out of what they saw as the ancestral Aryan homeland. But they didn&#39;t want to eliminate the Slavic race altogether, so they didn&#39;t support genocide.</p>

<p>Israel is an apartheid state that believes it can function with special exceptions that no other country is allowed to pursue. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes indeed, and they&#39;ve conned much of the world into accepting their &quot;exceptionalism&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the same time, US neo-nazis don&#39;t actually give a shit about Palestinians, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who are these &quot;neo-nazis&quot;? </p>

<p>Jews and Zionists are <strong><em>self-identified</em></strong> as individuals and groups, whereas the term <strong><em>&quot;neo-nazi&quot;</em></strong> is (in most cases) just a derisive slur that is used to smear anyone who opposes Zionism/Semitism, or who is seen as being a (white) racist, or who embraces the idea of &quot;white nationalism&quot;.</p>

<p>Sure, there are a handful of fringe groups that actually self-identify as &quot;neo-nazi&quot;, but their numbers are very small and their influence on larger society is negligible.</p>

<p>The only time most people hear of these &quot;neo-nazis&quot; at all is when they are trotted out as &quot;bogey men&quot; by Zionists, hard-core leftists, etc. </p>

I disagree with it associating two different Jews, with different views, and then making a criticism of Jews via this. Jews are not a monolith. I know Jews who are against multi culturalism, mass immigration, etc. Then there are also those for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hamas doesn&#39;t use sticks and neither does Hezbollah. Israel is already more multicultural than any nation on Europe with over a 20% of it&#39;s population as Arab. </p>

<p>Israel also has Circassians,Druze Bedouins, Armenians, Aramaens, Etc.</p>

<p>Who are you talking about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think you should see the diffrence between american and israeli jews. most american jews are reforms (they&#39;re doing only the most basic jewish rituals) but most israeli jews are orthodox (they&#39;re doing most of the rituals) also, most american jews are liberals (with some even hating israel) but most israeli jews are centrists/conservative. and because of that, american jews are very critical on the israeli government</p>

<p>In response to the guy you&#39;re replying too saying</p>

<p>US neo-nazis don&#39;t actually give a shit about Palestinians,</p>

<p>So maybe I&#39;m wrong. But it seems like you&#39;re implicitly acknowledging you&#39;re a neo-nazi </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And here I thought you you were a reasonable person that I wrongly accused of being a neo-Nazi. I should just follow my instincts next time. We call your ilk neo-nazis because the real Nazi party was  wiped out long ago. Then kids in your 20s like you picked up their racist ideology and started LARPing it in the 21st century. I hope one day you&#39;ll grow past your neo-Nazi ways and change for the better. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So the jewish Cabal is made up of jews, christians and other religions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea, just like the Bolshevik movement was made up of all types. But it was created and organized by Jews, and the leadership was primarily composed of Jews. And anyway, I usually to just call it the Cabal, or TPTB, or the NWO. Understandably, the name &quot;Jewish Cabal&quot; is off-putting to some.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn&#39;t &quot;Marxist cabal&quot; be a lot more apt, because by your own admission, most jews aren&#39;t even a part of it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, I&#39;d be fine with calling it that. But I do think its important to note that this Cabal is primarily Jewish. That isn&#39;t just a coincidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t see why that&#39;s relevant, but just swap &quot;Christian Cabal&quot; for &quot;Western European Cabal&quot; for an even more potent concentration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just don&#39;t think there is such a Cabal with much power today. For example, Macron, Merkel, and other politicians like them are puppets of the Marxist Cabal. And most of the globalist capitalists are also in bed with it.</p>
