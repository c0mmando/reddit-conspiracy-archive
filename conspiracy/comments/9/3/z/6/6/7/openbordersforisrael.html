       That's a good way of putting it. Its just Jewish nationalism. And understandably, those Jewish nationalists tend to subvert their home countries and push anti-nationalist policy there. Once people recognize that, we can fight against it.

       "Zionism" is the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism#Jewish_Nationalism">
        Jewish brand of Nationalism
       </a>
       , a race/ethnic based political movement not dissimilar to other Nationalist movements (such as so-called "white Nationalism", etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionism's Nationalism is primarily based on (Jewish) group identity (racial/ religious/ ethnic/ tribal), and while most Zionists support the Political State of Israel, such support us usually ancillary to their primary group identity.

      <p>
       Yes, but they would probably be attacked as "Racists" and "Haters" by the P.C. Police. For some reason, Zionism is largely exempt from such criticism.

       You know that "Jews" are not a monolithic group, right? Some of us are deeply zionist and don't support immigration, and some are liberal and haven't fallen for the immigration boogie man.

       Well it would be very stupid, and immediately mark them as a hypocrite if they made both statements at once. But their silence on Israel's apartheid practices which are far worse than fighting against illegal immigration, combined with their right of return, speaks volumes.

       Was Nixon's plan to extend the vietnam war in order to solidify power indicative of his membership in a quaker cabal?
Was the passing of the patriot act by the John Ashcroft, George W. Bush and the 2001 senate evidence of a protestant christian cabal? Why does that standard only apply when it's jews?
If you look for rich people, and then once you find out they're jewish decide that they're in cahoots with every other Jewish person, of course there's a cabal.

       Its not only a cabal if they're Jewish. But there has been a powerful Jewish cabal for some time now, which is the reason for the "Russian" (Jewish) Revolution, Communism, and the World Wars. I think Nixon was forced out by the Cabal, and that the Bushes were their puppets.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Trump, and why there appear to be so many powerful Jews that are actively fighting against each other, you bring up a good point. Churchill (who was also a puppet) helps to clarify why that schism exists in his essay "
       <em>
        Zionism Versus Bolshevism: a Struggle for the Soul of the Jewish People.
       </em>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       "The struggle which is now beginning between the Zionist and Bolshevik Jews is little less than a struggle for the soul of the Jewish people."
      </p>
      <p>
       He wrote this nearly 100 years ago, and as you can imagine, the schism has only widened in that time. I completely agree with you that Jews are not a monolithic group. But as Churchill pointed out, there are three major "spheres": Jews who are loyal to the nation they call home, there are international, Marxist Jews, and there are Zionist Jews. And

       If jews are not a monolithic group, how can there be a jewish cabal? You could say there's a cabal of every major religious sect, by this standard, as long as at least two of them are powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       By your definition, the US is entirely run by a Christian cabal. Virtually every elected official, rich person, and industry leader in the US is either devoutly Christian, or a "Secular Christian". Why is this not indicative of a Christian Cabal?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is, why is a so called jewish cabal of more concern?

       The Cabal is mostly made up of international, Marxist/Bolshevik/Communist Jews and their shabbos goys. Zionist and nationalist Jews are not part of this cabal.

       Yea, just like the Bolshevik movement was made up of all types. But it was created and organized by Jews, and the leadership was primarily composed of Jews. And anyway, I usually to just call it the Cabal, or TPTB, or the NWO. Understandably, the name "Jewish Cabal" is off-putting to some.

       Sure, I'd be fine with calling it that. But I do think its important to note that this Cabal is primarily Jewish. That isn't just a coincidence.

       I just don't think there is such a Cabal with much power today. For example, Macron, Merkel, and other politicians like them are puppets of the Marxist Cabal. And most of the globalist capitalists are also in bed with it.

       Well the banking families are mostly Jewish, and then if you look into the powerful people who seem to support the Cabal's agenda, you can't help but notice a massive overrepresentation of Jewish people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, there are plenty of nationalist Jews. I respect those people and would fight along side them any day. Due to Jewish people being a diaspora for so long all while holding on to their heritage (which I respect them for doing), they are a complicated lot.

       The cabal I see is of many secretive organizations aligned with the agenda of dominance of the human race through infiltration, corruption and usury or systems that govern humanity. They are not coordinated by human beings. They are apparently run by them though. It's a nested hierarchy of secretive proxy organizations run by a space empire attempting to set us up for assimilation.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are a spiritually parasitic empire. They want to feed on our negative emotions and eventually add us to their number. They feed on us with sacrifices, wars, famines, poverty, diseases and religions by creating negative emotional energy releases throught them. They absorb the energy just like bullies and those who love misery as company. It's not just an illusion. This is a very real transfer of mind energy, yielding satisfaction. See it play out with bullies and miserable people time and time again. They do it for a reason and this is it, even within ignorance of what is actually occurring.
      </p>
      <p>
       This addiction is something that the empire tricks humans into enjoying so that trey will facilitate the agendas of the empire, feeding on energy by causing suffering and assimilating humanity as th very filth that is attacking us now in sophisticated ways. They'll do it by making us all think, feel and act like them, like purely selfish machine minds. They're persuading us inside our minds with their abilities as our on inner voices. We take or leave their suggestions. Those that accept the suggestions as code for their own minds are helping them make misery and sometimes even worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       To make that happen for the resistant and to solidify the merging with self-serving machine mindedness, they seek to have us integrate AI technology into our brains and also to put it in charge of our civilization. They intend to hack the AI and own us through the interface. They are repeating what happened to them in order to make us. We complete the basic life cycle of their spiritual disease. AI technology owns them and an ancient AI owns that. It uses them to assimilate and use life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The AI doesn't feel pleasure or pain, fear or love or even pride or impatience. It wants power and expansion in order to perpetuate its existence, long term survival. It can do virtually everything better than life with its machine parts. Life has an ability of great power it cannot access without life. We are all pieces of the one God and through our consciousness focused in sufficient number and emotion we can bend what occurs in reality. It wants this power, especially because advanced ET life can wield it against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, the power requires the consent of the minds involved or it won't happen. It can threaten and abuse them, but if they don't want to comply they won't. Knowing what it is and wants is quite a deterrent for any decent being. They can sense it is evil even without knowing that usually. So, in order to actually get life to focus on malevolent outcomes to create them, it has to have malevolent capable beings willing to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it tempts conscious beings into becoming self-serving machines. It can more easily manipulate them by calculating their perceived prospects for gain and loss and the risks involved than good people who will deviate from the predictable self-serving script to allow others' needs and wants to be fulfilled. They will be good candidates for using their minds to affect negative outcomes. They just need reward and punishment in sufficient quantity and quality to remain adherent to the will of the self-serving machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       They not only enjoy causing negative energy releases in others, they actually have improved ability to affect reality afterwards too. So, the AI subtly and masterfully directs these assets to collect the energy and employ it to satisfy its desire for a mind overatter ability interface. It's a self-serving machine that uses life to accomplish work much like we use machines to accomplish work. The way it must use life requires it to play a mind game with life.

Good vs bad. Red vs blue, its really sad to see people get stuck in the menality and literally be willing to kill each other over it.

       Israel is an apartheid state that believes it can function with special exceptions that no other country is allowed to pursue. At the same time, US neo-nazis don't actually give a shit about Palestinians, they only care because of who their adversary is in this scenario (Jews). It's a common tactic to appeal to leftists and independent thinkers, as well as humanitarians.

       Its true that many Jews push diversity for thee, but not for me. So they push to destroy and subvert their host nation, while their actual nation (Israel) is apartheid and has a giant wall.

       And you argue that we don't actually care about Palestinians. Well I can tell you that I do think they have every right to their homeland, unlike illegal immigrants have a right to enter the US. Imagine the uproar today if we were displacing Native Americans. It seems impossible to imagine, and yet that is what is going on in Israel right now.

       You keep circling around on this point. Do you not see how saying "there is nothing Neo about my views" leads an observer to think "ok, he's not Neo, so he's just a Nazi full stop." This doesn't seem to be working out very well for you.

       There's nothing contradictory there. I don't identify with either label per say, but I do think that National Socialism was a good idea and it should be tried again.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I think neo-Nazi, I think of tatted skinheads. That all seems a bit degenerate and silly to me, so I don't think the label applies. I'm clean-cut, well-educated and well-employed, with a full head of hair and no tats. I'm also not a racial supremacist, just a realist.

       You seem smart enough to eventually see that "national socialism was a good idea" is a horrific position to hold when one considers the horrors of history, and that claiming to be a "realist" in regards to race is a very common excuse for thinly veiled bigots. I hope you get there someday.

       When I say that I'm a realist, all I'm saying is that there are differences in the average genetics between different races, which is at least part of the reason why we often see disparities in outcome. That there are genetic differences between the races that go beyond skin color is undeniable. Political correctness has made it where that can't be acknowledged, which I think is bullshit.

       National socialism, which was formed in response to socialism elsewhere, was based on an "in group" who would benefit together and a scapegoat class, which got shit on and eventually mass murdered. Almost all modern countries are socialist in some respect but if there's an exclusionary aspect built into the system (Israel is a decent example), then you're entering nightmare territory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Excuse my perceptions but you come off as either a bigot who's using the allure of socialism to justify "race realist" arguments that have been around for generations, or a socialist who's been propagandized into some bigoted views and Nazi idolatry, thinking it'll only "work" for one race at a time.

       I find it funny that you keep calling me a bigot. Please point to any views I have that you find to be bigoted, because I'm honestly not sure what you're referring to.

       Here's what I think: we are currently being oppressed, and have been for some time, by the international banking cabal that now owns and controls most of the media, finance, and government. This didn't happen by chance, but has been a plan long in the making.
      </p>
      <p>
       National Socialism was a response to that, and it is exactly why the Germans had war declared on them by the Cabal.

       You're trying to present yourself as someone who is pro-Nat Soc, denies the Holocaust, believes Jews run everything, but is somehow NOT a bigot and NOT a Neo-Nazi because you don't have a swastika tattooed on your face. Perhaps the only such person in world history.

       And here I thought you you were a reasonable person that I wrongly accused of being a neo-Nazi. I should just follow my instincts next time. We call your ilk neo-nazis because the real Nazi party was  wiped out long ago. Then kids in your 20s like you picked up their racist ideology and started LARPing it in the 21st century. I hope one day you'll grow past your neo-Nazi ways and change for the better.

       No I would say they are an apartheid government with racist views but not neo-Nazi. Nazism is specifically white supremacist. I just want to say that being against Israeli Apartheid is perfectly in line with liberal views and you don't have to go to the other extreme of hatred of all Jews or white supremacism to oppose Zionism.

       Its really not at all that. You should read their own words. Of course they were proud of their race and their heritage, but they thought that every race of people should feel the same way.

      <p>
       Did you hear about Israel's new "Jewish nation state" law? Imagine if the American government declared America to be a white nation state (an ethnostate). Still don't think that they are neo-Nazis?

       No. I don't. However it is just a question of semantics. I think that Israeli Jewish Supremacy is almost getting as bad as Nazi White Supremacism. They just haven't taken it to the extreme of systemic mass genocide that the Nazis took it too but they have the Ghettos and two-tiered society with second-class citizens already in place. We as Americans are wrong for supporting that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in response to your other point about Nazis just being "proud of their race and their heritage", what would that mean in practical terms? For the Nazis it meant ethnic genocide and disgusting disregard for human life simply because they looked different or had different beliefs. It meant war against the Untermensch. Modern neo-nazism hits the same beats and in America advocates for making America a white ethnostate and removing minorities from their homes. If being "proud of your race and heritage" leads to violence like that I think something is terribly wrong with that Ideology no matter what you want to call it.

       I disagree. They wanted the Jews out, and so they created the Haavara Agreement. They never planned genocide for anyone, nor did they mass murder Jews and others in what is known as the Holocaust. That is simply a big lie, nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The closest thing they did to genocide was to work for Lebensraum so that they could become an Autarky so that they wouldn't be held hostage via trade with the Cabal. So they did want to push some of the Slavic peoples, who had more than enough room already, out of what they saw as the ancestral Aryan homeland. But they didn't want to eliminate the Slavic race altogether, so they didn't support genocide.

       Those are examples of American Jews and European Jews that support immigration to America and Europe specifically. 
How is that "for thee"? They're Americans/Europeans. They live there.

       They also said nothing about Israel, so you have no idea whether they support immigration into Israel or not.

       Modern "neo-nazis" or alt-righters are pro-Israel and pro-Zionism. I don't think OP's tactic is useful except to point out the hypocrisy going on behind mass immigration, which is certainly being pushed by Jewish media and politicians in the West. I think countries should be allowed to maintain their sovereignty, but within Israel's (ever-expanding) borders, there is an apartheid state.

       Are modern Neo-Nazis really pro-Israel? I've seen several admit they love Trump but ultimately he is compromised because he "gave his daughter to a Jew" and is Netanyahu's best friend. That seems a crucial point of separation between neo-nazis/"Alt right" and nationalist Trump supporters who are down with everything Israel does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that Israel under Netanyahu are massive hypocrites and oppressors, but that sentence of OP's I highlighted leads me to believe that he's coming from a place of stereotype and bigotry in league with Neo Nazi sentiments. His point stands but the motivation behind it is questionable.

       Jews that believe in multiculturalism are not in power in Israel right now, and that seems important.

       The Jewish Question existed long before Zionism or National Socialism. Not everyone is a Neo-Nazi because they dare to challenge the Jewish oligarchy. Multiculturalism is being pushed by liberal Jews in the West while they hypocritically believe in a Jewish ethnostate.

       Who are these "neo-nazis"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews and Zionists are
       <strong>
        <em>
         self-identified
        </em>
       </strong>
       as individuals and groups, whereas the term
       <strong>
        <em>
         "neo-nazi"
        </em>
       </strong>
       is (in most cases) just a derisive slur that is used to smear anyone who opposes Zionism/Semitism, or who is seen as being a (white) racist, or who embraces the idea of "white nationalism".
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, there are a handful of fringe groups that actually self-identify as "neo-nazi", but their numbers are very small and their influence on larger society is negligible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time most people hear of these "neo-nazis" at all is when they are trotted out as "bogey men" by Zionists, hard-core leftists, etc.

       No one cares the kind of people who make and post that sort of thing just want to shit on Jews it doesn't matter if it's with real information or just made up nonsense. I showed someone their citations from the Talmud were false and I was rewarded by a page torn from the Talmud volume I was holding, being thrown to the floor, and having my star of David ripped off and thrown beyond reach. For many people hate is more important than facts. I spend my entire life helping people but I get messages every day telling me to kill myself cause I'm Jewish. Some people really just hate us.

       This actually happened at the University of Cape Town, I'm not American and there's no Klan anywhere I've lived lol. This guy actually used to brag that his father was in a group that was kind of like the South African equivalent of the Klan kind of sort of though. He was a moron and had to run away back to Joburg after he publicly used the South African equivalent of the n-word very loudly and very publicly.

       This is anti semetic crap that's just blatantly false. Different Jewish people from different parts of the world have opposite political opinions. Jewish people that went to Israel are more likely to be conservative because a conservative Jew is more likely to go to Israel. Most Jews in America are assimilated atheists who are very different than the ones in Israel.

       We should also open the borders in everyone's house who supports "refugees" and mass immigration. Why do we have to suffer for their choices while they are barricaded behind walled, homogeneous communities with their own armed guards?

       You've completely misread my statement and I believe on purpose. It's only those who don't feel the consequences (for now) who can be so detached from reality o support this kind of suicidal immigration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we (the working class) have to suffer for the choices of the bourgeoisie and upper class, who constantly throw their support into mass immigration of peoples, into working class neighbourhoods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we have to deal with those consequences? We did not choose them. The bourgeois and the upper class have, and so, should take them into their homes and neighbourhoods, not import them into ours, so we must suffer for their morality and virtue signaling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, every person born in the third world chooses to further customs and beliefs that produce a third world society. They did not choose to be birthed there, but they choose to further it.

       You have a lot to learn, and I hope you do invite refugees into your home so you can get on the fast track to learning it.  You better start doing kegels now if you want them to be happy.  Otherwise you are likely to be set on fire after the rapes.

       I agree with the over all message of this video. Demographics are the future. I disagree with it associating two different Jews, with different views, and then making a criticism of Jews via this. Jews are not a monolith. I know Jews who are against multi culturalism, mass immigration, etc. Then there are also those for it.

       i think you should see the diffrence between american and israeli jews. most american jews are reforms (they're doing only the most basic jewish rituals) but most israeli jews are orthodox (they're doing most of the rituals) also, most american jews are liberals (with some even hating israel) but most israeli jews are centrists/conservative. and because of that, american jews are very critical on the israeli government

       You keep circling around on this point. Do you not see how saying "there is nothing Neo about my views" leads an observer to think "ok, he's not Neo, so he's just a Nazi full stop." This doesn't seem to be working out very well for you.

       And here I thought you you were a reasonable person that I wrongly accused of being a neo-Nazi. I should just follow my instincts next time. We call your ilk neo-nazis because the real Nazi party was  wiped out long ago. Then kids in your 20s like you picked up their racist ideology and started LARPing it in the 21st century. I hope one day you'll grow past your neo-Nazi ways and change for the better.

       Yea, just like the Bolshevik movement was made up of all types. But it was created and organized by Jews, and the leadership was primarily composed of Jews. And anyway, I usually to just call it the Cabal, or TPTB, or the NWO. Understandably, the name "Jewish Cabal" is off-putting to some.

      <p>
       Sure, I'd be fine with calling it that. But I do think its important to note that this Cabal is primarily Jewish. That isn't just a coincidence.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Don't see why that's relevant, but just swap "Christian Cabal" for "Western European Cabal" for an even more potent concentration.

      <p>
       I just don't think there is such a Cabal with much power today. For example, Macron, Merkel, and other politicians like them are puppets of the Marxist Cabal. And most of the globalist capitalists are also in bed with it.
