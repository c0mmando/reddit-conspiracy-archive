       My wife just told me her friend's daughter just died from Sid's. I was surfing their Facebook and saw their last post before it happened. They took a pic with their baby in the car and said "On our way to get this little girl her shots, yayyy." She died the following day in her sleep from SIDS. The poor unsuspecting parents have no idea.

       The first study you reference had a sample size of only 110 cases, in which only 13 appeared to confirm the researchers hypothesis. Needless to say no real conclusion can be drawn from such a small sample.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second study you reference is just bad science. As you quoted, the US is 34th in infant mortality but has the most vaccines. The study chops the data off there and only looks at the top 34 countries. In other words they manipulated their data to find statistical significance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last study doesn't say vaccines are dangerous, it suggests that two specific vaccines given at the same time might be interacting with one another in a negative way that prevents them from being as effective. Even though the kids in the study who received one or the other had higher survival rates than kids who received both, all of the kids had higher survival rates than kids who were not vaccinated at all.

       Why would data manipulation be the only reason to do that? Infant mortality varies a lot for various reasons and developing countries can have a very high death rate due to factors that don't exist in first world countries which could obviously distort the results so there could be other reasons why you would only include the first 34 countries.

       it does definitely suggest that vaccines can be very dangerous. It shows that vaccines given in combinations that we see in the real world can kill children and interact in ways we can not predict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Death is not a harmless side effect. Today up to 6 vaccines can be given in one single day and we have no idea how they interact.

       where did they say that specifically? I read several studies by the same authors and in others it was found that single vaccines and some combinations caused more deaths than they could have prevented so I wouldn't necessarily assume that they are always helpful.

       Sorry, the other poster said that mortality was still less in the vaccine group than the non vaccine group. I thought that was a legitimate statistic, was it not? Definitely agree that changing the combos would be the thing to do, though! Just trying to get the whole mortality of vaccine vs no vaccine straight, that’s an important factor in understanding the big picture I think, so if you know where I might find that info would you point the way? Good talk!

       They knew the US had the most vaccines in its schedule, and by cutting off the data at the US, they guaranteed it would also have the highest IMR. In other words they deliberately made the US an outlier in the data. They didn't use a good sample, they cherrypicked countries that would confirm their views. The fact that their confidence interval was so high should have tipped you off.  That whole study was a mess. In addition the cutoff, they're comparing the number of shots in the vaccine schedule to a nationwide statistic without actually controlling for vaccine usage. My guess? The US has the highest IMR and also the lowest vaccine uptake rate of any of the top 34 developed nations. More people refuse to vaccinate their kids here and more kids die. Hmmm.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second study most certainly does not suggest vaccines could be dangerous, although you're correct in saying they could have unintended side effects (all medicine does). The kids did not die of being vaccinated, they died of yellow fever, malaria, malnutrition, the list goes on. The vaccines failed to work. That's not the same as being harmful.

       <em>

       * hard to brush this off.  Being 34th in IMR should be a huge fucking concern since we push vaccines on children so heavily, country that boasts about its medicine cant keep a baby alive?

       "Torch found that two-thirds of babies who had died from SIDS had been vaccinated against DPT (diphtheria–pertussis–tetanus toxoid) prior to death."

       "without additional data we do not know whether it is the vaccinated or unvaccinated infants who are dying in infancy at higher rates."
      </p>
      <p>
       The second study isn't meant to talk about the dangers of single vaccines, its talking about the dangers of
       <strong>
        <em>
         multiple
        </em>
       </strong>
       vaccines, we don't administer vaccines alone we pump children full of dozens of them and thats obviously having an effect as the study quite clearly shows.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        this study proves nothing, vaccines in single doses are safe. 
It's admirable that you want to do your own review, but you need to understand what you're reading.  Don't just derail the experiment, its showcasing vaccines not as singles but the fact that the more vaccines we are taking, the more we are dying.  Try to understand the experimental design.

       Pushing vaccines on people doesn't guarantee they will administer them. Getting to zero IMR is next to impossible with our current medical technology, but developed nations do a pretty good job of getting us close.
      </p>
      <p>
       To your second point, most babies are vaccinated and don't die. Some babies die of SIDs. Correlation does not equal causation and if it did you would expect 100% of the babies who died from SIDs to have been vaccinated rather than only 2/3rds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't address your third point because you ignored what I wrote, made a fake strawman quote that never appeared in my post, and responded to that instead. Yikes.

       Are you really trying to deny the heavy vaccine push that is going on? That's not even an argument, it is happening, the media and the doctors are
       <strong>
        <em>
         literally
        </em>
       </strong>
       saying if you do not vaccinate your child you are killing them, some places even have mandated vaccines.  Getting zero IMR is difficult yes, but it's concerning that the nation that boasts about having some of the best medicine in the world (vaccines) has such a high imr.
       <br/>
       Ah, the ol' correlation != causation, therefore the study is worthless.

      <p>
       Thats not an argument either, not everyone has a reaction, lots of people smoke, but they don't all die, therefore smoking is completely safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually took the time to read the article it states that the unvaccinated are dying in fall/winter, where as the vaccinated are dying of sids between 2-4 months of age, they may both be dying of sids but they are dying at different times.  You are just spewing out bullshit and trying to hide this fact and the study clearly states it, why are vaccinated children dying of sids in the time period of vaccination but unvaccinated children are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       My last post is not a strawman, you told them to not jump to conclusions and to read what is being said and what is being studied yet you yourself have not, in fact you did the opposite, you tried to take attention away from the fact that children who were receiving MORE vaccines had a higher rate of death.  The entire point was that we need to closer look at the vaccine schedule, rather than individual vaccines, because we aren't giving out single vaccines but rather injecting dozens and dozens into infants and clearly this is having an effect that we are ignoring because we don't want to see what happens when we pump too many into a child because then pharma would lose money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your entire post is meant to take the focus off of vaccines having a negative impact, you never addressed it, in fact you said the exact opposite.

       "These findings demonstrate a counter-intuitive relationship: nations that require more vaccine doses tend to have higher infant mortality rates."

       The conclusion is that we are giving too many vaccines and you are refusing to acknowledge it, attempting to focus more on

       My entire post was to encourage people to be scientifocally rigorous rather than taking this bullshit at face value. Nowhere did I "try to deny the heavy vaccine push" because it is irrelevant to the conversation about these three very flawed studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't the children who recieve more vaccines who have a higher rate of death. It's literally "children who live in countries with more vaccines on their official schedule," with no reference to how many children in each country actually follow that schedule. In other words the entire premise of the study is so mathematically and scientifically flawed that any conclusion is automatically useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also bears repeating because you didn't hear it the first time: the SIDs study had a sample size of 110 and only 13 confirmed the hypothesis. No patterns can possibly be drawn from only 13 cases. You're talking about the time of year of death as if this is some kind of settled science when in reality the entire study is useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying this because I'm a shill for pharmaceuticals, I haven't argued this conspiracy one way or the other, I have only encouraged people to think critically about the information that they put into their brains. These are studies commissioned by anti-vaxxers, that just happen to confirm what anti-vaxxers already believe? Alarm bells should be going off for you.

       If that was the only study ever linking vaccines to SIDS, you might have a point, but there are many, the link is well known, in fact at one stage Big Pharma used to warn on the vaccine inserts about the risk of Crib Death after vaccines.
      </p>

       This
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Rbje6WT.jpg">
        leaked memo
       </a>
       shows that Big Pharma know that certain batches of their vaccines cause Crib Death, so they deliberately split up the batches to make it harder for people to notice the effects of a batch.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The second study you reference is just bad science. As you quoted, the US is 34th in infant mortality but has the most vaccines. The study chops the data off there and only looks at the top 34 countries. In other words they manipulated their data to find statistical significance.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They are looking specifically at first world countries, developed nations, so as malnutrition and poor sanitation didn't come into it.  If people in the first world are going to take a vaccine it needs to be based on first world data, not third world.

      <p>
       Then vaccines are dangerous, because they are given together in combinations, and nobody is studying for these effects apart from random independent researchers who then get marginalized and smeared.  The CDC vaccine schedule isn't about giving vaccines one at a time, it is about getting as many in on one sitting to boost Big Pharma profits, in case you don't come back again.

      <p>
       Yes, look to experimental design, like pro-vaxx studies not using real placebos, like not tracking for more than a few days post-vaccination, like people who got injured in a study not appearing in the final data.  Look also for funding e.g. if it's Bill Gates or Merck then don't believe it.

       Conspiracy theoriests are supposed to be more critical, not less. If you deny that scientifically rigorous studies are legitimate, and insist that non- scientifically rigorous studies tell the truth, no meaningful discussion can be had. We're supposed to ask questions, not make up the answers we want to hear.

       We'e in the 30s for a lot of stats, but all developed nations tend to be pretty close together. It'a harder for the US to "compete" on those tables because we have a significantly higher population and a more decentralized government than those other 33 countries. That doesn't mean we have an alarming IMR for a developed nation (we don't).
