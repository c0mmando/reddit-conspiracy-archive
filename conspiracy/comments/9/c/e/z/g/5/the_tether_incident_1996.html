       This is still one of the one most jaw-dropping videos I've seen when it comes to UFOs and Space. It literally makes no sense but is a fascinating watch. I think the official narrative was that these were 'ice crystals'. lol

       I have no idea what is supposed to be happening there. Nothing looks like a satellite, I just see a line and a bunch of floaters like when you get something in your eye. This would be a lot better if things were at least labeled.

       I'm so disappointed every time I see this video.  Any time it comes up, all people want to talk about are the weird bits flying around.  They could be aliens, molten metal bits, debris, I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it glosses over what could be the most important discovery in the last century.  All they did was dip a tethered probe into the atmosphere a little way, and they accidentally(?) pulled out more electricity than they could handle.  It was so strong that it literally burnedthrough  their millions of dollars worth of equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlimited, free, (relatively) easy to get power, and people only want to talk about alien particles...  Such a shame.

       Instead of focusing on what could be the greatest discovery in all of human history, detractors  believe 'ice particles' can't pass BEHIND the tether, pulsate, and produce over a mile long image...

       We have about 4.2 kagillion videos of aliens or stuff flying around.  How many videos do we have of equipment pulling "free" usable electricity out of the sky?  Not some guy playing with magnets or house antennae.  Massive amounts of electricity, just by dangling a metal rope.  If they kept the tether a bit shorter, it would've been a manageable amount, and the same effect could be extrapolated for a ground-up operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or...  We could talk about yet another of hundreds of videos that show alien particles flying in straight lines.

       The aliens aren't your friend.  And catching them on video for the 1000th time isn't going to change the world, or anything.  Unlimited energy, on the other hand, would move humanity forward in too many ways to list.

       Well it certainly did snap off. You might not have "weight" as we see it in space, but you do have momentum. Can clearly be seen snapping off - curling up like you would expect.

       Almost all of the videos of it, like the one in this post, are cut off so you don't see what happened.

       Even this one is trimmed up pretty bad too, and has extra commentary, but you can see at least some of the buildup that led to the gradual electrical overload.  For some reason, I can't find the original, longer version, that shows the longer overview of the mission and what happened.  I hope YouTube didn't memory hole that one too...

       It's a fascinating phenomena and I'm all for renewable energy sources... But how would this current even be used for applications on Earth's surface?

       That's one of the more bullshit explanations I've seen from NASA (or its acolytes), and they spew bullshit on a regular basis.  They should've just gone down to Home Depot, if their cables are so shit.  Not to mention that the entire tether was lit up, indicating that the resistance of the cable conductor across the entire length couldn't handle the amps going through.  The problem was that their cable wasn't conductive enough, for how long it was.  If they'd gone half that length or less, maybe the amps would've been manageable.  Can't really say, since NASA and the rest of our shit government doesn't care to investigate it further.

       And there are a variety of experiments and applications that could be done with this.  Tethered drones, tethered high altitude towers over deep mines, perpetual orbit in satellites.  Cabled kites charging ground batteries.Those are just me spitballing.  I'm sure that smarter people could come up with more.

       I do like your ideas, but hat altitude needs to be obtained for this induction to work--can kites, drones and towers go high enough?  How would satellites transmit current back to the ground?

      <p>
       Your argument seems wildly speculative and you lost me at points .. home depot cable isn't going to fix pockets of oxygen in insulative material.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have a video of the tether lit up with evidence it was due to current not sun light?

       All I can say is that I've seen this exact same thing with my own two eyes.

       It looked like a giant doughnut with a bite taken out of it.

       that video gives the impression of looking into a microscope displaying pond water. Life, everywhere. It's also sort of interesting in that regard considering the old hypotheses that talked about light being transmitted through a "trans-luminal fluid" and the really old bits about the "firmament"...
      </p>
      <p>
       What was the context of you seeing that donut-thing? The video makes them sort of look like jellyfish or something, although that could be just a the focus effect.

       That particular type of "pacman-looking" anomaly/craft/whatever you want to call it, has been seen numerous times. I do not believe it is a camera artifact. I would have love to see the raw footage of some of these things.
