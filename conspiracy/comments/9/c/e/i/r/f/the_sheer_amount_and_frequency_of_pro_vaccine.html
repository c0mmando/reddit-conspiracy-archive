       I am concerned about this as well.  What do you think their end game could be?  Are they just ensuring big pharama keeps getting that vaccine money without the population questioning it, or is it something more nefarious?

       I literally have zero clue, I was just assessing the amount of posts on pro-vaccine stuff all over reddit (and indeed the media) - it's overkill for the amount of people who say vaccines are bad... Which is suspicious to my feeble tinfoil-hat mind :D

       Vaccines are used for social engineering e.g. fetility reduction, killing off elderly etc, they are also used for inducing lifelong disease, which is equivalent to increasing tax, a disease tax.  Vaccines are a form of wall and chain, a weaponized tool of our slave masters.

      </p>
      <p>
       Ethylmercury (etHg) is derived from the metabolism of thimerosal (o-carboxyphenyl-thio-ethyl-sodium salt), which is the most widely used form of organic mercury. Because of its application as a vaccine preservative, almost every human and animal (domestic and farmed) that has been immunized with thimerosal-containing vaccines has been exposed to etHg. Although methylmercury (meHg) is considered a hazardous substance that is to be avoided even at small levels when consumed in foods such as seafood and rice (in Asia), the World Health Organization considers small doses of thimerosal safe regardless of multiple/repetitive exposures to vaccines that are predominantly taken during pregnancy or infancy. We have reviewed in vitro and in vivo studies that compare the toxicological parameters among etHg and other forms of mercury (predominantly meHg) to assess their relative toxicities and potential to cause cumulative insults. In vitro studies comparing etHg with meHg demonstrate equivalent measured outcomes for cardiovascular, neural and immune cells. However, under in vivo conditions, evidence indicates a distinct toxicokinetic profile between meHg and etHg, favoring a shorter blood half-life, attendant compartment distribution and the elimination of etHg compared with meHg. EtHg's toxicity profile is different from that of meHg, leading to different exposure and toxicity risks. Therefore, in real-life scenarios, a simultaneous exposure to both etHg and meHg might result in enhanced neurotoxic effects in developing mammals. However, our knowledge on this subject is still incomplete, and studies are required to address the predictability of the additive or synergic toxicological effects of etHg and meHg (or other neurotoxicants)."

      <p>
       Your parent’s generation wiped out smallpox using the smallpox vaccine.

       You probably have the classic scar on your shoulder that the smallpox vaccine left, your children won’t, as the disease has been wiped out.

       Let’s be real though, there are side effects from vaccines for certain types of people depending on their genetics and the body’s ability to process them in a safe way, but vaccines have helped and protected way more people than they have hurt in the long run. People do just enough research to convince themselves that there’s some huge conspiracy, but not enough to get to the actual truth of the matter.

       If graphed over time, yes. I 100% agree. However, I would be inclined to check how much of that data is legit and question whether that same curve can be attributed down to vaccines that have more than a few reports of bad side-effects.

       I’ve seen a lot of conspiracies that were/are real and there a probably quite a few that haven’t been proven yet as well. I’m just saying that people are more inclined to believe and see what they want/expect to see too. I’m just more skeptical of most things and try to look at everything objectively. From what I’ve seen with vaccines, there are issues with them, but I don’t think it’s a huge conspiracy to make kids autistic or something either.

       I can totally agree with that. It’s the people that think big pharma is out to kill them and you can’t trust any health professional that really kill me.  Those types of people make anyone who asks questions look like some raving lunatic with their ridiculous delusional paranoia.

       I would say the majority of people are in the mind that pharma is using vaccines to profit and to cause many chronic illnesses, and thereby customers for other pharma products.  I've never heard of anyone giving praise to most "medicine" that pharma sells, they all think it's hogwash and know it's just a money scam, but then when it's vaccines, they are happy to roll their sleeve up for the same company they rejected every other product for and inject miscellaneous chemicals into themselves, I don't see how people make that connection.

       Vaccines are actually one of the largest, most nefarious conspiracies around.
      </p>

       In the early 2000s, the VICP (Vaccine injury compensation program) was so flooded with cases of "vaccine induced autism," they realized that if a link between the two was definitively proven, the payout to these victims would be easily in the hundreds of billions of dollars.  That's all taxpayer money, by the way, because in 1986 Ronald Reagan passed the NCVIA bill, which transferred all liability for vaccine injury off the manufacturers, and onto the taxpayer through the VICP.  It should be self-evident that this bill is one of the most treasonous acts ever perpetrated against the American people.  With this newfound freedom, the vaccine schedule exploded. The schedule went from around 10 recommended vaccines to 68 now, highly correlative with an explosion in SIDS, autism, and autoimmune disorders.
       <a href="http://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Autism-Prevalence-Graph.jpg">
        Look at this graph
       </a>
       and what happens around 1986.. I know, correlation does not equal causation, but interesting nonetheless.

       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       This type of controversy could have bankrupted the entire government, thank god for them a team of scientists at the CDC put out a landmark study in 2004 that proved that there was no link between vaccination and autism.  The VICP used the results of this study and passed an omnibus proceeding to throw out all cases of vaccine induced autism.  This is despite the fact that the VICP had previously rewarded compensation to victims such as Hannah Poling, when they found there was sufficient evidence that vaccines had caused her autism.

       The problem with this study, though, is that
       <strong>
        it was a complete fraud.
       </strong>
       William Thompson, co-author of the study and current head scientist at the CDC has blown the whistle and has sought federal whistleblower protection.

       that vaccines can cause autism in genetically predisposed individuals with a mitochondrial disorder.  We have to be clear here, autism like symptoms = autism.  There is no blood test, or genetic test to diagnose autism.  Autism is diagnosed solely through behavioural symptoms.  So if you have autism-like symptoms... you have autism, or are somewhere on the spectrum.

       &amp;#x200B;

      <p>
       I tried to keep the evidence here layperson friendly, but I also have hundreds of peer-reviewed studies which show that vaccines are far more dangerous and ineffective than the general anti-scientific pro-vaccine rhetoric on reddit would have you believe.  If anyone tells you there is a scientific consensus on the safety of vaccines, they are either lying, or an idiot.

       This is just the tip of the iceberg pertaining to vaccine related conspiracies.  I just recently read a study looking at measles infection in utero, the sample size is small, but it turns out almost all the children born to infected mothers went on to develop Crohn's disease.  Autoimmune conditions like Crohn's are
       <strong>
        skyrocketing
       </strong>
       , yet very few people get measles anymore, the only exposure we have to measles is through the vaccine.  If you want to go even deeper, look up SV40 and prepare to be shocked.

       That’s what I’m saying though, the individuals would be people who would be predisposed to having a reaction, not necessarily your average person. As I said before, I believe vaccines have their issues sure, but no more so than a lot of other pharmaceutical compounds either. I think that it’s just something that antivaxxers sensationalize as more prevalent than it actually is.

       Really? Our society's current stance on the topic is
       <strong>
        "Vaccines do not cause autism."
       </strong>
       That is a hell of a lot different than "vaccines cause autism.. sometimes."

       If you didn't know, autism is the most dangerous and quickly spreading pandemic in modern history.  If prevalence trends stay the way they are, most children will be autistic in just a couple decades.  This is not due to the changing diagnostic criteria for ASD.  A recent study in California showed that only 14% of the increase in autism cases was due to a wider diagnostic criteria, the rest was genuinely due to this disease becoming more prevalent.  Autism is almost infinitely worse than other pandemics of recent times such as H1N1, because it is a lifelong debilitating condition, which often requires round-the-clock care for life.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been told for decades that: "we just don't know what causes autism."  It turns out that's bullshit.  We now have scientific proof that vaccines do cause autism, the authorities and the pharmaceutical industry have known this for decades and have been covering it up.  Millions of children have lost their livelihood due to this crime.

       You really think "anti-vaxxers" are sensationalizing this? What if my children are predisposed to having this reaction?  You think I'm actually going to take that chance?  What's worse, measles gives a fever and a rash to 99.9% of people and disappears within a week, autism could put my children in diapers for the rest of their lives and they won't have the mental capacity to say their own name.  Until they make a safer vaccine, it's a pretty obvious choice.

       No.. that was Andrew Wakefield.  The CDC study I'm talking about was basically put out as a rebuttal to Wakefield's study, to discredit his idea.  But, as I said, William Thompson, a co-author of the study has admitted it was a fraud and the actual data in the study
       <strong>
        confirms that Andrew Wakefield was right.

      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;

       Andrew Wakefield never faked anything in his study, he lost his medical license because they found that he didn't conform to proper medical standards when performing the study, the actual results of the study have not been proven wrong.  In fact, there are many other peer-reviewed studies that have come to similar results, such as
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12849883">
        this one.
       </a>
       Isn't it odd that autistic children have elevated levels of measles antibodies compared to controls?
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you hear about autism, Wakefield and vaccines is essentially propaganda bullshit put out by the medical establishment to cover their tracks.  Before being demonized, Wakefield was the foremost gastroenterologist in the world and one of the few people brave enough to take on the pharmaceutical industry.  They destroyed his life and career for it.

       The term side effect isn’t clever marketing necessarily. It’s supposed to be an unintended effect of the drug that may or may not occur depending on the person. For example with opiates nausea is a listed side effect, not all people will experience nausea some will depending on the person.

       The big decline in death rates from epidemics is CORRELATED temporally with vaccine use in society. However no serious scientific study has been conducted to PROVE causality. Some scientists and doctors skeptical of big pharma have posited that the decline in communicable disease might be the result of improving hygiene and diets over the same period of time that vaccines have become commonplace. The fact is that no long term, placebo based, double blind study has ever been conducted to compare vaccinated kids to non vaccinated kids. The only studies done so far compare vaccines with toxic adjuvants (aluminum, mercury, formaldehyde, etc.) against placebos that ALSO have toxic adjuvants. So, clearly not legit to compare 1 potential poison to another.

       Like I said, I realize there are problems with certain vaccines and with certain types of people who experience issues with them. That being said, what are the real numbers on injuries or reactions? I don’t personally know of anyone that has ever had an issue despite everyone I know receiving them. I’m not saying things don’t happen I’m just saying I don’t think it’s quite as prevalent or widespread as some make it sound either.

       the majority of people who are harmed never connect it to vaccines. Only less than 1% of all adverse reactions are ever reported and long-term effects are almost never attributed to vaccination.
      </p>

       neurodevelopmental disorders are now very common, autism 1 in 30 and ADHD 1 in 10 and they are reported to be much less common in unvaccinated kids.

       This mostly shows that flu vaccines have way more claims per dose than others.

      <p>
       The point is, these incidents are less than 0 and are swept under the rug while the public are told "vaccines are great! Get yours now even if it only works 10% of the time..because it's better than nothing! "

       I also said there are problems with certain vaccines too. Like I said, I’m not saying there aren’t problems just that maybe they aren’t as frequent or widespread as some would have you believe either. That said, some vaccines are definitely worse than others, flu, hpv just to name a couple

       the opposite is true. Most people do superficial research and believe that vaccines are safe and only some do enough to realise how much damage they are doing.

       will suffer at worst a 2 week cold - with 95% being completely asymptomatic.  Those numbers are almost certainly falling as a result of vaccinating everyone...

       There are a few that I think are credible; mostly involving big business and large government. They have reasons to hide stuff , either for their own enrichment, or their own longevity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate that you may think I  contradicting myself, with big pharma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccinations aren’t an invention of big pharma; they’re an invention of science for society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that big pharma is conspiring against us: for example encouraging governments to stock anti virals for a flu pandemic; there is no scientific evidence behind that, and pharma is brainwashing governments into buying that stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bilderberg, G8 are definitely conspiring, large oil, tobacco, and technology companies very likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to conspiracies that I do not believe in: ones that ignore basic science. I don’t really mind ones that are innocent (flat earth, charm trails) as they don’t hurt anybody.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do mind anti vaxxers, as they hurt the innocent: children whose parents are misguided, and children with compromised immune systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a parent who sat on the fence who asked for advice here that pushed me to start pushing against anti vaxxers. I then spotted the pattern in the anti vaxxers posts, and I believe that there is somebody behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot comment for tigers who are pushing against anti vaxxers. For all I know Greg have been triggered by the same inane recent push of anti vaxxers

       Strange not a lot of scientific evidence vaccines help more tha hurt. Case in point they have been vaccinating since the 60's and not scientific studies have ever been done with control groups. So your comments and beliefs in vaccines almost seem like something a shill would say.

       Depending on your age, you may have been vaccinated against “smallpox”
      </p>
      <p>
       Smallpox was eradicated from planet earth thanks to the smallpox vaccine, and consistent vaccinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had anti vaxxers and reddit been around in the sixties, then smallpox (aka the red plague) would still be lingering killing people indiscriminately.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can thank foresight by your parent’s/grandparent’s generation for wiping out smallpox.
      </p>
      <p>
       Polio could have been eradicated, except for efforts by the Taliban, Boko Haram, and ISIS. Thanks to vaccines polio is wiped out everywhere except for four countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti vaxxers have kept polio alive in central Africa, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Syria.

       As economies improved smallpox greatly declined and disappeared even in countries without mass vaccination programs, something which even smallpox vaccination experts admitted privately.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vaccine didn't save us in the western world, modern life did, so no as long as we have good living condition smallpox would not be  a problem here even if we had never invented a vaccine.

       this is not true. India had the most aggressive polio vaccination campaign in the world for over 20 years. They have more polio like illness than anyone else but they hide it under the name "accute flaccid paralysis".
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes officially Polio is gone but we have huge accute flaccid paralysis epidemics.  Very clever.

       Actually none of what you said is true. Most if not all vaccines were introduced when the diseases were in decline. Even the makers of vaccines have never laid claim to "eradicating" the disease they vaccinate for because they know the science does not support it. Vaccines have the virus in it which means you can build up an immunity to it within the body (and can also be done naturally as with all contagious diseases they weaken with each new host and is why improved hygiene nutrition and sanatition were why the diseases declined) or it can cause you to contract the disease (which happens in most outbreaks and is never reported or buried by MSM) Check out Dr. John Bergman on youtube for information involving the historical, political, corporate meaderings. The legislative protection given to vaccine makers which caused a ridiculous surge of vaccines of diseases that were never prevelant. And how the driving force is profit not protection.

       Doctors don't push vaccines because "science," they push them because they get a massive fucking paycheque for doing so.  The real science published in scientific journals shows that vaccines are
       <strong>
        far, far worse

       than the pharmaceutical industry would have you believe.

       See another comment in this thread explaining smallpox. We should all feel lucky that that has been eradicated. So anti vaxxers really wish small pox would still be around killing and blinding large swathes of people?

       Wanting safer vaccines is commendable. Like any medical advance, vaccines come with a risk. A hip operation comes with a risk.  Wiping smallpox of planet earth has undoubtedly caused harm in some individuals; and if you are in that group you won’t be pleased that smallpox was being eradicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that a disparate set of people is pushing an uneducated anti vaccine campaign. One based on angst. One based on supposed toxicity of chemical elements. One based on religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, don’t let me stop you from helping designing safer vaccines. But I will respond to campaigns that I perceive to be based on misinformation.

       Companies test products for safety to minimize lawsuits. The 1986 act removed the liability from vaccine manufacturers and gave them immunity. They have no financial obligation to spend additional funding on testing for safety. The HHS was supposed to be testing vaccines since 1986 but couldn't produce any test results in the recent ICANN vs HHS lawsuit. The governing agency HHS hasn't been doing their job for 32 years. This should scare everyone!

       It’s not the vaccines I question but the recommended CDC schedule! No other country forces infants to receive so many shots at so young an age.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowadays you can’t get a pediatrician to adapt or delay the vaccination schedule, so on-the-fence parents end up not vaccinating AT ALL.

       The CDC schedule is designed so they delay the vaccine until they are statistically most likely to encounter that disease. So provided they vaccinate just before that you will stop the majority of people from getting some of these diseases (hence why you get a ton of shots as a baby but you only get the HPV shot in your early teens). It’s not a foolproof plan but it works for the vast majority of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically changing the schedule by delaying some vaccinations could put your child at the same risk as not vaccinating them at all.

       I consistently get downvoted for asking simple questions and raising simple concerns. I even claim I'm not an anti Vaxxer, but I just want more research than these half ass focus on one specific additive. We need mass data this, EVERYONE takes it, it's worth the effort!

       I commented that theres a difference between someone who 50 years ago, had 5 shots in the youth, 30 years ago had 7 or 8, now were looking at 51+ shots and pointing out autism rates are 10x higher.

       I find the vast majority of Redditors who are pro vaccine are contradtictive. If they hate the anti vaxxers so much and believe so strongly in vaccines, they should just let the antivaxxers not get vaccinated and have the "problem" take care of itself. Antivaxxers are only hurting themselves according to vaxxers logic. Also, it is impossible to achieve 85% vaccination for herd immunity to take effect. Everyone tries to force the children in schools to be vaccinated but it seems no one takes into account the staff and support individualsmgoing through the school facilities on a daily basis.

       The problem with your argument is twofold.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, anti vaxxers put their children at risk; not themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, there are people who cannot be vaccinated. Herd immunity saves those people. Anti vaxxers put their health at risk.

       Ive seen on other blackhat forums people promoting ways of getting their posts pushed to the front page of reddit. Wouldn't surprise me at all if pharma are doing this. The vaccine posts that reach the front page arent even witty or funny they are just meme type posts about anti vaxxers.

        Just makes me suspicious, why is there such a culture of "NO IT'S GOOD!!"?

      <p>
       that's really simple: PROPAGANDA
      </p>
      <p>
       A certain percentage of the population respond very well to propaganda. You can brainwash them to believe almost anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are using propaganda tactics because a lot of people are waking up and realize that the current vaccination is a giant scam run by big pharma.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are using propaganda to recruit useful idiots who will then defend big pharma's vaccine racket thinking they are doing good.

       just think about it like this: those products are among the most profitable kinds to one of the most profitable industries in america.
      </p>
      <p>
       This profit is mandated by certain requirements. Certain professions must be vaccinated. Law requires you to have children vaccinated should they need to attend public school. Every military person will be fully vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, how do you
       <em>
        increase
       </em>
       the sales on these products ( in order to generate more profit, as labor/material costs are just about as low as they can go ) ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most countries ( not US tho ) ban drug manufacturers specifically from advertising on television. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically to sum this up, these companies have a
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to make sure that people aren't spreading the conclusion that these products are harmful; this is one of the only
       <em>
        means
       </em>
       to combat a force that poses a serious threat to those profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       That "no it's good" culture is the same one that bases their entire understanding of the reality they inhabit on the Fallacy of Authority.

       Uh because the benefits of vaccination extend to other members of the society in general, hence it is something that should be actively encouraged? How is that difficult to comprehend - a vaccinated person is less likely to become ill, which makes him unproductive (an economic loss) and puts people around him at risk; therefore, it is desirable to avoid this scenario by ensuring everyone knows about the benefits of vaccination.
