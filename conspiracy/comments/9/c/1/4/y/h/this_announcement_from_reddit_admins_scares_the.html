<p>A couple of things I want to comment on immediately:</p>

<p>1 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They typically did this by posting real, reputable news articles that happened to align with Iran’s preferred political narrative -- for example, reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen. These articles would often be posted to far-left or far-right political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? They posted things they agreed with - from reputable news sources no less - to sub-reddits that may be receptive to their thoughts?</p>

<p>OH BURN THEM AT THE STAKE WILL YA!</p>

<p>It would be an interesting day when you apply this to Reddit as a whole. I&#39;d guess 100% of Reddit users will be banned within 24 hours.</p>

<p>Whatever happened to free speech? I defend free speech to the end of may days - specially the speech I disagree with.</p>

<p>2</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re investing in more advanced detection and mitigation capabilities, and have recently formed a threat detection team that has a very particular set of skills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holy smokes and mirrors, Batman! What &quot;threats&quot; (not specified actually)? This sounds very much like cold war fear &quot;them&quot; propaganda. What it amounts to is just stifling of free speech. </p>

<p>3</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our actions against these threats may not always be immediately visible to you, but this is a battle we have been fighting, and will continue to fight for the foreseeable future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again with &quot;threats&quot; without specifying it. And &quot;Reddit special team&quot; are of course the &quot;good guys&quot; fighting the &quot;good fight&quot;. Dreadful comes to mind.</p>

<p>4 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Through this investigation, the incredible vigilance of the Reddit community has been brought to light, helping us pinpoint some of the suspicious account behavior. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s like a visit from the CIA in the 1950&#39;s and 1960&#39;s asking you about someone you might have known in the past, which are suspected of being commies. Since you have nothing to hide, and you are not against the free world - aka the USofA - you will of course tell the CIA everything you know. And if you don&#39;t - Are you a commie too? What are you hiding? Who are you protecting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So when will they go after the other independently confirmed, but ideologically Reddit acceptable, accounts posting cherry picked, favorable news?</p>

<p>Reddit needs to have consistency banning everyone that fits into the very very VERY vague criteria they claim to have used (basically banning all Reddit users). Otherwise we are all in danger of being target at any time for any reason. Even worse when they apply new &quot;rules&quot; retroactively.</p>

<p>It&#39;s scary how the major social media platforms all apply shady banning practices, and all around the same time. Hmm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t giving out the methods and criteria for doing so because they want to prevent these groups from knowing the details as to how they were caught so they keep making the same mistakes over and over again. I could tell you right now what I think got Russia caught red handed in 2016 but I won&#39;t because they will adapt rather quickly to it. </p>

<p>They keep it vague because they want to ensure that the Iranians, Russians, or any other country isn&#39;t able to game their system and they lose control of something they built. Really though the structure of how social media is built needs to be fixed as it is a terrible form of democracy. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t see them getting k-lined. The <em>hidden rules</em> are clearly not applied to them. Oh, that&#39;s right, they are &quot;on our side&quot;. </p>

<p>And having a set of hidden rules screams authoritarian rule. You never know if you ever break any of them, and if you&#39;ll ever get banned. I can show you a list of places with authoritarian rule, none good.</p>

<p>Reddit admins are very aware of the dark influence by &quot; Western &quot; powers, but either chooses to ignore it, are paid to ignore it, or have been threatened to ignore it... Or a combination.</p>

<p>Can you show me hard evidence that the Iranian accounts were breaking rules (and how they were doing it exactly)? Beyond of course pointing me to the Reddit thread where Reddit admins <em>simply say this is so and we believe them without question</em>.</p>

<p>Because hey, why would they ever lie or obfuscate the truth (or indeed make the situation look favourable to their narrative)? They would never do that, I&#39;m sure.</p>

<p>One thing you guys didn&#39;t mention about black cube (company name) is that it might be a reference to either Roman decimation or freemasonry. The decimation process was a form of punishment where a group of roman soldiers would each take a stone, whoever got the black stone would be beat to death by all the others. In freemasonry (so I hear, I&#39;m not one), apparently members have to vote anonymously for new applicants, if someone puts a single black cube into the voting box, the applicant is not accepted. like I said, that&#39;s just something I heard, if anyone  is a freemason and I got the details wrong, feel free to correct me</p>

<p>So let me see if I&#39;ve got this right. If someone is trying to run an &quot;influence operation&quot; for Iran, or Russia, China etc. That&#39;s bad and it should be shut down. But if someone is doing the exact same thing for the &quot;right&quot; country... it&#39;s ok?</p>

<p>Also, what influence? I was always under the impression that reddit isn&#39;t a national website that&#39;s owned by any one nation. </p>

<p>People come here from all over the world. They join so they can express their opinions and post their own content. To me, it seems perfectly normal that users from one nation (e.g. Iran) would tend to express similar viewpoints and have a shared narrative.</p>

<p>So you could argue that this was an influence op that got shut down. But you might also argue that this is reddit acting on behalf of US/Israeli interests to shut down a competing narrative.</p>

<p>The following part in particular was also markedly Orwellian:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, the volume of user reports we’ve received has highlighted the opportunity to enhance our defenses by developing a <strong>trusted reporter system</strong> to better separate useful information from the noise, which is something we are working on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guess what? They will be developing a trusted reporter system! The <em>Reddit Thought Police ™</em>. Does anyone else see any parallels with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK4QtiPhTRQ">YouTube Heroes</a> here? (what I linked is a satire video, but for those that don&#39;t know, yes this was absolutely real - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlHY7oMYrHM">the original YouTube Heroes video</a> ).</p>

<p>Reddit is literally turning into a massive intelligence agency operation right before our very eyes. Sometimes I wonder whether agencies like the CIA or other governmental or corporate entities simply threaten and extort the makers of these platforms that start small and become influental if they don&#39;t adhere to certain rules, which always include massive surveillance and censorship. This is the case with Facebook, Google...Reddit is in many ways already there, but it still seems to be getting worse. </p>

<p>Did the Reddit owners sell out or were they forced to sell-out? You could think of them as bad people that willingly did this for their own benefit and the benefit of the advertisers, but who knows what kind of threats and harassment are going on behind the curtains...</p>

<p>Neither the announcement or the article it links state the move was made against paid shills. The apparent motive was to tackle accounts deemed to have a moderate likelyhood of being inauthentic.

<p>So <em>why</em> are they banning accounts? It&#39;s not made clear <em>at all</em> besides the <em>&quot;They typically did this by posting real, reputable news articles that happened to align with Iran’s preferred political narrative&quot;</em></p>

<p>Where did you get &quot;Government sponsored&quot;? Or did you just fill in a blank by yourself since you <em>expected</em> it? That is quite the interesting leap you did there. In fact, both Reddit and FireEye uses language to specifically NOT mention anything about any Government. Also, the language used by Reddit (and FireEye) is very vague - &quot;suspected&quot; and &quot;we believe&quot; for example. Not &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;confirmed&quot; etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who is in a better position to spot these sock puppets and shills than the admins?</p>

<p>But they <em>didn&#39;t</em> spot them. An outside source did. And Reddit only reacted to protect their incomes. Or are you saying FireEye is a Reddit organization?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Where is the proof of that? The only thing they have said is that they have been posting news from reputable sources. Very much in line with how Reddit is being used minute to minute, hour by hour, day by day, by literally million upon millions of people.</p>

<p>And finally you link to a previous thread of mine. What is the purpose of linking it? I&#39;m not advocating censorship, just organization. Are you trying to confuse trying to organize <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> into a better resource with censorship? Barking up the wrong tree, in an entirely wrong forest there buddy.</p>

<p>The only way to confirm it 100% is for those behind the accounts to admit it and provide proof. Everything else is based on confidence in the available evidence.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>But they didn&#39;t spot them. An outside source did</p>

<p>An outside source linked them all together. Several accounts were already banned:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than a third (51 accounts) were banned prior to the start of this investigation as a result of our routine trust and safety practices, supplemented by user reports</p>

<p>Admins are in the best position to find these accounts because they have access to information the public doesn&#39;t. They just need the resources and motivation to act...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit only reacted to protect their incomes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. That&#39;s how it almost always is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or are you saying FireEye is a Reddit organization?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>no.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is the proof of that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Admin reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>part of threat detection is not showing your hand to those trying to manipulate the platform, while balancing disclosing examples which can help to educate everyone on things to look out for. We can&#39;t disclose all of the technical indicators we used to identify some of these accounts, and without those it won&#39;t be that helpful to list the accounts themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that kind of leaves people hanging. Here&#39;s a simple example of using a sock puppet to ban evade so they can keep submitting their domain to this subreddit:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For the domains listed in the Fireeye report, this was the most active account on this subreddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/peterjackson2050/">https://www.reddit.com/user/peterjackson2050/</a></p></li>
<li><p>That account was banned here <code>2017-11-29 17:50:20+00:00</code> for spamming links to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/domain/usjournal.net/">https://www.reddit.com/domain/usjournal.net/</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/peterjackson205/">https://www.reddit.com/user/peterjackson205/</a> began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7pxoqw/documents_detail_plan_for_civil_unrest_and/">submitting</a> the same domain here on <code>2018-01-12</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s a simple example. An analysis of the other accounts would take its own thread.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very much in line with how Reddit is being used minute to minute, hour by hour, day by day, by literally million upon millions of people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that refutes any claims that they were banned for their political opinions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thousands of innocent civilians being killed by US Weapons isn&#39;t a political opinion, its a fact. Saudi Arabia have bombed entire weddings by mistake, more than once. </p>

<p>There is a reason why the US classifies its civilian casualtie numbers and Reddit is going after these 150 Iranian accounts who have posted a few true news stories rather than the hundreds of thousands of IDF, US, Saudi and PR firms that make sure any comments, posts or anything that would resemble a discussion involving truth and human compassion is buried instantly. </p>

<p>America spends over six hundred million dollars annually on propaganda. You are waving the flag for ending government sponsored site manipulation, when if anything this is just a continuation of it. Rather than going after the worst offenders of government sponsored manipulation they are going after somebody who they haven&#39;t even linked to anyone yet. </p>

<p>there biggest crime, as far as I am aware, is posting stories that they were actively burying, because its  pretty hard to justify giving Israel billions of dollars in tax payer funded weapons when they are using them to shoot unarmed protesters in the back as they flee, and the medics when they come to assist them...</p>

<p>Americans are inundated with something trying to influence their opinions every minute from burger king advertisements to news paper articles designed to shape your narrative. Don&#39;t you think that its more important for the American public to have access to all the news articles even if some are fake and allow them to choose for themselves rather than allowing groups who are supressing news stories to continue unabated while they attack a small group of Iranians who the best evidence against them so far is they have an iranian phone number and posted some articles about what&#39;s happening in Yemen. </p>

<p>And one that uses its power more. Too many scandals hit the news that we all collectively flip out over, but let pass in a few days when the next outrage happens. But remember when we were more political in the past? Especially with net neutrality things. Or other sitewide efforts like that pixel art experiment.</p>

<p>You always see banners on wikipedia asking for money. Why don&#39;t we get more banners for awareness for causes that the vast majority of users agree on? We spent so much time tearing each other apart over the stupidest things that we forgot we could build incredible things with little to no cost or effort. Like a million man march online.</p>

<p>Even here. I know we have our posts of the week. But what if we took a couple more steps forward and voted weekly on a topic that genuinely needed looking at? And perhaps avenues for getting results - links to email reps, donate to organizations that fight the injustice or maybe a mass petition to be delivered to the party that would be most likely to act. We could even track them on the sidebar. Imagine if news or politics kept meta posts on the sidebar for updates and status of say Trump or Clinton cronies, removed once convicted or exonerated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An interesting website that does a lot of activism, creates petitions and has a pretty remarkably high success rate (especially when it comes to environmental issues and animal welfare, but many times also issues related to people) is <a href="http://www.Avaaz.org">www.Avaaz.org</a> </p>

<p>Check out their site for success stories, they are pretty good at what they do (currently seated at about 45 million members). A good example of how influential they&#39;ve become is the fact that Monsanto is currently battling them in court, because their activism helped stop a lot of the Monsanto/Bayer bullshit that was cropping up in Europe. I even gave them a small donation for their court fees, as they are an organization that lives off of donations.</p>

<p>Yes there are some issues they are petitioning that I do not support, but the majority of their stuff is great.</p>

<p>I think they are a pretty good example of what activism over the Internet can be, when it&#39;s done right. </p>

<p>“In 2016, reddit launched an ambitious campaign with select “partners” to control the narrative and mold public perception in order to influence the outcome of the presidential election. However, even limited free speech was able to foil our efforts. Thus, we must double down before the important midterm elections of 2018. If we determine that brigading, vote manipulation, harassment, and/or astroturfing are not sufficient to counter certain news stories or ideas, then we will resort to more extreme measures to ensure that only approved talking points remain on our platform.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems that any website, corporation,.... that truly makes it or has the potential to make it somehow gets compromised along the way... I wonder whether Reddit was meant to turn out like this from the get go, or whether they simply attack the most influential players and companies first and make them do their bidding (by them I am referring to various political, corporate and intelligence interests and players).</p>

<p>I honestly think Reddit was created in good spirit, but it has been destroyed over the years from within and without. Slowly the takeover is becoming totally apparent to all, even those with their head 3 feet under the sand.</p>

<p>The whole point of Reddit. Why we are all even here, is to democratically select news and information to push narratives up from the bottom. The reason we&#39;re on the worldwide web is to expose ourselves to ideas far and wide, god forbid even those from other countries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with those of you saying that it&#39;s about controlling what information is put out there and what spin it has (IE: Genocide in Yemen). But this is also about demonizing Iran as part of a larger <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw">plan to regime change Iran</a> just like we&#39;ve been trying in Syria.</p>

<p>If you look at the general attitudes in the_Donald and greatawakening you&#39;ll find people are somewhat primed for a war with Iran. The pallets of money Obama sent has them convinced that Iran is part of some deep state puppetry that Trump is working against in 3D chess.</p>

<p>The reality is that Saudi Arabia is a terrorist state more-so than Iran and we are actively aiding and abetting them as they massacre Yemeni people. The same goes for Israel as this sub seems well aware.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So why are they banning accounts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For using sock puppets to submit their own domains and astroturf. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They were banned for using Reddit as intended.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. They were banned for masking their source and trying to manipulate the site.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Where did you get &quot;Government sponsored&quot;? Or did you just fill in a blank by yourself since you expected it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a good point. I concede I did fill that in myself, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s much of a leap.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, the language used by Reddit (and FireEye) is very vague - &quot;suspected&quot; and &quot;we believe&quot; for example. Not &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;confirmed&quot; etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only way to confirm it 100% is for those behind the accounts to admit it and provide proof. Everything else is based on confidence in the available evidence.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>But they didn&#39;t spot them. An outside source did</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An outside source linked them all together. Several accounts were already banned:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than a third (51 accounts) were banned prior to the start of this investigation as a result of our routine trust and safety practices, supplemented by user reports</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Admins are in the best position to find these accounts because they have access to information the public doesn&#39;t. They just need the resources and motivation to act...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit only reacted to protect their incomes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. That&#39;s how it almost always is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or are you saying FireEye is a Reddit organization?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>no.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is the proof of that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Admin reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>part of threat detection is not showing your hand to those trying to manipulate the platform, while balancing disclosing examples which can help to educate everyone on things to look out for. We can&#39;t disclose all of the technical indicators we used to identify some of these accounts, and without those it won&#39;t be that helpful to list the accounts themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that kind of leaves people hanging. Here&#39;s a simple example of using a sock puppet to ban evade so they can keep submitting their domain to this subreddit:</p>

<ul>
