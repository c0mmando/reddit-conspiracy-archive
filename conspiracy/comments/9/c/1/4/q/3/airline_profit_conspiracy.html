I’ve seen tons of videos talking all about the science of why you can’t fly west but it’s honestly just a bunch of bs. You’re telling me if the president has an emergency situation that arises in Tokyo and he is currently in CA, he can’t take Air Force One and fly directly there in a matter of hours? There’s no way that is even possible, the distance is extremely shorter and even with the rotation of the earth you’d still cover a 1000 mile distance going west faster than a 4000 mile distance going east.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting question! Here&#39;s what I found
The reason for the difference is an atmospheric phenomena known as the jet stream. The jet stream is a very high altitude wind which always blows from the West to the East across the Atlantic. The planes moving at a constant air speed thus go faster in the West-East direction when they are moving with the wind than in the opposite direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! This is what I’m saying. How is there a magical force that makes me go slower going one direction instead of another? With that logic, driving from LA to NY should be faster than driving from NY to LA since I’m going 1600mph faster easy right? Doesn’t make any damn sense.</p>

<p>Why can a plane fly from the UK to the Caribbean no problem but a plane won’t fly from la to japan? Does this magical jet stream start and stop where ever it is convenient for the government to say it starts and stops?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hate to say it as will get shot down in flames, but the flat earth model would answer your question. I am not saying its right but it explains an awful lot when it comes to flights. By the way I have been in the travel trade since 88 and there are an awful lot of flights that exist in theory but you cant actually book them. If you do manage to book one it will then be re-scheduled via an intermediate point.</p>

<p>An example would be Santiago to Johannesburg. Would be routed via Europe or Middle East even though it may show as a direct flight. It isnt</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting! The main reason I’m asking all of this is I’ve often seen flights that seem to go out of their way to not fly west. I do know that some flights fly west, obviously. Flights from the eastern US to western US fly west all of the time. But my main question is do some airlines go out of their way to not fly west simply to extend their profits. Seems totally reasonable considering how many other things in this society are done purely for profit despite them being inefficient or outdated </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps, but staying in the air is more expensive to the airline as they need to pay for the crew, fuel, and maintenance. They also charge a fixed amount so they aren’t making any more money by flying longer. </p>

<p>Imo this would be plausible if the ticket fee was dynamic like uber, otherwise it makes more sense to get to the destination and pick up another set of passengers as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>I have a friend that is a commercial pilot and he confided in me that his airline pushes him to fill with less fuel than he estimates to save costs which is also counter indicative to this theory although this is one airline out of many. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. </p>

<p>There’re two reasons. </p>

<p>If you want to go due west and you are halfway up the globe (say Boston to Portland), then it is shorter to fly a bit north first. Buy a globe, pull a piece of string between Boston and Portland, and the shortest route isn’t due west.  Similar the other direction, and on the Southern Hemisphere you will go south. </p>

<p>Second, prevailing winds are west in medium latitudes of the northern hemisphere, so it can be faster to go a bit north first if you must go west. Flights from Europe to the US fly far north, flights in the other direction go a bit less far as the tail wind helps them. </p>

<p>Hope that helps. </p>
