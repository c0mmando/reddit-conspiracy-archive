    <div class="md"><p>For me, hollow earth means a massive cave system thats somehow heated maybe by underground hot springs. Cave systems have been found with clouds and plants in them. My personal theory is that the entrance to this underground oasis in the middle of Antarctica was discovered a long time ago, and the governments of the world agreed to hide it from the pubic, to keep as a final place to retreat to if the whole world goes to shit. The planet is obviously not hollow, it’s just the term that caught on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s circumstantial evidence at best.</p>

<p>The &quot;best&quot; evidence for HE in my opinion is what the Nazis did in Antarctica. KGB recovered some maps from them that discuss an entrance to the hollow Earth. They also had New Swabia there in the same location that the HE map supposedly said the entrance was. On top of that, if you look at a map of <a href="https://img-purch-com.cdn.ampproject.org/ii/w1200/s/img.purch.com/rc/560x315/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA1NS80Nzkvb3JpZ2luYWwvQW50YXJjdGljTGFrZXMuanBn">subglacial lakes and rivers in Antarctica</a>, you can see some where New Swabia and the supposed entrance to the HE is.</p>

<p>The map has inconsistencies though, for example the depth required to reach the entrance was deeper than the crush depth of known u-boats at the time of the maps creation, so it requires a belief that the Nazis had sub technology that we havent acknowledged.</p>

<p>Like i said, circumstantial and definitely doesnt prove the Earth is hollow but it&#39;s fun and it&#39;s there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.imperialgermans.com/images/maphollowearth.png">This</a> is the section, the date is mentioned at the bottom. Translated, it reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Printed for the Military Navy in an edition of 1300 copies at the special laboratory of the KZ Dachau. January 1944.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The entrance is supposedly 400m underwater according to the maps coordinates, and as far as i know the crush depth of subs back then wasn&#39;t even 300m as far as we were aware. 400m is pretty deep even for modern subs aside from our nuke subs</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about hollow earth as such, but I definitely think that the poles of all planets are significant to understanding the way that planetary energy works, (using pseudo scientific terms here) Obviously the poles have a higher (?) concentration of magnetic energy, it&#39;s where you can view the auroras... planets like jupiter and saturn have crazy storms concentrating at the poles, maybe it&#39;s something to do with large celestial bodies operating toroidally? (Again another dodger term lol) I think that theres something going on at the poles for sure, dunno what though..</p>

I&#39;m not suggesting it&#39;s genuine, I&#39;m just pointing out you made a baseless claim. Nazism was steeped in occultism, they sent a team of scientists into Tibet when it was all but impenetrable to research Aryan origin, they searched for the holy grail, claimed the spear of destiny, named their intercontinental rockets after a mystical form of energy known as Vril  (the V rockets) that came from a book about advanced *underground* civilizations that was incorporated into the ideology of an occult society influential on the inception of Nazism, and you&#39;re saying common sense records of the hollow earth were just a disinformation campaign? My common sense says otherwise, that they were genuinely interested and looking for some kind of entrance (irrespective of whether it actually exists).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t though, because you&#39;re making a baseless claim. Why would a map to the Hollow Earth divert WWII interests? If it&#39;s common sense for it to be disinfo, why would anyone, Russia or the Allies, even consider it? Why would Nazi Germany even try? </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it make much more sense, if they wanted to divert attention from Europe, to say that there was a major Nazi stronghold in a country empathetic to Nazi beliefs? Say, Argentina?</p>

<p>Logically, trying to divert allied forces to Antarctica doesn&#39;t make any sense in a WWII context, and beyond that, why would the KGB try to persuade the USA that the Nazi&#39;s had found a hollow Earth entrance during the Cold War if the KGB actually made the map?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theories are not established facts. Theories are attempts to explain certain phenomena by using known cause-effect relationships and applying them to the given circumstances.<br/>
Good theories are ones which manage to explain the phenomena with as few or no contradicting data points as possible. The vast majority of theories are not absolute established facts. They&#39;re just models that work at the time with the respective measurements and observations. Usually these work for a time until too many contradictory data points accumulate, at which point a new theory is put forward which manages to explain both the previously explained data points as well as the contradictory ones. Old theories very replaced by new theories constantly.<br/>
I&#39;m not denying that evolution is a real process. I&#39;m simply saying that regardless of your feelings it&#39;s still, and always will be, a theory. It&#39;s a theory that works, but it&#39;s still a theory.</p>

<p>You can still believe in God and not rely entriely on the Bible for your map of the world. </p>

<p>There are many flaws it in amongst some beautiful ideas. Those flaws which have been proven to be false many times over by many different independent sources (for no monetary gain, even at the expense of their lives in a few instances) paint a pretty clear picture that the book is not absolutely correct.</p>

<p>So instead of getting into arguments defending very poor points. Realise that everyone else is trying to figure out the universe not defend a flawed map because it feels right. You can still be moral, you can still be building a proud safe society and believe it or not you can still have a very deep relationship with the universe(god).</p>

<p>Hopefully you can take this from a fellow Q supporter. </p>

<p>In this modern age of plentiful free (and yes occasionally fraudulent) information there is no excuse to not research both sides of every belief you hold. Some like the Turin shroud are mind boggling. Other like evolution are pretty clear cut. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you be more specific with the terms &quot;Science and physics&quot; as that&#39;s a very broad statement. My comment wasn&#39;t intended to support the theory the HE belief (as it is understood), as it was to question your statement about the truth being boring because it is known and therefore mundane. &#39;Science&#39; doesn&#39;t know the truth about many many things, what it has are the most well substantiated theories to explain a given phenomena. However as is continuously demonstrated throughout history, scientific conventions can be disrupted and replaced almost immediately by new discoveries and transform fundamental elements of the preceding theory (take the journey of physics from Newtonian, to relativistic then onto Quantum). So what is &quot;true&quot; today, in terms of scientific knowledge and expertise, can be completely dissolved into more evolved theories as understanding develops. </p>

<p>There are massive subterranean caverns and interconnecting passages that exist throughout the world surrounded by sources of geothermal energy, lava, minerals and water. An occult explanation of the Hollow Earth is impossible to resolve with scientific understanding, however the possibility of widespread and developed life cannot even be properly investigated with current technology let alone understood and there are precedents for advanced life to exist without (sun)light at the bottom of the oceans (feeding off and around geothermal vents. Who really knows what&#39;s happening 100km under the surface.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has been shown by the delay and the limits of the spread of seismic waves that the earth is not hollow..also, the force of gravity causes matter to be condensed into as dense a form as possible so  it would cause the earth&#39;s surface to implode into a smaller, denser sphere if the center of the earth was not made up of dense rock/magma.

The fact is no one has been able to travel to the inner earth or measure how gravity works there, we have theories (based on our current level of scientific comprehension) but none of this is particularly relevant to the actual point of my statement anyway (which oddly you support re: your statements about DUMB’s and possibly underground highways) which is that it appears to be feasible that life can be supported underground (making somewhere like Antarctica an ideal place to do so) regardless of the nature of the inner earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Utter bullshit. <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;amp;objectid=3539491">Jon Johanson, an Australian pilot tried to fly across Antarctica a few years ago and no one shot him down.</a> He had to land on the ice because he didn&#39;t take enough fuel, but he wasn&#39;t killed or locked up. If you want to and have the money, you can copy him and fly across Antarctica as much as you want. The Antarctic Treaty bans military activity in Antarctica and military personnel and equipment may only be used for peaceful purposes, so no one will shoot you down.</p>
