<p>And that&#39;s not even getting into the pan-global beliefs in angels, demons, the end times, and similar extremely intrusive phenomena that should&#39;ve been quite definitely recorded long ago. </p>

<p>Skepticism demanding evidence dates back thousands of years, yet even the ancient Greeks and the Abbasid arabs and the whathaveyou&#39;s (all freed from modern sensibilities and pollutants) all treated the supernatural like a parable or &quot;something that happens over there in the ill-defined other places&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps there&#39;s more to the ancient spellcrafts of the illuminat and pals? Maybe they attempt to guide mass consciousness with their symbols and ritual that seem to be of great importance to the secret orders today. I reccommend not watching much TV either way.
It would be lost when the mass consciousness is disturbed into a point of fractured identity, Like war, child sacrifice, plague, ect.
Also magik shit happens every day, healers are all over but they mostly lie low because they know what world we&#39;re living in, get me?
It seems to be difficult to do the holy grail of conscious powers, active manifest materializations.  But &quot;miraculous&quot; things happen all the, whether or not we pay attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&gt;Like war, child sacrifice, plague, ect.</p>

<p>All these things were even more common in the average life of humans past, and in some (very imaginative and explicitly supernatural) belief systems, they were an integral part to the functioning of the spiritual world. The Aztecs boasted an intricate super-society and an extremely vast pantheon of spirits, demons, ghosts, and gods: and one of their most important activities is the ritualized dismemberment and slaughter of other human beings, men and women and children.</p>

<p>Frankly, this all seems pretty convenient. The supernatural is real and rife, yet near the advent of skeptical thought and methods of recording phenomena it suddenly disappears?  The fact that we have to introduce &quot;well, there has to be a STRONGER ill-minded magical force in the works&quot; should throw up some red flags...</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve looked into the maybe truth of the 4 various potential &quot;Atlantises&quot;  I have found that the idea of several advanced, psychic in my lense, civilizations have come and gone and we have only really revealed the last snapshot of humanity. Essentially we have the creative works that are retellings of cultural pieces from these ancient societies.
Ancient flood event is one datapoint to look at, There are countless retold versions of a great flood, all the way back to Gilgamesh, and also solid geoweathering patterns that support the existence of an actual megaflood.
The most modern version with Noah cannot possibly be literally true, but if you account for creative metaphors warping the verbage over time, perhaps the symbols like &quot;2 of every animal&quot; were metaphor humans of the time could grasp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a terrible analogy. All mathematics is is another way to express laws that we observe in the universe. It doesn&#39;t explain why the universe does things or behaves the way it does. Did humans create math our has it always existed and we just discover it as we go ?The other aspect of mathematics is that you can learn it, memorize it, create formulas etc.</p>

<p>Imagination on the other hand...no one can truly tell you what it is and if they claim they can they&#39;d be lying. How can a painting affect you? How can a song move you to tears or feelings of elation?  Is it an amalgamation of your experiences that you harness to bring it forth? Has it always existed and somehow manifests through you to humanity?</p>

<p>So I ask you now...are these really the same?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is one person good at math and another not? Why does one person excel in some fields of academia and fail in others while a different person does the opposite? Just because math is a way to interpret the observable laws of the universe doesn&#39;t mean everyone is equally capable of it.</p>

<p>If you want to get into some really odd math stuff, look up the history of &#39;0&#39; as not all civilizations had it. Hell, not all civilizations worked with base 10 numerals. This stuff varies just as much as the arts you are ascribing the header of &#39;Imagination&#39;.</p>

<p>Also, Similar to the mathematical ability, different people respond to art or music differently. Some people find certain paintings to be deep and meaningful while others see those same paintings as just a bunch of random lines of paint. Likewise, some people listen to music for the lyrics while others not only don&#39;t care about them, but often don&#39;t even pay attention to them.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t even going into the fact that you can outright be wrong when it comes to art or music. There are literally entire schools devoted to teaching people how to create various types of art. There are rules on which color combinations are right or wrong for a piece. You can find entire sections in bookstores full of books teaching you how to create art. Plus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_notation">you most definitely have formulas when it comes to music</a>.</p>

<p>Imagination is just a word for the measure of a person&#39;s creativity. A facet of their personality and a result of their brain running its standard OS. To ask where does a person&#39;s imagination goes when they die is the same as asking what happened to the MSPaint program on a laptop after it got dropped into the ocean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the in-depth response. </p>

<p>People have different strengths and weaknesses. I think one reason why certain people excel at certain disciplines is because they have an inborn and inherent talent and interest in said subject. I don&#39;t see how that is a correlation to imagination.</p>

<p>As for the your history of &quot;zero&quot; example I would argue that it is just different ways to say the same thing. Once again I don&#39;t really think it correlates to imagination but that&#39;s just my opinion.</p>

<p>Of course people respond differently to different types of music or art. That&#39;s why I could like classical and you could like rock music or vice versa. You could feel the intent of the painter or feel the sadness of a piece of music. That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m saying....the same can&#39;t be said for math. I&#39;ve never had a math problem or equation evoke any emotional response in me other than getting it correct on a test.</p>

<p>I totally disagree with your assumption that art or music can be wrong. If it is &quot;created&quot; by someone, who&#39;s to say that it is right or wrong? Who&#39;s the judge of that? Once again, if you need to be told how to create art I would argue it&#39;s not coming from a place of true imagination. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not good but it&#39;s just different from being an imaginative expression in the truest sense of the word.</p>

<p>If someone can copy a Monet almost perfectly, where is the imagination...he who&#39;ll created the original or he who can replicate it?</p>

<p>I get the feeling that you believe that imagination and consciousness are a result of brain function. I&#39;m the exact opposite, I believe the brain is more of an antenna to creativity and consciousness. I believe imagination is one aspect of the consciousness that makes up everything we see.</p>

<p>Your imagination goes back to the source from which it always was part of when you cease to exist on this plane...MSpaint sits on a hard drive at the bottom of the ocean forever.</p>

<p>I mean, if that&#39;s the way you see it, we&#39;ll never actually agree and at best agree to disagree. </p>

<p>Thus, the only real thing I think can still be debated is whether art can be wrong. To that, I point towards the fact that instruments must be tuned and the existence of musical dissonance. If you disagree that those are examples of wrongness, then I do not believe we will ever agree on that subject either, though.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the &quot;god&quot; of the bible is any more valid than anything else people claim to be &quot;god&quot; in any other holy book or text. It&#39;s just the personification of an idea that is greater than us.</p>

<p>Now a question for you...what is your definition of &quot;god&quot;?</p>

It is composed of those  whose intellectual and spiritual perceptions have revealed to them that civilization has a Secret Destiny— secret,  I say, because this high purpose is not realized by the many; the great masses of peoples still live along without  any knowledge whatsoever that they are part of a Universal Motion in time and space. &quot; - Manly P.

<p>It seems so dumb but just stand back for a second. Isn&#39;t this the world we&#39;re living in? Our government leaders nothing but backstabbers and out for their own gain? </p>

<p>Then we get down to stuff like this. The &quot;gate&quot; through which all knowledge is stored. In the anime, the equivalent exchange for a peak at the gate was Ed&#39;s leg. We know equivalenct exchange is real - i don&#39;t know where I&#39;m going with this. I believe there must be true magicks and psychic abilities and so many books destroyed at the library of Alexandria, so much hidden in the Vatican. </p>

<p>The Bible outlaws magic - why would it even need that if magic in one form or another didn&#39;t exist? Why do ancient tales talk of wizards and warlocks? </p>

<p>I guess for me it all comes down to this - there&#39;s knowledge that very powerful people have access to and are experimenting with what&#39;s real, what&#39;s possible, and if anything worked to begin with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone that has had many mystical/spiritual experiences (and interacted in many way with what you could call subtle planes, as well as know and have shared experiences with many individuals that have done the same) and have been engaged in these practices for quite a long time now, I&#39;d say the reason we are so out of tune with Life is far more than simply poisoned food and water. </p>

<p>If you engage in practices that are meditative in their nature, if you let go of your mental fog, if you place your intention into experiencing these states and uncovering your own latent psychic abilities, you can always do so, even in modern times, even with water and food that might not be perfect. Yes, I have noticed it in myself, what you eat and drink and generally your body health has quite a relation to your connection with the subtle realms and the ever-present Divine Source, but I would say these are not the main factors in one&#39;s spiritual evolution.</p>

<p>If you choose to grow spiritually, if you choose to rest deeper in the fundamental peace and freedom or reality, found in the stillness and silence of the Now, you can do so even in modern times. Yes it is harder, because of toxic external influences, this is true (obviously all physical components of our reality, from various forms of pollution, to unhealthy food, &quot;poisoned&quot; water, EM waves....have a subtle component to them and influence the subtle spheres of you and reality), so you are right in that sense,  but I&#39;d say the difference between now and back then is not only this, but also the beliefs and life style, where people did not outright reject the metaphysical properties of our Cosmos and would thus be more inclined to venture into spiritual exploration from a very young age. </p>

<p>In some ways they were more primitive, but in this way they were more advanced. Now we have totally neglected the subtle aspects of reality by attempting to master the physical domain. But doing so has made us unhappy and out of tune with Life, thus also without compassion, empathy, freedom, wisdom and peace. We can regain this fundamental unity and humanity, based on what I&#39;ve been seeing is doing exactly this, but slowly. I see many more people are engaging in meditation, the mystical traditions from east and west are spreading, people are interested in the subtle aspects of our reality, even science is exploring this, especially through disciplines like quantum physics. </p>

<p>People desire to experience the Life, the Peace that is ever-present, found in stillness of Now, of Being. Everyone can do this, you simply have to be curious, practice and explore. Believe nothing, soon you will come to your own conclusions whether these experiencing are merely synapses firing in your brain, or whether they are not of the body, but beyond, rooted in Being.</p>

I agree, and I guess when I got into the swing, and felt where we are I was so disappointed in how much progress we have as a wold to make before this species can be in my opinion healthy, and let my spiritual practices slip a bit.

    <div class="md"><p>This is an excellent post. You hit the nail on the head with just about everything you said. I have recently started to meditate and have seen a difference already. Within the past 2 weeks there have been about half a dozen syncronicities that I have noticed pertaining to my personal journey.</p>

<p>Now some people would say that&#39;s rubbish but it holds meaning to each individual. Something small or inconsequential to me could be a revelation to another. I&#39;m becoming convinced that the universe talks back to us if we have the eyes to see it. </p>

<p>The problem is that it is so opposite of what most of us were raised to believe or taught by society as a whole. Think of it like this...or societal programming is so entrenched in out mind it&#39;s almost like a sub-routine always running in the background of our mind. That goes for religious beliefs, where we were born in this world, what we were taught in school...basically everything.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of internal work to recognize it and courage to be able to give it up and clear it out once one identifies it. Once you do, it is the most liberating and incredible feeling...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree completely.</p>

<p>Synchronicities are actually constantly happening, since the Cosmos, from a metaphysical perspective, is totally intertwined on a subtle level and works in unity. Because of this, when we become more aware, we see how our thought influence our reality and how our reality and others influence us. The Cosmos is a co-creation of magnanimous proportions by all the beings in it and the one Beingness that contains all. 
Once it is realized that reality is a thought created hologram created by consciousness, it is more easily understood why it works the way it does, how it can be bent, how synchronicities happen, how all is intertwined on the subtle level.... all of these things can be experienced by us all and I am convinced that slowly even mainstream science will be able to objectively prove these things. But this matter little in your personal journey, you do not need science to prove to you that you can be free now - you just have to take the leap and allow yourself to experience the freedom and peace now :) </p>

<p>Though as you said, it requires a lot of courage, truly a lot, as we all venture into unknown territory - with that I could not agree more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my <em>opinion</em> (inb4 &quot;proof?&quot; &quot;source?&quot;), cutting out fluoride can allow you to reach the astral world and other planes of existence through meditation, at least much easier. Fluoride covers your pineal gland, which means you can&#39;t see through it when you meditate. The pineal gland is a very simple eye, it has a photo-receptor (it helps regulate sleep/wake cycles by seeing light), which <em>may</em> be able to see more of the electromagnetic spectrum than your two regular eyes. As you said, the wifi and other pollution may cloud the sight of the third eye as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evidence I&#39;ve accumulated for this has been built up over time, Baba Vanga was a psychic who figures like Hitler went to personally visit. Read into her story and see what you learn.
She is but one datapoint in this hypothesis, and she demonstrates perhaps one avenue seldom taken to uncovering latent power.
She was blinded in a tornado and her lack of psysical sight caused her to focus on her nonphysical eye.
She is an example of what I think we all could have been at one point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So apparently this Baba Vanga figure is quite controversial her predictions tend to be vague, new ones are still being published by her followers and her famous 911 prophesy was made in the year the Berlin wall fell. Its funny how all these prophesies never prevent said events from happening. Or is that what happens when a prophesy fails to come true? The plot thickens indeed.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t really see how this has anything to do with eating healthy and besides, eating healthy food won&#39;t bring you any closer to communicating psychically..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True not everything she predicted panned out for us the way she saw it, I&#39;m personally a believer that the timewave is fluid, and just because you see a timeline does not guarrentee it&#39;s occurance here.
It&#39;s certainly complex, the avenues of imagimation and psycommunication are interrelated, some things in the mind are more symbollic than literalphysical.
Food for thought, Rasputen is another contemporaryish mystical figures with more than a few odd stories coming from his life. He is a good datapoint because his oddness was under scruteny at the time, and his position near monarchs made his doings quite journalized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well its not just things in the mind that are symbolical, what about ancient stories and fairytales? They sure don&#39;t describe the world as we live it, but the lessons learned from them are truths we rely on every single day. So then if the mystic abilities of people like Rasputin, Baba Vanga, etc. Are more or less symbolical than what lessen do we learn from it? And why are some people adamant in their belief that these abilities are real, as in physically real real?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tad late here so prolly just talking to OP...</p>

<p>There is so much math encoded in these ancient megaliths.  When I expose this to &quot;normies&quot; I often get the &quot;How did they measure it?&quot; question.  I usually sidestep the question.  My hunch is they didn&#39;t.  They were so in tune they either just asked some astral entity during a DMT trip (self-produced or not) or knew/felt/understood ratios and natural math that they could easily figure it out.</p>

<p>Blavatsky, I think, says yoga was initially developed to help our ethereal selves learn the physical.  Now we are so physical, yoga is used as a mere physical practice (in the West) or at best as a way to awaken the spiritual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree completely.</p>

<p>Synchronicities are actually constantly happening, since the Cosmos, from a metaphysical perspective, is totally intertwined on a subtle level and works in unity. Because of this, when we become more aware, we see how our thought influence our reality and how our reality and others influence us. The Cosmos is a co-creation of magnanimous proportions by all the beings in it and the one Beingness that contains all. 
Once it is realized that reality is a thought created hologram created by consciousness, it is more easily understood why it works the way it does, how it can be bent, how synchronicities happen, how all is intertwined on the subtle level.... all of these things can be experienced by us all and I am convinced that slowly even mainstream science will be able to objectively prove these things. But this matter little in your personal journey, you do not need science to prove to you that you can be free now - you just have to take the leap and allow yourself to experience the freedom and peace now :) </p>

<p>Though as you said, it requires a lot of courage, truly a lot, as we all venture into unknown territory - with that I could not agree more.</p>
