       Does anyone find it a bit weird how a man who is a huge threat to the fossil fuel industry can go from being beloved and pretty much the second coming on reddit to the human punching bag of reddit?  This all seemed to happen over the course of a week or two. I'm just hoping to see this discussed a little bit in the comments. I know its probably a dumb connection.

       It would be better if got all of the bugs out of his ideas before peddling them to world as if he already had and he's done as much damage to his own credibility that way which has left him wide-open to personal attacks that many people are inclined to believe because of it.

       He made one mistake. He alluded to the Reality of the glue that binds the entire Elite apparatus together when he called out the Thai cave diver as a Pedo, and refused to back down on that, doing so again just the other day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds quite random, but when you look into the incident you'll see it was far more than meets the eye. The reasons those kids were in the cave, the reason they were rescued,
       <em>
        who
       </em>
       rescued them, and of course Elon's role and what he knew of the incident.
      </p>

       He fucked with forces far greater than himself and they're trying to put him in his place.

       I feel that the Thai joke/insult was fuel for the fire.  I tend to think he really made his enemies when he attacked the media establishment by saying he was going to make a rating system for journalists.... Which is a great idea.

       The switch on Musk opinion has been a long time coming, even if it just hit you more recently.
       <a href="/r/EnoughMuskSpam">

       </a>
       has been around for a decent while, and ever since he amped up his twitter presence a few months ago he's been changing the opinion on himself by exposure.  Elon's always had a vocal fanbase, but their vocalness hid the shallowness of other parts of his support.  Probably some oil/short money being put in to anti-PR, but the trend still seems organic.

       has a history of arbitrarily locking funds (my current funds are locked because I have a prepaid phone); offers poor customer support -- support is foreign and can't relate to consumer and automated email support doesn't solve problems; offers no form of digital ownership; current app has an identity crisis and is hard to use; bows to government requests without warrants; need to provide my passport info to Paypal just to use MY money.

       Paypal is a convenient tool for the government to control consumers. No where is there a law or is it stated in the constitution that the government owns the money of its people.

       I simply want to own my money and use it without having to ask others for permission, and Paypal prevents this.

       According to CDAN Elon has  been doing anything he can to influence the media to not talk about his slow unraveling.

      <p>
       Read the actual Independent reports about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is constantly wasted (high), and is being talked to at the highest levels to remove him from TSLA.

       All that fakeness has caught up with him. The Tesla in space BS looked faker and cheesier than David Bowie in Labyrinth. Maybe if we close our eyes and wish hard enough we can imagine Bowie driving Elon's car while Tesla himself waves (pun fully intended), brokenly and used, from the back of the theatre.....like in The Prestige.

       Fuck off with that bullshit. I have a long time friend who I've known for decades and who I've always considered intelligent. He got wrapped up in the flat earth nonsense (along with Christianity at the same time, just a coincidence, I'm sure). I bought tickets for us to fly to Florida to see that launch, to settle the argument. It was the most awesome thing I've ever witnessed. The launch was cool enough, but watching the two boosters scream back toward the ground and then refire just when it looked like they were going to slam into the Earth.. fucking awesome. There were thousands of people gathered at multiple viewing sights, plenty of indipendent video. It's not disputable. That shit happened, and I saw it with my own eyes.

       Yes, there are absolutely paid firms who have been hired to smear nearly every major player in the business and political spheres. Musk's problem is that he has been giving them fuel to feed feed the flames. When you have that many well funded crosshairs fixed on you, you have to play it the way politicians do.. you need handlers who research everything you say and do publicly, and craft responses to anything that may come up. He hasn't done that, which is obviously commendable, but at the same time it exposes him to these sorts of attacks. He's human, just like the rest of us, and without a team of professionals crafting his image, flaws will be visible.

       Because Musk doesnâ€™t do shit but fantasize about things.  He then pays the real thinkers to figure out how to do it, but for some reason gets all the credit for it.   The things he gets credited for has already been imagined by a great many people, he just has the money to throw at it.

       He seems like a cult of personality to me. I was never interested in him or his work. I would occasionally see clips of him on those hyper-paranoid YouTube videos about the end of the world (WW3 Is Just Around The Corner! MUST SEE (2018)). He would talk about AI a lot. Joe Rogan-tier if you ask me.

       The only person running a smear campaign against Elon is Elon himself, by making a tit of himself on twitter time and time again. People are getting sick of his brand of egotistical or elitist bullshit, from calling a guy a peado because he criticised him submarine to calling himself a socialist whilst being a union-busting  billionaire (also saying Marx was a capitalist cos he wrote a book about it). People are just now realising that despite funding some awesome stuff, the man himself is a fool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also to say he is a major threat to the fossil fuel industry is a bit of an exaggeration. Tesla is a small company and far from a run away success, whilst almost every major car manufacturer is already selling electric cars that are far more affordable than Tesla's.

       A power plant is far more efficient and clean than the internal combustion engine in a car. So even if the grid remains fully fossil fueled, it's actually still a big improvement.

       Whilst this is 100% true, manufacturing a new car uses vastly more emissions than a more efficient engine saves. Electric cars remain a luxury for 'eco-conscious' middle-class types rather than an effective way of combating climate change.

       I know there was a study on the environmental impact of the full manufacture of a Tesla. The car does use more energy to build, but it begins to break even pretty quickly. I cant find the source right now and I don't remember the details too well so take it with a grain of salt. I'm definitely more optimistic than you about the benefits of electric cars, but it's good to be skeptical.

       That payoff is when you compare a brand new ICE car with a Tesla and even then it is 8 years. So the extra environmental impact of building a Tesla over an ICE vehicle is worth 8 years of the increased emissions from the ICE.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you already own a car then it's even worse because the emissions from building a new one will outweigh a lifetime of savings from increased engine efficiency whether it is electric or ICE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously electric is the future of vehicles but buying an electric car is not good for the environment. Affordable public transport, cycle infrastructure and walking are the only eco alternative.

       While mostly true, even a coal fired power plant is far more efficient than any internal combustion engine, so while the majority of the power that powers electric vehicles comes from burning fossil fuels, less CO2 is released due to how efficient power plants are. Plus plenty of folks have battery cars and solar on their roof. I see it quite a bit here in sunny New Mexico.

       Reddit is a fine example of just how absurdly malleable/gullible people are, broadly.  They have no real opinions of their own.  They spout off anything they've heard somewhere else so that they will feel they will appear better informed and intelligent.  Think about that for a while.  When they talk about the elections being swayed by external forces, realize just how stupid that is to make an issue of.  Of course they're going to say that because their own propaganda was less effective.
