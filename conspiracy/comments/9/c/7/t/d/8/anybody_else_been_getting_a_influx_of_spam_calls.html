        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve had at least a dozen this year , typically it will be some prerecorded message but I never really answer my phone so a lot of times I&#39;ll simply text the person. All of the times I get replies they&#39;ll say they never called me - I&#39;ll screen shot and send them a photo of the proof that their number did call me only to get a &quot; oh thats weird &quot; or similar response. Theres some sort of program happening that has compromised what I believe to be mostly Verizon numbers ( because of my local prefixes ) the weirdest one so far was my exact number plus 1 calling me eg. (101)101-1010 - my number - (101)101-1011 their number. I saw a facebook post recently in a car group talking about the same thing in the north west but they would be running a car ad / part ad to get people to text them back. </p>

<p>any way. If this goes over your head  you probably haven&#39;t experienced it yet but if this sounds similar at all you&#39;re probably fully understanding what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>My question is how did these scammers get access to other peoples numbers or I guess mask it to seem local enough to get people to answer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So that opens up for me in my opinion a rabbit hole , this technology is available to modern day scammers the govt&#39; has probably had it for the last 20+ years. With all the voice to text / voice search google owns probably terrabytes of the publics voice clips - if they can spoof numbers of real peoples numbers couldn&#39;t they call people on our behalf ? If they have enough voice bites and the ability to spoof our number so CID picks it up as our number they could use the tech to call people and have them believe its you.</p>

<p>kind of goes all the way back to 9/11 for me where there was phone calls made by people that just couldn&#39;t have taken place in theory. </p>

<p>now they wave the tech in our face trying to scam us out of our monies or personal information... </p>

<p>say they call from a govt&#39; based number they could convince people of things that weren&#39;t true idk.. something fucky about it doesnt sit right with me.</p>

<p>The same is true for outbound email addresses if you run an email server, but there are newer techniques to block spoofed emails.  Not so with phones yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Caller ID spoofing.    It&#39;s huge now.</p>

<p>UNFORTUNATLY for them...    they keep spoofing my area code - prefix when they call me.</p>

<p>And my prefix is a cell phones only prefix and NOBODY i know has it except me.   </p>

<p>So any call i get from that prefix i know is bullshit and don&#39;t answer at all.     </p>

<p>Heck spam calls in general are huge now imo.   </p>

<p>Most annoying was the 1-800 # spam.   direct tv tryin to sell me nfl sunday ticket.<br/>
I filed an FCC complaint for those.<br/>
It&#39;s un-possible i&#39;ve ever done business with anyone who would have given them legal cause to call me.     They&#39;re flat out cold calling.    fuckers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there was a podcast about this. </p>

<p>It’s supposed to make you think someone in your town is calling you. I grew up somewhere where the area code and three digit prefix were used by all the local numbers. If you saw those first six numbers, you though someone in your hometown was calling you. But not a lot of people know that anymore so for whatever reason scammers think people will assume the first six is someone who has a somewhat similar phone number calling. Not that it’s someone from their hometown. </p>

<p>As for them using government numbers; they do exactly that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On my last number I had, I literally would get up to 20 calls a day at one point. Utterly ridiculous. My SO has for months been getting random numbers with local or close to local area codes asking for this <em>same</em> damn person over and over. Every time he has answered their call, it has always been a different person too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got a random call from some lady saying she just got a call from my number. I haven&#39;t been on my phone all day, was actually waiting for a call. She told me that this happens a couple times a week. I didnt think about it then, but after reading this? Pretty weird. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Had this happen to a group of us. They somehow accessed someone&#39;s contacts and we kept getting spoofed calls from each other (like 7 of us). It only affected the 7 of us as far as I&#39;m aware. I got calls from some people that I didn&#39;t have in my contacts too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been getting spoof calls like crazy lately. I got ATT and got a direct call from their number asking me for info that I knew was a scam. Hung up an called their direct line and they said “there’s nothing wrong for your account. We don’t ask for that info”. They flagged my account for fraud and will get back to me but it’s getting crazy. </p>

<p>I use to be able to tell the fake automated messages where you try to ask dumb questions like “what’s 2 plus 2” and they hang up on me. Shit is getting more sophisticated </p>
