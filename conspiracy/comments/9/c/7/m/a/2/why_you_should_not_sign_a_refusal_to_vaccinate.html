<blockquote>
<p>”I know that failure to follow the recommendations about vaccination may endanger the health or life of my child and others with whom my child might come into contact.”</p>

<p>The biggest contention with vaccines is the lack of ‘informed consent’ for the real risks and the real benefits of their product. They fear if ppl knew this, they would choose NOT to vaccinate.  Hmmmm...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antivax is a very broad stroke to define multiple nuanced opinions that are quite different:</p>

<p>1: belief that vaccines don&#39;t work or that they&#39;re intentionally harmful</p>

<p>2: belief that vaccines do work, but with possible complications that outweigh the risk</p>

<p>3: religious beliefs prevent the use of vaccines</p>

<p>4: belief in personal sovereignty and that the state should not have the power to impose anything forcibly</p>

<p>These are radically different issues and calling someone a &quot;retard&quot; demonstrates your ignorance of the subject as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re correct, I’ll explain why I feel each of those categories is, in fact, retarded.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Vaccines do work they have been proven beyond a doubt they work and they are the only reason we have eradicated diseases like measles and polio, if you truly don’t think they work you are in fact not using your brain and may as well actually be mentally challenged.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe you refer to those people claiming vaccines cause autism and considering the only “proof” for that is a disapproved study done by some quack that retracted the entire results of the study when the research community called him on his BS. Again, to believe this requires turning off your critical thinking.</p></li>
<li><p>I do not agree  should be allowed to put the entire population at risk for preventable diseases because you subscribe to a Stone Age belief that you think knows how to treat diseases better then modern medicine does and my reasoning with 1 applies here as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course the state has to enforce certain things people may not like, it’s called having a society and if you want to live and benefit from it you have to follow the rules. You can’t suddenly decide you don’t need vaccines, you don’t have the knowledge for such a decision and the people that do know better will wonder if you’ve lost your mind. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I get we don’t trust big pharma, I’m with you on that for many things but vaccines are something critical and I just don’t think any of those reasons are valid to disregard vaccines. If you want to talk about facts and studies on something specific then I’m on board. Until then, simply stating how evil big pharma is is not a reason to be antivax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because those people with companies domineering systems don’t get to decide if they are susceptible or not, they already are. Your “choice” can result in someone else’s easily preventable death. That is why I have an issue on being “pro choice” when it comes to vaccines. You aren’t only making a choice for yourself, you’re making that choice for people who can’t get vaccines due to age or medical reasons. Even if the odds of a negative vaccine are there you are incredibly selfish for deciding that the tiny chance of you having a negative reaction is worth more than the lives of someone else.</p>

It is not my fault they have bad immune systems, but you are making it my fault for not doing something about it? Doesn&#39;t work that way. Plus, just because I&#39;m vaccinated doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not a carrier and it doesn&#39;t mean they still won&#39;t get diseases, it just means my immune system can deal with it. If they have compromised immune systems, face it, they are fucked. Even if every human on earth was vaccinated they would still be fucked because we get more diseases from the air we breathe, food we eat and water we drink than from simply being around other humans</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was an outbreak in measles the a region in the U.S. a few years back and the pro vaxxers and MSM had a field day. About 6 months later a short blurb comes out revealing 80% of the infected HAD been vaccinated and most likely infected the 20% that were unvaccinated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you find even a single example of an immunocompromised person catching a vaccine preventable disease from the child of an anti-vaxer? This is always used an as argument to support forced inoculation, but I&#39;ve never been able to find any example of this actually happening. At this point, it seems more like a theoretical risk than an actual risk.</p>

<p>People like yourself who want the government to forcibly vaccinate all children tend to ignore all the adults who do not get their booster shots. The focus is always on vaccinating the children. There is never an effort to ensure that adults are up to date on their vaccine booster shots since most vaccines do not provide life-long protection in every case. In fact, many of these crazy pro-vaccine people are themselves not up to date on their vaccine booster shots and they don&#39;t even know it. They think that anti-vaxers are the most horrible people in the world, yet they themselves may not be protected from all vaccine preventable diseases since they haven&#39;t kept up with their booster shots. </p>

<p>Maybe you are even one of these people? How old are you and when was the last time you were vaccinated? Have you ever had your titers checked? Maybe you&#39;re the one actually putting immunocompromised people at risk and you don&#39;t even know it! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree the state has an authority to force people to vaccinate, but ultimately this is a matter of personal philosophy.</p>

<p>While &quot;slippery slope&quot; is a fallacy, it is still demonstrably real phenomenon.  Its gets a little eugenics-y when the state starts deciding whats best for the individual against the individual&#39;s will.</p>

<p>I never understood the argument about non vaccinated people spreading disease. If they aren&#39;t vaccinated but someone else is, how would they spread a disease? </p>

<p>I think the hardest problem is children. A parent restricting their vaccination to protect them is the parents&#39; choice, but ultimately the child is the one at risk, so the personal sovereignty argument doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>If you circumcise a child, and it ends up with a complication or contraction of chronic illness, nobody seems to have an issue with that, despite the fact that circumcision isnt even a necessary practice. The stigma around vaccines makes it difficult to even have a conversation about it.</p>

<p>Ultimately, what is needed are real, long term studies on the ingredients, effects and necessity of all vaccines. These have been completely ignored by the pharma industry, despite legal requirements to do so.  Until then, anyone saying they know for sure, either way, is wrong.</p>

Your body fights it off and you never even knew it was there but you interacted with someone who couldn’t fight that off and wasn’t vaccinated and now you’ve infected and potentially killed them.

<p>virtually no one thinks the wakefield study proved anything even the study said the following.</p>

<p>people don&#39;t rely on the wakefield because there is so much more evidence.</p>
