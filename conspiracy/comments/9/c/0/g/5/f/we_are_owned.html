       What and how? If you don't want to be tracked then use cash. Lol, this is 101. Something tells me you are not being completely honest nor serious.

       I get that where one gets cash can be logged ans tracked, but how do they track spending in cash?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems to me that they can only tell where one got their cash from, but it is nearly impossible to track as there are no serial numbers directly associated with any given individual and they would have to sift through and log all the cash in a given area to find the specific bills associated with an individual. I'm pretty sure they aren't doing this to the masses, I could be wrong though.

       Essentially every transaction you make is tracked now- even if you go to the store and use cash.

       On a serious note, you know that people live off the grid by building their own homes. If they hunt/grow their own food, would they not be completely self-sufficient and "opting out"?

       Ahhh I see what you were getting at now. Yeah, people can opt out by completely disconnecting from society and dropping off the grid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it comes down to whether you are ready to do that. It is a huge thing to do. Quit your job and .. what? Go erect a tent in the middle of nowhere and live off the land? I can't see many ppl being up for that … yet

       It sounds like you're defending society and companies. What's wrong with living off the grid? If you're willing to put in the work, you can live in a bigger home than the one you're paying the government to let you rent. Does this lifestyle not interest you? You said there wasn't a way to out out. Now there is. You have the option, you just don't want to make the leap I suppose.

       I'm not the one that made a post about how the world is monitoring my every action. You did. I don't care about these things, but you obviously have an issue with them so I provided ways to get around being monitored. I have you a solution to your problem and you basically said "nahh that's a lotta effort". I imagine in hindsight you made this post to rant about the world instead of actually putting in work to get what you want, which is fine. Just own up to it.

       "The end is near." Those four words always seemed a bit egotistical to me. Perhaps the end happened long ago. Perhaps it won't happen until we're long dead. We live very short lives and many have said those four words only to end up beneath us, dreading the end until their final moments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started this out as a bit of a rant, but if 99% of everything truly is as you see it, then take solace in the 1% that makes you free and that you enjoy. Life is short, after all.

       This is correct, they have more then surely a program were they can simulate every people who have a internet presence now, more and more person each day making an account on social media or anything were you put yourself out. With that program were everyone is categorize under certain « folders » if you want, they can predict how the response on a event or topic that they put foward will have on the majority of the people of a certain region or country.

       Yes, the end is definitely near imo. 
Food for thought**
      </p>
      <p>
       They want you to believe that there is no such 'end', that we've been here for 'billions' of years, like the guy mentioned; well, it makes perfect sense that you don't believe that the 'end' is near if they have you believing that we've been here for billions of years..
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny how the most popular theorized end year to date has been '2012'. It was very popular due to its many reasons for its claims, however, it did not occur on the the exact date to our gregorian calendars and we all just chucked the idea into the bin &amp; made it something to laugh about.. I did too..
      </p>
      <p>
       The times we are currently living in which is so close in proximity to 2012, is almost picture perfect in circumstances as theorized by many, prophesizing the end times.. I mean that's pretty crazy in itself if you think about it, especially if you believe that we've been here for billions of years..
      </p>
      <p>
       What are odds of both of those aligning so closely?
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the odds that the date truly is '2012', just that our calendars are off by some years/decades?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, ofcourse we can't validate the latter for obvious reasons but just looking at it as it is, I'd lean towards the former being more improbable, especially considering we've been here 'billions' of years..

       If you think humanity could be killed off at this point, you don't know your own species very well. We're cockroaches in the sense that we refuse to die under any cataclysmic event. I don't believe in end times because it's egotistical to think that we're chosen to witness such a world changing event, but even if it did happen, it wouldn't be the end of us as a species, and at that point could it even truly be called "the end"?

       Well, according to 'science', we're a mere speck floating in infinite w/ an unsummable amount of comets and meteors floating randomly in space which are 100s of times bigger than our planet, any close contact then its the end of civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we survived then all it means is that it wasn't Big enough a cataclysm to wipe us out, not because the last of us form some cataclysm-proof impenetrable cocoon around us like you're making it sound..   all your ideas are based on past experiences and hypothetically, if the end had past then there would be no argument as to whether there can be an 'end time', therefore it's redundant. +via your logic, it's still has to happen in somebody's lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument doesn't refute anything; All you're saying is, 'it didn't happen in all those people's lifetimes therefore you're arrogant because you think you're special because you singled yourself out '1/10000xx'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, guess what?? This isn't a lucky draw..that's not how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, it was just a humble brag assuming people are arrogant for speculating and quite egotistical to come here and just do that whilst providing 0 refutations other than your own opinions which is again, based on the past and as i said, this is not a lucky draw.
      </p>
      <p>
       The things runnin through your mind and imo I'm sure the majority of us has had those those thoughts.. it's rudimentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       ***Anyways, I don't really believe in all that tbh, e.g. Humanity's extinction via meteors etc; it's just an argument I felt aligned more w/ your pov because this 'you think you're special because it's going to happen in your lifetime' narrative has zilch to do w/ what op is addressing regarding the world being in turmoil &amp; NWO taking over which were predicted far back..

       That's what happens when every citizen knowingly carries a personal locator in their pocket.

       I personally was more surprised about the amount of meta data collected by police cameras scanning license places. They data is going to eventually be resold and then things get interesting.

       The amount of information you can collect on citizens by recording and analyzing their driving habits seems overly evasive.

       Have you considered that such a high level of monitoring could be to an individual's advantage? If one is aware of monitoring then provide that information that presents the Monitors with exactly the portrait you want the Monitors to see. Not everything in society has to be done while connected, do those things that you don't want the Monitors to know without carrying a phone, use proxies and VPNs, know how to cover discernible physical features without looking like you're doing so. We don't have to resign ourselves to defeat and oppression because the tech
       <em>
        seems
       </em>
       overwhelming. If we're aware of it, we can use it to our advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, the ultra-monitoring is only really heavy in cities and dense urban areas. Rural communities aren't nearly as bad. ;)

       Every square inch of the country, forest or not, is either private land or public land where you can't squat or hunt. You can always buy a piece of land somewhere and build on it, collect rain water, solar power, septic system, growing food or homesteading/ hunting on your
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       land, etc. but you
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       follow local laws about the structures you can build on your legally purchased and recorded land and you
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       pay taxes on the property, which will be reassessed every time you build or improve the land (ie- taxes increase). But there is no such thing as living totally off the grid in the United States, just having a lesser dependence on it.

       Definitely, and it behooves one to study their local laws and town bylaws carefully, so they don't squat or trespass, or one may end up evicted, jailed, fined or at the end of a landowner's rifle. There is no wilderness anywhere, it is all owned by someone or the government. Survival requires smarts, not just guts.

       You are not thinking of the big picture. It's also spying on people of power and influence. This can be used for blackmail to affect large portions of society, for the benefit of a few. But ya we are probably just gonna get Ads for  now.

       I'm on board w a lot of conspiracies and wont deny all the data collection feels sinister. But seriously everyone is being too alarmist. If you live in the west then we have more things available to us than ever before. We can book a flight to a place around the world, watch any kind of movie we want on the way there, use our phones to look up words and take pictures and look at maps, etc. Most peasants for all of human history were illiterate and never traveled beyond a 50 mile radius from their birthplace, not to mention dead by age 45 by some God awful disease- so really guys what do you want? Modern society or medieval serfdom? There's shitty stuff going on, but let's not act like we are total slaves because that is simply not reality.

       I think to call us serfs is to ignore reality of what historical serfdom was, and that our standard of living is inconceivable to anyone born before the 20th century on all counts- access to info, life expectancy, availability of food and clean water, freedom to travel, etc.
      </p>

       Yes most people work for the man, and there is an overlord class that pulls the strings, but I just think that this talk of slavery and ownership turns conspiracy discussions into hysterics that push others away.

       It's bizarre how people don't see how big of an issue it is. They only see little pieces to a really big puzzle, so they assume it isn't all that bad. The more you put the pieces together, the more you'll see that you are not free. And probably never will be. I think it's hard for most people to wrap their head around that because they live like they're free. It's an illusion though ! ! !
