        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Mormons are required to pay 10% of their income.  they aren&#39;t allowed to know where that money goes.  A while back someone traced 12 holding companies back to being owned by the mormon church, through tracing the owners of those holding company&#39;s websites.  The news broke that the LDS church owns 32 Billion dollars in stocks.  but not much else was discussed.  Someone on reddit disambiguated the information and made a list of all the stocks those 12 companies owned.  I decided to investigate those 1217 companies and found a pattern.  money laundering, fraud, tax evasion, dishonesty and general corruption from the top levels of these companies.  I made a list of news articles detailing just a fragment of the corruption.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>which in reality, is funded by mormon tithes if those tithes are buying stock in corrupt companies.  I have been tuning into Q anon, and trigger words for mormons in my mind are-- </p>

<p>nsa(they put the NSA right next to salt lake city mormon headquarters and mormons hold high level positions through the intelligence agencies, CIA, NSA etc.  (brent scowcroft arguably the most prominent architect of the modern NSA is a mormon dude)</p>

<p>keystone(they call their book the keystone) snow white(I know snow white refers to what 7 super computers) (but to me it hints at mormons because their whole premise is that if you are righteous you will get white delightsome skin, if you are wicked you will be cursed with dark loathesome skin(like the lamanites are supposedly wicked jews which were turned brown when they became native americans)</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>anyway, I don&#39;t think the LDS church is suspected enough.  and the members themselves are all just loving people who want to do what&#39;s right, but at the top levels there is something called a 2nd anointing, where your calling and election are made sure.  there is an elitist inside church for only the ultimately obedient members, they refer to that as being &quot;church broke&quot;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>anywho.  here is a list of scandals and there is a link inside of the list of LDS church owned stocks.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/9ces3w/i_decided_to_look_into_the_companies_the_church/">https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/9ces3w/i_decided_to_look_into_the_companies_the_church/</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------break----------------i will add a bit more info----------------------------------------</p>

<p>Keep in mind royal arch masons were the architects of the mormon religion.  People who are not mormon think they know what mormons are because they know a nice mormon or two, and try to correct me.  And they just don&#39;t know what they speak of, I&#39;ve been mormon my whole life.  I will give you some links for pertinent information.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>First, for those who believe mormonism is not masonic.... Here is a nice article showing how every part of mormonism came out of freemasonry <a href="http://commonpaine.blogspot.com/2011/09/mormonism-and-masonry.html">http://commonpaine.blogspot.com/2011/09/mormonism-and-masonry.html</a></p>

<p>(the aaronic and melchizedek high priesthood the mormons have, came from royal arch freemasonry)</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>And then yeah I&#39;ll just leave this here also.  This is sort of the secret origins of the LDS church for anyone interested.  <a href="http://www.conchisle.com/moroni.htm">http://www.conchisle.com/moroni.htm</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Mormonism has evolved to be something people want to hear.  But in reality it is wholesale fraud.  Here is Mitt Romney&#39;s cousin speaking about it.   <a href="http://www.parkromney.com/?view=essays&amp;amp;sid=X1365244534">http://www.parkromney.com/?view=essays&amp;sid=X1365244534</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The book of mormon was run through plagiarism detectors via modern computers and found to be plagiarized from many sources, while mormons profess it to be translated from ancient records(ancient jews who became native americans, which DNA science refutes completely showing that native americans came from china) .  </p>

<p>One book the book of mormon plagiarized from is the late war.  <a href="http://wordtree.org/thelatewar/">http://wordtree.org/thelatewar/</a>  The late war was a textbook they drew from.  the religious content was drawn from sermons of 19th century preachers.  John edwards and john edwards the younger and benjamin paddock to name a few.  anyone really wanting to dive into that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3uvrl5/nineteenthcentury_protestant_material_in_the_book/">https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3uvrl5/nineteenthcentury_protestant_material_in_the_book/</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Otherwise.  We have much secret society involvement.  Early mormon leaders were attending the bohemian club in san francisco.  (they own the bohemian grove) ... Wilford Woodruff the mormon &quot;prophet&quot; was a keynote speaker there before &quot;dying in his sleep&quot; immediately after.  it is well documented.  Hirum Clawson the lead architect of the famous SLC mormon temple accompanied him as well as George Q Cannon.  Hirum Clawsons son continued to be on the Bohemian Grove Roles as can be found here  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bohemian_Club_members">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bohemian_Club_members</a> scroll down to john willard clawson, as mentioned in his profile he is hirums son.  hirum was also a bohemian club attender, as mentioned in history as he accompanied woodruff there to his death.  and Cannon&#39;s son tracy clawson was a leader of an SLC bohemian club.  george q cannon was a mormon &quot;apostle&quot;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>so anyway.  otherwise, you have sitting apostles within mormonism who are members of skull and bones.  robert d hales.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1m7ng9/til_elder_robert_d_hales_was_member_of_skull_and/">https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1m7ng9/til_elder_robert_d_hales_was_member_of_skull_and/</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>and you have plenty of other top church leaders involved in CIA etc.  anyway, just thought I would this drop this info on the internet.  ciao</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh, I see now that you were OP and the removed. Looks like the auto moderator caught a FB link and auto removed it. As far as uncensorable... I&#39;ve only found a few subs for spiritual/personal growth type stuff that were pretty much anything goes as long as the subscribers didn&#39;t have a big issue. </p>

<p>With so many links, maybe post on your self made sub and link to that if allowed? Otherwise something heavily moderated will find a reason. </p>

<p>Appreciate you taking the time to re-link your findings here. I don&#39;t know much about the subject, but you obviously invested time into your research and I look forward to looking at those articles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had issues with this as well. Either the entire post gets removed automatically because of one or more links, or a moderator may remove the post without telling you. A few options to get around this: Find which link is causing the problem and archive it, using either archive.is or archive.org. Those links will show up fine on Reddit. You can also make your own sub, post everything in a thread, then click the approve button. You can link to that thread. </p>

<p>The best way to find out if your post has been removed is to simply log out and check to see if the text in the body of the post is still visible. If it says [Removed] then you can use one of the above options. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m a Mormon from one of the smaller sects not associated with the LDS. </p>

<p>The obsession with genealogy has nothing to do with eugenics. It is Mormon doctrine that you can baptize your deceased ancestors by proxy thus allowing them to ascend to a higher level of paradise in the afterlife. Genealogy research allows us to find out who those ancestors were so that we can have them baptized by proxy improving their status in the afterlife.</p>

<p>While uncommon there are also Mormons who upon finding evidence of black or Native American ancestry point to their white skin as proof of their righteousness and the righteousness their family has exhibited since then.</p>

<p>It’s also important to note that the LDS church only distanced itself from using white skin as evidence of righteousness when they started making major inroads with evangelism in Africa and South America. South America and Africa are two of the primary growth areas for the LDS church right now. They have abandoned a core doctrine of the church over money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also just a point, masons didn’t create Mormonism. Joseph Smith, mostly because his brother’s name was Hiram (aka Hiram Abiff, the master mason, Grand Architect of the Universe, most revered figure in Freemasonry) was made a “mason on sight”. A common practice back in the day when medicine wasn’t a recognizable part of life and societies needed to maintain proper herd numbers.</p>

<p>It became well known that Joseph and his dad were major con artists, being in jail multiple times prior for leading wealthy individuals on, posing as “gold finders”. They would collect a sum of money from a group of people under the impression they would “find gold in the hills using secret maps”. </p>

<p>Now the Internet wasn’t a thing and masons couldn’t google his name and pull up his records quite like we can today. So they initiate him into the brotherhood, begin sharing the secrets and Joseph and his brother take the blood oath.</p>

<p>Well fast forward a few years, and Joseph and his con artist ways decides he wants 10% and free access to everybody’s wife, so he starts a religion based around the rituals and truths he learned through freemasonry (which are true and sacred, hence the partial truths in Mormonism). He plagiarizes a whole bunch of stories from the time to create his book, tells people he was shown the brass plates by an angel, and used the urim and thumim to translate old dead languages. </p>

<p>Masons catch word of it, and start chasing him down to honor the blood oath. Hence why the Mormon church moved around a bunch (persecution for beliefs was the excuse). In reality, they were running from Freemasons, but the local people were sick of Joseph and his cohorts trying to polygamize everyone’s wife, sisters and daughters.</p>

<p>Story ends with Joseph in jail and the masons catch wind of where he is, find the building and riddle it with bullet holes. The rest of the leaders go “oh shit it’s serous now” and pack everyone up and run to Salt Lake to grow their church “persecution” free.</p>

<p>The part about Mormons being littered throughout high ranking positions in the three letter agencies is true. But those positions are always full of deeply religious people because they’re the easiest to control. They can be led to believe they are fighting in the war of good and evil, and are their gods chosen soldiers of truth. It’s not because Mormons run those agencies.</p>

<p>The Mormon church has its own fair share of a hideous underbelly, but it’s not the ultimate dark force OP is painting it out to be. You’re looking for the Jesuits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s what surprised me. One set of my grandparents were adopted during the depression. We could not find records of where they were from, our lineage just dead ended at them. For years we could not find anything in govt records. But my uncle was able to track down full lineage through the Mormon Church (not even through ancestry.com). My uncle contacted the church and was able to get access to their records. What’s crazy is no one in our family ever was Mormon. My uncle had just heard they kept records on everyone. It just blows my mind that they would devote so much time and resources into keeping such records with no real benefit to them considering they keep records on people who aren’t in the Church of Mormon. </p>

<p>It’s just creepy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something gets you going down the road Im just curious about the start. I dont have a horse in this race. Im not a Mormon so Im not offended nor am I a fan of organized religion. There is always a reason for the journey especially one so specific. Is it in response to the Vatican talk last week so the thought was applied to the LDS because its closer to home. Have other groups been investigated by OP or was it a mixing of a love for stocks mixed with bad feelings toward a group. Im currently looking up the Jesuits because im interested in conspiracies and the amount of hate they recieve peaked my intrest. Once again dont have a dog in the fight so its purely curiosity. Im not looking up jesuit church architects. See that would be a specific interest not a random &quot;I wonder&quot;.</p>
