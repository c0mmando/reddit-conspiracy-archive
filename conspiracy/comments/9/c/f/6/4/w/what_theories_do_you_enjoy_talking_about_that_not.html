        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I enjoy talking about theories with people, and sometimes this place gets repetitive. One of my hobbies is learning new ideas. </p>

<p>Throw me your weird theory. It doesn&#39;t have to be foolproof, but it has to at least make sense. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll start. I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_Super_Collider">Desertron</a> is more than what it seems. </p>

<p>It was supposed to be the largest supercollider in the world, but was canceled in 1993 due to budget concerns. But not until after this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the project was canceled, 22.5 km (14.0 mi) of tunnel and 17 shafts to the surface were already dug, and nearly two billion dollars had already been spent on the massive facility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After that, in August of 2016, it was sold to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_Bryan_Hunt">J.B. Hunt</a>, who died by slipping on a patch of ice 4 months later. Magnablend, a chemical company, bought it in 2012.</p>

<p>Now to where i spin off into the abyss and get a little nutty. If you don&#39;t know, the FL in my name stands for ForgottenLanguages and is an entirely different thread itself, but it exposed me to an idea about Desertron.</p>

<p><a href="https://forgottenlanguages-full.forgottenlanguages.org/2016/10/machine-in-desert-military.html">https://forgottenlanguages-full.forgottenlanguages.org/2016/10/machine-in-desert-military.html</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s some of the interesting English parts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In June, 1993, the non-profit Project on Government Oversight (POGO) released a draft audit report by the Department of Energy&#39;s Inspector General heavily criticizing the Super Collider for its high costs and poor management by officials in charge of it. Congress officially canceled the project October 21, 1993 after $2 billion had been spent. President Clinton signed the bill which finally cancelled the project on October 31, 1993. POGO made a damn good job. They actually forced the Congress to cancel the project, so that we now have many necessary facilities already in place including high-rise international headquarters, educational resources, pre-tunneled terrain, shafts to the surface already dug, and the usual degree of inaccessibility. The entire complex is clear of flight paths and out of hurricane, earthquake and flood zones. We simply need to occupy the facility and start working. It will be the most powerful collider on this world, <em>and it will belong to the military for the first time.</em></p>

<p>The multiverse concept makes possible to extend the search for both life and intelligence to other universes, and theoretically, it is easier to communicate with a parallel universe than to communicate with a distant star in our own universe. We know usual matter does leap from our braneworld to a hidden one, and vice versa. We reasoned that it might be possible to use the controlled production of virtual particles as a way to communicate with the intelligent beings at the other side of the brane. Under the replica world scenario, a replica of our world exists at a mere ten to the minus 43 meters distance, so virtual particles popping up here come from that world, much as our virtual particles go to theirs. Even if the replica world scenario is not valid, you still assume a parallel brane is somewhere out there, hence this communication scheme still applies. Thus, assuming we can generate pairs of virtual particles in a controlled manner, exchange of information between both worlds is possible.</p>

<p>Obviously, we needed a supercollider and that&#39;s why the Desertron was so attractive to us, provided we could snatch it out of civilian hands. We did. The project was nicknamed Queltron Machine and was put under the administration of XViS.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure, think it was an XViS operation channeled through a chemical company called Magnablend. They bought the property and facilities in 2012. Later on, Univar successfully closed Magnablend acquisition on December, 11th, 2012. Univar is also under XViS supervision. To my knowledge, XViS operates under the cover of  theDefense Logistics Agency. Officially, DLA provides logistical, acquisition, and technical support for the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and other federal agencies and allies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe the common opinion on Desertron these days is that those tunnels are filled with water, but my mind can&#39;t help but consider the implications if it isn&#39;t. 14 miles of underground tunnels seems a great military interest.</p>

<p>So, what&#39;s your theory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you hear about how some people apparently got a hold of NodeSpace and translated some of the text? There&#39;s a FL reddit, but it seems to be dead. I found out about FL after the sort of &#39;rush&#39; when people were heavily investigating it, but all the communities dedicated to trying to understand it seem to have died down....is there a place where people are still actively discussing it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We didnt need NodeSpaces, I actually created the FL subreddit and was a co-founder for the 4chan discord that was 300 ish people on this at once lol. There are some very extensive dictionaries we have done at this point, there&#39;s some on the FL sub.</p>

<p>I can probably get you a discord invite when I get home if you want. There are a few still active.</p>

<p>We learned a lot, but at the same time didnt learn anything.</p>

<p>As far as the doxx, there was a situation where ayndryl put up a new website with an unprotected whois so yes, that part is true but i cant share that here for obvious reasons, nor is it in the discord.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll share a theory I find interesting about the emergence of human consciousness from our prehuman ancestors, inc copypasta from an old comment of mine.</p>

<p><strong>begin copypasta</strong></p>

<p>I think Love was what started it all. I think that the concept of Love was imprinted into the minds of our pre-human ancestors through the process of Love Indoctrination. Though the mother may nurture her child through instinct, to the child, this is pure, unconditional love. I believe this is how our consciousness developed.</p>

<p>Love indoctrination is essentially the idea that the human mind learned empathy and selflessness through the unconditional love of a mother (freely given though dictated by instinct) to the child, which received it pure of instinct and saw it only as unconditional love. The idea is that this helped foster the human consciousness. I&#39;ll give a link but I want to caution that I do not agree with everything the World Transformation Movement (whom will provide the link) believes.</p>

<p>Link: <a href="https://www.humancondition.com/freedom-love-indoctrination/">https://www.humancondition.com/freedom-love-indoctrination/</a></p>

<p>Snip from link</p>

<p>and thus understand why the present human-condition-afflicted human race hasn’t been able to adequately nurture our infants to the extent their instincts expect that it becomes safe to finally admit that nurturing is what made us human—that it was nurturing that gave us our moral soul and created humanity. So how did nurturing create our extraordinary unconditionally selfless moral instincts?</p>

<p>snip</p>

<p>while nurturing is a genetically selfish trait, from an observer’s point of view it appears to be unconditionally selfless behaviour—the mother is giving her offspring food, warmth, shelter, support and protection for apparently nothing in return. This point is most significant because it means from the infant’s perspective its mother is treating it with real love, with unconditional selflessness. The infant’s brain is, therefore, being trained or indoctrinated or inscribed with unconditional selflessness and so, with enough training in unconditional selflessness, that infant will grow into an adult who behaves unconditionally selflessly.</p>

<p>I genuinely do believe our ancestors were closer to Bonobos than they were to Apes, as Bonobos are far more loving creatures who have sex to settle differences and are ruled by the Women of the tribe, who are the ones to select mates based on non aggression traits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ruling families sometimes erroneously referred to as &quot;illuminati&quot; are descended from the hyksos.  They&#39;ve written/compiled all of our bibles, established the fiat pyramid currency scheme, and have control over your most popular media, political, and religious institutions.</p>

<p>Through a combination of controlled reincarnation and old, established money control, they continue to work their plan through the ages without many people realizing what they&#39;re up to.  The power is focused at the top of the family, but they have many branches of relatives they place in power, ensuring that the control system in place isn&#39;t infiltrated or compromised by outside interests. 
 They&#39;re technically human, but follow a distinctly inhuman agenda.</p>

<p>It sounds even weirder when I leave no sources, so I&#39;m gonna go ahead and not do that.  Happy hunting :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s probably the best starting point.  But he kinda drops the ball after King David, Solomon, Psusennes, and doesn&#39;t explore much further on who they actually were, where they came from, where they went, etc.  From his starting point, you can then jump to &quot;where did the Greeks/macedonians come from?  Where did the various &quot;tribes&quot; go?  Who were the &quot;sea people&quot;?  Where did Roman aristocracy come from? (Hint:  Greece again...). Where did Danes and britons come from?</p>

<p>All of these strings can be (loosely) traced through conventional archaeology and history, but it&#39;s so sprawling that people don&#39;t put the pieces together.  Once you start down the reincarnation rabbit hole, though, it gets a little more... esoteric...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my research I haven&#39;t been able to confirm the potential for bloodlines remaining intact much farther than the 5th century Roman Elite&#39;s. From at least the 5th century onward there&#39;s an avenue of survival possible in the institution of the Church and in the Byzantine Court at Constantinople, which ties into Khazarian marriage into the Eastern Roman nobility in the 11th century. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some families <em>claim</em> traces back through even ancient Greece.  It&#39;s obviously difficult to trace directly, but there <em>are</em> ties between ruling Greek families and later Roman Caesars/rulers, including the church.  There are lots of gaps in the family tree because of lack of records, but then again, you can still find unexpected hidden gems, like where the Julio-Claudian dynasty immigrated from.  Their ancestors, a couple hundred years before the &quot;empire&quot; came directly from Greece, even being distinguished by their &quot;unusually&quot; shaped noses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is somewhat amusing that the Hyksos were forced from Egypt at a similar time to the Hebrews, is it not?</p>

<p>My <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-22.htm">favourite passage from the bible goes something like this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>21 Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, 
22 “Let us pass through your land. We will not cut through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will stay on the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.” 
23 But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. Instead, he gathered his whole army and went out to confront Israel in the wilderness. When he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The appearance of Gobekli and Karahan Tepe right after the flood, plus the spread of &quot;wisdom&quot; from that area (agriculture, building, domestication), slightly south into Canaan - where Jericho was built less than 1000 years later - and from which stock of people (The Amorites) was Babylonian civilization derived.</p>

<p>The Canaanites were recipients of knowledge from the survivors of the flood. The Hyksos/Hebrews stole their land, culture, history, religion, secrets and destiny.</p>

<p>Is it not odd too, that Carthaginian culture is strikingly similar to Phoenician culture (the only Canaanite culture to survive slightly longer). After the defeat of Carthage, they <a href="https://eos.org/articles/miners-left-pollution-trail-great-lakes-6000-years-ago">&quot;retreated to their copper mines in the west&quot;</a> (This last part I am still slightly uncertain of, but the appearance of Michigan Copper in the Mediterranean, plus the Phoenicians reputation of sailing, makes it at least possible.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good stuff.  The ties between &quot;European&quot; and &quot;middle eastern&quot; culture got so mixed up during the greek-to-roman empires, that I see them as pretty much the same.  <em>Truly</em> European cultures, like  the Celts for example, were completely and utterly  wiped out, or nearly, at least.  It  was then replaced by the culture of 
the conquerors, who came from Italy-&gt;greece-&gt;canaan-&gt;egypt-&gt;sumer-&gt;India? 
It wasn&#39;t until later, during the rise of Islam, that they separated and split down very different paths again.  (But still based on abrahamic ideology, unsurprisingly...)</p>

I think there&#39;s something currently considered &quot;supernatural&quot; to it (notice the reincarnation reference), but I think that throwing archons into it muddles an already-hard-to-digest theory, and mine isn&#39;t <em>dependent</em> on archons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why we don&#39;t go to the Moon anymore is because we were warned from there.</p>

<p>Armstrong: It was incredible … of course, we had always known there was a possibility … the fact is, we were warned off. There was never any questions then of a space station or a moon city.</p>

<p>Professor: How do you mean “warned off”?</p>

<p>Armstrong: I can’t go into details, except to say that their ships were far superior to ours both in size and technology – boy, where they big! … and menacing …. No, there is no question of a space station.</p>

<p>Where did these come from? Our previous human civilisations circa. 30,000 years ago who were completely wiped out. Only that the Moon has preserved their Moon stations. It was most likely robotic security devices protecting those &#39;ships&#39;.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re probably thinking, why not go and explore? Well imagine footage of this coming out, how the hell would they be able to explain it all? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>HIV doesn’t exist. Aids does. HIV was fabricated by tptb in order to explain away AIDs. Why? Because aids is caused by lots of anal sex. These are luciferians in TPTB and love anal sex. Having it be known as the cause of health issues was obviously bad business for them, it would logically cause people to believe the Bible. Homosexuals were just the icing on the insane cake that is the HIV fraud. </p>

<p>How does it work? The hiv tests are unspecified highly sensitive tests meaning that they test for a ton of different issues but can do that will incredible accuracy. Yes hiv tests are reactive for 62 issues. This is how they keep the fraud going. Positive test = hiv. Despite nobody actually establishing HIV exists. </p>

<p>This can all be learned from The House of Numbers but most of my research cane from just reading the DHHS and NIH reports on HIV and utilizing common sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Through the introduction of foreign bacteria, viruses, fungus and DNA. it really only becomes an issue if you are having tons of anal sex. The original aids patients were gay men and some had as many as 10,000 sex partners (these guys weren’t that old either). </p>

<p>The human blood stream is not designed to expect or handle foreign dna let alone many different strains of foreign dna. Unprotected Anal sex with ejactulation risks dna getting into the blood steam. </p>

<p>Consider how many stds were shared and then cured with antibiotics. If you had 5,000 partners like another aids patient had and only got an antibiotic treated STD from 1% still is 500 infections. </p>

<p>This is exacerbated by the drug called Poppers which relaxes the muscles and sphincter allowing for prolonged anal sex sessions increasing the likelihood of damage to the thin anal lining.</p>

<p>Consider poppers is also linked with damage to the immune system and the height of poppers usage was during the height of AIDs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the powers that be that control many different industries fabricated aids to cover up the anal sex cause of AIDs. Why? Because saying anal sex makes you ill would obviously make people think of the Bible and as you said realize the natural order of things (anal sex is not natural). As you may or may not notice the decline in our morality - having anal sex be taboo would not expedite that decline. These days if a girl isn’t having anal she is considered a prude. If people knew it caused aids that would not be the case, right. </p>

<p>AIDs is just around 300 dieseases that are allegedly caused by HIV. I don’t know what you are mentioning. All the AIDs dieseases exist without HIV. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m kind of interested in the whole &quot;wall street washes drug money&quot; conspiracy theory. It was started by Michael Rupert to explain why the cia is so connected to the drug trade. Yes, they ran opium in the 1960s, yes they ran cocaine in the 1980, yes they ran heroin after 911. Why? So the money can be pumped into the US dollar and washed through the stock market.</p>

<p>You want to run 10 million in coke into the United States? That&#39;s fine, you aren&#39;t getting 10 million dollars back, you are getting 200 Ford F150s back to sell in your home county.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;CAPT. Larry Khan&quot; written on the bottom of Kurt Cobain suicide note . Bottom right corner..doesnt appear in the original release of note, but seems to be there on re release after new crime scene pictures were re-released by the Seattle police Dept. Maybe it was edited out of the original release? Curiously , if you look at original release in the spot where it should be, looks like someone used Photoshop in that very spot. </p>

<p>Can be found if you look at Wikipedia entry &quot;Kurt Cobains Suicide&quot; Apparently people thought it might have been written by a cop on scene,  day of his death but there&#39;s no cop with that name . </p>

<p>There is however,  someone who uses the psydeoum &quot;Larry Khan&quot; who is employed in the record industry.. Apparently an associate of DGC,  but employed by Jive records. </p>

<p>Anyone know anything about this? I&#39;ve only discovered all of this in last few days. </p>

<p>Any input greatly appreciated.!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey thanks for the response . I used to believe Courtney Love somehow played a hand in Kurts death, but I&#39;m not so sure anymore. I&#39;ve heard a few diff theories, also one interesting one I heard about Love is that Rosemary Carroll discovered a handwriting sample on a piece of paper in Loves bag after Kurts death that looked like she was practicing copying someone&#39;s writing.  Who knows really . I grew up enjoying Holes music quite a bit , and I feel she has unfairly taken a lot of flak regarding his death . But we will possibly never know. Or maybe we will one day? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like this.</p>

<p>Do you ever read into the idea that the Abrahamic God is real, but a Demiurge imprisoning our spirits to endure cycles of life for their benefit? I&#39;m not a strong follower of the theory, but it seems to tie into this slightly. The way it was explained to me is that our consciousnesses will always be stuck at this &quot;level&quot;, being recycled (a la reincarnation) as long as we go to the figurative light when we die. Essentially it&#39;s a trap. Escaping the cycle, moving away from the light, is how to ascend to the next level of consciousness.</p>

<p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/i3e7aMCIxjY">Childhood&#39;s End</a> and it brought me around to this circle. </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna kinda spoil it, and if you&#39;re willing to watch it i <em>HIGHLY HIGHLY</em> recommend not spoiling it for yourself but &gt;!essentially an alien race comes to Earth and creates a perfect Utopia. No war, no hunger, no poverty. They never reveal their appearance to the human race, stating &quot;they&#39;ve done this before&quot; and they &quot;know the effects their appearance can have&quot;. The main alien refers to himself as the &quot;supervisor&quot; for Earth, here to usher them to the next age of Man. He specifically says that &quot;the stars are not for man&quot;. Science dies in this Utopia, as humans no longer need for anything. People breed, because living conditions are perfect. After 15 years, the aliens reveal themselves to look identical to the biblical representation of Satan. Note that they had said they&#39;ve done this before and have seen the effect of their appearance, indicating Abrahamic faith in other civilizations across the universe. Humanity accepts their appearance, as they&#39;ve done nothing but benefit mankind and at this point religion has been hit hard as aliens confronts Abrahamic faith pretty hard, which is another central point of the plot. Lots of plot later, the aliens make all adults sterile (after they have a lot of children) and take the children to &quot;ascend&quot; to the next level of consciousness through the real God, true enlightenment, a belief held by some in regards to Satan. It ends with a discussion about how life in this level of consciousness is controlled by a demiurge and we&#39;re all essentially spiritual slaves.!&lt;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I actually have been interested in gnosticism and an idea of two creator gods, good and evil. Have been listening quite a few Graham Hancock interviews about this and it&#39;s very interesting indeed. However, I&#39;d still like to believe, that everyone of us is guaranteed to have that everlasting peace at some point. Maybe after 50 reincarnations or after this society is wiped out for good who knows, but in the end the good creator (what ever that is) will collect back its consciousness energy or spirits whatever. I also think that, at least Abrahamic religions are all the same. Interpretations about the same idea will vary from, but this salvation theme will stay through the religions.</p>

<p>Gnosticism is quite hard about salvation and ending this spirit wandering, but more or less the idea of gaining some &quot;gnosis&quot; is only good for us. I have a pentecostal history myself and boy do I find it super blasphemic to read and identify with gnosticism and other weird theories about life, death and consciousness. </p>

People in the past who may have been classified as Black or Hispanic are now considered multiracial.  The achievement gap will eventually be closed with this racial category because it will be impossible to differentiate subgroups. Everyone will eventually be multiracial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some families <em>claim</em> traces back through even ancient Greece.  It&#39;s obviously difficult to trace directly, but there <em>are</em> ties between ruling Greek families and later Roman Caesars/rulers, including the church.  There are lots of gaps in the family tree because of lack of records, but then again, you can still find unexpected hidden gems, like where the Julio-Claudian dynasty immigrated from.  Their ancestors, a couple hundred years before the &quot;empire&quot; came directly from Greece, even being distinguished by their &quot;unusually&quot; shaped noses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the powers that be that control many different industries fabricated aids to cover up the anal sex cause of AIDs. Why? Because saying anal sex makes you ill would obviously make people think of the Bible and as you said realize the natural order of things (anal sex is not natural). As you may or may not notice the decline in our morality - having anal sex be taboo would not expedite that decline. These days if a girl isn’t having anal she is considered a prude. If people knew it caused aids that would not be the case, right. </p>

<p>AIDs is just around 300 dieseases that are allegedly caused by HIV. I don’t know what you are mentioning. All the AIDs dieseases exist without HIV. </p>
