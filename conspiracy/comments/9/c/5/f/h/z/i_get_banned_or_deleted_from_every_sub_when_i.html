       Homosexual pederasts are abusing children in the Catholic church. I get banned or deleted whenever I mention this:

       I am posting here to get banned and deleted and prove that this sub is a honeypot. You are all the "sheep" you deride. Redditors support and cover for abusers when it is convenient for them. They cover for the Rotherham abusers. They cover for the Hollywood abusers. They cover for the pederast priest abusers. This is the god's honest truth.

       The best way to tell if a conspiracy is true is if it is banned from this sub. If it is banned from this sub, then there is probably grounds to believe it. If it is left up, it is because the sicko shills who moderate this place know it to be false.

       The only conspiracy here is the existence of god lol it’s known that priests molest little boys. No one cares enough to do anything. It’s not a cover-up; it is ignorance that mutes these headlines.

       You gotta chill, bro. You might’ve been deleted from another sub for posting your opinion about it but I don’t think you’ll get it here. 
Well, you might, but you’re going a little psycho loco there, so it’d be understandable.

       We will see. Redditors are the stupidest people on the internet (this is not a specific attack against a specific user! please note, you "super smart and totally not retarded" mods!). I can only assume this place is home to the lowest of the low, the most gullible and easily duped.

       He was likely just a troll stirring shit, or some deranged guy with a persecution complex. My guess, judging how he kinda fumbles his way through explaining his position, is he was trying to imitate the kind of user he's representing here. Read his beliefs as the opposite of those stated, and you got a pretty poor troll. I got a lot of respect for a quality troll man. This was probably a 6th grader trying to impress his friends or something.

       i kinda read him as one of two things... either he was a not that bright person that had in earnest tried to discuss pedogate on one of the main subs OR he was a troll that liked whip-its. i was hoping for the former.. but you're probably right.

       Dude it’s got nothing to do with it not being true, it’s monstrous, fucking vile shit that needs to stop! I think the problem is tarring all homosexuals as paedophiles. Its a stigma gay men have had to deal with for a long time and still persists. It’s the same as when people claim that all middle eastern people are paedophiles, it’s an ignorant over generalisation. Obviously some are, but also some straight white people are peadophiles also.

       I’m with you on getting them out of any place of power and or institutions. My problem with your argument is there is no accurate statistics for abuse victims or for percent of population that are homosexual. How many abuse victims never come forward and how many homosexual people never come out because of being stigmatised by ignorant people like yourself, there are no accurate statistics. Secondly most paedophilia is about power over the victim not sex, so being a homosexual has not so much to do with the matter. It matters only that they dominate another human. So telling me to do the math with bad statistical data is ignorant and short sighted on your part.

       You think this guy would hang out with the original Jesus?  He'd be a dark skinned Mideastern male under the age of 35.  That dude probably wouldn't even sit next to him on a plane much less care what he would have done.

       The thing is is that back in the day, maybe these people are 60 and up now, gay men were steered to the church.  If u were gay, but became a priest and were celibate THEN u weren't committing a crime per the Bible.  Ur gay, but don't have gay sex.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up in the Catholic Church and many times I wondered if the priests were gay because of stereotypical mannerisms and speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for being banned, of course u r. Ur not wrong in what u say, but it is a narrative the press won't play.  It's kinda the dirty secret no one wants to talk about.  In Boston, the overwhelming/mass majority of abuse by priests were boys.

       I think the real problem is that gay men think they can be "cured" of their homosexuality by running to religion. That shit aint gonna help. The Catholic church needs to change their attitude on priests marrying as well. Also? No more "altar boys" The church has proven they can't be trusted with children.

       woah, woah... it might help to take a look around this sub in particular... we don't ban people for discussing pedogate and its many insidious religious, political, and corporate instruments.  i had not seen this information before, and i thank you for it. it will be added to my archives.

       maybe try not to get banned and find places exist for people like us? they do exist, and we need you.
