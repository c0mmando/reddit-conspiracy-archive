<p>I am posting here to get banned and deleted and prove that this sub is a honeypot. You are all the &quot;sheep&quot; you deride. Redditors support and cover for abusers when it is convenient for them. They cover for the Rotherham abusers. They cover for the Hollywood abusers. They cover for the pederast priest abusers. This is the god&#39;s honest truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was likely just a troll stirring shit, or some deranged guy with a persecution complex. My guess, judging how he kinda fumbles his way through explaining his position, is he was trying to imitate the kind of user he&#39;s representing here. Read his beliefs as the opposite of those stated, and you got a pretty poor troll. I got a lot of respect for a quality troll man. This was probably a 6th grader trying to impress his friends or something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m with you on getting them out of any place of power and or institutions. My problem with your argument is there is no accurate statistics for abuse victims or for percent of population that are homosexual. How many abuse victims never come forward and how many homosexual people never come out because of being stigmatised by ignorant people like yourself, there are no accurate statistics. Secondly most paedophilia is about power over the victim not sex, so being a homosexual has not so much to do with the matter. It matters only that they dominate another human. So telling me to do the math with bad statistical data is ignorant and short sighted on your part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is is that back in the day, maybe these people are 60 and up now, gay men were steered to the church.  If u were gay, but became a priest and were celibate THEN u weren&#39;t committing a crime per the Bible.  Ur gay, but don&#39;t have gay sex.</p>

<p>I grew up in the Catholic Church and many times I wondered if the priests were gay because of stereotypical mannerisms and speech.</p>

<p>As for being banned, of course u r. Ur not wrong in what u say, but it is a narrative the press won&#39;t play.  It&#39;s kinda the dirty secret no one wants to talk about.  In Boston, the overwhelming/mass majority of abuse by priests were boys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>woah, woah... it might help to take a look around this sub in particular... we don&#39;t ban people for discussing pedogate and its many insidious religious, political, and corporate instruments.  i had not seen this information before, and i thank you for it. it will be added to my archives. </p>
