<p>Everybody? Sure, if they were glued to their TVs watching the prerecorded CGI show unfold.</p>

<p>Ten years after 9/11 the above link summarised all recorded eyewitness testimony even vaguely mentioning a plane for the second tower.</p>

<p>What proportion are from media, military or government employees? Do you trust them?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there are videos of the first plane hitting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is one solitary clip known to exist, the Naudet brothers. Several versions can be found online, all of which have notable differences revealing it also to be a shoddy CGI fabrication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 911 no plane theory to me is a psyop that&#39;s hijacked the debate. There are dozens and dozens of eye witnesses that report a large jet flying towards the Pentagon and not one that said there was a cruise missile. The Pentagon has a real incentive to not release the security tapes because its created a smokescrean with a false debate to obfuscate the real events of the day. I feel confident those tapes show a plane and that the PA crash was simply shot down, which explains the debris spread and small entry in the ground. </p>

That&#39;s a TON of people to plant to give false testimony and keep hushed. </p>

<p>To me it makes a lot more sense to use a plane outfitted with remote control drone technology than using a missile during the early morning commute in broad daylight. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re on the east coast but the Pentagon is smack dab in the middle of DC and is surrounded by highways and apartment highrise buildings. A missile would be so much more obvious the whole affair was orchestrated by the government. I just don&#39;t see why they&#39;d use a missile when a drone outfitted plane would accomplish the same goal and raise much less suspicion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another reason its not a missile is because no one in that entire military area reported the sound of a missile. Even flight 93 being shot down had actual reports of veterans hearing the telltale sign of a missile. Meanwhile the pentagon has reports of a plane. A less well know witness reporting came from a Hispanic man speaking in Spanish. Im a Spanish speaker and it was the first time I heard that witness. He described a plane 100% however he specifically noted it looking like a corporate jet and NOT a big plane. Others have done the math and the damage to the pentagon should&#39;ve been much larger. You could even just look at a picture of the damage before the outer wall fell/was demolished! Its clear a giant 180+ft wingspan plane did not slam into it.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t have to be light to get airborne, that&#39;s not how wings work. They have &#39;do not walk&#39; sign on them in the weaker sections that aren&#39;t designed to take a direct load on an unsupported panel, that doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t structurally sound.

<p>Yes they do, and yes it is.</p>

<p>Aircraft designers are constantly seeking stronger, lighter materials to save fuel. The leading edge of a wing only has to be strong enough to withstand air pressure and the type of forces the aircraft will experience in flight. The fuselage is a hollow tube. </p>

<p>Aircraft are not engineered for or capable of cutting through structural steel, not even at “590mph” (lol).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, wings don&#39;t have to be light to fly. That&#39;s not how aerodynamics works. Yes, you want your aircraft to be light, but not so light as to compromise structural rigidity. The Airbus A380 wings each weigh about 30 tons before their fuel tanks are filled up. </p>

<p>The leading edge of larger aircraft like airliners are quite robust, as they are fitted with slats. The aircraft that hit the towers were supposed to be 767s, and they have leading-edge slats, so the wing leading edges are not light and delicate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All fixed wing aircraft leave wake vortices. Wake vortex is a phenomenon caused at the wingtip of an aircraft in flight. It’s only visible when the air itself is not clear, such as in cloud or... smoke ;)</p>

<p>Try to find evidence of wake vortices in either the Naudet Brothers clip or in any of the other clips.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, there is only <strong>one clip</strong> out of dozens available that <em>faintly suggests</em> a wake vortex <em>may have been</em> present for the second tower explosion. Incidentally this footage was released much later, seemingly as a response to an otherwise <strong>impossible anomaly</strong>, if aircraft really had struck the towers.</p>

<p>Well fancy that.</p>

<p>Like so many details in the badly produced 9/11 footage, this relatively newer clip also doesn’t hold up to scrutiny and also doesn’t reconcile with the rest of the evidence. No surprises there for those who have studied the footage in detail.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you think they&#39;re important, given that it was a clear crisp morning, not conditions conducive for forming such vortices. Also, the flight path of the second plane was from a different direction to where the smoke was blowing, and was dropping from a higher altitude, so it wouldn&#39;t disturb teh smoke until the very last instant at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vortices follow the plane’s path for quite some time, up to a minute or so. They should have been visible as soon as the smoke from the “impact” plumed into the space where the aircraft was supposed to have been moments earlier.</p>

<p>The problem is that in all clips but one no vortex swirling is visible at all. The one clip that (barely) shows it was released much later than the ones that completely fail to show the vortices.</p>

<p>It’s one of many puzzle pieces that, together, prove the video footage is a fabrication and cannot possibly be real world.</p>

<p>If you still find such fluid dynamics hard to believe, try finding footage of an aircraft going through a cloud or smoke <em>without</em> producing wake vortices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know all about fluid dynamics, as amongst other things I design ductwork systems. </p>

<p>The plane&#39;s path, for the last few seconds, was quite straight and level, and after the impact the smoke is pluming up out of the large center-mass impact hole. Why would you expect the smoke to plume back and out to where the vortices would be? At best the smoke might find the vortex off the starboard wingtip, as that was higher, but it would never meet the port wingtip vortex, as that was so much lower. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is only true from a few angles. The majority of angles, in particular the various side-on and directly below shots show a large smoke cloud expelled in all directions. There is no evidence of wake vortex on any of them.</p>

<p>To reiterate: I don’t believe any footage depicts the reality of what happened on 9/11. This is why the smoke plume sometimes seems to be going up and away, and in other clips it appears to be spreading out in all directions, including directly back into the alleged path of the alleged aircraft. </p>

<p>The best explanation for why all released footage is so inconsistent and incompatible with the laws of physics is that most or all of it is fabricated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I used to laugh when people used to tell me that. I looked into it a little further and certain things weren&#39;t adding up. How fast the plane supposably was going was impossible, the fact that you could hit the building at that speed and still control it was impossible, supposedly these are amateurs yet they could do things that veteran Pilots couldn&#39;t do, the wing disappearing behind the building, its nose poking out of the side of the building which is impossible, the exact moment when it hit the building all four networks covering the story all blacked out simultaneously, the passengers on the plane making phone calls from there 2001 cell phones and being able to connect? Doesn&#39;t add up. Jet fuel melting Steel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were to believe what that plane did on 9/11 in my flight school, you wouldn&#39;t have passed the course nor would you have made it out of the simulator. 500+ knots at ground level? (impossible) 500+ knots at ground level without breaking apart? (impossible) Able to be controlled with precision at those speeds by amateurs even though veteran pilots have said they could not do what they did and hit there target. Poking out of a steel concrete building? Left wing disappearing behind a building before impact? (?) Plane melting into the building like butter and not breaking apart into pieces and falling to the ground as one would expect. People making phone calls from a plane with their personal phone from their 2001 cell phones. (Once that was brought up, the government changed it to &quot; they made the calls from the planes land line phones&quot;. lol initially it was their cell phones then they switched it b/c it didn&#39;t make sense. lol)  Once again, this is a discussion board. Lets do just that. The name calling and the swearing is completely unnecessary.</p>

<p>Poking out of a steel concrete building?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something I read while investigating the 9/11 situation that I don&#39;t frequently see sited (cited?) was from a physics perspective</p>

<p>In layman&#39;s terms, the end result of a plane flying into the WTC building (the aftermath) would be the same whether the plane hit the building or the building hit the plane</p>

<p>The writer described it as follows (phrased as a question):</p>

<p>&quot;If you picked up one of the world trade center buildings and swung it like a baseball bat at 500 mph at an aluminum plane, what do you think the result would be?&quot;</p>

<p>This got me thinking</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy for our brains to think of a plane flying into a building, a resulting explosion, heat, melted steel, weight of concrete, building collapse, blah, blah, blah</p>

<p>Without thinking through everything that is wrong with this scenario, it seems plausible</p>

<p>BUT !! ... Think about it the other way and it makes no sense at all</p>

<p>IF you swatted the plane out of the sky by swinging the building at 500 miles an hour, you would expect the plane to be smashed to shit with relatively no damage being done to the building</p>

<p>The original author explained this much better than I did, but when you think about it everything doesn&#39;t make so much sense anymore</p>

That&#39;s a TON of people to plant to give false testimony and keep hushed. </p>

<p>To me it makes a lot more sense to use a plane outfitted with remote control drone technology than using a missile during the early morning commute in broad daylight. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re on the east coast but the Pentagon is smack dab in the middle of DC and is surrounded by highways and apartment highrise buildings. A missile would be so much more obvious the whole affair was orchestrated by the government. I just don&#39;t see why they&#39;d use a missile when a drone outfitted plane would accomplish the same goal and raise much less suspicion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another reason its not a missile is because no one in that entire military area reported the sound of a missile. Even flight 93 being shot down had actual reports of veterans hearing the telltale sign of a missile. Meanwhile the pentagon has reports of a plane. A less well know witness reporting came from a Hispanic man speaking in Spanish. Im a Spanish speaker and it was the first time I heard that witness. He described a plane 100% however he specifically noted it looking like a corporate jet and NOT a big plane. Others have done the math and the damage to the pentagon should&#39;ve been much larger. You could even just look at a picture of the damage before the outer wall fell/was demolished! Its clear a giant 180+ft wingspan plane did not slam into it.</p>
