<p>I was going through insta stories, saw that one of my friend is travelling and he has posted the picture of his Indigo airline ticket maybe waiting at the airport.
Now, he has not typed anything on the picture itself, but all the text about the journey, time, destination, etc are clearly visible and ofcourse the huge indigo logo is there on the ticket.</p>

<p>Now after couple of other stories a sponsored Indigo story came on my screen, about flights starting from this amount and that amount etc was written and the sponsored story was from Indigo and not from make my trip or anything else.</p>

<p>So in conclusion, this can be a huge coincidence or the thing can be that smartphones are getting powerful day by day and google may have developed an algorythm to analyse anything on the screen something like google glasses(included in photos app) which keeps scanning logos and texts of picture and all those kinds of stuff and also there is a debate about your phone listening to you as well.</p>

<p>So, they might be using a fraction of the processing power of your octa core phone for their algorythm to show ads based on what is in your screen.</p>

<p>bottle of cologne i had not used or spoken about in 5+ years was near my phone. i had not mentioned aloud or typed a message in regards to which cologne i had. </p>

<p>guess what the first ad i got was for? the exact same type and brand of cologne. its especially funny because,  5 years ago, when the bottle ran out, i couldn&#39;t find the same type/brand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is that the algorithms they use are really really good at predicting what sort of things you personally would shop for. This is why personal data has value to companies. Once they get enough data on someone they can build a profile that is scary good at knowing what you want to consume. Couple that with everyone&#39;s natural tendency towards confirmation bias and paranoia and there you go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spot on regarding building a profile. My education including quite a bit of data science theory and coding - I think we all underestimate how good the algorithms are. What&#39;s interesting to me is how and when we are targeted after our profile has sufficient data.</p>

<p>For example, I&#39;m in the process of joining the military. Today I unboxed a brand new Win10 PC and made a local account on the company network. I didn&#39;t use my name anywhere. When the &#39;Welcome to Windows&#39; newsfeed loaded up, the top &quot;articles&quot; are about the best uses for a military discount and the top 5 military bases. My theory is location data and a bit of guess work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I think it is an uncomfortable truth that we are rather predictable in our actions. Everyone wants to think of themselves as this unique being, and you are, but not that unique in terms of the range of possible preferences and life choices. We are a products of our environment. Plug in enough data points and you can get a some really highly accurate predictions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Often when I&#39;m scrolling through Facebook, there will be pictures that my friends have posted that haven&#39;t loaded yet; the picture is replaced with text describing the picture (&quot;girl, smile, outdoors&quot;) until the picture loads.</p>

<p>Clearly websites are analyzing the content of pictures that are posted/uploaded, and would probably argue that they&#39;re not doing it for nefarious purposes. This is more or less common knowledge. </p>

<p>Pictures that have text in them would seem particularly easy to analyze. </p>

<p>It is also more or less common knowledge that websites and applications are constantly collecting this information in order to market and advertise products and services to us and are friends.</p>

<p>In short, everything you mentioned is completely plausible based on what we currently know about how digital media operates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting catch. Actually LetItGo has awesome picture recognition. It&#39;s an app where you buy/sell things, but you can take a pic of whatever you want to sell and it will automatically identify it! Google/IG/FB must be using a similar approach. Also i&#39;m sure they can time scroll speed to know how long you looked at a photo. Since you were probably trying to read the writing on ticket, you must have spent longer than usual on this particular photo. The algo picked this anomaly up, used its picture recognition software to figure out what pic had you so interested. Learned it was a plane ticket and served you up with a ticket offer ad.  </p>
