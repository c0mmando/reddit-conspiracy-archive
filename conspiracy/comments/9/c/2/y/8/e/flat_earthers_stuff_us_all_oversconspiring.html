Lets keep our conspiracies based in the realm of truth otherwise we can&#39;t actually influence society!</p>

<p>Not a one of you will explain how FE works I mean you, as a group, don&#39;t even have something as simple as a map.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with anti vaccine is that they prefer to cherry pick statistics; and then supplement it with arguments that appeal to an evangelical community, and arguments that apply to non-science educated community. </p>

<p>As such, it amounts to spreading misinformation of the worst sort. You start by presenting Andrew Wakefield’s study, which on large scales is totally discredited. </p>

<p>Then you point out that it constrains chlorine, which is a poison. Somebody without a science education may believe that, as chlorine is a poison. It just happens to be that saline solution is not a poison. Oxygen is poisonous too. </p>

<p>Then you say that there is foetal matter in a vaccine; for no other reason then to arouse evangelicals who have a strong opinion on this matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the FE youtube community is a money-op.  From a post I have made in the past.</p>

<p>If you look at Google trends you will see that interest in FE is way down. They main people behind pushing it these day (for $$$ in my opinion) are Mark Sargent / Patricia Steer / Robbie Davidson (Runs the various Flat Earth conferences), FECORE see the board members list on their website (checking how it has changed via the WayBack machine is interesting), Jeranism, Bob (Globebusters), and a few others.</p>

<p>Attendance at the recent Canada conference was way below expectations. It was so low that they streamed it for free despite saying it would cost and taking money from a few for the ability to watch the streams.</p>

<p>Everyone I mentioned uses their real names on their websites and youtube channels. I haven&#39;t doxed anyone this is all public knowledge.</p>

<p>For example Jearn, according to his own words, bring in 67% or more of his income from his Pateron subscribers so he has a vested interest in pushing FE.</p>

<p>I find it comical the notion that flat earth is a psyop to discredit conspiracy theorists, as if getting rid of it would suddenly bring credibility to the community. Who cares about credibility anyway? News flash: those people were never going to listen to us. They think people landed on the Moon, ffs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here’s an idea; Why don’t you worry about your own beliefs instead of telling others what to believe? </p>

<p>The whole purpose of this sub is to be a platform for free thought. The only reason you believe the Earth is round is because <em>someone told you</em> the Earth is round. But rather than doing your own empirical research you just took their word for it. You didn’t ask questions. You didn’t <em>think</em> about it. You just accepted what the “authorities” on knowledge told you...</p>

<p>Flat Earth is not a ridiculous conspiracy. It doesn’t make anyone look bad. Have you proven with your own research that the Earth is indeed round? Didn’t think so.</p>

<p>If you want to keep conspiracy’s isolated to the realm of “truth” according you, then you should just spend your time in the politics sub. All of your completely fake political distractions that you wish were real conspiracies will do well there.</p>

<p>Once that is done math happens then you are left with 2 points.  One point will be much higher than the others so you disregard it. </p>

<p>That is how GPS works at a basic level.  You can verify this for yourself with a Software Defined Radion, and Antenna, and free open source software.</p>

<p>Have you ever measured how far the Sun moves across the sky throughout the day? It&#39;s something you can actually measure yourself without fancy equipment.  No matter how you measure it, the answer is always 15<strong>°</strong>/hr<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>No matter where you are on Earth, no matter what time of day it is, when you measure the Sun&#39;s movement, it will be 15 degrees per hour. This is incontrovertible fact. Even when two people watch the Sun at the same time from opposite sides of the United States, both of them see the sun moving 15<strong>°</strong>/hr, all day long.</p>

<p>No flat Earth model can accommodate this one simple, easily observable, undeniable fact. However, the spinning globe model can explain this motion perfectly. The spin, the orbit, and the tilt explain so much of our natural world so perfectly, yet your answer is &quot;science lies&quot;.</p>

<p>The Earth simply is not flat.</p>

<p>I can show you endless diagrams of what I am talking about... The seasons, the procession, eclipses, can all be explained with simple diagrams that can be found on just about any educational website.</p>

<p><strong>Show me just one flat Earth diagram that demonstrates how the Sun can move 15°/hr.</strong> It&#39;s an impossibility... The flat Earth model just can&#39;t support this undeniable fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one has ever made that model. Probably because of people like you who are too proud and indoctrinated to even consider evidence against round Earth theory. </p>

<p>You give the human race too much credit.  For a “catholic” you also seem pretty devoted to science over faith.</p>

<p>What you fail to understand is just how big the deception is. If the Earth is indeed flat and not round it completely changes our understanding of space, the universe, and pretty much reality itself. Deception is the name of the game, and it is the reason why we are where we are today.</p>

<p>Let me ask you this; do you believe we actually went to the moon? If the answer is “yes”, then why have we not gone back since the 60’s? I mean, technology is so much more advanced now it should be easy right? What does NASA even do these days?</p>

<p>Listen, this is my point: It’s extremely arrogant and equally ignorant to claim that you know without a shred of doubt that the Earth is round. You can’t say you “know” unless you have proven it with your <em>own</em> research and are prepared to present the evidence in full detail.</p>

<p>Why do you feel the need to squash debate on this subject? Does it really bother you that much? Why not let people who are interested in this conspiracy come to their own conclusions? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve done the exercise to achieve the measurement that the Sun moves across the sky 15°/hr three times. Once with my father, once with my oldest son, and again with my youngest. But don&#39;t trust me... You can easily do this yourself. Spoiler: You&#39;ll get 15°/hr.</p>

<p>(My father was a Navy pilot. When I was young, he taught me some basics of navigation.  We started with observing the sky...)</p>

<p>There are only two models in which the Sun can traverse the sky at a rate of 15°/hr. One where the Sun orbits the Earth and one where the Earth is rotating. Go ahead and get yourself a compass and try to diagram any other model that can support the incontrovertible fact that the Sun moves across the sky at a rate of 15 degrees per hour. Spoiler: Can&#39;t be done.</p>

<p>Further observation of the &quot;wandering stars&quot; indicates orbits around the Sun just like our own, so the &quot;Sun orbits the Earth&quot; model is discarded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can’t say you “know” unless you have proven it with your own research</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did my own researched. It was a simple exercise to measure the Sun&#39;s movement and confirm that it moves 15°/hr.  That fact holds true morning, noon, and evening; no matter where are on Earth.  That is the only proof one needs to completely dismiss flat-Earth because NO f-E model can support this undeniable fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you feel the need to squash debate on this subject?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because flat-Earth theory is the stuff of utter morons.  This nonsense reaches people... Kids in middle school are led to this topic and my kid comes home wanting to know how his own friends could be so stupid. So, we get out the craft supplies and make a rudimentary sextant like thingy so we can measure the angles ourselves.</p>

<p>Flat-Earth is a con that preys on the simple minded. 15°/hr kills it dead in its tracks.</p>
