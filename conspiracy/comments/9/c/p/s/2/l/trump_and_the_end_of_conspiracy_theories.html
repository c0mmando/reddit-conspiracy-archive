        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Serious question.
Trump has insulted and humiliated his intelligence services many many times. He has sided with Putin in Russia while publicly telling the world his CIA and FBI are wrong.
And NOBODY has managed to put him into the modern equivalent of an open top motorcade in Dallas.
No-one has slipped anything into his covfefe.
This to me is significant.
Presumably any extra terrestrial info he would have access to or be told about if asked. And if he knows this there is NO WAY he’s gonna keep quiet about it.</p>

<p>So does this mean the idea of an all powerful CIA and secret service and alien conspiracy etc etc MUST be wrong?
Has Trump not proved that there are no big conspiracy theories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that sort of thing. 
Any kind of big serious backroom bilderberg group illuminati type nonsense would never in a MILLION years have such a liability running the show. Someone with hundreds of people lining up with sex scandals and shady business crap and someone so easy to blackmail with pee tapes etc. No-one would ever allow that to be in charge. 
So doesn’t he fit into the ‘random shit that happens from time to time’ category? Thereby making a nonsense of any kind of secret world order.</p>

<p>Can you imagine his being briefed on the Roswell crash (if it were aliens) and being able to not shout about it on twitter and somehow blame immigrants or Hillary? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I don&#39;t understand. How could <em>any</em> candidate get into office if the Deep State (all powerful as it is) approve of them? Wouldn&#39;t winning an election be <em>nothing</em> for them? I know, I know, people always say they got sloppy because they were cocky about Clinton, but the election was very close for several months. You want me to believe this entity that aims to control the entire world and basically does--they wouldn&#39;t <em>just in case</em> add in a few extra ballots or change some electronic votes or tell the media (that they control) to hold off on reporting election results until they had okayed it??? <em>No one</em>* thought to do that?!</p>

<p>Then the Deep State must have very little control, if any, and is not the danger people speak about. I can&#39;t comprehend that the above is true and that the Deep State is as powerful as they say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s more of a story I can believe. I think the Deep State knew and planned for Trump to be elected - or at the very least they were not disappointed or surprised and are working with him now. I can see it one of two ways: Trump is truly an idiot who has no idea what&#39;s going on and basically rubber stamps whatever his handles ask him to, albeit with the occasional rant on Twitter or at an event; OR he&#39;s fully involved in his presidency and there is no Deep State, or at least not a very powerful, shady one working to bring him down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you not see that Donald Chabad Lubavitcher Trump is playing a role - that his campaign and presidency were a (continuation of) sophisticated Reality TV? Also the reverse-psychology techniques used during the campaign (and still used to this day) is quite remarkable.</p>

<p>Heck, every last corporation uses “control groups” to (statistically) gauge their products/packaging. Yet people seem oblivious to the fact the fake outrage peddled by the media is not meant in the first-degree.</p>

<p>About the “Putin hacked the USA” meme, again, it is fake and scripted. It isn’t meant to be believed by most people. And <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/putins-rabbi-says-challenging-governments-is-not-jewish/">Putin is governed by the same messianic freaks.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you could well be right. It’s less about the politicos and more about his open insults to the intelligence community. His first speech as president was in front of the memorial at the CIA and all he did was brag about inauguration ratings. Immensely disrespectful and it has gone on from there.
Irrespective of his politics the fact that he so openly hates a very large, very well armed and resourced group that we are led to believe can literally take anyone out - doesn’t his continued presence dispute that familiar idea?</p>

<p>I’m not saying I like the idea of an all powerful secret group but people openly will talk about alien cover ups and fake moon landings and CIA doing 9/11 and all the usual bullshit - my question is how can be true in a world where they also allow Trump to keep insulting them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, consider what JFK was doing to uncover and disrupt things. This is one of the reasons many people believe his assassination wasn’t what it seemed, along with many other aspects of it I won’t get into in this comment. </p>

<p>So far, Trump has done nothing to warrant an assassination from these people. He publicly insults, but does nothing of real substance towards them, and when he does “humiliate” them, it’s never taken serious by anybody anyway, so would it truly matter if he began to anyway? A lot of people hate the man, and everything out of his mouth, whether it be true or not. </p>

<p>Different people/family and time. We have the internet now and Trump supporters are nothing like JFK supporters. JFK was a near untouchable which is why I think the only way they got away with it was because they had the blessings of his elders. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same reason Sanders took the mat at the Dem Convention after two years of telling massive rallies that he would absolutely contest any questionable convention.</p>

<p>If that convention wasn&#39;t held in question after all the shenanigans caught on phone recordings........ /s</p>

<p>If any future candidate has grandchildren/children they love.....TPTB have you by the nuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are many levels to the elite running the swamp. it is so so deep no one will ever be charged other than a little fall guy. they are all intertwined by blackmail and association. trump is a part of it all, but the businessman in him i think wants to do somethings right. he is a narcissist tweeter twit. but what else does he have as the news is our enemy they lie to us. Its the only way he can defend himself i guess to me anyway. to me its like they give him a little rope and he like all the rest have to play along in other areas. but hey what do i know. I do know w 90 some Muslims running for ofc and many will win, we are in for big doo doo down the road, especially if the left takes back the house. Maybe we get lucky and w news telling us Trumps approval ratings are so bad, they won&#39;t vote. Then again there are the ilegals, and in Co Golden Mayor wants voters to start age 16. Some other City is trying as well. Voting does no good in that both parties are the same just diff way of going about things.. I believe its called the Swamp, now i see John Kerry is thinking of running, and he just might win can you imagine  him President?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Few possibilities first one is trump is a baffoon and isn&#39;t an actual threat to the deep state and if anything what he&#39;s doing is just being noicy on the world stage and the deep state is ussing the msm to cover up what they&#39;re actually doing with 24/7 coverage of trump and his stupid shit.</p>

<p>Option 2 is trump is part of the deep state, he is super wealthy and has been rubbing shoulders with people and this is all scripted</p>

<p>Option 3 which is what I think is the case, the world is super complicated and there isn&#39;t a deep state just just a lot of very powerful people that all have opposing interests and all are pulling in opposite directions and trump somehow got elected because the election isn&#39;t rigged and he won a popularity contest and now he&#39;s is in the middle of things that are way over his head and he&#39;s just throwing shit at everything but not really leading any ground breaking policy changes </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So does this mean the idea of an all powerful CIA and secret service and alien conspiracy etc etc MUST be wrong? Has Trump not proved that there are no big conspiracy theories?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not entirely wrong. The CIA is still a very powerful organization. But that doesn&#39;t mean they are godlike... There&#39;s still a huge human element and humans make errors. It is entirely possible, but not very likely, that Trump succeeded due to such an error, and he is now facing the full might of the CIA from a position where he can weather the storm if he wants to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TLDR; some of the Deep State wanted HRC to win. Others wanted HRC to lose and any winner is a means to this end, even one straight from the WWF.</p>

<p>The Deep State is like a monarchy but possibly without a recognized king. So, not a monarchy exactly, just some similarities. Think of the 1% and the Deep State as a big aristocracy feuding amongst themselves like in a feudal system of government.</p>

<p>Behind the Deep State are the ultra-wealthy 1% (wealth, not taxible income). The 1% are not really unified; they struggle (feud) with each other to gain more power and wealth amongst themselves to an extent. (Of course, they would unite for sure against a threat.)</p>

<p>So these separate forces of the 1% apply their power to the CIA, FBI and the other alphabet agencies and also direct their power towards politicians of all colors. Remember, their power is feudal and not unified, so the powers delegated to the alphabet agencies are also not unified.</p>

<p>For a reason &quot;why they donT kill the bad guy&quot;, first remember, he is only &quot;<em>bad</em>&quot; for some of our Oligarchs, not for all of them. Our Oligarchs are structured and work like a &quot;mafia&quot;. <strong>One could say, the govT is the strongest mafia of any country.</strong> The govT holds total authority over all violence and protection like a mafia gang does.</p>

<p>In movies, we see the mafia killing each other, but IRL, they have turfs and &quot;agreements&quot; with each other which they tend to respect. &quot;Gentleman&#39;s Agreements&quot; and we are their pawns. </p>

<p>Should the Blue Side kill our WWF Star, the Red Side would declare war, mafia style, not necessary Civil War II.</p>
