<p>I just stumbled across this theory in another thread and had to look it up.</p>

<p>If Justice Scalia was assassinated (which other theories out there suggest) why would the Clinton campaign have anything to do with it?</p>

<p>Snopes denies the theory as false claiming wetwork refers to a media smear campaign against Sanders, but something seems odd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes more sense in the full context of that particular email. The email was sent on the same exact day Clinton lost to Bernie in New Hampshire by 20 points. 
This also helps explain what he meant by &#39;rough night.&#39; </p>

<p>So arguably it makes more sense he&#39;s referring to the upcoming terminations or reassigning of people who worked for the campaign. Referring to it as &quot;wetwork&quot; is obviously meant to be hyperbolic. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t think wet works meant pool parties at the Vineyard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1. The email exchange is between John Podesta and Steve Elmendorf of <a href="http://teamsubjectmatter.com/">teamsubjectmatter.com</a>, a media consultant.</p>

<p>2. The email was sent February 9, 2016. This was the date of the New Hamphsire Democratic primary. It was a bad night for Hillary Clinton because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_Democratic_primary,_2016#Results">Bernie Sanders trounced her</a>.</p>

<p>3. The phrase &quot;pool parties at the Vineyard&quot; refers to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BkspUIS.png">this picture</a> of Bernie Sanders by the pool at a party on Martha&#39;s Vineyard. The party was an event for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Senatorial_Campaign_Committee">Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC)</a>.</p>

<p>Back in February of 2016, Bernie Sanders was attacking Hillary Clinton on all the big money donations she had accepted. The Clinton campaign tried to paint Sanders as hypocritical, pointing out that he had participated in big money Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraising events.</p>

<p>This is how the story was playing in the media that week:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/sanders-democratic-fundraisers/">2016-02-05 CNN: Bernie Sanders: Prolific Democratic Party fundraiser</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/sanders-campaign-finance-purity-not-always-possible">2016-02-07 MSNBC For Sanders, campaign finance purity not always possible</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So we can look at the emails from the preceding three days.</p>

<p>On the night of Saturday, February 6, Tina Fournoy, Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32693">sends an email</a> to the Hillary Clinton campaign with an attachment, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BkspUIS.png">IMG_0692.JPG</a>, and the description &quot;Bernie at the DSCC retreat&quot;. The campaign staff <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=DSCC&amp;amp;mfrom=&amp;amp;mto=&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;notitle=&amp;amp;date_from=2016-01-01&amp;amp;date_to=2016-12-31&amp;amp;nofrom=&amp;amp;noto=&amp;amp;count=50&amp;amp;sort=1#searchresult">discuss what to do with it</a>: &quot;Omg&quot; &quot;Can we tweet it?&quot; &quot;I think we shd give to NY post&quot;. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34299">&quot;I got it from a friend who took it. Do what you will with it - probably better if we got someone else to do it&quot;</a>. &quot;DSCC event in edgartown [Martha&#39;s Vineyard] last July.&quot; &quot;Will send briefing for the event with attendees.&quot;</p>

<p>So this leads to the email <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/14833">&quot;MV DSCC 2015 guest list&quot;</a>: &quot;Guests at the retreat. will have briefing in the am or later tonight&quot;. Attached is a spreadsheet with a list of guests. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/AKrZylJ.png">Number 88: Steve Elmendorf</a>, a Hillary supporter, &quot;low dollar&quot; fundraiser, and a partner in a <a href="http://teamsubjectmatter.com/">public relations firm.</a></p>

<p>The following afternoon: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9394">&quot;Thank you. We are on this.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Steve Elmendorf —who can honestly say he was at the party, even if he didn&#39;t take the picture— delivers the photo to Perez Hilton. Perez Hilton runs the photo on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePerezHilton/photos/a.428041364018074.1073741828.424686427686901/555226774632865/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BBk-2XqoauL/">Instagram</a> with the message &#39;I wonder what @MikeBloomberg would think about this??? &quot;@BernieSanders lounges at elite Martha&#39;s Vineyard pool, summer 2015, after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists.&quot;&#39;</p>

<p>There&#39;s not that much reaction to the photo, but it may have helped keep the fundraising story alive one more day: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bernie-sanders-regular-luxurious-dscc-fundraising-retreats">MSNBC: &quot;Bernie Sanders a regular at high-dollar donor retreats&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>John Podesta <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56753">emails Steve Elmendorf</a>: &quot;Thanks. Didn&#39;t think wet works meant pool parties at the Vineyard.&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;wet work&quot; was a play on words. Elmendorf was performing a &quot;covert operation&quot; by delivering the picture to the media so that it didn&#39;t look like it came from the Clinton campaign. And it was a picture taken at a pool party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but I have to call bs. Clinton was within the margin of error the entire time. Left-Wing media saw that her odds were better and blew it way out of proportion. No serious institution that&#39;s monitored previous elections actually thought it would be impossible for her to lose. You would have to be even more naive to think that the powers at be aren&#39;t the ones who actually decide who wins or not. The electoral college is there to make sure of that.  </p>

<p>FOX news is MSM. Should be obvious by now that Trump has been working with the deep state from the beginning, Clinton was just a red herring. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t think this means they murdered an innocent Supreme Justice, that&#39;s on you. But for you to imply my poor grammar and your irrelevant list is somehow proof that they didn&#39;t, is a bit comical. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetwork"><strong>Wetwork</strong></a> is a euphemism for murder or assassination, alluding to spilling blood. The expression and the similar wet job, wet affair, or wet operation—all calques of Russian terms for such activities—can be traced to criminal slang from at least the 19th century and originally meant robbery that involved murder, i.e., spilling blood.</p>

<p>These operations are reputed to have been handled by CIA, and also the KGB by Spetsbureau 13, colorfully known as the &quot;Department of Wet Affairs&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s your problem. I&#39;m not here to win or lose. I&#39;m here seeking <strong>truth</strong>. The truth is wet works means assassination in most contexts. Podesta emailed about wet works by the vineyards 3 days before Scalia died. Scalia has a vineyard beside his home. He was found with a pillow over his face. These are the facts. You can get pissed and insult all you want, it won&#39;t change the facts. It&#39;s suspicious timing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You lost because you tried imposing a <strong>lie</strong>. You tried to bs by trying to push a false narrative that only someone too stupid to actually read the emails <strong>before</strong> they try arguing would fall for. You then tried to wiggle your way out of it by pretending it was a typo, only embarrassing yourself even further. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not insulting you, you&#39;ve lost your credibility and any modicum of respect when you blatantly tried to lie to sell your argument. You <strong>lost</strong> because you tried to push a lie and I called you out on it.</p>

<p>The truth is that &quot;most&quot; contexts mean absolutely nothing in language. Probability doesn&#39;t dictate the proper appropriation of the use of a word or phrase, it is the <em>context</em> that decides the meaning. </p>

<p>In this case the context was Clinton losing the primary the same day the email was sent and the previous emails that corroborate the subject of the discussion. This would have likely resulted in a series of staff changes, a process even often referred to as a <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/02/10/get-ready-for-the-hillary-campaign-bloodbath-after-new-hampshire-loss-n2117430">bloodbath</a>.</p>

<p>You lied again, he was found with a pillow <strong>over his head.</strong> He died in his bed, fyi old people who die in their beds often have pillows near their heads. </p>

<p>Either you&#39;re lying and expecting me to blindly believe you, or you are foolish enough to blindly believe others without seeking the truth yourself. </p>

<p>I dare you to explain your argument that Wet working can mean only one thing after I&#39;ve linked you to mutiple sources destroying your argument.

<p>The context of this email was that it came after the New Hampshire primary, in which Clinton was 20 points behind Sanders. The media at the time reported likely staffing changes in the Clinton campaign as a result. &quot;Wetworks&quot; has been used to mean getting rid of staff, and that was what they were talking about here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never heard wetwork referenced as terminating employees before, but Thank you for lending an alternative theory. </p>

<p>The Clinton campaign was claiming wetwork is the term they were using to smear Sanders in the media for his Wallstreet donations whole portraying himself as the working man&#39;s candidate.</p>

<p>Yet, if you go by wikileaks summary the term wetwork doesn&#39;t appear in either of these contests in any other podesta emails.</p>

<p>Scalia was found in his room at a Texas ranch with a pillow over his face. There was no investigation or crime scene. Assuming this wasn&#39;t a case of auto erotica asphyxiation or some other embarrassing event that was kept out of public view you have to wonder about the member and the timing.</p>

<p>As others have pointed out Justice Scalia was more of a moderate with one exception. The opinion he wrote on gun control in heller VS DC is the only thing I can see which would have made him a target for Clinton. Reaffirming the individuals right to possess a firearm screws up every gun grabbing legislation Clinton would ever dream of ramming through.</p>

<p>That&#39;s like all I can see for motive </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Involuntary Turnover</p>

<p>Employee termination for poor job performance, absenteeism or violation of workplace policies is called involuntary turnover – also referred to as termination, firing or discharge. It’s involuntary because it wasn’t the employee’s decision to leave the company. Layoffs could also be considered involuntary terminations, though layoff procedures usually are handled differently from termination. Some layoffs have certain federal and state provisions that aren’t afforded to employees who are fired because of performance or policy violations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So according to the info you&#39;re giving me, turnover includes firing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are saying that lots of people were fired (high turnover) during the Clinton campaign. </p>

<p>That should be easy for you to back up with some links.</p>

<p>Actually find anyone that john podesta may have fired around 9/2/2016</p>

<p>In my opinion the email is a dark humored passing comment with no connection to Scalia. But you are peddling bullshit by trying to pass &quot;wet works&quot; off as firing people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You lost because you tried imposing a <strong>lie</strong>. You tried to bs by trying to push a false narrative that only someone too stupid to actually read the emails <strong>before</strong> they try arguing would fall for. You then tried to wiggle your way out of it by pretending it was a typo, only embarrassing yourself even further. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not insulting you, you&#39;ve lost your credibility and any modicum of respect when you blatantly tried to lie to sell your argument. You <strong>lost</strong> because you tried to push a lie and I called you out on it.</p>

<p>The truth is that &quot;most&quot; contexts mean absolutely nothing in language. Probability doesn&#39;t dictate the proper appropriation of the use of a word or phrase, it is the <em>context</em> that decides the meaning. </p>

<p>In this case the context was Clinton losing the primary the same day the email was sent and the previous emails that corroborate the subject of the discussion. This would have likely resulted in a series of staff changes, a process even often referred to as a <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/02/10/get-ready-for-the-hillary-campaign-bloodbath-after-new-hampshire-loss-n2117430">bloodbath</a>.</p>

<p>You lied again, he was found with a pillow <strong>over his head.</strong> He died in his bed, fyi old people who die in their beds often have pillows near their heads. </p>

<p>Either you&#39;re lying and expecting me to blindly believe you, or you are foolish enough to blindly believe others without seeking the truth yourself. </p>

<p>I dare you to explain your argument that Wet working can mean only one thing after I&#39;ve linked you to mutiple sources destroying your argument. I would like to see you fight your cognitive dissonance to actually embrace the truth. In all honesty, I&#39;m expecting you to remain ignorant. I dare you to prove me wrong. </p>
