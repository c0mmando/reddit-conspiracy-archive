    <div class="md"><p>It was because the numbers seen on screen actually didn&#39;t match the true numbers. A lot of it was predictive etc. If a post got say 20 upvotes in 30 seconds then at 60 seconds it would should around 40 as it was trying to follow the pattern, even if there were only 5 more upvotes in that final 30 seconds. Then after another 30 seconds it would recalculate based on the 25 upvotes it got over the past two intervals. (time frames are just an example). It made the numbers really inconsistant </p>

<p>It was something to do with &#39;hot&#39; topics getting on the front page without having the figures of other top posts.</p>

<p>Now if something gets upvoted a lot really quickly it will just not display a number at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brutality in just one word... Very beautiful!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A central idea of Foucault’s panopticism concerns the systematic ordering and controlling of human populations through subtle and often unseen forces. Such ordering is apparent in many parts of the modernized and now, increasingly digitalized, world of information. Contemporary advancements in technology and surveillance techniques have perhaps made Foucault’s theories more pertinent to any scrutiny of the relationship between the state and its population.</p>

<p>However, while on one hand, new technologies, such as CCTV or other surveillance cameras, have shown the continued utility of panoptic mechanisms in liberal democracies, it could also be argued that electronic surveillance technologies are unnecessary in the original &quot;organic&quot; or &quot;geometric&quot; disciplinary mechanisms as illustrated by Foucault. Foucault argues, for instance, that Jeremy Bentham&#39;s Panopticon provides us with a model in which a self-disciplined society has been able to develop. These apparatuses of behavior control are essential if we are to govern ourselves, without the constant surveillance and intervention by an &quot;agency&quot; in every aspect of our lives. The Canadian historian Robert Gellately has observed, for instance, that because of the widespread willingness of Germans to inform on each other to the Gestapo that Germany between 1933-45 was a prime example of Panopticism.[5]</p>

<p>Panoptic theory has other wide-ranging impacts for surveillance in the digital era as well. Kevin Haggerty and Richard Ericson, for instance, have hinted that technological surveillance &quot;solutions&quot; have a particularly &quot;strong cultural allure&quot; in the West.[6] Increasingly visible data, made accessible to organizations and individuals from new data-mining technologies, has led to the proliferation of “dataveillance,” which may be described as a mode of surveillance that aims to single out particular transactions through routine algorithmic production. In some cases, however, particularly in the case of mined credit card information, dataveillance has been documented to have led to a greater incidence of errors than past surveillance techniques.[7]</p>

<p>According to the tenets of Foucault&#39;s panopticism, if discursive mechanisms can be effectively employed to control and/or modify the body of discussion within a particular space (usually to the benefit of a particular governing class or organization), then there is no longer any need for an &quot;active agent&quot; to display a more overtly coercive power (i.e., the threat of violence). Since the beginning of the Information Age, there exists a debate over whether these mechanisms are being refined or accelerated, or on the other hand, becoming increasingly redundant, due to new and rapid technological advancements. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been downvoting most everything not related to cp and pedo busts. I was pretty pissed with this sub over pizzagate and since the children were handed over to DynCorp in old walmarts and drugged, separated from their families with no plan in place to reunite them this sub has gone dumb and mute. If pizzagate was so important when there were non existent victims why is it silent as the grave here now?
