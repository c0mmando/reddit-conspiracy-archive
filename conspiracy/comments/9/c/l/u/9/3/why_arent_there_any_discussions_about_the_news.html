<p>WTF are you talking about?  In case you havn&#39;t notice, there&#39;s a dude named &#39;Muelle&#39; who is going over everything Trump literally has  ever done, BASED on &quot;Russian hacking&quot;</p>

<p>The FISA court... FISA means:  &quot;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&quot;.  If there was no &quot;foreign&quot; they would not have been able to give Trump his virtual colonoscopy like they are doing now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The breach was discovered by the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) and reported to the FBI. Documents have already shown that the meeting between ICIG and the FBI took place. The FBI statement only denies that they found evidence. Of course they didn’t, it was the ICIG. </p>

<p>Too many people are using their anti-Trump / pro- Trump bias to play-out their illusions. </p>

<p>I challenge anyone here to use scholarly research methods to fact check the NYT, WaPo, CNN, Fox, MSNBC. It’s all propaganda and less than 2% of the stories are 100% true. They even lie about the non-political feel good stories they report on. </p>

<p>Hillary had an open server. It would be extremely foolish to think that it was not breached by several countries. </p>

<p>If they are used to conduct government business, they would be subject to FOIA law. The issue is that it&#39;s impossible to determine whether FOIA was complied with or not (which in itself should be evidence of non-compliance with FOIA, so should be punished with jailtime).</p>

<p>But Comey said this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a July 2016 statement, Comey said the FBI “did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked.” But, he added: “Given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence.”</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is known that hackers were aware of Clinton&#39;s non-public email address as early as 2011.[81] Secretary Clinton and her staff were aware of hacking attempts in 2011, and were reportedly worried about them.[82]
In 2012, according to server records, a hacker in Serbia scanned Clinton&#39;s Chappaqua server at least twice, in August and in December 2012. It was unclear whether the hacker knew the server belonged to Clinton, although it did identify itself as providing email services for clintonemail.com.[74] During 2014, Clinton&#39;s server was the target of repeated intrusions originating in Germany, China, and South Korea. Threat monitoring software on the server blocked at least five such attempts. The software was installed in October 2013, and for three months prior to that, no such software had been installed.[83][84]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also this in the wiki</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Security experts such as Chris Soghoian believe that emails to and from Clinton may have been at risk of hacking and foreign surveillance.[73] Marc Maiffret, a cybersecurity expert, said that the server had &quot;amateur hour&quot; vulnerabilities.[74] For the first two months after Clinton was appointed Secretary of State and began accessing mail on the server through her Blackberry, transmissions to and from the server were apparently not encrypted. On March 29, 2009, a digital certificate was obtained which would have permitted encryption.[19]</p>

<p>Page is also protected so no someone that hates Hillary didn&#39;t just write it. </p>

<p>A foreign entity that&#39;s not Russia was able to get copies of Clinton&#39;s email. This was in July before all this fiasco shit going in because of DT.</p>

<p>congressional record—house h6166 has it if you want to read or you can watch the cspan showing</p>

<p>I think Hillary had emails from the compromised agent which led China to said compromised agent. But that&#39;s a theory that&#39;s flimsy so idk. Like you said there is a completed investigation on this but I thought I would like to add something to the convo</p>

When it comes to the reports of China accessing Hillary&#39;s servers and leading to compromise of CIA agents, which was in that report, there is no evidence, no direct quotes, no named sources, nothing at all.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that <em>is</em> the dismissing talking point being repeated by MSM very loudly. You sure repeated that a ton of times in this comment thread!</p>

<p>Yet, what was first reported by the Daily Caller, was reasonable speculation based on the declassified FBI emails and Strzok hearing, where it was shown that foreign intelligence where known to have accessed Hillary&#39;s emails.</p>

<p>FBI <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/381798258/Peter-Strzok-email-about-Clinton-emails">Peter Strzok&#39;s declassified email:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is more accurate to say <strong>we know foreign actors obtained access to some of her emails (including at least one Secret one)</strong> via compromises of the private email accounts of some of her staffers. It is also accurate to say that a sophisticated foreign actor would likely have known about her private email domain, and would be competent enough not to leave a trace if they gained access. But we have seen no direct evidence they did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we have <a href="https://gohmert.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398653">Congressional press release perspective of the lie:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It’s not surprising that the FBI ‘has not found any evidence’ regarding Clinton’s servers being breached. Like I stated to Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok in the House Judiciary Hearing, <strong>it was the Obama-appointed Intelligence Community Inspector General that discovered the breach.</strong> It was not the FBI that found it, so their statement was technically correct, but very deceptive in its omission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When there is no evidence that backs up the SPECIFIC claims being made, then the claims SHOULD BE DISMISSED.</p>

<p>One secret email does not establish that Clinton&#39;s server was hacked by the Chinese and that information was used to out CIA agents.  That is the claim being made in the referenced report.</p>

<p>You are making assumptions on top of assumptions with NO EVIDENCE to back up the specific claims being made by a conservative opinion outlet. </p>

<p>We also know that the emails which were labelled Secret (which is a pretty low classification level) were done retroactively.  Even then, a single email at the Secret level would not carry enough information to compromise over 20 CIA agents.  There is no evidence that it was the Chinese.  You&#39;re making assumptions on top of assumptions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s illogical to leap to those conclusions based on the lack of evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The specific claim was made by the IG in the Congressional hearing and is still hidden/redacted/classified. The only person who knows and can freely decide to talk publicly about it, is Trump.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we have one Congressman carefully toeing the line to expose this:</p>

<p><a href="https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/29/gop-rep-china-hacked-hillarys-emails-and-strzok-li/">https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/29/gop-rep-china-hacked-hillarys-emails-and-strzok-li/</a></p>

<p>We already know about  “Dancing Panda”, where China was known to have hacked most top US officials in 2010.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/china-read-emails-top-us-officials-n406046">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/china-read-emails-top-us-officials-n406046</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We also know that the emails which were labelled Secret (which is a pretty low classification level) were done retroactively.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is factually incorrect, but also often repeated. The FBI testified that there were actually classified emails later on, when more hacked emails were exposed. Early on just some were talked about, and of those 22 had their security &quot;upgraded&quot; and early on, that was correct for what the public knew. Then more emails involved were made public and clearly contained very confidential and sensitive material that was thought to likely expose confidential informers.</p>

<p>Obviously, it was an informed speculation about China and was never presented as more than that, until the US President made the statement. It is undeniable that foreign countries have her emails, have accessed her email server, per the FBI&#39;s own assertion, and previous incidents show China specifically has accessed most top officials emails in the past.

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you hear me out it does seem believable and real that China  would and have had access the entire time.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is known that hackers were aware of Clinton&#39;s non-public email address as early as 2011.[81] Secretary Clinton and her staff were aware of hacking attempts in 2011, and were reportedly worried about them.[82] In 2012, according to server records, a hacker in Serbia scanned Clinton&#39;s Chappaqua server at least twice, in August and in December 2012. It was unclear whether the hacker knew the server belonged to Clinton, although it did identify itself as providing email services for clintonemail.com.[74] During 2014, Clinton&#39;s server was the target of repeated intrusions originating in Germany, China, and South Korea. Threat monitoring software on the server blocked at least five such attempts. The software was installed in October 2013, and for three months prior to that, no such software had been installed.[83][84]</p>

<p>Security experts such as Chris Soghoian believe that emails to and from Clinton may have been at risk of hacking and foreign surveillance.[73] Marc Maiffret, a cybersecurity expert, said that the server had &quot;amateur hour&quot; vulnerabilities.[74] For the first two months after Clinton was appointed Secretary of State and began accessing mail on the server through her Blackberry, transmissions to and from the server were apparently not encrypted. On March 29, 2009, a digital certificate was obtained which would have permitted encryption.[19]</p>

<p>A foreign entity that&#39;s not Russia was able to get copies of Clinton&#39;s email. Congressional record—house h6166 has it if you want to read or you can watch the cspan showing</p>

<p>Comey also said this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a July 2016 statement, Comey said the FBI “did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked.” But, he added: “Given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we wouldn&#39;t see any evidence if it was coming from a any potential bad actors such as China.</p>

<p>Just some thoughts</p>
