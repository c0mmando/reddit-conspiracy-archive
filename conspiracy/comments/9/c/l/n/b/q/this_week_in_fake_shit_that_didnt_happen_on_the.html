       You can't make this shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, actually I guess you can, because they did.
      </p>
      <p>

       There it is. An astronut saves the day -- again -- by plugging a hole in the space station with his thumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazing how no one has died up there in nearly 20 years.  Good thing the "vacuum of space" didn't destroy them after a hole was put in their space station traveling at about 17,000 mph.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some will notice that this ridiculous story seems to be based on the "little hero of Holland" tale, where a Dutch boy plugs a leaky dike with his finger until help arrives, popularized in the book
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Brinker,_or_The_Silver_Skates">
        <em>
         Hans Brinker.
        </em>
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        But here's the thing.
       </strong>
       Look at the photo Chris Hadfield posted of the hole that was repaired. See how it is marked with official NASA labels, like all their official photos?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, it's the same picture as the album cover of this
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_(album">
        2014 contemporary Christian album
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       I look forward to seeing the excuses put forth by the eternally faithful to the government organization called NASA.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the unbiased observer, take note: this is why we distrust NASA and doubt the things they say they do and the places they say they go....  it's because they
       <em>
        unendingly give us pure bullshit, all the time, and constantly lie to us and mock us.

       The fact that the photo is the same deserves to be its own post. I'll just make that one at a later date, working it into the title, after this one gets downvoted into oblivion, as do all conspiracy posts which are actually incriminating, by NASA shills and bots.

       If it fares the same as all my posts about NASA do, and indeed any post which calls "space agencies" into question, it will eventually land at 0 points, 50% upvoted. I'm sure others have experienced this "phenomenon."

       You were proved incorrect though. No one from NASA, including Chris Hadfield, so much as intimated that that was the same hole as the current one aboard the ISS.

       Um, hate to rain on your parade, but no-one is saying it's a photo of the actual hole. That photo is of a hole in a satellite.

       The title of the article I posted, which is underneath that giant photo, reads something like "astronaut aboard the ISS had to plug
       <strong>
        this
       </strong>
       hole with his thumb."
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess the way it was presented by Hadfield/NASA fooled even this "science blogger" who wrote the article I posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in your view, a 2014 Christian rock band used an obscure photo from NASA's website of a hole in a satellite, on their album cover, then 4 years later, when a hole appeared in the ISS, NASA used the same photo used by the Christian rock band, to represent the hole, instead of a photo of the actual hole? That's a yes or no question by the way.

       Well, Mike Wehner is wrong, because neither NASA nor Chris Hadfield said that photo was a photo the hole they're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA didn't use that photo as you're claiming. Probably because they had more important things to worry about than taking a photo.

       Answer the question: You think that what happened here was that Remedy Drive used the satellite hole photo in 2014 for their album cover, then NASA used the same photo to represent an actual hole in the space station four years later?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, that's a yes or no question, after which you can answer who took the satellite photo hole in the first place?

       I suspect that was a piece they brought back with them. The satellite in question was Solar Maximum, which was famous as it was the first orbiting unmanned satellite to be repaired in space.

       Like hopping on social media. You'd think if they had time to log into twitter, they could have taken a picture of the actual hole an astronaut put his thumb over to stop the environment from leaking out. I wonder if social media would have liked to see that hole... nah throw a stock photo from Wikipedia up, they'd eat it right up.

       Are you calling him disingenuous? Because he tweeted a picture he hoped journalists and thousands of followers would believe is the hole he talked about in the text of his tweet. It's also funny that the guy wouldn't have immediately asked his astronaut friends who were up there for a picture of the plugged up hole when he found out about it, which he could then post on Twitter.

       Interestingly, most of the articles I'm seeing now are sure to interject something clarifying that the photo posted by Hadfield is not a photo of
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       hole. Seems like a deliberate caveat, as though added later.

       It's an electron microscope picture of a piece of the Solar Maximum probe that was most likely replaced during STS-41-C. It was actually a pretty interesting mission because the satellite

       I don't understand why you're so defensive over this. Every flat earther doubts NASA as a matter of course. 100% of flat earthers are NASA doubters, that's undeniable.
      </p>
      <p>
       A majority of flat earthers are flat earthers for religious reasons. I only have anecdotal evidence of this but it seems to fit most people's experience and expectations. You're the first person I've encountered in a while who is concerned with the actual conspiracies surrounding NASA and not the superstitious nonsense. It happens to every good conspiracy; eventually it gets popular and the wing-nuts take over.

       Go to a large star party someday and ask someone to show it to you, it is really cool! You can literally see it with a telescope scope about once every 90 minutes. And to the naked eye it looks like any ordinary satellite.

       Talking about satellites bud. Also, for such a mammoth human achievement, there are no videos of the construction of the ISS, which would have taken place while orbiting at 17,000 mph, or any uncut video of a rocket voyage to dock with and enter the ISS.

       Why do keep mentioning 17,000 mph? In the vacuum of space the speed is irrelevant. If you're docking with something and you're both doing the same speed then from your point of view your almost stationary.

       Yes, but irrelevant when talking about construction in space. Its like the classic argument about how it was impossible for the lunar module to dock with the command module when it was travelling at 10,000 mph.  If you're doing the same speed too then the actual speed doesn't matter, just the difference between the two.

       They, uh, didn’t build it in space...maybe that wasn’t shared with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was sent up in pieces over the course of many years. Those pieces docking with one another are very well documented moments. Similarly you can easily find videos of those pieces being manufactured and tested on earth before getting sent up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t be embarrassed though, it’s great that you are asking questions. As a scientist, I encourage everyone to ask questions. Just be careful not to fall down a rabbit hole as often the answers are a lot less complicated that you’d expect.

       how that flimsy thing cope with the torsion stresses of continuous rotation.

       the  thing has to rotate in synch with the earth and its own orbit. theres no magic string keeping it orientated to the earth.

       I've seen "it" with a high powered telescope. I've seen "it" docking with a space shuttle, with a high powered telescope.

       "It" is the same shape as the photos of the ISS.

       You can, perhaps, argue that the ISS is something else, but there is an object in orbit, that you can see with the naked eye, that has the exact shape and dimensions of the photographs you see of the ISS.

       Yeah mate it's a giant conspiracy involving thousands of people who've all managed to avoid spilling the beans. Why they'd do this is anyone's guess but I'm sure you have an equally brain dead explanation for that.

       Well it's about time something happened up there. Nothing bad ever happens which can't be fixed by a fun space walk and some Gorilla glue.
      </p>
      <p>
       In bed a couple nights ago, my HVAC unit was short-cycling and I couldn't go to sleep. Hearing the air come on and turn off every couple minutes, combined with the general stress of being alive, being an adult, stressed me to the point where I couldn't sleep. Got me thinking about how ridiculous it is to assume that these people are insouciantly floating around, smiling, describing their ludicrous and nebulous "experiments," some of them with children back home, where their lives would be on a razor's edge. The psychological trauma caused by spending 5 minutes in such a dangerous situation would be such an adrenaline rush and intense experience that years would probably be taken from one's life, yet we are to assume that these people shower, shit, shave, and grow tomatoes up there while traveling at 17,000 mph.  What a joke. What an unbelievably absurd fairy tale that exposes itself by the very nature of its goofy theatrics.

       that one. NASA had no need to get involved, as anyone who actually read the caption accompanying the picture wouldn't have misunderstood things to this level.

       If it is anything like ballistics on earth you'd expect the entry to be smaller.  In any case it is on a module of the Soyuz that isn't coming back to earth, so even with a temporary patch to maintain pressure it shouldn't pose any continued risk to astronauts and cosmonauts after the next trip home.

       Even on airliners the depressurization isn't instant (unless we are talking like losing half of the plane at once), just like if I poke a hole in a bucket of water the bucket doesn't empty instantly.  Yes orbiting junk is a risk, but keep in mind how large of a space it exists in, but as we can see, the difference in relative velocities can cause serious damage even with small masses.

       No, I wouldn't assume that one atmosphere (14.7 psi) of internal air pressure is destructive.  I'd recommend reading

       You have no idea why someone may use different accounts or scrub their history. I would expect someone on this sub would appreciate the desire for anonymity. Your desperate search of people's post history just tells me you don't like what they're saying but have no good arguments to back it up. Rather then actually addressing what is being said you search for a justification for dismissing it entirely.

       He's been proven wrong all throughout the thread, and walked by the hand through how his very basic presumptions were incorrect. Aren't you a mod here? Wouldn't you want there to be more quality submissions here instead of entirely unreasearched stuff like this, that could have been avoided had he read the tweet that accompanied the offending picture?

       Nope; as I’ve already pointed out your only conspiracy post ever is about “Russian troll tweets.” I.e., a fake conspiracy that does the

       of incriminating the United States government.

       So you're privy to the goings-on on my other accounts, not to mention how much I've contributed here with this account, accounting for my occasional history scrubbing? I'd say that's a much bigger conspiracy than you misunderstanding the tweet of an astronaut.

      <p>
       Conspiracies don't have to always incriminate the US government. In fact, that very real and irrefutably proven conspiracy I posted about, directly incriminates the Russian government.

       You should probably spend more time attacking my arguments instead of attacking me and my post history, because you're really not helping prove your case in any way.

       Do they have the space debris that made the hole or did it puncture and bounce off?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the problem of decompression for a bullet sized hole in space had math done by Professor Andrew Higgins of McGill University and gives the following answer:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The air will leak through the hole at sonic velocity (Mach one at constriction of the leak).
       </p>
       <p>
        So, the mass flow rate is:
       </p>
       <p>
        dm/dt = rho V A
       </p>
       <p>
        where rho is density, V is velocity, and A is the area of the hole. The velocity equals the speed of sound (sonic orifice), but this is slightly lower than the speed of sound in the spacecraft cabin due to expansion of gas as it flows through the hole. Density is lower also. So, it is more practical to express the mass flow rate in terms of stagnation conditions, i.e., the conditions in the cabin, which I will denote po and To:
       </p>
       <p>
        dm/dt = A po Sqrt[ (g/(R To)) (2/(g+1))
        <sup>
         (g+1
        </sup>
        /(g-1))) ]
       </p>
       <p>
        here "g" is gamma, the ratio of specific heats (g = 1.4 for air) and R is the gas constant (R = 287 J/kg-K for air). You can find this derived in any compressible fluid dynamics textbook (or any fluids book with a chapter on compressible flow).
       </p>
       <p>
        For air, this simplifies to:
       </p>
       <p>
        dm/dt = 0.04042 A * po/Sqrt[To] "Fliegner's formula"
       </p>
       <p>
        If you stick to MKS units (use Pa for pressure and K for temperature), this will give you the mass flow rate of air leak in kg/s.
       </p>
       <p>
        So far, we have assumed that the spacecraft remains at the same po, To. Of course, as the leak progresses, the pressure in the spacecraft begins to drop, and this affects the mass flow rate through the leak. Thus, dm/dt is no longer constant, and we have to integrate the above differential equation coupled to the decrease in po and To as the spacecraft leaks. You can find the details of this in Saad's Compressible Fluid Flow (2nd Ed., pp. 103-106). The answer is that, to leak from an initial pressure of pi to a final pressure of pf, the time required is:
       </p>
       <p>
        t = 0.43 V [(pf/pi)
        <sup>
         -0.143
        </sup>
        - 1]/(A Sqrt[Ti])
       </p>
       <p>
        Again using MKS units, where V is the volume of the spacecraft (Ti = initial temperature), this gives you the time "t" to leak down to pf in seconds.
       </p>
       <p>
        This assumed that the blow-down was isentropic. In practice, any blow-down that will last tens of seconds to minutes, the process in the spacecraft is more likely to be isothermal: mass of spacecraft has huge thermal capacity compared to the (decreasing) mass of gas inside and will keep the gas warm as it expands. With the assumption of isothermal blow-down, the time required becomes:
       </p>
       <p>
        t = -0.086 V Ln[pf/pi]/(A Sqrt[T])
       </p>
       <p>
        where T is the (constant) spacecraft temperature.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, if your spacecraft has a volume V = 10 m
        <sup>
         3
        </sup>
        at 300 K with a 1 cm x 1 cm hole, the time it takes the pressure to drop from 1 atm to 0.5 atm is:
       </p>
       <p>
        t = -0.086 * 10 * Ln[0.5]/(1e-4 Sqrt[300]) = 344.2 s
       </p>
       <p>
        Or about six minutes.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       NASA claims the leak occurred overnight and into the morning. How is that possible?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Overnight and in the morning there was an abnormal situation—a pressure drop, an oxygen leak at the station,” Dmitry Rogozin of Russian space agency Roscosmos told reporters. “A micro fracture was found, most likely it is damage from the outside. The design engineers believe it is the result of a micrometeorite.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The atmosphere would have dropped significantly for that long a period. Near complete decompression.

       The difference in pressure from inside the station to outside is only 1 atm.

       The hole was the equivalent of having a pin hole in a bottle of water, the water will leak out but not rapidly and it doesn't cause catastrophic decompression.

       This is far smaller than the entire pressurized volume of the ISS that you are using and the hole is 2mm x 2mm approximately. Still roughly 6 minutes to drop.

       Even so, that'd be a 2 hour time to depressurize down to 0.5 atm, according to your equation. Still not 6 minutes, because of the hole size alone. The picture clearly shows a hole much smaller than 1 cm in diameter.

       For the record:
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of this post is not the image of the hole, but of the fantastical nature of this obviously fabricated story which was contrived as window-dressing to mollify the multitudes of unfortunate people who still believe in the ISS hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let it be pointed out that NASA astronaut and ISS "Commander" Chris Hadfield
       <em>
        did indeed
       </em>
       tweet a photo that could easily be interpreted as a photo of the actual hole in question, and indeed from which the science blogger I linked to originally
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       infer that Hadfield was tweeting an image of this hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not think for one nanosecond (shoutout to Don Petit) that I did not expect some kind of sleight of hand damage control to serve as a pseudo-justification for this latest gaffe. Of course now it is said that the photo is of a hole in a satellite.... Hadfield merely was tweeting a photo (without clarification) to
       <em>
        represent
       </em>
       what a hole in the ISS
       <em>
        might look like,
       </em>
       etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is nonsense of the nature which can be filed away under the "petrified wood" category, where any proponent of NASA must bend over backwards in their Sisyphean task of defending the agency's every misstep and anomaly -- plugging their holes, if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now we are seeing the damage control I already expected in real time.... There is an excuse for everything. There will always be.  If you want to believe that the Christian band Remedy Drive used this NASA stock photo in 2014, then Hadfield decided to use that same photo four years later to represent a hole in the ISS, which actually exists in orbit and contains astronauts in gorilla suits and football jerseys, this is your choice.

       are you arguing that the Christian rock album came out before the NASA photo? Unless my brain is playing tricks on me,

        the NASA photo

       came out
       <em>
        before

The title of the post itself does not even mention the photo tweeted by Hadfield.

       Well, I first came here when I started to look into 9/11 myself. I was also interested in Sandy Hook and the Boston Bombing. I'm open to other conspiracies, but not the ridiculous - the Earth is demonstrably not flat, space is real, and man has indeed walked on the Moon.

       So have you come to believe that 9/11 and sandy hook are in fact conspiracies? Because the thing is, once someone wakes up to the real truth behind 9/11, it honestly makes more sense that the moon landing and the entire space programme is a hoax too. The way the US government operate starts to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. Lies and deceipt on every level. A country that would murder its own citizens is not above worldwide deception, it should be expected from such an entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for whether space is even real I honestly don't know anymore, I certainly can't say for certain myself. I would have to defer to an authority for answers and I certainly don't trust NASA. The moon landing being fake is not necessarily indicitive of a flat earth or space being fake. I would strongly recommend looking again at the fake moon landing argument, once you wake up to that there really is no reason to believe the ISS is perfectly legit. Why would they go clean after getting away with the biggest lie of all time?

       There is no rational or logical link between 9/11 and the moon landings. The Space Race was a product of the Cold War, whereas 9/11 is the product of Zionist influence (everything that has happened post-9/11 appears to be to Israels benefit).

       I have studied the moon landings in detail for many years, and I still nothing to indicate that it was anything other than that presented - using the latest technology of the time, and with astronauts who were exactly the right kind of men to risk their lives in such an undertaking, the US put men on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       People seem to forget that NASA isn't the only space agency - there are some 70-odd worldwide. They are all not part of some weird conspiracy to hoodwink the entire world.

       I wasn't so much saying there was a direct link between 9/11 and the moon landing, just that the moon landing is a relatively benign lie compared to that so faking it is completely within reach (and plausible considering the circumstances of the time.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Your second paragraph sounds so ridiculous to me that it might be enough to make people second guess the moon landings on its own. We'll have to agree to disagree on that one.

       Well, I keep asking people to show me proof that the moon landings were faked, but no-one has been able to do that. They had the hardware, the know-how, the willing, the men...why is that so hard to accept?

       First of all, your default position should be skepticism. The burden of proof is on those claiming to have landed on the moon, not the other way around. I think this is one of the fundamental problems for why people believe it. They're taught it when they are young and have no reason to question the authority teaching it. Its true until proven fake is completely the wrong way to approach it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put yourself in a 60's mindset before this hoax was started. Nobody has ever been to moon, then a government body with plenty of political/financial motives tells you they have figured it all out within 8 years (despite losing the space race to Russia the entire time) and have now been to the moon and back on the first try. They can't provide telemetry evidence for their claim and then say the original footage is missing. Also the special lander that remarkably worked the first time in totally untested ground was destroyed! Then when reasonable people doubt this highly dubious claim, we are treated like idiots and asked 'why is it so hard to accept'?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you believe me if I said I went to the deepest point in the ocean ever, but destroyed the magic sub I went in and lost the video, also the data for my trip is lost too! Also nobody else has been 50 years since and counting indefinitely. But I did go trust me! At the very least understand the perspective of people who just aren't buying this bullshit anymore.

       In those 8 years of huge spending and blossoming technology they progressed from launching unmanned satellites, then chimps, then humans in sub-orbital flights, then solo orbital flights, then 2 man missions where they practised EVAs and docking with other craft. Then they developed the world's most powerful rocket, and they flew to the Moon 3 times before they landed on it. Hardly the first try.

       The special lander was destroyed? Huh? The descent stage was left on the moon's surface,as it had performed it's task, and the ascent stage was discarded once it had done it's job. Why bring it back to Earth when it couldn't survive reentry?

       It's funny you should mention deep sea diving. Do you know when man first went to the bottom of the Marianas Trench, the deepest point of the world's oceans? 1960. Do yo know when someone did it again? James Cameron, the film director, in 2012. 52 years...

       All you even said to my point about starting with skepticism was 'they did it 6 times!'. I feel like you're missing my point there...
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not agree that we should start from a skeptical persepctive? Also what does all the missing evidence say to you exactly? Could you agree that NASA are least incompetent? The same organisation to lose the moon landing footage were the first people ever to get man out of low earth orbit?
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference with the Mariana trench is there is actual evidence for the trip. So that one isn't exactly in question here. Also, the deepest point in the ocean is not nearly the same as 237'000 miles to the moon. Not at all a fair comparison.

       Someone was incompetent but I would hardly call the whole organisation that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing wrong with a healthy dose of scepticism, but I think you're going way beyond that. A blanket denial that something that was technically feasible, and that there is plenty of evidence to support happened, is hardly scepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is actual evidence that men walked on the moon, but you keep choosing to ignore it. And I would argue that it was more dangerous to dive to 10,911 metres underwater than go to the Moon, as at that depth if anything had gone wrong, especially a structural failure, then they would be dead instantly. At least they stood half a chance with Apollo 13. In fact, I think that there is more proof that we went to the moon than we went to the bottom of the ocean in 1960 - film, photos, samples, photos of the stuff they left behind on the moon, etc etc.

       I would say start by looking at the lack of evidence supporting the moon landing. From the mouths of NASA officials all hard evidence is gone:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/7q1l-jf3KqA">
        https://youtu.be/7q1l-jf3KqA
       </a>
       So that's original video footage of Apollo 11, telemetry data and the moon landing technology. I would venture a guess that it was prrobably illegal to destroy those records.
      </p>
      <p>
       Various anomolies with the footage. Here's the harnesses worn by astronauts seen on camera:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Zz9Bzi_GyD0">
        https://youtu.be/Zz9Bzi_GyD0
       </a>
       NASA would have you believe that every glimpse of their fakery is some sort of scientific anomoly that occurs on the moon. Its ridiculous. Think for yourself and do not defer to NASA for answers. You can see it with your own eyes.

       There’s some damage control at play here which I have addressed in a lengthy comment here. It’s an interesting turn of events. I have seen this happen before, where NASA seems to have made some big screw-up that exposes them, and no sooner than it is pointed out they release some “reasonable explanation” which is then used to make the accusers look like paranoid conspiracy theorists.

       None of the following reference NASA and still no flat earther can show me how they are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Orbital satellites prove the Earth is a sphere as do the following: placement of light houses, placement of radio transmission towers, trade routes, wind and weather systems, the rotation of the Earth as supported by laser gyro and apparent movement of stars in the sky, different stars in the northern and southern hemispheres, adjustments to ballistic targeting calculations to account for the curve of the Earth, large constructions projects like some bridges, and lots and lots more.

      <p>
       Flat earth can't explain how any of the above works.

       They don't even have experiments to support their ideas that the Earth is flat.

       You are a paranoid conspiracy theorist. You are claiming every piece of evidence is damage control for a slip up that never actually happened, and anyone who disagrees with you is a shill who's never posted on the conspiracy subreddit before, and every downvote has personally come from NASA to silence you.

       Well, as I have explained to you before, it was built the same way as an aircraft, with a pressurised aluminium alloy cabin,covered in 20+ layers of various materials. But hey, that's OK, you keep on pulling 'facts' out your arse.

       <em>
        the

       hole photo and had similar wording to another unrelated article, suggesting that these were hasty edits to assist in the damage control.

       Isn’t it more likely that edits were due to reports not understanding it was a different hole just as many of us would have done? Articles are revised all the time because guess what, humanity is not perfect.

       It’s not like all the actual political propaganda is being written by flawless individuals who are all in on it. So many reporters are also stuck in a false narrative and may not even comprehend the social effects of what they write.

       So just to clarify, you’re upset that this picture from a recovered satellite from 2006 was used as an album cover in 2014? I’m confused, because some basic reverse image searching (which can also show dates of images), proves the NASA photo predates the album.

       Yeah this was the point of the post more than the image of the alleged hole, which of course has become a straw man that the shills are using to make a production of attacking that one aspect of this post so that no one discusses how silly and stupid the concept of the ISS is in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I intend to do another post soon which ties into this incident. If you look around you’ll notice that there is now much discussion of space debris and how it is postulated that due to an increasing amount of orbiting junk, and said junk colliding with itself until it becomes some kind of deadly dust/shrapnel. Some are saying now that it might prevent future manned space travel because of the danger! So this could very well be just a pseudo-justification for why space programs will cease their efforts to send people to space. It gives them a reasonable-sounding excuse to stop faking space missions.

       its funny how the story keeps changing. from space debris, to meteorite, to assembly floor mishap, to crazy astronaut from previous mission drilling the hole. and also many different pictures floating around the fake web. but no one is talking about the physics of the incident and how they are still alive. i have been led to believe my whole life that something like this would be catastrophic. everyone seem to be cool with it i guess.

       what also doesn't make senses is the fact if it is a drill hole, then that drill hole has been there this whole time and it never had a problem. i call big bull shit on that. i am just tired of all these lies.

       That picture is from a scanning electron microscope (SEM).   They don't have one of those on the space station.   And if they did,  it would require the sample being imaged to be physically placed inside the vacuum chamber on said SEM.

       I saw an article with this same picture used, and they never said that was the hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can’t find the article right now, but they used the same picture but clearly noted it was a “hole like the one in the picture” that they plugged, not necessarily the exact hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is more of a case of overzealous reporting and trying to be the first to break news than any nefarious cover-up or conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately we’re seeing lore and more these days of “journalists” publishing stories on the internet without all facts so that they can break the news for clicks, credit, at whatever other reason. But how many times do those things get edited, corrected or taken down? All because they didn’t have all the facts and wanted to run with something. I think some dimwit saw the tweet, took the photo and didn’t do much research.

       My thoughts are, that if you think that the ISS is fake, what the hell flies over head on certain times? You can see it with the naked eye and if you use some good binoculars  you can make out the entire structure. Next thing is, you'll be telling me that the earth is flat. You are a true Red Formanism.

       You can literally go outside and see the ISS with your naked eyes. Put your city in at the linked site and it will tell you when the next flyover will be. If you want a more detailed view, use binoculars.

       The actual NASA report. Mike whener the writer on the website you linked looks to still be in highschool. The hole is not a gaping hole in the living room either, It was less then a millimeter and in a seperate space craft causing a "minor pressure drop." NASA saying minor is minor.

       They didn’t use their thumbs (except maybe to troubleshoot the leak when looking for it) they used Kapton tape which is very stable polyimide film used a lot in all kinds of applications. Kapton is sorta the high tech version of duct tape.

       Well it's about time something happened up there. Nothing bad ever happens which can't be fixed by a fun space walk and some Gorilla glue.
      </p>
      <p>
       In bed a couple nights ago, my HVAC unit was short-cycling and I couldn't go to sleep. Hearing the air come on and turn off every couple minutes, combined with the general stress of being alive, being an adult, stressed me to the point where I couldn't sleep. Got me thinking about how ridiculous it is to assume that these people are insouciantly floating around, smiling, describing their ludicrous and nebulous "experiments," some of them with children back home, where their lives would be on a razor's edge. The psychological trauma caused by spending 5 minutes in such a dangerous situation would be such an adrenaline rush and intense experience that years would probably be taken from one's life, yet we are to assume that these people shower, shit, shave, and grow tomatoes up there while traveling at 17,000 mph.  What a joke. What an unbelievably absurd fairy tale that exposes itself by the very nature of its goofy theatrics.

       If it is anything like ballistics on earth you'd expect the entry to be smaller.  In any case it is on a module of the Soyuz that isn't coming back to earth, so even with a temporary patch to maintain pressure it shouldn't pose any continued risk to astronauts and cosmonauts after the next trip home.

       The point of this post was to highlight the latest absurd story from the ISS, about a hole being plugged with a thumb, and how it beggars belief that this utter made-up nonsense is still readily accepted and defended by so many. The title of the post itself does not even mention the photo tweeted by Hadfield.

       Do you think that the Christian band Remedy Drive used a stock photo from NASA for their 2014 CD and if so, why?

       The hole was the equivalent of having a pin hole in a bottle of water, the water will leak out but not rapidly and it doesn't cause catastrophic decompression.
