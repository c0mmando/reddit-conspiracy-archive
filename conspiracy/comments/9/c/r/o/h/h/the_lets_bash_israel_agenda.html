        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Maybe I&#39;m not talking to a majority of r/conspiracy.  Maybe the people this is addressing are just a few very vocal posters.  I&#39;m guessing never until you are consumed by your own hatred of what you think is injustice.  Just go learn about how Palestinian refugee status works.  Go learn about how to aquire citizenship. Go learn about the wars, about Hamas, and about the propaganda shoved down the throats of children.  Criticism of Israel is fine, but when you just throw crap around claiming it&#39;s true or relevant is just a lie. It&#39;s crap and used to incite hatred, which is the exact opposite of what you were created for.  It&#39;s a perfect example of constricted consciousness.</p>

<p>If you want to be a healthy, happy, and successful individual, the key is to avoid hate and love truth.  Your purpose hear is to expand your consciousness.  Love obviously is one of the most expensive aspects of reality.</p>

<p>Fear is constrictive. Extremely. It has a purpose, but its only good if that fear is used to get to a place of harmony after confrontation.</p>

<p>There is no confrontation here.  Just a bunch of whining and name calling which is just a cover for hate and fear.</p>

<p>If you are here to hate, ok, free speech, so go die in a fire.</p>

<p>If you are here because you are afraid, then stop being a bitch and go meditate.  Go talk to someone more knowledgeable than you on the subject until you get clarity on that matter. Of that clarity is frustrating, then confirm it is true with someone that would oppose the argument and present it.  Of the conversation is relevant, thrn share it.</p>

<p>Otherwise you are just wasting another person&#39;s time which is the most valuable asset in life.  Stop wasting time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a super knowledgeable person on this subject, and I&#39;m probably not the right person to ask.   I&#39;m just want this sub to try to be a little more constructive and a lot less fearful.  Don&#39;t be a little bitch.</p>

<p>Be a man, deal with your life and your problems, and of you can handle most of that, the help others.  You aren&#39;t being helpful if you are just hating and fearing.</p>

<p>Im mostly a lurker here, but I was just hoping this would be a platform for more constructive info.  Fear and hate don&#39;t help. Of you have some kind of actual solution that isny just some fairytale BS, then share it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be afraid of things you don&#39;t understand remotely.  And don&#39;t hate them, it&#39;s a pathetic life and you were not created to be pathetic.</p>

<p>Having negative views of death in general is understandable including negative views of a country.  But I&#39;m literally talking about destructive bashing.</p>

<p>btw, Plishtim have running water, IDF is far from ruthless (cuz they could just wipe the map if they chose to be ruthless), and Israel doesn&#39;t give about international laws that would make it impossible to defend itself properly, just as you would not care about a law stating you had to leave your front door unlocked at night or that you aren&#39;t allowed to own a weapon for personal protection, when your neighbors have literally been trying to kill you every day of your life.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>A vast majority of it is bashing.</p>

<p>bingo, to a certain degree.  That is the general idea.  However the word Egypt&#39;s root (at least in biblical Hebrew) means constriction.  Leaving Egypt is more than just a physical action, it means breaking the mental and spiritual shackles that constrict consciousness.

<p>You see, when events like children playing football on a beach are killed by hellfire missiles people tend to get angry.
Or a Palistinian shot in the street bleeding out and IDF soldiers are leaning on their truck smoking as if nothing is wrong...to top it off Israelis are passing by him spitting and mocking him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed 100%, and as a result, Israel should be criticized...but constructively.  And yes, that could be a conspiracy that I&#39;m guessing several have tried or are trying.  However that&#39;s not my point in this post.  Most posts I see, or at least comments are just not helpful.  I understand that&#39;s what you get in an open forum, but my purpose of this post is to tell people that if they want to be helpful to society, talk about the issues and solutions, and don&#39;t just be like &quot;yeah, drive the Jews into the sea&quot; ™   </p>
