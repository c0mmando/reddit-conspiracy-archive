<p>Noam Chomsky, Stephen Cohen and Paul Craig Roberts among those mentioned.</p>

<p>The Russiagate conspiracy is starting to turn against its inceptors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With self-righteous probity, Trump&#39;s political and media enemies are declaring him a felon for accepting foreign interference in the US presidential election.</p>

<p>Admittedly, President Trump appears to have been telling lies about the past meeting, which took place at Trump Tower in New York City in the summer of 2016. Or maybe it&#39;s just this American president shooting himself in the foot — again — with his inimical gibberish-style.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with the Trump campaign team in early June 2016 is described in US media as &quot;Kremlin-linked&quot;. But that seems to be just more innuendo in place of facts. She denies any such connection. The Kremlin also says it had no relation with the attorney on her business of approaching Team Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the presidential campaign, Clinton&#39;s team contracted a British spy, Christopher Steele, to dig up dirt on Trump in the form of the so-called &quot;Russian dossier&quot;...</p>

<p>Not only that, but now it transpires that the Federal Bureau of Investigation also paid the same British spy to act as a source for the FBI&#39;s wiretapping of Trump&#39;s associates, according to declassified documents obtained by Judicial Watch, a US citizens&#39; rights group.</p>

<p>In other words, the foreign interference that the FBI engaged in under the Barack Obama administration, as well as by Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign team, is on a far greater and more scandalous scale that Trump seems to have clumsily endeavored to do with a Russian lawyer.</p>

<p>The real, shocking interference in US democracy was not by Russia or Trump, but by American secret services working in collusion with the Clinton Democrats to distort the presidential elections...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another staggering hypocrisy in the US media kerfuffle over Trump and alleged Russian interference is that all the fastidious hyperbole completely ignores actual foreign interference in American democracy  — foreign interference that is on an absolutely colossal scale.</p>

<p>As American critical thinker Noam Chomsky points out, &quot;Israeli intervention in US elections overwhelms anything Russia may have done&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another foreign benefactor in US politics is the so-called Saudi lobby and other oil-rich Gulf Arab states. Millions of dollars are funneled into Congress by these dubious regimes to shape US government foreign policy in the Middle East. For several decades, Saudi oil money is also documented to be a major contributor to the CIA and its off-the-books covert operations around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The whole Russiagate narrative is sheer hysteria driven by anti-Trump forces who do not want to accept the result of the 2016 election. It is, in effect, a coup attempt by unelected political forces.</p>

<p>Russiagate is a cover to conceal the really disturbing scandal which was, and continues to be, the attempt to subvert American democracy by US intelligence agencies working in cahoots with the Obama administration and Clinton&#39;s election campaign. To cover up those crimes, Russia is being maligned for &quot;attacking American democracy&quot;.</p>

<p>Such lies are an odious distortion of the truth by America&#39;s real enemies who are its own domestic political and media operators trying to cover up their anti-constitutional crimes. What&#39;s even more despicable is that these people are willing to inflame US-Russia relations to the point of starting a war between two nuclear powers.</p>

<p>When did Donald Trump meet with Russians to get dirt on Clinton?  Clinton hired a Russian to create dirt on Trump.</p>

<p>Clinton, through intermediaries, paying this Russian to create dirt is a-ok though.  The real problem is that Don Jr. met with the very same Russian who was in truth (like for real) colluding with the DNC.</p>

<p>Makes sense.  /s</p>
