        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey Reddit,</p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t been on the Conspiracy subreddit in a while and I&#39;ve noticed that there&#39;s been a fresh raid here targeting anything that smells of Pizzagate. They are using a common technique of baiting people with low-quality posts, then further raiding the comments with derisive messaging specifically meant to demoralize anyone who has looked into this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m here to field any questions other researchers, skeptics and trolls may have about P*zzagate, and to also &quot;debunk&quot; a few claims I see going around which are either false or misleading. This is a follow-up to an AMA I did about a year ago. Far from being fixated on the lurid sexual aspects of the investigations, my research has revealed a vast web of politically-linked occult groups that have been active in Europe and the Americas for decades if not centuries. Rather than seeing the Podestas and Comet Ping Pong as the sole perpetrators of this operation, I want to make the case that they are but a part of a larger occult intelligence network based in England, and are the same clandestine group witnessed by hundreds of victims of the so-called &quot;MK&quot; and &quot;Tavistock&quot; programs that the CIA and MI6 have tirelessly worked to saturate as the work of a few bad apples. </p>

<p>AMA. </p>

<p>1) Luciferians. As a belief system, what are their tenants? I&#39;ve been delving into hermeticism and it seems like that&#39;s the basis....the mystery school teachings. The frank-sabbateans, Laveyian Satanism.....what&#39;s the main ideological belief system in your opinion, and what does it teach? Is there a main belief system that binds these people together, or is it just a syndicate of like-minded psychopaths?</p>

<p>2) According to their doctrine, what is the purpose of raping/killing children? What&#39;s supposed to happen? What function does it serve? Is it just for kicks and mutually-assured destruction/blackmail, or is there something more?</p>

<p>3) In your estimation, how likely is it that there&#39;s an illuminati?</p>

<p>4) Can you please tell us what you know/understand about Tavisstock?</p>

<p>5) I&#39;m pretty sure I know that the reason these things happen is because our leaders are all psychopaths, and, unbridled, this is just some shit psychopaths would come up with amongst themselves....in your estimation, the political purpose of promoting/propping-up pedosadists is blackmail? Or something more?</p>

<li>The interests of the British Empire and its two main intelligence affiliates (CIA/OSS and MI6). There are also &quot;good&quot; types of Luciferianism. </li>
<li>The basic answer is &quot;because they can&quot;, but if I can give a direct, recent example, think of the whole practice as being marketed as a kind of NXIVM &quot;executive success program&quot; taken to the extreme. Historically, though, it&#39;s an iniatory practice for the Knights Templar, which are still active in US and UK nightclubs trading extremely illegal substances. </li>
<li>100%, but Illuminati is also a blanket term for a lot of sub groups acting in a similar interest.</li>
<li>The basic answer is that Tavistock is a kind of intelligence/propaganda/research/bioweapon factory for the global cabal. </li>
<li>Think of it this way. If Los Angeles street gangs need initiation rituals to trade crack, think of what people subverting G8 countries need to do. Also, you need to understand the weight of the secrets they are holding. </li>

<p>My answer to the templar question is: every corporation has hierarchies. </p>

<p>As for secrets, look into British Lords who still believe America is a British Colony. Sir Oliver Franks is a good start. Also look into biographies of Alister Crowley, Blavatsky, Henry Wellcome, Bright Young Things, Fabian Socialism in London. You&#39;ll start to find patterns of this group in operation. </p>

<ol>
<li>Is the entire pizza made of children or just the pepperoni?</li>
<li>Este is Spanish for East while Pod can either be referring to a group of whales or the seed of a legume. Is there anything you can do with that information? Podesta meaning seed of the East. That&#39;s vaguely sinister sounding, innit?</li>
<li>What sort of PPE (pedophile protection equipment) does Comet Ping Pong employ to safeguard their occult child sacrifices and how have you been able to overcome their defenses?</li>
<li>Do you have an elite team of investigators at your disposal or are you a one man operation, like Batman? Also, are you billionaire? If not, how do you fund your investigation?</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Tavistock is itself a legitimate and well-known medical institute that has done a lot of work in the fields of psychology and public relations. You had Freud come there in the late 1910s, Bernays the marketing king in the 20s, along with countless other luminaries. But it&#39;s not all it seems.</p>

<p>For one University of London (Tavi&#39;s location) is historically the epicenter of British occultism and it resembles something called the Invisible College, a kind of freemason intellectual think tank that existed in the age of European courts. But it gets weird when you begin to notice the sheer amount of occult groups, religions, movements, spy agencies and banking interests who seem to have magically sprouted from this area. I&#39;ll try to name a few but I just want to remind you that all of these things largely originate from the Tavistock &quot;quadrant&quot;:</p>

<p>Feminism, modern eugenics, reproductive rights, Fabian Socialism, Freemasonry, Quakerism, pharmaceutical tablets, Aquarian conspiracy, the original New World Order, OSS, popular psychology, trauma studies, contemporary art, some aspects of punk music, brutalism, the Royal Society, literary modernism, the Bloomsbury Group, Mohandas Gandhi, OTO, parts of Scientology, Process Church, Theosophy, Modern Luciferianism...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>After Alex Jones reporting on the possible link between pizza gate, ping pong and children provoked an individual to shoot the place up, and as a direct result, led to senate hearings and tech giants now censoring what they consider extremist media: do you think trying to report on such extreme subjects does more harm than good?</p></li>
<li><p>What will it take to finally open 99.9% of the publics eyes to the greater conspiracy or cabal at play inside our government? My friend commented last year that the police could have found a dead child inside Clinton campaign headquarters and the media would have just ignored it as fake news or an attempt by a bitter rival to plant evidence. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><ol>
<li><p>Tavistock was involved in the Facebook hearings. A group called the Wellcome Foundation ran a bunch of institutes around Tavistock and our friend at Channel 4 Jon Snow worked for a teen shelter supported by them. The Wellcome foundation owns a sizable amount of Facebook stock but sold some off before the report and hearings. Also, Alex Jones should be ignored. </p></li>
<li><p>It will require someone they&#39;re taught to dislike making a huge mistake and essentially admitting everything. I think the Cemex rape camp was close but three weeks later the msm launched a massive campaign about &quot;children in cages&quot; at the border.</p></li>

<p>Find people in the community you can trust and work to end human trafficking, but know that deception is their field of expertise.

    <div class="md"><p>You need to understand the role of residential schools in Canada as it pertains to the British crown. The whole part about the Queen directly kidnapping kids in Kelowna seems like a bit of a red herring to describe some of the real policies of kidnapping and trafficking that have dogged BC and Northern Alberta. </p>

<p>Matrix 5 is definitely the right idea but I think that some of the facts are a little bit off. However I think the Robert Pickton story is interesting because he ran a snuff ring out of piggy&#39;s palace. It&#39;s not pizza party ping pong but it&#39;s the same alliterative descenders (pp,bb,dd) that pedophiles and cabal members use at their sites. Think Besta Pizza, Beyond Borders, Politics &amp; Prose. </p>

<p>I think there&#39;s a possibility of a north south trafficking route that goes through Western Canada that I wish I had more time to look into. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Antarctica </p></li>
<li><p>Antarctica likely contains some sort of human &quot;seed vault&quot; -- think the Svalbard seed vault in the north and how the elite are obsessed with Satanic inversions. Also that random Taiwanese email address sending photos of antarctica to John Podesta. Marina Abramovic also went on an art tour of antarctica, a big red flag for what it&#39;s worth.</p></li>
<li><p>The Vatican and Vatican II</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Not sure about Vatican but I do know the Knights of Malta have agents that operate through Tavistock, mainly celebrity musicians in the United States. I believe Jack White and Tom Delonge are involved in this. Look up Jack White and &quot;Vescovo&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li>Israel and Zionism</li>
</ol>

<p>Zionism is a broad topic but you should investigate Walter Rothschild, the signing of the Balfour declaration at his estate and all the Roth estates in Bucks county. Also that St.John of Jerusalem hospital in Israel and what they&#39;re doing with ocular tech there.</p>

<ol>
<li>Bitcoin</li>
</ol>

<p>A lot of connections to the DEN pedophile network that was exposed in the doc &quot;an Open Secret&quot;. Think Brock Pierce, etc. Also there is a ton of predictive programming involving this stuff</p>

<ol>
<li>Elon Musk and SpaceX</li>
</ol>

<p>DARPA. Also Bronfman family behind NXIVM set up a fake space research company in the 80s, may be similar.</p>

<ol>
<li>Aliens and disclosure</li>
</ol>

<p>I personally don&#39;t believe it and I think if anything it&#39;s cover for milabs and clandestine chemical experimentation.</p>

<ol>
<li>Assange&#39;s proof of life</li>
</ol>

<p>No idea. Feels like a distraction to me.</p>

<ol>
<li>Monarch and the entertainment industry</li>
</ol>

<p>Disassociation trauma can have positive effects if done correctly. You can give people incredible negative capability--or the ability to separate oneself from your own biases and thoughts--with disassociation. Very helpful for acting and performers. Otherwise it&#39;s also used experimentally to improve it and may also be used for pleasure be perpetrators in snuff rings. </p>

<ol>
<li>Ayahuasca &amp; DMT</li>
</ol>

<p>What&#39;s your angle? Would like to know more. </p>

<p>History</p>

<p>The <strong>Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee (RBWC)</strong> is a not-for-profit organization that orchestrates an open dialogue among high-level stakeholders committed to redefining the global financial architecture and monetary system to better respond to the changing economic landscape.</p>

<p>RBWC was established in 1994 by its current Executive Director, Marc Uzan, and was set in motion through an inaugural conference titled “Reinventing Bretton Woods” (New York City, September 1994). This event was organized for the 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods Conference and was designed to address the need for the global economy to adapt to the emergence of new actors and circumstances not present 50 years prior. The proceedings of this conference were later published in a book entitled The Financial System Under Stress: An Architecture for the New World Economy.</p>

<p><strong>HYPNOTIC SHOW FAQ:</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is Hypnotic Show?</p>

<p>A: A temporary social structure of engaging into creative cognitive acts through shared practices of art and hypnosis.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is the relationship between art and hypnosis?</p>

<p>A: Hypnotic power of artwork has always been a favorite trope of people looking for transformative potential of art. However instead of seeing “hypnotic power” as a rhetorical figure Hypnotic Show aims at reducing art practice to the method of pure hypnosis. According to  biometrics it connects to the brain faster</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: Why brain?</p>

<p>A: It is the ultimate destination of neuro-social engineering as well subjectivities of yet-to-be-invented. From the perspective of ceaseless production and total transparency* brain is seen as a final frontier to be colonised, from the perspective of individual subjectivity - as a last resort of things not-to-be-known. Hypnotic Show positions itself on both ends of the perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: How does Hypnotic Show work?</p>

<p>A: When all spaces undergo gentrification and you think that your very inner subjectivity will remain a space of a strictly personal order your brain-waves are being measured against you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: No, no, but how does it work technically?</p>

<p>A: A number of invited artists have submitted proposals for Marcos Lutyens to be performed on the audience through a session of hypnosis.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: Is it true that hypnosis can convince in a value of certain artwork against my will? </p>

<p>A: Multiple techniques are used in promoting arts value, hypnosis is just one of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: What remains after this show?</p>

<p>A: Reconfiguration of principles about workings or art and mind implied by artists proposal.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: Is it an empty show?</p>

<p>A: A show in your head will never be empty. There will be possibly a dream-machine of Burroughs and Gysin installed in the gallery.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: Can I buy I a hypnotic artwork? </p>

<p>A: Not at this moment. However soon you will be able not only to buy, but commission a hypnotic artwork created especially for you or to be able to induce your own hypnotic artwork on your friend out of pure love. Or both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If anyone is planning to study or analyze the pictures, it may be worth reconsidering tin foil hats at this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>PIERO PASSACANTANDO</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>This hypnotic artwork will affect you in no way. Once you wake up from this hypnotic stage, nothing will have changed; maybe I shall say that everything will still be continuously changing, if you are a fan, like me, of seeing reality as a flux, in the usual way. What will be different is that for the first time, I can assure you, this hypnotic artwork will have lasting and measurable results in terms of its efficacy. In fact, if the world stays different but similar, and you will still perceive it as before the hypnosis, than this process really worked to a totality of experience.</p></li>
<li><p>This artwork is really a special one. It took me long years of hard studying. Late nights of failed attempts to create it, of being close but not quite there; an error process that could  potentially drive you to a degree of sweaty insanity. Finally, just a few moments ago, I was able to succeed in fixing the last glitches, reefing the last curves, improving the aerodynamic  properties, improve on the bandwidth and hydraulic elasticity. A beauty. What it does is simple. It’s a disappearing machine. At first it was hard to find, as it would itself disappear and being that it really disappears (distinguishing it from my previous invisibility machine, which was quite futile really), it really took me forever. Sometime I would have to start from scratch. Than I resolved this problem by locating it into the center of the anus. I tried with the brain first, but the results where not that satisfactory. Now as you are being hypnotized, right now, as we speak, this machine is being built by your own body (and this was my greatest achievement). Actually, if you  pay attention, you can really start to notice and feel this construction. The interesting aspect of my improvements is that appearing and disappearing can be practiced at will. I thought of it mainly as a machine to disappear things, but I found that its best application was that you could at times disappear to yourself. Quite a hard thing. The only problem I noticed was that every time I came  back, I was almost the same but not quite. I’m curious to know your impressions on the workings of my machine. Let me know. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>How much can the people who are the big names in pizzagate be connected to people or events from the larger pedogate?  Have you found connections to events like Boystown/King, The Presidio, The Finders, etc.?</p>

<p>My theory is some sort of ad hoc patchwork of infrastructure for supplying kids developed in the &#39;50&#39;s when the CIA and organized crime started working together.  Then, in the &#39;80&#39;s, an ambitious Governor Clinton leases Arkansas to the CIA and gets introduced to the broader pedo-world.  In the &#39;90&#39;s, under the Clintons, the same management, consolidation and logistics techniques the corporate world uses are applied to the pedo-world.  And under CIA management.  The Clintons also jacked up the marketing and provided a sort of PayPal via the Clinton Foundation.  Applying corporate strategies to streamlining the pedo-trade would have led to someone looking at expansion, sooner or later.  Expansion means a need for more raw material, hence, the Clinton Foundation in Haiti and DynCorp in Europe.</p>

<p>The Podesta e-mails piqued my interest, but it was looking into events like The Presidio, Jerry Sandusky, Boystown/King, midnite White House tours, Jimmy Saville, ad infinitum, that convinced me of the larger pedo-gate.  Over and over and over again there are wayyyyyyy more people implicated than charged or even investigated.  Just from Boystown, cross-referencing testimony to eliminate duplicates still ends with over 400 individual clients/johns.  The only person prosecuted was King and that wasn&#39;t even for anything pedo.</p>

<p>For me, the non-prosecutions are the dog that didn&#39;t bark.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was curious if you found any specific names that kept popping up from pre-pizzagate scandals/events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finders is 100% connected. We know this because the Comet gallery (Transformer) receives support from friends of Finders&#39; Marion Pettie through the American Visionary Art Museum, which is one of the largest Outsider Art galleries on the East Coast and contains a board filled with celebrities. Not accusing them of criminal behavior but you can see the links fairly easily. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a very good analysis of the Clinton Cabal. You should read a little more on a German company called IG Farben (basically funded the Nazis top to bottom) and then reread a lot of ground accounts of the Clinton Foundation in Haiti, Rwanda, etc. Also good to stop fixating on one particular criminal act and to look at the big picture of humans as assets to exploit etc. </p>

<p>You should look closely into Podesta&#39;s Alien schtick, it&#39;s obviously code for something because if he truly were an expert on the matter he wouldn&#39;t be discussing &quot;Roswell landings&quot; and surface-level memes with a known freemason like Blink 182&#39;s Tom Delonge, who is also a good friend of the Heinz-Kerry contingent. </p>

<p>The Harriman family is a good starting point that I found showed up several times over the century. Bronfman is another one that came up in the NXIVM investigation and is worth looking into more. Another angle you can take is following the paths of Tavistock psychs and their contributions in and to the United States. I wasn&#39;t expecting much but it filled out a lot of gaps I was looking for. Also look for people who ran the major art galleries in NYC post war. </p>

<p>More claims and details about PG and less Tavistock. Guessing PG eventually led to the latter. You get a sense of motive and OP mentions what he considers optimistic and pessimistic views about the situation.</p>

<p>With regard to these specific claims, what research did you do outside of reading on the internet, where did you travel to, and whom did you interview?

    <div class="md"><p>Pedophilia is largely a bipartisan issue in the United States, as evidenced quite simply by the relationship between the Podesta brothers, Dennis Hastert and the Clinton&#39;s, as well as the Franklin scandal before that. </p>

<p>Occult snuff and pedophilia networks in DC have always ensured that both parties are compromised, but...it&#39;s complicated. Many of the suspects from the beginning of the 20th century seem to be die-hard eugenicists, but those same families became largely left-wing following the second world war. </p>
