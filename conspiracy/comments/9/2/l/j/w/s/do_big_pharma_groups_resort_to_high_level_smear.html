        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have ben browsing Reddit for quite a while and I try to stay open minded about contentious issues.  I have noticed that any time an anti Vaccination story comes up hordes of commenters descend upon it with hateful comments talking about how they would hurt someone who said such and such (anti-vax comment) or how anti-vaxxers are completely clueless, etc.  </p>

<p>From what I have heard though the anti-vaxxers may have some important insights into a troubling practice of vaccinating incredibly young children with too many vaccines at once with a toxic load that such a young child has trouble handling.  </p>

<p>I seems very logical to me that 1 vaccine may be beneficial but 5+ at a time may be very harmful.  </p>

<p>Big Pharma has had laws passed in the U.S. that give them immunity against any claims against them in regards to vaccinations so they are free to recommend as many vaccines as they can possibly come up with just to increase their profits and if it turns out that taking too many vaccines at once is proven harmful there is no legal recourse.</p>

<p>With this in mind if I was running Big Pharma I would have a horde of angry social media agents running a smear campaign at every available moment on social media making anyone who questioned their logic look like a an ignorant anti-science fool.  Conspiracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science especially with regards to vaccinations has really been turned into a religion. People simply chose to believe in the conclusion, without having any understanding of how it was arrived upon. The general public don&#39;t know how vaccines are tested, or in some cases how little they are actually tested. Or how in a phase 3 trial there is no placebo. But I think the brainwashing has been so effective the general public would probably line up to be injected with anything. If you don&#39;t take this new shot some kid somewhere could die and it would be your fault. It&#39;s easy to remove rational debate when you can get people so afraid.</p>

<p>And here&#39;s an excellent article that examines the link between DDT and pesticide use and 
poliomyelitis.

<p>Your kids would be better off not getting vaccinated by ANY vaccine on the schedule. None have been studied for safety, all have been found to cause adverse health risks especially in the nervous system as you are injecting known neurotoxins. 
 <a href="http://www.vaccineriskawareness.com/Your-Immune-System-How-It-Works-And-How-Vaccines-Damage-It">http://www.vaccineriskawareness.com/Your-Immune-System-How-It-Works-And-How-Vaccines-Damage-It</a></p>

<p>Just read the insert of any vaccine and look at the side effects. Why take the risk? If you&#39;re not malnourished you can deal with any of these diseases just fine. And all were on the way out prior to the introduction of vaccines pointing to nutrition and sanitation as the mechanisms that eradicated these diseases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The numbers are VERY flawed, 1 in 100 is for global, you are including areas that have no clean water, proper nutrition, access to medical care (Not vaccines), housing, sanitized environment or proper hygiene.  The deaths of the infants also does not account for whether the mothers had their mmr shots which is a huge influence since mothers pass on their immunity to infants so they are protected, so a mother with her mmr shots and an unvaccinated child is at risk but a mother that is unvaccinated with an unvaccinated child is not.   It also does not state whether those in europe who have died from the measles disease had been vaccinated or not, there are many outbreaks that occur in which those with the vaccine are still infected so the question is left unanswered as to whether they are dying because of measles or because they cannot properly fight the measles disease because of the vaccine.  </p>

<p>The CDC lists global statistics, not those relating to only a 1st world country, obviously those African children are going to die from measles because they are drinking mud water, let&#39;s see how well you fare drinking that even while vaccinated.  </p>

<p>Your sources are very misleading, they use global statistics which is not real data that can be compared since you are comparing a 1st world country to 3rd world which skews the data heavily.  The sources also do not account for whether those infected or the parents of the infected had been vaccinated in the case of infants.  </p>

This clearly shows how economical changes affected measles, the death rates were not even slightly affected after the introduction of the measles vaccines, it was already on a massive decay.<br/>
If 1 in 10,000 is deadly then vaccines are just as deadly, especially when you look at vaers data and the number of cases successfully won through the vaccine compensation act.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am almost certain you are a shill, you have just admitted that the 1 in 1000 statistic, while true, is completely misleading and is total fear mongering.  How can you even try to argue that your numbers have ANY relevance to any actual debate on the topic of vaccines when you are comparing people who drink mud water to people who have access to every possible medical care available.  Your whole argument is flawed, you are just trying to pass off numbers simply because they exist but don&#39;t have any real backing behind them for being relevant to the topic at hand, you need to do further research before you start flinging your shit stained statistics around and just trying to scare the public.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said that I am an authority. I choose the inform myself instead of parroting what the media says</p>

<p>The Polio story is really complicated and a lot of different things happened at that time. It is hard for me to say how much of the decline was due to vaccination and how much was due to other factors and it would take too long to explain the full story.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I have ever claimed that the oral vaccine did not reduce the number of wild polio viruses in circulation?</p>

<p>One thing one always needs to pay attention to is if the diagnostic criteria were changed around the time of the vaccine introduction which was the case with Polio.</p>

<p>This is very important. If you listen to the media reporting you would believe that Polio was eradicated in India since they started vaccination 30 years ago.</p>

<p>While it is true that the number of  reported cases went from perhaps 20000 each year to 0 but at the same time reported AFP cases  (Illness identical to Polio) went from 0 to 50000 each year. Makes you wonder how many of the former Polio cases were actually misdiagnosed AFP?</p>

<p>I think that a lot of what was called Polio in the US before we had a vaccine could have been GBS, Transverse-Myelitis and AFP. After the vaccine came on the market they changed the diagnostic criteria and these illnesses would not longer qualify as Poliomyelitis.</p>

Furthermore, let&#39;s assume they did contribute, why should I fear these diseases, the symptoms for the diseases we vaccinate for are mild flu like symptoms,  unless you&#39;re malnourished such as those who live in third world countries, some of them die from diarrhea, but we don&#39;t worry about diarrhea here in the US, nor do we worry about diseases which we don&#39;t have vaccines for (they are also not a problem anymore even though there&#39;s no vaccines, probably due to sanitation).

<p>I&#39;m not really sure you understand what vaccinations are available. Polio has just flu-like symptoms? Whooping cough, mumps, measles? Flu-like symptoms?</p>

<p>These are life-threatening diseases. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re in a developed nation or not. A large portion of the people who contract them and die from them are infants, children, and senior citizens. Diarrhea-induced dehydration still kills people in developed nations every day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look. Like I said before I&#39;m open to change, but this whole thread I&#39;ve seen you only post claims with nothing to back you up. I&#39;ve done the research, CDC website and everywhere else.

If you can show me the exact sources you&#39;re referencing and have data to support your claims then please do so, I would like to see it. Until then I&#39;m still going to lean towards not vaccinating since, for hundreds of thousands of years, that&#39;s not what we&#39;ve adapted to as humans and I&#39;d rather not take my chances on something with poor safety studies. I mean you&#39;re injecting a known neurotoxin,  it inflames the nervous system, that&#39;s part of its mechanism of action, that&#39;s how it induces an immune response, its known to cause encephalitis, seizures, and other neurological reactions. If I should still vaccinate in spite of this, I&#39;m really all ears, I&#39;ll change my mind on any issue.</p>

<p>The program is called the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and information is found here: <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html">https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html</a> </p>

<p>Vaccine manufactures are not immune from civil lawsuits.  Instead, an injured person must FIRST proceed to the &quot;vaccine court,&quot; and if a satisfactory result is not achieved, a civil lawsuit can be filed against the manufacture.   This is covered at the above link.  It reads: &quot; The special master&#39;s decision may be appealed and petitioners who reject  the decision of the court (or withdraw their petitions within certain  timelines) may file a claim in civil court against the vaccine company  and/or the health care provider who administered the vaccine. &quot;</p>

The reason they think it&#39;s important is because &quot;side effect&quot; implies it&#39;s an effect of the product whereas &quot;adverse reaction&quot; implies it&#39;s a reaction by the subject. Get it? On the one hand the product is defective, while on the other it&#39;s the person. Fuck these guys.</p>

<p>That said, Big Pharma has been extremely successful at propagating the idea that anti-vaxxers are equivalent to baby killers, so most everyone wants to distance themselves as much as possible from the anti-vax movement. In this way the masses become programmed useful idiots. Up until about a year ago I used to be one of them. </p>

<p>Funny though, it was a conversation I had with one of these shills that redpilled me on the topic. The guy was attacking people with perfectly reasonable questions in a pretty offensive way, so I started looking for material to undermine his arguments and bingo! That&#39;s when I discovered that Gardasil wasn&#39;t tested against a placebo even though it was perfectly reasonable and ethical to do so. And furthermore the safety studies were custom-fucking-designed to obscure any evidence of &quot;adverse reactions&quot;. Once it becomes obvious that Big Pharma actively obfuscates the side effects of its products, then you know there&#39;s a conspiracy afoot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what made you so sure (you said; definitely). Is it because it&#39;s the only logical conclusion in your point of view or is there actually evidence?</p>

<p>Like I dont deny there&#39;s all kinds of shills on reddit. But this habbit of some people on r/conspiracy is kinda annoying me. </p>

<p>&quot;Because he is knowledgable he&#39;s a shill&quot;
&quot;because he&#39;s against my view point he&#39;s a shill&quot;
&quot;I get downvoted must be shills&quot;
etc...</p>

<p>It&#39;s completely counterproductive and stifles any conversation.</p>

<p>Um. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the problem is Reddit-wide. I&#39;ve been called a Russian bot countless times in r/politics, r/news, and elsewhere. Characterizing this as an r/conspiracy issue is retarded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been proven that Monsanto paid trolls to be pro GMO/Glysophate and dispute any claims of them being unsafe in anyway so It wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all. A lot of people are abandoning mainstream TV so they have to get their propaganda out somewhere.</p>

<p>With the merger of Bayer/Monsanto, and other pharmaceuticals companies continuing to get only get bigger I&#39;d expect even more shills backing up Big Pharma.</p>

<p>C&#39;mon, you&#39;ve seen posts like this. 99% of vaccination posts have about 10 heavily up-voted posts that read like an emotional plea. Even in places like askscience, where emotional pleas are the antithesis of the sub. Reddit is one of the most trafficked websites, of course they&#39;re going to be astroturfing here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you tell people to &quot;google it&quot; and not simply spend the 30 seconds to do it your self? If you did, you would not be guessing at things and not be misinformed.  You could also help people by directing them to legitimate sources of information.</p>

<p>The program is called the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and information is found here: <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html">https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html</a> </p>

<p>Vaccine manufactures are not immune from civil lawsuits.  Instead, an injured person must FIRST proceed to the &quot;vaccine court,&quot; and if a satisfactory result is not achieved, a civil lawsuit can be filed against the manufacture.   This is covered at the above link.  It reads: &quot; The special master&#39;s decision may be appealed and petitioners who reject  the decision of the court (or withdraw their petitions within certain  timelines) may file a claim in civil court against the vaccine company  and/or the health care provider who administered the vaccine. &quot;</p>

<p>Vaccine manufactures are not immune to lawsuits.   You can sue them if their product causes you injury and you do not like the decision of the &quot;vaccine court.&quot;  </p>
