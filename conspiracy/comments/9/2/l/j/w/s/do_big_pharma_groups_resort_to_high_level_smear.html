       I have ben browsing Reddit for quite a while and I try to stay open minded about contentious issues.  I have noticed that any time an anti Vaccination story comes up hordes of commenters descend upon it with hateful comments talking about how they would hurt someone who said such and such (anti-vax comment) or how anti-vaxxers are completely clueless, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I have heard though the anti-vaxxers may have some important insights into a troubling practice of vaccinating incredibly young children with too many vaccines at once with a toxic load that such a young child has trouble handling.
      </p>
      <p>
       I seems very logical to me that 1 vaccine may be beneficial but 5+ at a time may be very harmful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Big Pharma has had laws passed in the U.S. that give them immunity against any claims against them in regards to vaccinations so they are free to recommend as many vaccines as they can possibly come up with just to increase their profits and if it turns out that taking too many vaccines at once is proven harmful there is no legal recourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this in mind if I was running Big Pharma I would have a horde of angry social media agents running a smear campaign at every available moment on social media making anyone who questioned their logic look like a an ignorant anti-science fool.  Conspiracy?

       Science especially with regards to vaccinations has really been turned into a religion. People simply chose to believe in the conclusion, without having any understanding of how it was arrived upon. The general public don't know how vaccines are tested, or in some cases how little they are actually tested. Or how in a phase 3 trial there is no placebo. But I think the brainwashing has been so effective the general public would probably line up to be injected with anything. If you don't take this new shot some kid somewhere could die and it would be your fault. It's easy to remove rational debate when you can get people so afraid.

       Most people are so religious about vaccines they aren’t even willing to spend the 10 minutes to even read the ingredients. If you read the ingredients no sane human would willingly inject their children or themselves with this shit.

       Completely agree. Vaccines are way more about religious dogma, and a fear based control mechanism rather than real science.

       How can they even try to claim that an "anti-vaxxer" is appealing to fear mongering yet you have doctors literally telling you "YOU'RE A BABY KILLING MONSTER AND YOUR CHILD WILL DIE IF YOU DON'T GET ALL VACCINES ON THE SCHEDULE".  Many mothers have reported they are sitting there crying in the doctors office and this is how they were being treated when all they wanted was more information, time to decide, a delayed schedule, etc and they weren't even against vaccines they just wanted an alternative schedule.

       The same “doctors” who were pushing their favorite brands of cigarettes in the 60s. The same people pushing pills for big pharma rather than recommending lifestyle changes like proper nutrition. Let’s not forget the real biggest killers heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and brain disease.

       I suggest researching further. It seems like every day anti-vax posts pop up here with separate citations, all of them easily researchable. If you're following the money route on Vaccine companies, do the same for the places claiming the opposite.

       A post a few weeks ago cited a paper by university students who used only 3 people in their study. Another was a research paper paid for by a lobbying group; their information was heavily cherry-picked.

       It's an opinion hit-piece with many of the absurd citations I mentioned. Read the citations. Read the actual reports, the studies. Look into the people that wrote them. Some of them are further opinion pieces based on decades-old research that's dubious in either matter or sourcing.

       95% of polio cases are symptom free, the other 5 percent are flu like symptoms. Here's two great resources that examine the history of polio and the efficacy of the vaccine.

       Your kids would be better off not getting vaccinated by ANY vaccine on the schedule. None have been studied for safety, all have been found to cause adverse health risks especially in the nervous system as you are injecting known neurotoxins.

       Just read the insert of any vaccine and look at the side effects. Why take the risk? If you're not malnourished you can deal with any of these diseases just fine. And all were on the way out prior to the introduction of vaccines pointing to nutrition and sanitation as the mechanisms that eradicated these diseases.

       The numbers are VERY flawed, 1 in 100 is for global, you are including areas that have no clean water, proper nutrition, access to medical care (Not vaccines), housing, sanitized environment or proper hygiene.  The deaths of the infants also does not account for whether the mothers had their mmr shots which is a huge influence since mothers pass on their immunity to infants so they are protected, so a mother with her mmr shots and an unvaccinated child is at risk but a mother that is unvaccinated with an unvaccinated child is not.   It also does not state whether those in europe who have died from the measles disease had been vaccinated or not, there are many outbreaks that occur in which those with the vaccine are still infected so the question is left unanswered as to whether they are dying because of measles or because they cannot properly fight the measles disease because of the vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CDC lists global statistics, not those relating to only a 1st world country, obviously those African children are going to die from measles because they are drinking mud water, let's see how well you fare drinking that even while vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your sources are very misleading, they use global statistics which is not real data that can be compared since you are comparing a 1st world country to 3rd world which skews the data heavily.  The sources also do not account for whether those infected or the parents of the infected had been vaccinated in the case of infants.

       Measles is still a deadly disease. I saw one source claiming the American number could have been as low as 1 in 10,000 during the 50's on account of unreported cases. Even 1 in 10,000 is considered deadly.

       This clearly shows how economical changes affected measles, the death rates were not even slightly affected after the introduction of the measles vaccines, it was already on a massive decay.
       <br/>
       If 1 in 10,000 is deadly then vaccines are just as deadly, especially when you look at vaers data and the number of cases successfully won through the vaccine compensation act.

       Ffs. The 1 in 1,000 was about Moskowitz contracting the disease as a child, which would be in the 1950's. I have no idea where he was born. Your chart is England and Wales.

       Because international implies that everyone is being affected by the disease in a similar way.  A child in Africa is MUCH more likely to die from measles than a child in the U.S that has access to clean water, nutrition, medical care, vitamin A, etc.

       The problem is that you are trying to use higher statistics to debunk somebody who is speaking out against vaccines.  You say 1 in 1000 but the number is SO much lower than that, it's misleading and untrue.

       I am almost certain you are a shill, you have just admitted that the 1 in 1000 statistic, while true, is completely misleading and is total fear mongering.  How can you even try to argue that your numbers have ANY relevance to any actual debate on the topic of vaccines when you are comparing people who drink mud water to people who have access to every possible medical care available.  Your whole argument is flawed, you are just trying to pass off numbers simply because they exist but don't have any real backing behind them for being relevant to the topic at hand, you need to do further research before you start flinging your shit stained statistics around and just trying to scare the public.

       I was asked to provide sources for the 1 in 1,000 number. I did. There were no parameters set. It's still a legitimate statistic overall. I don't know what you're not understanding. It's not a good representation of vaccine numbers? Of course not. But it's still a true stat.

       I never said that I am an authority. I choose the inform myself instead of parroting what the media says
      </p>

       The Polio story is really complicated and a lot of different things happened at that time. It is hard for me to say how much of the decline was due to vaccination and how much was due to other factors and it would take too long to explain the full story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I have ever claimed that the oral vaccine did not reduce the number of wild polio viruses in circulation?
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing one always needs to pay attention to is if the diagnostic criteria were changed around the time of the vaccine introduction which was the case with Polio.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is very important. If you listen to the media reporting you would believe that Polio was eradicated in India since they started vaccination 30 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is true that the number of  reported cases went from perhaps 20000 each year to 0 but at the same time reported AFP cases  (Illness identical to Polio) went from 0 to 50000 each year. Makes you wonder how many of the former Polio cases were actually misdiagnosed AFP?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that a lot of what was called Polio in the US before we had a vaccine could have been GBS, Transverse-Myelitis and AFP. After the vaccine came on the market they changed the diagnostic criteria and these illnesses would not longer qualify as Poliomyelitis.

       Ditto. You consistently push this anti-vax narrative, with an obvious ulterior motive. I don't know if it's political, as many of these things tend to be or corporate. I've already seen enough anti-vax "studies" paid for in political contribution money.

       You cry that these "anti-vax" studies are paid for with political money and have conflict of interest, yet here the cdc is having all of it's studies paid for by Merck that has been proven to threaten scientists with cutting their funding if they spoke out against vioxx.

       Do you have sources that vaccines are responsible for this? From what I've seen these diseases were on the way out before vaccines were introduced. Furthermore, let's assume they did contribute, why should I fear these diseases, the symptoms for the diseases we vaccinate for are mild flu like symptoms,  unless you're malnourished such as those who live in third world countries, some of them die from diarrhea, but we don't worry about diarrhea here in the US, nor do we worry about diseases which we don't have vaccines for (they are also not a problem anymore even though there's no vaccines, probably due to sanitation). See what I mean?

       Let's be honest, if you're here debating this stuff on that side of the argument, you're not exactly going to believe sources like the WHO or CDC. If you did, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

       I'm not really sure you understand what vaccinations are available. Polio has just flu-like symptoms? Whooping cough, mumps, measles? Flu-like symptoms?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are life-threatening diseases. It doesn't matter if you're in a developed nation or not. A large portion of the people who contract them and die from them are infants, children, and senior citizens. Diarrhea-induced dehydration still kills people in developed nations every day.

       I'll believe any evidence that's real scientific data. I'm more than willing to change my mind. Are you? Are you open to the possibility that you could be wrong? Maybe you've bought into dogma? Do you have evidence that these diseases are as terrible as you say for those of us in the developed world?

       Look. Like I said before I'm open to change, but this whole thread I've seen you only post claims with nothing to back you up. I've done the research, CDC website and everywhere else. The language you have been using on this thread seems to be a little combative like you're defending dogma instead of thoughtfully considering opposing viewpoints. If you can show me the exact sources you're referencing and have data to support your claims then please do so, I would like to see it. Until then I'm still going to lean towards not vaccinating since, for hundreds of thousands of years, that's not what we've adapted to as humans and I'd rather not take my chances on something with poor safety studies. I mean you're injecting a known neurotoxin,  it inflames the nervous system, that's part of its mechanism of action, that's how it induces an immune response, its known to cause encephalitis, seizures, and other neurological reactions. If I should still vaccinate in spite of this, I'm really all ears, I'll change my mind on any issue.

       Come off it, man. There have been weeks of people providing you evidence and scientific research and you still push the narrative. If you've looked at the CDC information and are still unconvinced, I'm not sure that you are willing to be proven wrong.

      </p>
      <p>
       I was looking at some studies that supposedly disproved the link between GBS and swine flu vaccinations.
All the studies did was reference each other and had no actual research to back them up.
The trippy part?  When I looked up the researchers names, I found that the only place they could be found were on links to the studies.  I couldnt find anything else about them. No social media accounts. No mentions in the press. No mentions in association with any schools they may have graduated from. Nothing.

       Why would you tell people to "google it" and not simply spend the 30 seconds to do it your self? If you did, you would not be guessing at things and not be misinformed.  You could also help people by directing them to legitimate sources of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The program is called the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and information is found here:
       <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html">

       Vaccine manufactures are not immune from civil lawsuits.  Instead, an injured person must FIRST proceed to the "vaccine court," and if a satisfactory result is not achieved, a civil lawsuit can be filed against the manufacture.   This is covered at the above link.  It reads: " The special master's decision may be appealed and petitioners who reject  the decision of the court (or withdraw their petitions within certain  timelines) may file a claim in civil court against the vaccine company  and/or the health care provider who administered the vaccine. "
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccine manufactures are not immune to lawsuits.   You can sue them if their product causes you injury and you do not like the decision of the "vaccine court."

Go look at any Imgur post about vax, 100% the post is about how STUPID anti-vaccers are for even asking questions, and the comments are filled with people holding pitchforks and torches saying that those people need their children taken away and or forceibly injected while the watch or just taken away forever while they are sterilized.

       Reddit autists truly believe that every baby will die if they aren't vaccinated and that Donald Trump will kill them.

       There are definitely paid pro vaccine shills on Reddit. These are the ones that have just a bit too much specific knowledge about, say, Gardasil safety studies, and the ones that will condescendingly explain the difference between "side effects" and "adverse reactions" as though it's important. The reason they think it's important is because "side effect" implies it's an effect of the product whereas "adverse reaction" implies it's a reaction by the subject. Get it? On the one hand the product is defective, while on the other it's the person. Fuck these guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, Big Pharma has been extremely successful at propagating the idea that anti-vaxxers are equivalent to baby killers, so most everyone wants to distance themselves as much as possible from the anti-vax movement. In this way the masses become programmed useful idiots. Up until about a year ago I used to be one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny though, it was a conversation I had with one of these shills that redpilled me on the topic. The guy was attacking people with perfectly reasonable questions in a pretty offensive way, so I started looking for material to undermine his arguments and bingo! That's when I discovered that Gardasil wasn't tested against a placebo even though it was perfectly reasonable and ethical to do so. And furthermore the safety studies were custom-fucking-designed to obscure any evidence of "adverse reactions". Once it becomes obvious that Big Pharma actively obfuscates the side effects of its products, then you know there's a conspiracy afoot.

       Why would they pay people when by faaar most people are pro vaccine? They could just let them do the job. And yea ofcourse some people are knowledgable about it. All kinds of people on reddit.

       But what made you so sure (you said; definitely). Is it because it's the only logical conclusion in your point of view or is there actually evidence?

       Like I dont deny there's all kinds of shills on reddit. But this habbit of some people on r/conspiracy is kinda annoying me.

       Um. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the problem is Reddit-wide. I've been called a Russian bot countless times in r/politics, r/news, and elsewhere. Characterizing this as an r/conspiracy issue is retarded.

       It's been proven that Monsanto paid trolls to be pro GMO/Glysophate and dispute any claims of them being unsafe in anyway so It wouldn't surprise me at all. A lot of people are abandoning mainstream TV so they have to get their propaganda out somewhere.

       With the merger of Bayer/Monsanto, and other pharmaceuticals companies continuing to get only get bigger I'd expect even more shills backing up Big Pharma.

       C'mon, you've seen posts like this. 99% of vaccination posts have about 10 heavily up-voted posts that read like an emotional plea. Even in places like askscience, where emotional pleas are the antithesis of the sub. Reddit is one of the most trafficked websites, of course they're going to be astroturfing here.

       Could you cite 1 in 1,000 dying? Because we have historical, statistical evidence that proves the deaths much lower than that.

       Why would you tell people to "google it" and not simply spend the 30 seconds to do it your self? If you did, you would not be guessing at things and not be misinformed.  You could also help people by directing them to legitimate sources of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The program is called the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and information is found here:
       <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html">

       Vaccine manufactures are not immune from civil lawsuits.  Instead, an injured person must FIRST proceed to the "vaccine court," and if a satisfactory result is not achieved, a civil lawsuit can be filed against the manufacture.   This is covered at the above link.  It reads: " The special master's decision may be appealed and petitioners who reject  the decision of the court (or withdraw their petitions within certain  timelines) may file a claim in civil court against the vaccine company  and/or the health care provider who administered the vaccine. "
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccine manufactures are not immune to lawsuits.   You can sue them if their product causes you injury and you do not like the decision of the "vaccine court."
