<p><strong>You just mentioned the Clintons, who are friends of yours. Why is there still such visceral dislike of them? What are other people not seeing in Hillary, for example, that you see?</strong><br/>
It’s because there’s a side of her — when you keep secrets, they backfire.</p>

<p><strong>Like what secrets?</strong><br/>
This is something else I shouldn’t be talking about.</p>

<p><strong>You sure seem to know a lot.</strong><br/>
I know too much, man.</p>

<p><strong>What’s something you wish you didn’t know?</strong><br/>
Who killed Kennedy.</p>

<p><strong>Who did it?</strong><br/>
[Chicago mobster Sam] GiancanaChicago gangster Sam Giancana is a well-known name among Kennedy conspiracists, both for his alleged help in delivering Illinois votes for Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election and the 1963 assassination of the president. The latter theory largely stems from Giancana’s murder in 1975, not long before he was supposed to testify before a Senate committee investigating collusion between the mob and the CIA.. The connection was there between Sinatra and the Mafia and Kennedy. Joe Kennedy — he was a bad man — he came to Frank to have him talk to Giancana about getting votes.</p>

<p><strong>I’ve heard this theory before, that the mob helped win Illinois for Kennedy in 1960.</strong><br/>
We shouldn’t talk about this publicly. </p>

<p>So he&#39;s talking out of his ass about JFK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Joint Chiefs of Staff for some, Secret Service for others, CIA or other unknown intelligence agency for others.</p>

<p>CIA &amp; Secret Service are not under Department of Defense.  NSA is, DIA is.  General Curtis LeMay smoked a cigar at the autopsy.  LeMay was the author of the nuclear launch codebooks.  They were all reported missing from B-52 patrols on 11/22, which suggests an overview of the plot and the &quot;Blame Russia&quot; component that Oswald&#39;s USSR defection was designed to failsafe.  If rogue pilots or officers decided to take matters into their own hands upon hearing that alleged &quot;Communist sympathizer&quot; Oswald &quot;did it&quot; then there would have been a danger of accidental nuclear war.  Codebooks were removed.</p>

<p>CIA couldn&#39;t have done that.  Only Pentagon.  But CIA-exclusive links are elsewhere, like the CIA safe house Oswald slept at on his return from USSR + Oswald&#39;s CIA files.  Oswald had high-security clearance from Army + Jagger-Chiles-Stoval where he worked on U2 recon.  George DeMohrenschildt, Oswald&#39;s handler, was a right-wing anti-Communist &quot;White Russian&quot; with CIA ties including George H. W. Bush.</p>

<p>Mexico City impostor (photo available of a blonde man) claiming to be Oswald is anyone&#39;s guess, but it&#39;s unlikely that Giancana would have had the breadth of knowledge about Oswald&#39;s background to tag him as a patsy, or to allegedly contact the KGB assassination specialist in Mexico City allegedly contacted by the Oswald impostor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He doesn’t give a f. He’s absolutely full of himself. So are most successful producers. All that is incidental to the “conspiracy” content I posted.

    <div class="md"><p>Only problem is he&#39;s since apologized for the statements he made in the interview, characterizing them as &quot;wordvomit&quot; - </p>

<p>&quot;&#39;When you’ve been fortunate enough to have lived such a long and crazy life (and you’ve recently stopped drinking – three years ago!), certain details about specific events (which do NOT paint the full picture of my intentions nor experiences) come flooding back all at once and even at 85, it’s apparent that ‘wordvomit’ and bad-mouthing is inexcusable,&#39; Jones elaborated in his statement. &#39;One of the hardest things about this situation is that, this bad-mouthing had contradicted the very real messages I tried to relay about racism, inequality, homophobia, poverty… you name it. And of course I don’t want that. I have already reached out to my friends privately, but when you live a public life, you have a responsibility to be an example, and since I do lead a public life, I wanted to make a public apology.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Centipedes, a term for Trump supporters adopted from a YouTube mash-up of the song “Centipede” by the band Knife Party and clips of Mr. Trump’s speeches. It might also be a penis joke. Seriously.&quot; - <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/opinion/sunday/reddit-and-the-god-emperor-of-the-internet.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/opinion/sunday/reddit-and-the-god-emperor-of-the-internet.html</a></p>

<p>Also, centipede is known as a &quot;nimble navigator,&quot; and Trump is able to navigate impossible odds to victory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look at your current culture to see who your masters are.  In the 30&#39;s until the late 60&#39;s culture was flamboyant, starts like Cary Grant and John Wayne ruled.  Sophisticated dress codes, stylish furnishings, stylish sets were all in vogue.  Of course, the culture was as gay as you can get and the rulers were all sucking dick.</p>

<p>Now you have a culture that thinks only of themselves, women are portrayed as meat, and the biggest celebrities dress like cheap whores.  We are told that we are all worthless, we are being degraded.  Who uses these techniques?  Pedophiles.  We now live in pedophile culture.  Pedos don&#39;t think of others.  They don&#39;t care about the damage caused when they rape a child, because they are only about instant gratification.</p>

<p>What&#39;s next?  Once the culture you are immersed in makes you accept sex with kids, which it will.  Just as you all accept gays now because you spent 100 years immersed in gay culture, so too will this or a future generation accept pedophillia and incest.  It&#39;s already happening, the most popular porn searches are for teens, young, petite etc.  A flat chested, childlike porn actress will make significantly more than a big cheated porn actress.</p>

<p>Look at apps like Bigo where children will have thousands of viewers watching her or him dancing in sexy outfits, but the real women on there are lucky to pull in half that audience.  It&#39;s happening.... Once youre immersed in that culture, you become that culture.</p>
