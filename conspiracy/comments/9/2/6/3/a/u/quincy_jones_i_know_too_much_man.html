       <strong>
        You just mentioned the Clintons, who are friends of yours. Why is there still such visceral dislike of them? What are other people not seeing in Hillary, for example, that you see?
       </strong>
       <br/>
       It’s because there’s a side of her — when you keep secrets, they backfire.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Like what secrets?
       </strong>
       <br/>
       This is something else I shouldn’t be talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        You sure seem to know a lot.
       </strong>
       <br/>
       I know too much, man.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What’s something you wish you didn’t know?
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Who killed Kennedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Who did it?
       </strong>
       <br/>
       [Chicago mobster Sam] GiancanaChicago gangster Sam Giancana is a well-known name among Kennedy conspiracists, both for his alleged help in delivering Illinois votes for Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election and the 1963 assassination of the president. The latter theory largely stems from Giancana’s murder in 1975, not long before he was supposed to testify before a Senate committee investigating collusion between the mob and the CIA.. The connection was there between Sinatra and the Mafia and Kennedy. Joe Kennedy — he was a bad man — he came to Frank to have him talk to Giancana about getting votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I’ve heard this theory before, that the mob helped win Illinois for Kennedy in 1960.
       </strong>
       <br/>
       We shouldn’t talk about this publicly.

       Giancana did not have the authority to change the parade route, call off Secret Service, remove nuclear launch code-books from B-52s, shut down the D.C. phone system after the assassination, invite General Lansdale to Dallas or General LeMay to the autopsy, send an Oswald impostor to Mexico City, or assign Dulles to the Warren Commission.

       Joint Chiefs of Staff for some, Secret Service for others, CIA or other unknown intelligence agency for others.
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA &amp; Secret Service are not under Department of Defense.  NSA is, DIA is.  General Curtis LeMay smoked a cigar at the autopsy.  LeMay was the author of the nuclear launch codebooks.  They were all reported missing from B-52 patrols on 11/22, which suggests an overview of the plot and the "Blame Russia" component that Oswald's USSR defection was designed to failsafe.  If rogue pilots or officers decided to take matters into their own hands upon hearing that alleged "Communist sympathizer" Oswald "did it" then there would have been a danger of accidental nuclear war.  Codebooks were removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA couldn't have done that.  Only Pentagon.  But CIA-exclusive links are elsewhere, like the CIA safe house Oswald slept at on his return from USSR + Oswald's CIA files.  Oswald had high-security clearance from Army + Jagger-Chiles-Stoval where he worked on U2 recon.  George DeMohrenschildt, Oswald's handler, was a right-wing anti-Communist "White Russian" with CIA ties including George H. W. Bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mexico City impostor (photo available of a blonde man) claiming to be Oswald is anyone's guess, but it's unlikely that Giancana would have had the breadth of knowledge about Oswald's background to tag him as a patsy, or to allegedly contact the KGB assassination specialist in Mexico City allegedly contacted by the Oswald impostor.

       He also shits on Trump in the interview. He doesn’t seem too Repub. Or dem for that matter. He’s a renegade old man who’s a product of being in showbiz almost his whole life. Has probably seen and heard  so much crap on both sides he knows they’re all full of it anyway.

       He doesn’t give a f. He’s absolutely full of himself. So are most successful producers. All that is incidental to the “conspiracy” content I posted. There’s also more in there (eg that Marlon Brando slept with everyone including Marvin Gaye and other supposedly heterosexual men).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the fact that he’s so non PC and has the industry insides from literal decades of high level contacts shows that this is only scratching the surface of the conspiracies widely discussed.

       Only problem is he's since apologized for the statements he made in the interview, characterizing them as "wordvomit" -
      </p>
      <p>
       "'When you’ve been fortunate enough to have lived such a long and crazy life (and you’ve recently stopped drinking – three years ago!), certain details about specific events (which do NOT paint the full picture of my intentions nor experiences) come flooding back all at once and even at 85, it’s apparent that ‘wordvomit’ and bad-mouthing is inexcusable,' Jones elaborated in his statement. 'One of the hardest things about this situation is that, this bad-mouthing had contradicted the very real messages I tried to relay about racism, inequality, homophobia, poverty… you name it. And of course I don’t want that. I have already reached out to my friends privately, but when you live a public life, you have a responsibility to be an example, and since I do lead a public life, I wanted to make a public apology.'"

       He had a psychedelic trip years ago a heavy one. He embraced his death already and is living his life as new as can be. He has found comfort in letting go of what he knows and embracing all the unknown that is left. He ain’t afraid of death he expects. So suiciding him has become meaningless in terms of hurting him. The only way to hurt him is to destroy what he has worked hard on the last few years.

       Just keep in mind that this is the same guy who 2pac accused of asking him if he would fuck him in the ass! Now while that is just a wild accusation, he does have some parts of his past that point to that being possibly true. He brought Will Smith to fame. And what was Smith's first film? 6° Of Separation, where he was getting fucked in the ass on film! But again, at the end of the day, that was just an unfounded accusation made by Tupac!

       FWIW, in French pederasty simply means male homosexuality. I think in English it’s used like this sometimes too, although I’m not sure of it.

       This needs more attention. The "pede" moniker, though nominally from centipede, is completely bizarre. And it ain't Yankee Doodle. I agree it's likely a very well-placed troll, and possible the whole centipede --&gt; pede was orchestrated.

       Yeah centipedes are disgusting insects. I don’t see why anyone would willingly call himself that. What is the overt origin of that term for Trump supporters?

       Also the 4chan reverence for a Babylonian frog-deity seems weird.

       Also, centipede is known as a "nimble navigator," and Trump is able to navigate impossible odds to victory.

       Pederastry can also refer to an older man who fucks a younger “protege” while giving the younger political or social connections.  I.E. fucking young entertainers and giving them jobs.

       Take a look at your current culture to see who your masters are.  In the 30's until the late 60's culture was flamboyant, starts like Cary Grant and John Wayne ruled.  Sophisticated dress codes, stylish furnishings, stylish sets were all in vogue.  Of course, the culture was as gay as you can get and the rulers were all sucking dick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you have a culture that thinks only of themselves, women are portrayed as meat, and the biggest celebrities dress like cheap whores.  We are told that we are all worthless, we are being degraded.  Who uses these techniques?  Pedophiles.  We now live in pedophile culture.  Pedos don't think of others.  They don't care about the damage caused when they rape a child, because they are only about instant gratification.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's next?  Once the culture you are immersed in makes you accept sex with kids, which it will.  Just as you all accept gays now because you spent 100 years immersed in gay culture, so too will this or a future generation accept pedophillia and incest.  It's already happening, the most popular porn searches are for teens, young, petite etc.  A flat chested, childlike porn actress will make significantly more than a big cheated porn actress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at apps like Bigo where children will have thousands of viewers watching her or him dancing in sexy outfits, but the real women on there are lucky to pull in half that audience.  It's happening.... Once youre immersed in that culture, you become that culture.
