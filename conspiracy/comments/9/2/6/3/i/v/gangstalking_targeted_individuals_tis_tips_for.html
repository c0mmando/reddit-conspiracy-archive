     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       One thing i would like to address is that i love Scott Snitzer on youtube.. I have watched about 40-50 hours worth of his videos.. I've absorbed most of it...
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be a hardcore health nut.. Not just with nutrition but also exercising.. I used to go for a 2 mile jog (it wasnt usually a brisk jog, i was usually pusing myself doing wind-sprints and stuff.. i was trying to become much more fit) 5 days a week.. I used to beat up on a 140 lb heavy bag (most intense cardio a person can experience, esp freestyle).. I used to research deeply and take many of these vitamins and supplements (the kinds that are natural like ginseng and green/black tea and bee pollen and lecithin etc) I only researched natural ones.. whole foods...
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be into that pretty hard around 2006.. I did all kinds of exercises also like weight-lifting... I did that for a few years straight...
      </p>
      <p>
       I was still being targeted hard during this time period...
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand where scott is comming from, because you basically need to stay out of the gutter in general.. But there is much more that a TI also needs to do.. You also need your head in place.. Infact, a Ti's psycology is probably more important than his physical state... Well I have much respect for Scott.. But i just wanted to throw some things on the table so to speak..
      </p>
      <p>
       Like i said, i used to be fit as it gets with all the nutrition, and supplements... I posted my picture on the gangstalking forum...
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not been that healthy for years and i basically feel the same...
      </p>
      <p>
       Scott's a great guy and i mean that, i AM NOT being phoney..
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       On to the next topic:
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, Scott is a human being just like me or anyone else.. I make and have made mistakes.... I hate the word mistake...
      </p>
      <p>
       What i basically mean is that a person learns.. They make a so-called "mistakes".. And then learn.. Which is what most people do.. Its natural... NORMAL..
      </p>
      <p>
       Every singlingle time i have considered a situation "A mistake", the perps capitalize on it and try to drive it home...
      </p>
      <p>
       One common mistake they try to capatilize on is if you talk about or contact people from your past..
      </p>
      <p>
       It may seem strange....
      </p>
      <p>
       But it is natural to want to branch out and reach old connections and people that you knew.. Otherwise, you are being severed by a narcisist or by related tyranny...
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ever go onto MySpace or Facebook and you contact an old person from the past, it doesnt matter how far.. Just LEAVE IT.. DO NOT DELETE YOUR POST... LEAVE IT.... UNCONDITIONALLY... When you delete it, you are doing a much worse thing than leaving it.... LEAVE IT, NO MATTER HOW EMBARRASSING IT MAY SEEM....
      </p>
      <p>
       For a T.I., as far as deleting shit on social media... The only time this is legit is if you are an actual Child Porn addict or you actually rape kids.... then you need to get fucked...

       I don't believe anyone has been gangstalked unless they have actually discovered something or made all the right connections with evidence to back it up no one commenting on a conspiracy forum has been  gangstalked. I could be wrong but I just think gangstalking is a mixture or paranoia and myth

       I've seen many stories here about 'gangstalking'.  I'm not really sure if that phrase is organic or weaponized (like the words conspiracy theory), but State sponsored harassment is a real thing.

       It is paranoia. It is manufactured paranoia. Character assasinations- Some people WANT to be masons, illuminati affiliated. Sacrificial rituals require sacrifices... In my story, I was meant to be a sacrifice...

       I could get evidence.. That part isnt hard.. But to capture the elaborate nature of it is much more difficult.... I could walk out into the street right now with a still camera and get pics of my perps.. clear ones... but that wouldnt do much.. Their whole scheme is set up in a certain way...
      </p>

       If i showed pics, all they would be is a perp that just looks like an ordinary guy.. I've done that before..

       One of the first things they do is induce the victim into psychoses. It's one wrong drink. Be patient with us, many are not as lucky as to even be able to form words.

       Are you sure that you have it in the correct order?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like is it possible that you have a psychosis that makes you think things about innocent people?
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask because I have been in legitimate situations where a real person and maybe a few of their friends were supposedly out to get me (nothing came of it btw and when i did actually run into the guy he apologized and said he didn’t want to fight and was just talking shit.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        point
       </em>
       is that when I thought that some group of people were maybe trying to jump me I started seeing suspicious behavior from random folks who looked like maybe the type that hang out with the person.  Started “seeing” people watch me or follow me.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of those people had anything to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy was drunk and mad about being fired and word came to me from someone who overheard. The reality is he slept it off and was surprised that I was ready to fight him when I saw him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paranoia even if you are totally healthy mentally can make you see things that aren’t there.  Hell, I bet if you spend 40 hours watching stuff about this it subconsciously manipulates you into believing it.  maybe it is the person telling you about being targeted that is actually the one who is messing with you?

       Nope, I'm completelt serious and sane. Many of the people who perform gangstalking actually do have underlying menral disorders however. It comes from the same lust for control that is shown in many other psychopathic tendencies. OCD, counter culture worship (paganism, anarchy) and often times they fknd aupport through means of identity scammers. Goals could be anything from immobilizing you in order to make off with enough personal information, to trying to get with your signiffigant other for the sake of increasing their own social standing. They are often betas targeting alphas due to underlying jealousy. They are also often the type of people who dismiss other people speaking up for themselves. Cyber bullying where the rules of the playground don't apply anymore, to try to simplify it for you.

       I don’t mean psychosis as in you are permanently mentally ill... that was the point of my example, if you have reason (or not) to
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       something, our minds naturally enter a primitive survival state of alert and we are suspicious of
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       .  I just meant to ask if it was possible your suspicion may actually be sending subconscious “micro body language” that other people subconsciously pick up and therefore begin watching you thinking that it is
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       who are watching them even though neither of you are involved in anything at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what is with all the emphasis on not deleting social media posts?  And what does “wavy” mean?  Just curious because it is like y’all are speaking some jargon I have never heard of and I am trying to make sense of some of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, I am definitely not saying gang stalking and intimidation don’t happen, I am just saying I don’t think it happens to random people with such organization.  Like if you live in a bad area, sure the local criminals probably do that to anyone new or who they see as a threat to try to individuate them, or if you are a whistleblower against a powerful group, I am sure they have private “security” firms do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you are, like me, some average nobody joe blow citizen, I don’t think any sophisticated agency would bother to do it just to fuck with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Although I would believe that some of the YouTube videos about it are actually psy-ops that use subliminal programming to make people think it is happening to them.
       </em>
       They don’t have to actually do anything, if you think they are then it is like the paranoid mistaken intent I mentioned above.  Then maybe they monitor the IP addresses of people who watch those videos to see if “it worked” and they post things showing they think they are being followed.
       <strong>
        This
       </strong>
       makes sense as experiments in population conditioning and doesn’t require hundreds of operatives to do.  Like the Soviet Secret Police, most of the work is done by victims oppressing one another hoping to be less harshly punished.  Once a society is fully conditioned to this, they keep themselves imprisoned.

       Nah, I could have just ghosted you here but for the sake of the next person to read this I'm commenting.

       Since you clearly are uninterested in doing honest research and instead would rather eat what's served, here is some source content from 10+ years. Including a full break down of what gangstalking is, the semantics and legalities, and testimonies, again, that reach over a 10 year span. Yes it's Wordpress that doesn't mean shit, go back to your VICE news where the next up in que is the health benefits of volotile mushrooms growing in your stomach. But they don't tell you that part or tell you that living in below freezing conditions is a cure. Or that acid tabs change your very chemical makeup.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, I'm the one that doesn't know. Sure pal, I'll continue to listen to my designer tunes and live a hella good life that I've deserved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, don't read too much into that, I'm using the Royal You ;)

       If you were looking for fear porn this is as close as you'll get to a gangstalking snuff film.

       Okay I'm back real quick for you to touch on something that is worth noting.

       " But if you are, like me, some average nobody joe blow citizen, I don’t think any sophisticated agency would bother to do it just to fuck with you. "
      </p>
      <p>
       You are not some average joe blow, you have a name- a surname- parents and a heritage. It is important to note especially if you reside where your heritage has been grown in itself.  Know what your name means- Not your handle or alias, your name.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       This is part of the "language of love" adopted by the "love movement". It's a way of thought. A way of breaking down the semantics of the language we are speaking to draw out a centerfold of in a term you've heard of before but may just now understand "reading between the lines"

      </p>
      <p>
       This I felt is the most important piece to discuss. Because it is knowledge that you look for, not hostile behavior. It's something that is invisible to the naked eye, and is still difficult to perceive to the trained one. If someone simply knows your story, it can be confusing to differentiate at first. *People like to talk, play mind games, and try to get a reaction out of each other* It's bullying without playground rules. However; As you will learn after researching from the sources I've provided for you above, you will see Gangstalking isn't just the cook talking shit out the kitchen when your in a restaurant. That's just what people do when they feel their territory is being tested. It's petty, but it's not the focus of our discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gangstalking isn't about keeping tabs on your life, it's about altering your life for the gain of another person's agenda. *Every successful person in this world has one thing in common; they posses two agendas. One personal agenda, and one global agenda* AKA How they will approach molding themselves to fit the world they are creating for themselves. Some people start earlier than others, some people have morals that do not align with others, some people act on their morals more than others. Some people will stop at nothing to gain something; anything; even if it's validation.

       I wasn’t tryin to offend you, I didn’t “do the research “ because I would rather hear about it from you since we are talking.  Even anonymous over the internet, person to person conversation beats reading some person’s stuff or watching some videos.  I am actually interested and figured why not ask?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen some of these threads, maybe yours?  But never really paid attention because those talking about it are hard to understand.

      <p>
       Situational awareness and survival instinct are adult traits, children don’t have them in a developed manner, the trust easily and don’t question their world in the same way.  That is why parents must protect their children.

       <em>
        don’t
       </em>
       trust surface explanations.  The main thing I ask is “what is the benefit and who gets it?”  That is crucial to understanding what really happens beyond the curtain.  People don’t do things requiring great effort without some perceived gain.  That was what lead me to the hypothesis about hypnosis...  that leads to powerful people experimenting how to beat implement a totalitarian state without challenge; a benefit.

       Hypnosis is a good point. One of the main traits of those with sociopathic tendencies is the need to be able to control and harm others when their personal balance is at stake. Trending Modus Operatum is something that exists, wherein a pattern is met via. indoctrination processes to pick out and recruit persons who show signs of having these traits- a lust for power. This includes those who belong to eugenic-based hate cults, pagan ritualists who are attempting to replace religion as moral compasses with ideological factions, people who are addicted to increasing their social standing (This goes hand in hand with hierarchy based cultist groups such as hardcore satanists, street gangs that require blood for initiation, and more. I implore you to do research on these key words yourself and present your findings here in order to move this discussion forward. #Discussionism is not a one-way communicative platform- You've got to understand that I too am suffering from negative effects of my experiences both from my time being targeted (I do live with PTSD, have been drugged and forced a dependency on heavy drugs without realizing it, and have been in a room with people who wanted me there to be a guinea pig for their own sociopathic experimentation)  and other ways life has happened to me before this occurred. (I was adopted at a young age, and prior to adoption the single parent I was with relocated very often during my younger years due to being in very high demand in his field, and my other biological parent sending everything from swat teams to... Well I won't speak on something I don't know about, yet. But they are definitely the reason I've been on certain groups map as such a young age.) So for me ghosting someone, or dropping a relationship is nothing. This, in retrospect, is probably why I have been able to survive as in tact as I am, and comprehended at a young age the importance of learning survival skills and to hone my own critical though- How do read people- I was the first kid the new kids met when they transferred to my schools. Even the homies that turned their back on me know that.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Wavy" is a the idea that when you speak, your sentences are presented with
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       connotative and denotative meaning. Double meanings between conversations AKA. Secret tongues. In literary works, it's the idea that the script was written to be timeless- to transcend beyond the initial version of itself and it's conversations and ideas presented between, say, your two side characters and deliver on further literary tropes to progress either the dialogue, or the underlying themes of the play. Shakespearean writing is studied in this way because specifically it is delivered in ye' olde english' so the students can focus on the body of work as opposed to what's being said; because, rarely do they understand what they are reading until their teacher explains; however- those that do comprehend are comprehending by linking the literary tropes that are transcending through the writing;
       <em>
        between the lines
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       So is act something between lines 12 and 18 Romeo explains he yearns for Juliet's touch, and then goes on to decide that he is going to sneak into her bedroom at night to lay with her. Cutting through 6 lines of monologue because the monologue is just there to draw the idea that is being presented as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of a totalitarian state continues to arise; I'll be sure to read your next comment suited up in slavs- my karma has doubled in the past few hours- this isn't a good thing because I've been very methodical to remain as low key as possible on Reddit for I could tell there have been many
       <em>
        botters
       </em>
       (People being paid to derail progressive conversations) here over the last few months
      </p>
      <p>
       So I will end this again with,
       <em>
        I am here for those who believe to be victims of gangstalking, I will answer any questions that I feel are worth noting but you will see me ignoring more that are there specifically to derail the end goal, which is to unify and figure out a means of rehabilitation for the victims; and to bring proper awareness to the idea of focus marketing as a tactic for cult recruiting. This is a game to these people, they get deep personal satisfaction, and work with each other to amplify that satisfaction, because, chemical release is the utmost form of success, particularly if you learn to manufacture it yourself

       Hey, thanks for the detailed reply.  Btw, I am not just being lazy about researching this, it is simply something I have seen on here a few times but often with such hard to understand phrasing that I can’t tell what is going on.  I am sure you know there are always more things that we want to read or learn than we have time for so I was asking for a quick explanation from you because you seem knowledgeable about it to see if I wanted to delve more deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I was almost worried you were going to think I was fucking with you or something, I am not.  I have been accused of being a shill before but it is almost always by those who do t understand that
       <em>
        skepticism
       </em>
       is the root of any conspiracy theory...  you have to be skeptical of the official narrative to even begin, and there is so much misinformation that one must
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       remain skeptical when considering other explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I understand what you mean by wavy now, it just wasn’t intuitive, it sounded more akin to “vibing someone” or “grooving on something” etc.  The meaning you are giving is also known as “power talk” in social dynamics, a double entendre with plausible deniability where only those meant to understand what is going on under the surface of a polite conversation get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read the other link you posted that gave a rundown of common things, btw, and something stood out to me.  Perhaps in another life I could have been one of the “agents” or whatever who design this stuff, I have no desire to hurt people but I can appreciate the malevolent genius of such an approach:
       <em>
        the goal of the attack is to cause psychosis in the victim, therefore a successful attack leaves no evidence because the victim is suffering psychosis and has no credibility
       </em>
       . If someone wants to make you a crazy person, after they do it you are perceived as a crazy person and the plot is dismissed as your delusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But due to the fact that this attack is clearly meant to cause psychosis and paranoia and isolation, I think that the victim who wrote the linked post was
       <em>
        missing a key element similar to my earlier hypothesis
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       They claim that the “perps” will coerce or manipulate friends and family and others in a community into assisting them.
       <em>
        This is very impractical
       </em>
       .  Since the goal is isolation and mental distress, why would they bother coercing others and giving avenues of credibility to the victim by making witnesses
       <em>
        when they don’t need to
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they want to cause isolation the
       <em>
        obvious
       </em>
       goal is to manipulate the victim into thinking that their friends and families are in on it.  But the simplest solution is not to actually turn them but to use drugs and hypnosis or infrasound or any other tech that we probably have it implant the idea that
       <em>
        everyone is in on it
       </em>
       .  That way the victim is
       <em>
        cut off
       </em>
       from potential avenues of help but they are imprisoning themselves.  That is how I would do it and if I can think of this, then the
       <em>
        much smarter than me
       </em>
       people working in the government would assuredly have realized this.  The axiom that “If it has been imagined it has been done.”

       I believe you. I still feel the pain sometimes, ears popping when you pull out get a view of the centerfold. MY suggestion to YOU is to do some research on how your body replaces itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.brainstuffshow.com/videos/does-the-human-body-replace-itself-every-7-years-video.htm">
        https://www.brainstuffshow.com/videos/does-the-human-body-replace-itself-every-7-years-video.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Start small. A tennis ball to your feet, push down on it until you are nearly crying for about 15 minutes. You will build a pain tolerance in your feet after 3 days. Continue to do this every day, it will break up resolidified sodium phosphate (Crystalized liquid salt) and allow it to cycle out of your body. There are low resistance exercises you can do (that do not require weights) that will pump your blood through your body clearing any obstructions that may have build up in any arteries. Why is this important? Because the for efficently your body cycles blood the more efficently your neck can FINALLY cycle blood up into your brain. This can do a number of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       1)Alleviate tension and dislodge anything in your sinuses
      </p>
      <p>
       2)Allow you to acquire a clearer thought process and provide better focus
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Although you may not be able to repair your lymph nodes from your initial psychoses induction- You can strengthen the ones that remain and heal some that are only marginally damaged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Numerically, 4 represents the new beginning. If 1 represents your mind, 2 represents your body, 3 represents the transition, and 4 represents the outcome you can see here clearly that it is a matter of REGENERATION vs DEGENERATION.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way they target your psyche with psychosis is to eliminate your EGO. They tell you that it's bad to have such an EGO. Your mind is categorized into 3 sections, your ID, EGO, AND SUPEREGO these translate into your INSTINCT, CRITICAL THINKING, AND SUBCONSCIOUS THOUGHT. They tell us to kill our CRITICAL THOUGHT PROCESS. What part of your brain is the bridge between your instant gratification (id) and your MEMORIES that make you feel good? (Subconscious) The lymph nodes that are activated to make you do what your KNOW you should do, as opposed to the FIRST THING THAT YOUR HEAD TELLS YOU TO DO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let the little voice speak up. I will read what you say. people will (obviously) try to return you to a degenerative state. This is actually a business tactic used by many "motivational speakers" because, how are they going to give you the HIGH of being inspired, if you don't feel the LOW of inadequacy?

       It's also worth noting that a lot of gang-stalking victims are victims of paranoia and/or schizophrenia.  That's not to say actual gangstalking doesn't exist, but rather, 99% of the cases can be attributed to mental illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar to UFO cases where the vast majority can be explained in ways more in accordance with occam's razor.

       Very worth noting. To be a victim of said mental illnesses doesn't necessarily mean you should be diagnosed with such illnesses. It could mean you are living the effects of the stigma of people believing you possess these traits, when in reality part of the character assassination of Gangstalking is convincing your local community that you are indeed sick, so you are treated as such before you even know what's going on.

       (Using the royal You again, or the Omnipotence of Younity, as I've deemed it myself) - You live in a fish bowl. It's a bio dome and inside is a jungle. There is prey and there are predators, some prey evolve and end up being higher on the food chain than expected due to defense mechanisms developed through evolution. My friend from Australia said so. He also said that you aren't placed higher on the food chain without taking out a few first. You may not realize that the game is being played around you yet, when you wake up, the first thing to learn of is your worth.

       This is so true. Not just as evidence that you contacted a person and they didnt share the same interest in reconnecting but if you ever see them in real life in a public area where you are being watched(Maybe by a community pillar such as a police officer, known gangbanger, or even someone who you have deduced to be passing on information about you YOU CAN IGNORE THEM AND MAINTAIN THEIR SECURITY. Explain later if you feel you need to, or if it matters to them they will undoubtedly search after you on Facebook, etc. They will just look to be another person tuning in and this can be their "raincoat"

       The last thing you want is a highschool homie to be seduced, or targeted by someone just for the sake of forcing you to watch their spiral... Or to remove them from the picture of your potential support system. Don't Trust me yet. The hardest thing is being forced to be silent as you see someone else is being kept tabs on. So do not approach these people due to your own anxiety- You are not a superhero and they assuredly have their own support system. If you care about someone theres a reason, if you feel uneasy about someone there is a reason, just as OP said if you feel disgusted by someone... Actions spoke louder than words.

       Remember, not everyone who shares your information knows the harm that its doing. If you are a person of status (you have a youtube channel for example) People can coax information through smalltalk just by knowing the most minimal information about you that you put forward in a piece of media.

       Others, such as my experience, could enable information trafficking through personal vendettas, not realizing just how far, widespread, or "high" the information is going. East coast of the east coast here- if you know you know.

       Side note: I agree that being in peak physical form is not a necessety, especially if you are the type of person to maintain a routine. People on the bus with you will recognize your face. I have memory problems myself yet can remember a face like its a curse! (Names, dates, appointments are my problems, and these same things cause me low levels of anxiety, which is why I personally perform as much high adrenal draining activity as I can fit)

       Now... If you have online friends...
DO NOT DELETE ANY COMMUNICATION. Discord is dangerous as fuck for this for this. Steam needs to catch up but is trying, consoles are up in the air for me personally as I stopped using them around 2015. However... Nobody wants to use a VPN and game online... Instead choose to run a dynamic IP address. Choose what servers you are going to play in and change it up. REPORT REPORT REPORT. Dont tell them you are doing it, just do it, mute them so they can not harrass your peace of mind and move on.
      </p>

       MEDIA IS MACRO NOT MICRO. YOU MAY RELATE TO THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF A TARGETED INDIVIDUAL AND THATS JUST HOW IT IS. DO NOT REACT. IT IS JUST A PRETENTIOUS DJ WHO THINKS HE'S WAVY THAT HAD A REQUEST FOR A CERTAIN SONG. HE PROBABLY DOESNT KNOW BETTER, SOMEONE AROUND YOU MAY. Practice this. Hone the skill of a pokerface. If you can not, practice identifying those who surround you as who is looking for a reaction and remember who they are. I was in the grocery store this evening and saw a girl who's brother is definitely on a wave thats watching me, she's on a wave watching me, her mother too I know now as I have honed using minute body language to get focused reactions. THIS IS ONLY MY STORY. As I said I have the status to hunt these people. I have the perfect storm. THERE IS HOPE! Mind over matter. Become healthy.

       Healthy vs fit. Ever wonder where the salt that you dont sweat out goes? It all melts. Gravity sends it downward theough your bloodstream, as liquid iodine is geavier than blood. Free up your circulatory system by reactivation the resolidified salt that collects at the bottom of uour feet using a medicine ball, a tennis ball, anything. IT IS GOING TO HURT. SO BAD. Only for a while. This will allow blood to circulate through the lower half of your body easier and alleviate... pains induced anxiety?

       LIGHT EXERCISES FOR YOUR MIND USING YOUR BODY: Full extension stretches- Stretch your arms out. If you have a baby wiggle their arms (without strain obviously, they are just babies...) I digress. (please exercise your baby, they are our future.)
Jumping in place... Skipping without a rope (Cardiovascular exercise)
YOGA is popular not because of the pants. It's because stretching and breathing improves cognitive ability. Helps open up arteries. (Like an accordian with a bit of clay in it... or lungs with tar.)
Oh yeah, and my life improved drastically after qyitting cigarettes. Do what you've got to do; non smokers never value the words of smokers, its part of the MANUFACTURED effect of secondhand smoke.

       oh by the way, "uhhh I dont know so I dont think its true" doesn't work anymore. If you dont know, thats fine, we understand. Dknt assume you are of a higher intelligence because you do not know. You are inexperienced. Inexperienced in living in a hell that is as old as the love movement. Pre. Janis Joplin. It is a side effect of MK Ultra I believe myself, as many people are enablers and part of the problem without realizing it. You are half asleep reading r/conspiracy? Who are you to assume we are full of shit? Lmao

       I was supposed to be a sleeper. Ive met my handlers. I've met the militia I was to be inducted into. I have a very specific set of skills. I am LUCKY to be on both a government watch list (Because I dropped out of policing school) as well as the HELLS ANGELS WATCH LIST (Daddy was a bank robber) Died when I was young, and I was adopted.

       do you have evidence to substantiate your claims? do you have a good motivating reason as to why the state would waste money and resources,  and bring dozens.. maybe hundreds.. of people into the conspiracy (none of whom have ever flaked and exposed the program)?

       I've seen a couple of gang stalking vids. Color me unimpressed. Or was like "you see!? 4 red cars in a row. OF COURSE"
      </p>
      <p>
       It was kinda sad. He also said his harassment included someone wearing out his sneakers faster than usual.

       A lot of those videos are gaslightimg away from the actual facts of gang stalking. Gamg stalking for myself has involved lots of outside manipulation in ways that I have not been able to see. Whatvyou are explaining (and Ive seen the videos) is someone compiling particular footage and then pushing a context. Poor journalism or propogation? The creators of that content baffle me as to their motive personally. You may not be able to comprehemd this; but there is a whole industry built around the fall of man. People are ablebto make money from creating chaos and distrust in others' life.
      </p>

       Anyways, sorry to tell you that your research was a wasre of time but you should really atop taking every doc you see at face value. Just like Im about to stop taking in information you put forward as it is pbvious to me that you dont know why your on this thread except to try to be "coloured".
      </p>
      <p>
       This isnt fear porn, I'm not trying to get you to "pop" with a creepypasta narrative. Go somewhere else if you want popcorn spooks. People here likely have been
       <em>
        marked by cults for sacrifice
       </em>
       and that means they are living with lasting physical and psychological effects that require support, not dismissal.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I do have source material for a page that is about a decade old thay I will digbup amf post here. Its a forum that people have been using to come forward as victims of gamgstalking and how to actually spot the signs. It is very accjrate as to how ot often begins and details information that will not appear to be relatable to just another dude with a camera shoved in his face after being in genuine paranoid solitude, where you can smell the narcotics through the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are lots of ways to become paranoid, thats what makes it fun for them.
