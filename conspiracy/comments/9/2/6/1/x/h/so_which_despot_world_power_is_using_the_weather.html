<p>My money is on Russia, probably used it initially to boost the weather for the world cup just gone but now its run out of control and is affecting a lot of the Northern hemisphere is particular worldwide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts are this is ridiculous. We haven’t and can’t outdo the suns power with anything. Not can we move the jet stream. It’s the magnetosphere that controls the jet stream to a large degree and because of the solar minimum it’s wobbling around like a loose electric band. Dragging all sorts of weather everywhere </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only explain a bit in basic language. And I don’t understand it all myself. But then it appears pretty much no one does 100% either </p>

<p>The sun is currently at a solar minimum which means few sunspots. It also means it has less power. Sun-spots produce flares which send CMEs into space. Out magnetosphere appears to be powered by the sun flares and not the earths magnetic cores as some first thought. But it’s likely he magnetic corse does interact with the flares (not sure how that works mind you) </p>

<p>The jet stream in the north and Southern Hemisphere are like bands going around the earth. Above tends to be wet cold weather below tends to be warm and dry. Normally the jet stream meanders like slithering snake around the earth. Sometimes a bit higher or a bit lower than normal. And that can give us good and bad summers or winters. But it appears to be kind of going a bit wild at the moment. And can produce arctic vortexes or massive heat waves. Dragging weather places it should t be. Ie right now the Arctic circle is really hot where as this winter Saudi Arabia had snow. As did Morocco. </p>

<p>Changes in sea temperature also help warm things up.  During the ice age for instance Alaska is warmer than today but ice sheets were all the way down to Colorado. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But we can heat the ionosphere, pushing it up, creating space for hot air to rise, which, en masse, affects weather. </p>

<p>We can cloud seed, which increases rainfall.</p>

<p>We can throw aerosols into the air to reflect and mitigate the sun&#39;s heat and rays hitting earth.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t Tesla invent some thing that was rumoured (or one of the stories) to be behind the Tunguska explosion? Radio waves heating the atmosphere or something like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HAARP is ours, in extreme rural Alaska.  I dunno what China or Russia call theirs.  And yea, they use that to heat the ionosphere.</p>

<p>IMHO, they are using it to keep California is a drought.  Our weatherpeople call the result &quot;The persistently present high pressure system&quot; that sits off our coast and has changed the weather patterns (in the past 5ish years).</p>

<p>Hadn&#39;t heard the Telsa/Tunguska connection but seems plausible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He did!?  Yikes, yea that seems... a lil too odd to be a random-ass line.</p>

<p>Kinda inline with our chat here... Shasta is aflame, the Carr fire.  Shasta fire chief (or similar agency head) said something like &quot;This is the biggest fire in Shasta history, bigger than the 5 biggest over the past 50 years.  This fire is behaving in ways I (he) has not seen, both weather-wise and fire-behavoir-wise.&quot;</p>

<p>In theory &quot;the&quot; did not start the Carr fire.  I do think &quot;they&quot; have prepped the ground for these fires to start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possible yes. Though another big effect is that solar rays are getting through now. This also messes with things. Fact is this freak weather is not easily explained by anyone. Lots of theories but in honesty a few people seem stumped. Fact is we should be a bit colder right now with low sun activity. But I’m hot as a bastard right now </p>
