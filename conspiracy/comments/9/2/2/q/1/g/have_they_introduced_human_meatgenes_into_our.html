    <div class="md"><p>I know you can’t splice pure genetic structure but mutated at a molecular level allowing adaptogen and adaptive response of the genes to mutate to a mutually viable code as they have adapted fish and amphibian genes to extend the shelf life of tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables???

makes me wonder what could happen? It seems Regulations are no longer used as boundary but a hurdle to get over. Right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is antarctic chimera? Tried to look at white papers on it could find anything.  Also GM corn is patent by I believe 2 or 3 companies one of which is Monsanto. I believe it should show in the parents what exactly was change in the corn ( did you know that farmers in America cannot store their own corn because it belongs to Monsanto do to the GM changes) 
So if you know what brand of GM corn has this Antarctic chimera I can go look for the patent .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Statin drugs are causing alzheimers/dementia  and congestive heart failure .  Lipitor is the most prescribed drug ever.  They wanted to put it in our water.  All the B. S.  about lowering cholesterol, they didn&#39;t  tell you  how important it was.  Your brain is mostly fat,  and it doesn&#39;t get very much  cholesterol because of the brain blood barrier, so it produces an enzyme called HMG-co reductase which makes it.  Statin drugs in your blood carried to your brain drastically reduces it HMG-co reductase.  This enzyme also produces CoQ10 , which is critical for your brain.  CoQ10 has also also been shown in study&#39;s to help parkinson&#39;s disease. </p>

<p>My dad has the parkinson&#39;s shakes from this shit.  Big pharma has no desires of you being healthy.  You dont need medicines for cholesterol, everything we need God put in the earth for us.  1 half of an apple a day will lower your cholesterol 15-17%.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m fairly certain Kit Kat mincemeat pies originally contained human flesh (before they turned into “4 finger” chocolate candy under the major brand name “Black Magic,” now associated with Hershey, Nestle, and Google (think Android, cross-promotions with prize giveaways for Google Nexus and Google Play Store credit, Golden Ticket Wonka-style promo with the prize being a spot on “Big Brother Series 7, now contains synthetic PGPR in place of cocoa butter which causes liver and kidney enlargement).</p>

<p>Background:  1600’s baker holds parties for a secret club at his bakery, women and children, everyone drinking, calling it The Kit-Cat Club (now a common name for strip clubs, checkit).  He prepared mincemeat pies at the parties, and after positive feedback from his guests, began to sell them to the public.  Prolly nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the article you provided is uninformed and has a misleading title. referring to hek 293 cells as aborted fetus tissue is fear mongering and incredibly misleading, considering it is an engineered cell line from the 70s that is used by biotech companies because it is easily transfectable, incredibly resilient, and divides quickly. it would be like telling someone they rub their skin with dead dinosaur carcasses in the shower if they used soap. on top of this, the article states that they are used to produce artificial taste buds for flavor testing purposes, not that they are used in the flavoring as you suggest in your comment</p>
