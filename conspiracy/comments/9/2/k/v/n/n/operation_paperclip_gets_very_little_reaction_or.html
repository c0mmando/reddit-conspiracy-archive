I was left aghast at the desire of the US to employ and award citizenship to high ranking Nazis, SS officers and men who not only supported the use of slave labour but men who committed war crimes. The scale of this operation and its impact on the militantly industrial complex can not be underestimated. Surprisingly it does not generate much discussion or analysis in r/history and I am curious to know why. </p>

Depending on how deep you believe the conspiracy to go, some believe that nearly all major events, from WW2 to 9/11 were all part of the plan. Considering the New World Order requires absolute control of the common man, Nazi experiments and technology most definitely pushed us closer to those goals, in a way that mainstream science could not.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that the conspiracy theory of freemansons/jews/liberals working towards a NWO was started by an catholic priest as an answer to the french revolution. And it was a damn good conspiracy theory considering that TPTB for their age (and they live on) used it against all liberal tendencies - and it is still used in that way. </p>

<p>Considering that <em>fact</em> everyone who references this particular NWO theory is in fact an unwilling shill of (somewhat lost) power that (had) been..</p>

<p>ed: Considering the state of our world - I would love to have a NWO. No petty trade wars, a real understanding that each and every life has the same inherent worth and a fair chance for every kids, regardless of where and to whom it is born. I see this as a vison worth fighting for - the majority prefers a world where the life of an US kid is worth more than the life of a kid in Sierra Leone. Where the land of the free can torture and kill without regard as long as it ain&#39;t a US citizen... truly fucked up. And yet people want it that way..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you envision a world where Democrats turn into the new Nazis and would imprison or kill scientists of von Braun&#39;s level for not working with them? It&#39;d complicate things more if you were already a Democrat - what would be the point where you abandon ship when you&#39;re being fed misinformation? How much insight would someone 70 years later really have about their motivations or feelings? </p>

<p>Its easy to write off everyone who gets caught up working with the Nazi party as an SS member but I think with a little empathy we can see how it would be a pretty fucked up situation for anyone.</p>

<p>Of course maybe someone has some quotes of von Braun proving he was a hardcore Nazi, I dunno. I was just using him as an example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not sure. I don’t remember him making any statements like that. I believe von Braun was a ranking member in the SS. It was more ceremonial I think, but there are stories that dispute that. About the others I’m not too sure. I think there’s were about a 100 that came to the USA. The others were taken by the Soviets. Guess it’s a bit of a morality question, so just referring to them as German scientists makes it sound better. Some were definitely voluntary Nazi members. Looking long term it was the right decision to make though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly recommend this series by Peter Levenda if you want to look into the more long term reach of Paperclip<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nine-Sinister-Forces-Political-Witchcraft/dp/098418581X">Sinister Forces book 1</a> . I also recommend Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein if you want to  go further down the rabbit hole of the US working with sociopaths, criminals and murderers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>in regard to your opening pose, Well, yeah, we had just defeated two enemies to a more or less free world, and guess what, we had substantially aid the new Soviet Union to become a block-buster of a super power with equipment money and damned near half of Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>You cannot pick and chose your weapons in war, you go full bore toward the biggest, best and most possible sources you can get.  War isn&#39;t much about sentiment as it is winning.  Some people tend to forget that overall philosophy when they want to zero in on isolated circumstances.  </p>

<p>We hauled at least 300 railroad cars of Germany&#39;s secret weapons stuff to White Sands, NM.  Many of the scientists from Nazi German in Operation Paperclip were put into doing furthering the research into keeping ahead of the Soviets.  I&#39;m willing to bet that not one of those scientists every pulled a trigger.  Like the millions and millions of soldiers of any side in the war, they should not be held accountable fore the decisions of their superiors.  Sad to say, that is the way politics and wars work.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a significant difference to a soldier on the front line doing his duty as best he can and Nazi Scientists doing experiments on prisoners. We are talking about men who conducted experiments on people to see when they would die from cold and trying to use alcohol to revive them. This is barbaric stuff. These are not just guys pulling a trigger these are high ranking officials in the Nazi party. Men who believed in the final solution. Men who were happy to work prisoners to death to build a rocket. Men who hung prisoners for no other reason than the read a leaflet dropped by the allies. The men hired during Operation Paperclip were not soldiers they were despicable men with genuine evil in their hearts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a rhetorical device I&#39;m not too fond of. The &quot;why aren&#39;t people interested in this thing&quot; form of a post. It presumes people <em>aren&#39;t</em>, first of all, when in fact that&#39;s not necessarily a thing, and then, what - the insinuation that maybe there&#39;s a concentrated effort to downplay it? I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s pretty effective, at least in initially gaining traction, as a conversation starter on places like r/conspiracy because it establishes a narrative most people here can buy into right away with the us v. them thing. But what&#39;s the conversation: operation paperclip? how you think that it&#39;s not popular enough? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can search Operation Paperclip in r/history and see each time a question is raised regarding it, the response is minimal. Almost no discussion. And considering they are always banging on about WWII and Nazis you think this would be something that would generate some interesting discussion. Maybe it&#39;s because people do see Operation Paperclip as the jumping of point for a lot of conspiracy theories people in r/history tend to steal clear of it? But it would appear to me that it&#39;s avoided as a discussion topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does a seen from a movie mean it&#39;s common knowledge? If you asked 20 random people in any American town or city do you honestly believe 10 of them would have heard of Operation Paperclip?? If you asked the same 20 people if they had heard of Wernher von Braun I&#39;m sure a few would know his name but I would wager few if any would know he was an SS officer. Just because you know something don&#39;t assume everyone one knows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are all sorts of negative times in history that people minimize or rarely talk about. People don&#39;t like to remember the parts of history that make their country look bad. And of course those in power do what they can to keep these events out of museums, the history channel, classrooms, and the public consciousness.</p>

<p>Nobody talks about how the US trained multiple brutal South American dictators and death squads at the School of the Americas, including techniques of torture.</p>

<p>Or how NSA intel was manipulated, dates changed and translations faked, in 1964 to create a fake North Vietnamese torpedo attack in the Gulf of Tonkin to get the US into Vietnam.</p>

<p>Or the birth defects and cancer caused by depleted uranium weapons and Agent Orange.</p>

<p>Or the 2001 anthrax attacks that killed 5 Americans, because there was initially a huge campaign to blame Al Qaeda and Iraq, but tests ended up showing the anthrax turned out to be made in US bioweapons labs. There was then an effort to blame a &quot;lone wolf&quot; scientist Stephen Hatfill, but he was declared innocent and won a $6mil settlement. Then they tried to blame Bruce Ivins with no real evidence, and he &quot;committed suicide&quot; before trial. Its pretty obvious if you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/83ca6a/the_fbi_deliberately_misled_the_public_in_its/">look at the facts</a> that the anthrax attacks were orchestrated by elements within the US government. The lead anthrax investigator Richard Lambert <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1714250/former-fbi-special-agent-in-charge-richard.pdf">even sued then-FBI head Robert Mueller for stovepiping and sabotaging the investigation</a>. Even though it was unsolved, the FBI closed the case and Obama made sure it would never be re-opened.</p>

<p>For more dark, minimized US history, I recommend checking out Oliver Stone&#39;s The Untold History of the United States on Netflix. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Operation Paperclip scientists are also tied to Plum Island (a biological weapons research facility), that is theorized to be where Lyme disease came from which is now epidemic in many areas in the US.</p>

<p>Op Paperclip seeded Nazi’s into every branch of the US government from the CIA, NASA, FDA, and others.</p>

<p>Literally was just in an argument with someone in Germany on Reddit recently about the fact that Germany to this day is essentially a proxy state of the US military industrial complex. We have 36 military bases still publicly operational in Germany, and house nearly 50,000 US military personal there. It’s basically an occupied country, but the people of Germany are so brainwashed they don’t even understand what’s happening. They actually believe they live in a Democracy, and America is some good guy beacon on the hill.</p>

<p>The irony is a German citizen today has more rights than an American because they have a more favorable and modern bill of rights, and EU protections the US does not. Including better access to healthcare and education. At the same time though they’re constantly under surveillance and basically an occupied territory of the US empire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the government and intel community have worked very hard to cover up Operation Paperclip. It’s not great press for the CIA. If everyone knew that Nazis were at the heart of the CIA’s foundation, it would put CIA projects like MK Ultra into context and make the public much more open-minded to the possibility that a branch of the CIA (i.e. HW Bush’s line) are, and have always been, really fucking evil Nazis. And maybe, just maybe, the “theories” that this particular group within the CIA still has vast control over what’s happening in the world, that this group is still running human mind control experiments like MK Ultra, that it really did have something to do with JFK’s assassination, that it really might be trying to do the same to Trump, that it really is facilitating weapons/drugs/human trafficking, and that it really does run brownstone operations (Franklin School, Epstein’s Island, and Comet Pizza to name a few) and systematically pimp out kids for political gain... suddenly, these possibilities become much more plausible. And if that happens, then the public would maybe start to question why we give the intelligence community black budgets and allow them to run free with as much money and power as they like while they commit these perverse and terrible crimes, using national security as justification. And if the IC lost the ability to have black budgets, that would make them unhappy. So the Nazi origins of the CIA will continue to be suppressed for as long as the CIA controls the media. And everyone can keep pretending paperclip never happened so that we don’t have to think about the implications of it. </p>
