        Agenda 21 - Depopulation?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We've all heard about the Conspiracy Theory of
       <strong>
        Agenda 21
       </strong>
       &amp;
       <strong>
        Depopulation
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Climate Scientist even seem to push depopulation stating that humans are the cause of Climate Change &amp; Global Warming.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, why would elites who are mostly
       <strong>
        Baby Boomers
       </strong>
       want depopulation when they're "largest Age Cohort"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they really want the younger crowd to lose all humanity?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who's going to protect &amp; take care of them when they can't? Robots?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they have children &amp; grandchildren who love them, and will take care of them &amp; protect them from monsters, then that's great.
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, they're f$cked one way or another if &amp; when human life is no longer precious IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       The seeds we sow, will determine what we reap -- good or bad!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like all these Conspiracy Theories directed at
       <strong>
        elites
       </strong>
       , is trying to unite the masses to rally for another Bloody Revolution IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please leave your comments below &amp; I will add more details and a list of all the Depopulation Conspiracy Theories about Depopulation and the reasons behind it.
      </p>
      <h1>
       Most of the World's Problems today stems from "Excessive Greed" IMO.
      </h1>
      <p>
       Limiting excessive greed with solve most of the world's problems IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have created a "
       <strong>
        WIN-WIN
       </strong>
       " Model for the
       <strong>
        Next Golden Age
       </strong>
       that I think is a solution that everyone could agree with.

       Those at the top of this planning and agenda picture a world where there are just enough real humans to keep this going, and the rest of their needs are served by AI – meaning, automation, robotics, and humanoids that are both biological and programmable on the DNA/consciousness level.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real humans need to be culled dramatically for this to happen.

       Why would they care so much when they don't have much longer to live on Earth IMO. Do they think they're immortal or have drugs for immortality now only available to elites?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why would true Artificial Intelligence go along with their plan? AI won't be greedy. AI won't love? If they're truly smart and rational, sure they may decide that depopulation makes sense to balance animals and humans. Or they may decide it's unfair for the 1% to own 50% and control 100% of the wealth by proxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt AI will be like Humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also heard about the Conspiracy Theory for Adrenochrome Drug that the elites use. Wouldn't it make more sense to have many expendable poor people continuously making expendable poor children for them to produce it on a continuous basis? If they can produce it artificially, why wouldn't they have already &amp; mass market it for mass profits?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, how do the elites keep such a huge secret from the population? Are all elites monsters devoid of any real humanity in them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, all these Conspiracy Theories seem to anger the masses -- the mob. When the mob is sufficiently angered enough, all hell's going to break lose &amp; they'll get lynched IMO.

       What do you think motivates them for such a reality? To save animals because they love animals so much? To save the planet before they die? Making more money? Buying hot girls? Buying fancy toys? Buying drugs? What would make them want that type of reality? Immortality in their own bodies or AI? Or travel to another planet or another dimension? What? WTF makes them tick?

       Because there is only so many things you can do with money, then you have to repeat to get a thrill and then you lose your "humanity and empathy" cause you think you are better, also Gates, Musk, Jobs, Bezos, Zuckerberg and the CEO's of the most popular companies are CIA, they create these Idols to promote spying devices like amazon Echo, the original Coomputers, Facebook (livelog) ETC, there are no geniuses only propaganda

       That theory may hold ground if they actually experienced all the "thrills" that life offers today. In reality, they seem to live normal lives. Nothing too crazy other than having lots of wealth. In fact, they're all probably afraid to go anywhere without a security entourage tagging along. That is not freedom. They are not truly free. They also live in fear IMO.

       I've heard of such Conspiracy Theories &amp; while there may be some that are like that, I doubt they all are. I can tell who the crazies are from the not crazies just by watching their speech &amp; body language.
The suspicious ones act suspiciously IMO.
And cannibalism? If there's no masses of humans they can exploit, who're they gonna eat then? Each other? Come on now.
I've always wondered why they would be cannibals. That might be for another post though.
I've heard of ancient tribes that practiced it but only to instill fear &amp; terror to their enemies.
It can't make them superior in any way genetically or nutritionally than what is already out there IMO. So then why do it? It makes no sense to me &amp; seems more like another Conspiracy Theory designed to create hostility &amp; anger towards the elites -- until one day they all get lynched by the angry mob.

       You are out of the loop, and there is a whole layer of pretending to be normal that you seem to be missing as well,  Let me put it in a clear way...you know how some people worship god and the bible like they are real, with all their hearts?, the christian god talks about other gods, and specifically calls Moloch by name, he also says: guys dont sacrifice children to moloch or I will get angry, NATURALLY some people will take god's word seriously and do the opposite, this has happened inside the Elite for thousands of years and it has never stopped, its a cannibal religion, also you are out of the loop with the whole adrenochome thing, its really everywhere, if you care about this topic you'll find your way around the missinformation from google and others

       Moloch is the biblical name of a Canaanite god associated with child sacrifice. However, the ancient Canaanites practiced this for protection &amp; good fortune.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look in the modern region where Canaanite is located. They are in ruins like Syria. WTF would anyone half intelligent worship a god or deity that has no real power?
      </p>
      <p>
       With regards to people who worship God zealously, look at them. Most of them seem to be people living with pain &amp; suffering of some kind. Most of them have no money &amp; have hardship, so they have hope &amp; faith in a better after life in Heaven. They do this because their life on Earth now is miserable IMO. Of course, there are many that love his teachings &amp; going to Church does instill good values in people IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wrote another Reddit post that makes more sense regarding the subject of Child Trafficking &amp; Sacrifice to produce Adrenochrome Drug.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Adrenochrome Drug" is basically "Adrenaline Rush"

....You say you know zealots, but you dont seem to believe people can take God's word seriously, he mentions moloch directly, and they have thrived inside the elite underground cause their child sacrifice habbits also allow them to entrap politicians, its been going on since the roman times, if you pay attention you will see it, also you have a very mainstream media conception about Adrenochrome, you are missing the canibalism side of the elite

       I'm not saying it doesn't exist. I'm trying to make sense of it in a rational manner. I don't know any religious zealots personally. I don't know anyone that seem so pathetic that they would need the help of Moloch or Satan too.
I'm sure there's lots of people who would sell their soul to the devil for wealth, fame &amp; fortune etc. But if it actually, worked, then why wouldn't everyone do the same?
Also, like I said Moloch's ancient proving grounds is a total &amp; utter failure. Who follows &amp; worships losers?

       Everyone assumes about others what they know about themselves, you think worshiping a deity to spite god and get power is silly, but there is a good 10% of the whole people in the world that considers worship of god *any god, the highest value in the world that you could have

       I don't think it is silly to worship &amp; have faith because like I said it gives people hope.
I just don't understand what Moloch worshipers would be doing it for when history &amp; present times, show it was all in vain.
The only thing that makes a little sense again is Adrenochrome Drug but even that is because they must not engage in anything healthy &amp; exciting in their lives that produced an "Adrenaline Rush" like playing sports IMO.

       Then what does it feel like?
The "Adrenaline Rush" I'm referring to is for example snowboarding down a mountain at 40MPH &amp; taking 20+ feet of air.
Also, what could be better than sex? Only drugs that enhance the pleasure of sex. LOL ;p
Ok, I've read that "Adrenochrome" could be like severe psychosis. So it makes sense that they would use it in Satanic Rituals for example. They would all probably hallucinate &amp; hear shit that makes them think they're talking with Satan himself! LOL ;p

       In reality the real criminals know how to get around spying. For example, criminals may use code words in game chat that is all related to the game itself not arousing suspicion. So then, they're all just spying on mostly normal people. I'm sure they just love their jobs &amp; what they're doing. If you have nothing to hide &amp; keep it real, it doesn't matter IMO. In fact, I might play with them if I knew they were spying on me for sure. LOL ;p ... Of course, I know many people want their privacy &amp; would be offended -- especially hot girls they spy on too.

       It just seems very odd because only elites can't be involved. They have to use regular people in their operations too. People who have loving families &amp; friends -- even children.

       This may explain the PTSD though, if regular people are involved &amp; can't get out for one reason or another.

       With regards to spying &amp; CIA. Who do you know that loves spying on people? Who has such horrible lives that they need to get their thrills spying on others? Starting 2013, I actually started posting all sorts of things hoping they were spying on me. Then they would have to produce hours of Power Point Presentations for their Masters &amp; act like my "shills". Death by PowerPoint. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ;p

       LOL ... of course, I've heard of voyeurism. However, I have thousands of hot girls as friends on Facebook, follow them on Twitter, Instagram etc, etc. They just keep posting all their photos &amp; even send me unsolicited nudes. Then there's some fakes girls that try to scam me with links to sex dating sites etc. I'm actually kind of getting sick of it. I would prefer to see more post about their thoughts &amp; ideas now.

       I think there may be a darker fringe society that is underground with degenerates &amp; mentally ill that think that worshiping Satan, Moloch or any other demon or questionable deity will give them wealth, wisdom etc, etc. Again, like the suffering Christian zealots, they too are miserable &amp; want to escape their misery any way they can IMO.

       I have friends from all over the world -- even Russia.
But they all seem wealthy, so maybe they're not good examples or sampling of the population.
Anyway, none of them want to marry me &amp; leave their countries. LOL ;p
Of course, we're just friends &amp; getting to know each other better.
And I like playing hard to get. LOL ;p
Anyway, you can't trust everything you read -- especially when you also speak about CIA treachery.
How do you know it's not all misinformation, so no American wants to emigrate out of USA en masse too?
Wars &amp; Conflict is big money for banks &amp; corporations too. Don't forget that.
Also, the media always focuses mostly on tragedy, scandals etc, etc because that shit sell subscriptions &amp; gets views unfortunately. Everyone wants drama!

       Ok thanks for sharing. I will look into it. Keep in mind China has 1.5 billion people. Maybe they must resort to things that the West is not used to because of such a huge population IMO.
However, in my experience most Asians seem very honorable generally -- specifically with friends &amp; family.

       Exponential population growth mathematically guarantees that we will reach peak oil production. Currently, renewables are not sufficiently efficient to replace fossil fuels and maintain this global population level. The wealthy are well aware of this, sonce they get the real data, not the bullshit that the MSM spews.

       It's actually rather simple.  Humanity created civilization once we entered the age of agriculture.  Agriculture allowed us to stay in the same area, but at the cost of hard work.  Eventually people realized it would be a lot easier to force others to work the fields, and this created physical slavery.  The problem with physical slavery is you need other guards to watch and force the slaves to continue being slaves, and the more slaves you have the need for more guards grows.  For example, if you had five slaves, you would only need one guard to watch these five.  If you got five more, you would need to hire two more guards, because watching ten slaves is much more difficult than watching five.  The more slaves means the more income and the more variety you can grow, but each guard wants money.  Eventually this system of physical slavery will collapse, as it will grow to a level where the income produced can't afford the cost of the guards.  So, the guards will eventually stop guarding the slaves, the slaves will revolt, and your whole empire will burn.  This is, in a nutshell, what happened to the Roman empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the powers that were at the time decided to change their policy.  They realized the only time the slaves were happy to have the guards was in times of war, so they split up families and created new cultures for the purpose of creating endless conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we entered the age of industry.  Now more could be produced by less people, but the more people they had the more they could have.  The need for mass numbers of people were needed to continue the perpetual conditioning that government was needed and there for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now we are in the age of technology.  With technology, one person can do the work of ten.  So, our leaders now find themselves at a crossroads.  They could use technology to finally free us.  Imagine a world where you would only have to do two hours of work a week, which would free up the rest of your time to do as you please.  In a generation or two, we would have a species of artists, scientists, and scholars.  This would raise us up to levels never believed possible, but at the cost of dropping them and their bloodlines down to our level.
      </p>
      <p>
       One the other hand, they also could use technology to go back to physical enslavement.  They could then stop pretending, hiding, and place themselves again as royalty.  The only thing stopping them from this is they would need to get rid of about 90% of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       By culling the herd down to 10% of what it currently is, they could easily use technology to force enough of us to perform ALL the work, while instilling a guard system to watch over us that would be affordable, and they would have ALL the time to do whatever they want.  They would create a paradise for them and theirs alone at the cost of Hell for the rest.

       Is there any scientific proof that their bloodlines are superior in any way other than having amassed excessive wealth over time &amp; generations?

       I don't see any "elite" super models, Olympic athletes, UFC champions, sports stars etc, etc. Maybe I'm mistaken but most of them seem to have risen from humble backgrounds. Sure many from well education &amp; wealthy families but not billionaires, kings &amp; queens etc IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aren't they afraid of inbreeding? TBH, I've never been attracted to "elite" women. I find many common girls way hotter, nicer personalities &amp; even more intelligent IMO.

       When I look at Ancient Kings, Queens, Tribal Leaders etc, etc. Not only were they one of the most intelligent but they also lead their Guards &amp; Armies into battle. Many even rose to become leaders due to their prowess on the battlefield. Today, they can't even take one 1 of their guards in hand-to-hand combat IMO. LOL 😜

       Because unfortunately humanity is only as strong as the weakest link.  Once robots can do menial task, there isn't much need for low, or even average IQ individuals. Humanity could accomplish great feats if  we didn't have a responsibility/burden of tending the needs of the weaker members of the world. Essentially, modern civilizations have  halted evolution and TPTB want to put it back on track.

       You’re asking us to argue a point based on Agenda 21, of which you offer a definition by way of an info graph of controversial subjects, while taken individually say nothing about the actual “agenda”. If you had mentioned the Georgia Guidestones, which actually do suggest a depopulation agenda, we could simply say it’s to provide them with a slave class.

       A burden for what? The reason most of them are wealthy is because of the manipulation of the masses. Without the masses they wouldn't be wealthy IMO.

       I've heard of such Conspiracy Theories &amp; while there may be some that are like that, I doubt they all are. I can tell who the crazies are from the not crazies just by watching their speech &amp; body language.
The suspicious ones act suspiciously IMO.
And cannibalism? If there's no masses of humans they can exploit, who're they gonna eat then? Each other? Come on now.
I've always wondered why they would be cannibals. That might be for another post though.
I've heard of ancient tribes that practiced it but only to instill fear &amp; terror to their enemies.
It can't make them superior in any way genetically or nutritionally than what is already out there IMO. So then why do it? It makes no sense to me &amp; seems more like another Conspiracy Theory designed to create hostility &amp; anger towards the elites -- until one day they all get lynched by the angry mob.

       First, thank you for such a elaborate &amp; rational comment trying to make sense of the Depopulation Agenda.

        This would raise us up to levels never believed possible, but at the cost of dropping them and their bloodlines down to our level.

       Is there any scientific proof that their bloodlines are superior in any way other than having amassed excessive wealth over time &amp; generations?

      <p>
       I don't see any "elite" super models, Olympic athletes, UFC champions, sports stars etc, etc. Maybe I'm mistaken but most of them seem to have risen from humble backgrounds. Sure many from well education &amp; wealthy families but not billionaires, kings &amp; queens etc IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aren't they afraid of inbreeding? TBH, I've never been attracted to "elite" women. I find many common girls way hotter, nicer personalities &amp; even more intelligent IMO.

       No one can live forever right? Or do you think they discovered the "Secrets of Immortality"?

       History will always repeat itself, if the mistakes aren't learned from &amp; corrected. One day, their heirs will pay for their treachery IMO. Then history will remember them with Truth.

       It's like Hitler. Would anyone else want to be remembered as Hitler? LOL 😜

       When I look at Ancient Kings, Queens, Tribal Leaders etc, etc. Not only were they one of the most intelligent but they also lead their Guards &amp; Armies into battle. Many even rose to become leaders due to their prowess on the battlefield. Today, they can't even take one 1 of their guards in hand-to-hand combat IMO. LOL 😜
