        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Two women have accused Nugent of having sexual relationships with them when they were under 18 years old. <strong>When he was 30, Nugent allegedly became romantically involved with and became the legal guardian of Pele Massa, a 17 year-old girl.</strong>[46] In a 2012 television documentary, Massa stated, &quot;It just really wasn’t a terribly appropriate situation in most people’s eyes...<strong>And now, it would be criminal</strong>.&quot;[47][48] <strong>Courtney Love claims that she was forced to perform fellatio on Nugent when she was 12.</strong>[49][46] In his 1981 song, Jailbait, <strong>Nugget wrote lyrics about a relationship with a 13 year old.</strong>[50]</p>

<p>On The Joe Rogan Experience, Nugent denied that he had ever been in a romantic relationships with underage girls, other than when he was underage himself.[51] This goes against what Nugent previously said in a Behind The Music episode, <strong>where he admitted to several affairs with underage girls.</strong>[52]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think maybe you are bitter because people aren&#39;t scrutinizing him or boycotting him in the same way as others, but keep in mind that nobody really listens to his music to begin with, making a boycott difficult. Also, he doesn&#39;t have a job, so we can&#39;t get him fired over his inappropriate lyrics. I&#39;m not sure what you suggest happens since his career is independent and &quot;poster boy&quot; for NRA isn&#39;t his official position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you gotta ask yourself if it&#39;s worth starting a crusade against Nugent being on the NRA board based on Courtney Love testimony. The song is real, no doubt, but it&#39;s just words, and it&#39;s not like anyone&#39;s ever heard it. There&#39;s just not enough there and he doesn&#39;t have enough to lose. That&#39;s why these allegations against him haven&#39;t got any traction. NRA doesn&#39;t cave to PC bullshit,  apparently. </p>

And if she didn’t have a previous history with racist rants (not racist jokes mind you) things might be different. At some point she lost the benefit of the doubt. I also think there is a difference between joking about race versus telling a racist joke. One is intended to point out funny cultural differences one is intended to demean. A person can joke about race without being racist. I can also joke about dead babies without ever actually killing a baby. </p>

<p>The pedos we are talking about have a long and recurring history of &quot;joking&quot; about pedophilia. There is even a blog entry saying &quot;I fuck kids&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At some point she lost the benefit of the doubt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is what I&#39;m hoping is happening with this pedo clown show.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also think there is a difference between joking about race versus telling a racist joke. One is intended to point out funny cultural differences one is intended to demean. A person can joke about race without being racist. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please give an example of what you find an &quot;acceptable, funny racist joke&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can also joke about dead babies without ever actually killing a baby. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly you can. People joke about all sorts of things that make them uncomfortable. Going to the next level and making it a nationwide (pedophilia) theme is different and you know it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yikes. Legitimate observation sure, whatever. Still not a joke. </p>

<p>They don’t have a history of pedo rants, they do have a history of offensive jokes. Pretty big difference. </p>

<p>I can see were they’ve lost the benefit of doubt on their sense of humor. Still doesn’t make them pedophiles. </p>

<p>Didn’t say there was an ‘acceptable racist joke’ said there is a difference between joking about race as a way to highlight differences versus making a racist joke which is intended to demean someone because of their race. Either way Roseanne still wasn’t joking. </p>

<p>Not sure what you mean by a nation wide theme of jokes, but even if it’s going too far, and it probably is, it’s still not evidence of a crime and you know it. </p>

<p>Anyway, they do have a long history of making pedo &quot;jokes&quot; and pedo-friendly rants. One even blogged that &quot;I fuck kids&quot;. </p>

<p>Is that a fucking joke? Am I lacking the irony gene that thinks this is funny? All the while, pro-pedo people that are defending this (often r/rickamdmorty subscribers,) are fucking <em>everywhere</em> on Reddit calling anti-pedophilia users as <strong>intolerant, racist, homophobic, violent, cultists, Nazis, fascists</strong>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is calling anti-pedophelia users racists and nazis. What they may be doing is pushing back against this bullshit Cernovich sponsored fake outrage over offensive humor. Sounds like you are conflating criticisms from the left of the altright goons who perpetrated this with criticism of anti-pedos, and while that’s adorable, it’s a horrible false equivalence. Nobody has a problem with the altright being anti pedo, its weaponized pedo accusations that are politically motivated, and seriously lacking in evidence, that are the issue and you know it, that plus the hypocrisy of Roy Moore, Ted Nugent, Jim Johnson, etc. actually have accusers and victims and it seems to be ignored by the same people who are asking for Gunn and Harmon’s heads. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, no. This is the left bringing up questionable, yet legal, instances of common age difference relationships in the past to overshadow a real problem of pedophilia <strong>right now</strong>. Ted Nugent had oral with Courtney Love? Let&#39;s bring that to court! No one is protecting him. Christ, I&#39;ve a long list of musicians that I partied with in my day that <em>I know</em> are pedophiles. I was literally a victim.

    <div class="md"><p>The party that wants to stop it is fucking laughable. As is questionable yet legal instances of common age differences. Now you are literally sticking up for actual pedophiles with real victims. Awesome. You remember Ted was in the White House with trump right. As an invited guest. Roy Moore was supported by the GOP. Don’t tell me they are the party that wants to stop pedos when they invite them to the White House and endorse them for congress. That’s a fucking joke. </p>

<p>I’d love to give you an opportunity to clarify your last sentence as well, are you saying it’s ok to have pedophiles in the GOP party because they ‘are siding with the party that wants to stop it’? </p>
