        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know Dan Harmon made a video of him raping a baby doll and all, but he&#39;s not a bad guy. Who better to demonstrate that than his ex-wife, Erin McGathy.</p>

<p>She made a funny skit about two women finding out they were dating the same guy, where she plays one women and the other women is played by a baby. Not only was it hilarious, but it definitely isn&#39;t weird at all when you consider that Harmon and her were dating at the time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=Mejs1XGoCdA">https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=Mejs1XGoCdA</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a funny clip of Harmon and McGathy from 2012 about a baby zoo and just burning babies for fertilizer and things like that hahaha comedy!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=g1Ge8P3E04g">https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=g1Ge8P3E04g</a></p>

<p>Also In 2015, she also stared in an 8 episode series titled &quot;Kill the Baby&quot;, centering around her husband&#39;s desire to kill their baby (which he does graphically multiple times throughout the series), which is also hilarious.</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/118394841">https://vimeo.com/118394841</a></p>

<p>Surely there&#39;s nothing else like this out there for anyone to look for.</p>

<p>Oh wait except for this clip of him raping an adult woman (this has no context or punchline)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OTZfo_arw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OTZfo_arw</a></p>

<p>And this clip of him (as garfield) calling Rick and Morty the n-word before saying he&#39;s been having sex with 12 year old girls all day and eating feces out of his owner Jon&#39;s ass</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMqHt3WIVpI&amp;amp;t=113s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMqHt3WIVpI&amp;amp;t=113s</a></p>

<p>And here is fellow Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland&#39;s absolutely abominable video &#39;Unbelievable Tales&#39;. This depicts extremely graphic child abuse and honestly it might be illegal under obscenity laws and I&#39;m beginning to genuinely hope he is arrested in conjunction with the Barron Trump tweet</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpejckQgpeg&amp;amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpejckQgpeg&amp;amp;t</a></p>

<p>Please spread this as far and wide as possible. I am not &quot;concern trolling&quot; Rick and Morty. I genuinely liked this show and I now believe the creators are diseased terrible individuals. I am ashamed of myself. The entire first episode of this show is basically a thin metaphor for abduction and rape. Rick takes Morty out of school, they go to &quot;outer space&quot;, Morty has his legs broken, Rick shoves the seeds from a tree that looks like a dick up Morty&#39;s ass, Rick convinces Morty to lie to the police, Rick lies to Morty&#39;s Parents. When Morty collapses at the end of the episode Rick says he is going to control his life forever. The entire show is like this, usually more esoteric than episode 1. But then you have Season 3 ep 9 with a pedophile king literally eating his own children. This show is disgusting, and I cannot believe they fooled me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was hoping that I would be able to say that but the content of Rick and Morty itself is ruined for me. There is also the masonic imagery of the first episode where morty becomes enlightened by the seed, and the two pedophile kings are avatars of the Royal Order Of Jesters. Also the scene that has the masonic awakening in the wormhole sequence with the pyramid, eye, pillars and baphomet split in two around rick was after the child being shot repeatedly in the head died.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t watch the show anymore. I reeks of child abuse and satanism to me now.</p>

I have also listened to the commentary and heard the writers talk about how they have to always tell Roiland he needs to tone it way back on the gore and fucked up stuff in general.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean its not obvious what turns him on to me. I just don&#39;t make a direct correlation between behavior and humor/creative writing.</p>

<p>If you want to speculate about Harmon sexual needs, I mean fair enough. Just understand that a lot of people take it a step further and tries to destroy his life over this. There is a concerted effort to make Dan Harmon into a sexual predator based of his work alone and I feel that is messed up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i dont see why my opinion matters to you. i am just saying, in this present age, by living in hollywood, which is a proven pedo nest, and continuing to hang out with pedos... and making references to pedophilia using skits might make people think you are a pedophile. it also is the perfect cover.. i mean anthony weiner can&#39;t claim, &quot;those were just jokes.&quot; know what i mean?</p>

<p>Weiner messages girls directly with sexual intentions, Dan Harmon makes comedic content for the public. I don&#39;t see how those two situations are comparable. </p>

<p>Harmon is close with pedos? Can you name a person so I can actually look into it myself.</p>

<p>Lastly, how is writing jokes a pedophilia a perfect cover? Had he not done anything we wouldn&#39;t even have this conversation. No one would.</p>

<p>it would be a perfect cover in that no one would be stupid enough to make jokes about being a pedo, if they were a pedo, right? no one would think the guy saying, &quot;hey look, i&#39;m a serial killer!&quot; is in fact a serial killer. it&#39;s perfect. plus in the case that your creepiness is exposed, you can fall back on, &quot;i&#39;m a comedian.. or i&#39;m an artist, you just dont understand.&quot; it&#39;s brilliant, really. </p>

And a looooot of the art is dicks. I was willing to handwave all of this. But now, with all of these other revelations, it&#39;s a lot more difficult to ignore.</p>

So both of the creators clearly have some problems.

He never used those words, and despite &#39;hotard&#39; having unsavory definitions on UD, we don&#39;t know who it&#39;s directed to. After rereading that particular post, it seems most likely to me that he IS intending the UD definition, but directing it towards one of the earlier commenters who are gushing about the baby. Makes sense to me that it would be a joke directed towards women or gay men who get all googly eyed when they see babies. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is true at all.

<p>All I&#39;m saying is there is that extreme shock style sub-genre of comedy that many people don&#39;t find funny in any way.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see how this plays out, but imho, this isn&#39;t nearly as extreme as the stuff on James Alefantis and Comet Pizza, and this is a lot different than some of the larger &#39;hollywood&#39; abuse cases.</p>

<p>The more content I see that lightly touches on topics of pedophilia or homosexuality or transgenderism, the more i am meant to think that this is a normal, everyday part of society. </p>

<p>It&#39;s subtly breaking down our morals that strengthen us as a society and turning us into degenerates. This is how Rome fell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So that&#39;s it? A video either has to be propaganda or baby fucking? </p>

<p>I&#39;m NOT looking for someone to make laws against this stuff but it also doesn&#39;t mean we have to like it or support. We use comedy to deal with topics that are uncomfortable and I strongly encourage any art form that &quot;crosses the line&quot; in order to start a discussion or help the viewer see a different perspective.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ve got agree at least somewhat with OP that this stuff seems to only be vile and vulgar and I missed the comedy part on all those videos and for sure didn&#39;t see any expression of art for social discussion. That looked like a sadist working out some inner struggles. Maybe even a person who was abused themselves and is trying to make sense of it or make others see their internalized pain.</p>

<p>I like Dan Harmon as an artist and writer. I think he is one of the masters of our time at complex stories with lots of esoteric symbology and metaphor while still being hilarious. That skill doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t a demented or damaged person. I&#39;m not calling for censorship but I do think these people need to seek help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Well, I just binge watched Casual. In season 1, when discussing the male preference for shaved vagina. A joke ends with 5 year old pussy being the Gold Standard. The drama in season 1 revolves around a 16 girl wanting to fuck her teacher and hints at him going along with it. He ultimately fucks the mom instead. </p>

<p>In season 2, while looking the sperm donor baby pictures, the main character says “well I wouldn’t take any of these babies home...” to paint the picture and give it some context, she was referring to sex. </p>

<p>Is this bad enough for you? Are you triggered? Are you going to reeeeeact? </p>

But find me a comedian/creator who hasn’t got some embarrassing fails under their belt. Most are just juvenile and a bit shit. But that’s it. If you find links to being friends with convicted paedophiles, production/possession/distribution  of child porn etc.  Then fine. Lynch away. Otherwise dig a little deeper to find the real people causing real problems.....Maybe the last past few US presidents who hung out on Paedo island repeatedly, or the sheer amount of child porn found in the Pentagon, for a start.

    <div class="md"><p>They are leftist and liberals. Throughout history one will never find leftists coming out on their own to oust a degenerate amongst themselves. Worldwide you will find them backing their torch bearers. </p>

<p>Body shaming went out fast when it involves conservatives. Mocking a child went out fast when it was conservatives child. Abusing women is fine if she is conservative. Shooting a conservative is cheered. A woman can be called whore and it is politically correct if she supports any other than them. Call for murder is okay and silencing them is not taking away their choice as long as its not leftists and liberal. </p>

<p>Remember liberalism is a mental disorder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently went back and watched the first episode of Rick and Morty and got serious child grooming vibes. Mortys parents don&#39;t want him hanging out with Rick but Rick sneaks him out in the middle of the night. Rick forces Morty to climb a super phallic looking tree (veins and all) to get a magic nut and then he makes him hide it in his ass and carry it around without telling anyone. The ending is the creepiest part though where Morty is essentially drugged and Rick keeps repeating over and over that they are going to be together forever. Gave me some seriously creepy vibes in light of all of this stuff coming out.</p>
