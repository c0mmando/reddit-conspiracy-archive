        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been thinking about this one for awhile. Every 5 years or so there’s a new diet fad and all of the sudden a certain food is deadly. The funny thing is it’s always a natural food, but never meat. </p>

<p>For example, a few years ago soy was considered the devil, linked to hormone imbalance. Even though there has been no concrete evidence. Gluten free exploded a few years ago and people claimed to feel better weeks after stopping eating gluten. When in reality it could be a placebo effect. Again, no concrete evidence. Look at all other countries where gluten is part of their culture like japan and yet they’re the one slimmest population in the world. Sure there are people who are gluten intolerant, just like there are people who are lactose intolerant but doesn’t mean everyone else is. </p>

<p>A few years ago, paleo was the “thing” and considered the best diet, which is mostly based of meat. The fad died off and now is keto. Which again, is mostly made of meat. And discourages carbs, because “they’re bad for the body”. </p>

<p>Now, what’s strange is that most of, if not all, are vegan alternatives that are now bad. This keeps people from going fully vegan. </p>

<p>I feel I can go as far as saying the pharmaceutical industry is connected since meat is linked to many health problems. </p>

<p>I’m not saying no food is bad. Abuse anything and there will be consequences. Drink to much water and get food poisoning. </p>

<p>Just some thoughts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hadn&#39;t considered that the meat industry might have been behind the push for gluten-free and such things as that. That&#39;s an interesting idea. Some people really do need to avoid gluten because of celiac disease, but that&#39;s really rare and there does seem to have been a really weird push for gluten-free without regard for people who actually have celiac disease. </p>

Fat can be stored in an outer layer or it can be stored around the organs and it&#39;s entirely dependent on whether it has to be processed by the liver, such as with glucose and alcohol.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s one for you.<br/>
I can no longer eat beef.     And yes it&#39;s beef.  In any form.<br/>
Guts got messed up.  Took my diet apart.  It&#39;s beef.    </p>

<p>Good.  Bad. Average.  Super high quality.   None of it is acceptable now.   </p>

<p>And i literally lived on beef for the last ~20 years straight.  Almost 100%.</p>

<p>If i had a few thousand bucks extra to throw at doctors.  I&#39;d try and find out why.<br/>
Internet is really no help either.   Just run into those vegan dilholes in every place the topic is discussed.   </p>

<p>But lucky theres chicken, turkey, bison, deer, buffalo, elk, etc...    </p>

<p>Still i&#39;m a sad mofo.  I like beef.   :|   </p>

<p>My best theory is i&#39;ve hit the total number of cows a single person is allowed to eat.<br/>
Gotta be well over 100.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen anyone talking about a keto diet that has said carbs are bad for you. Carbs turn into sugar in the body so too many can be bad for you. I&#39;ve been on a keto diet for a few months now and have lost a considerable amount of weight and meat isn&#39;t the only option for eating. It&#39;s basically just eating 50-100 carbs a day and there are plenty of foods other than meat that can be eaten on the diet. Meat is just one of the obvious choices bc of the low carb count</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Le cordon bleu qualified chef here. Gluten isn&#39;t very good for anyone. Certain recipes call for extra gluten which is made by processing dough in a certain way and just keeping the gluten. Basic white flour differs in gluten percentage in different parts of the world. To make certain doughs you may need to introduce gluten which makes &#39;strong flour&#39; or bakers flour. These are typically leavened bread products, and laminated dough (puff pastry). Most commercial kitchens, bakeries use white flour. This is a bleached product with differing ratios of added gluten. Ideally gluten should almost be eaten on a treat type basis. All the famous old chefs and bakers died young with rotten teeth and stomach problems. Bleached flour contributes greatly to this. Know what your are eating. Gluten free, soy free, glysophate free, Fukushima radiation free etc is smart. We are being poisoned. </p>
