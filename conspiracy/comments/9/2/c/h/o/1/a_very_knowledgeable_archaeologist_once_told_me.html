       ... that archaeology is based upon assumptions.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I recently had an opportunity to visit the Mayan site of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanai">
        Lamanai
       </a>
       in Belize. This ancient site was spectacular and surprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/JvEgFMdVr6v">
        https://goo.gl/maps/JvEgFMdVr6v
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The hiking wasn't too bad. I was able to see the Temple of the Jaguar, The Mask Temple. I also got a chance to climb to the top of The High Temple.
      </p>
      <p>
       I learned that most of the original temples were covered over with 'accurate' representations of statues and walkways. They did this to prevent damage from today's tourists.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the few places still in its' original condition was The Royal Ball Court:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://people.uncw.edu/simmonss/Lamanai%20ballcourt.JPG">
        http://people.uncw.edu/simmonss/Lamanai%20ballcourt.JPG
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where the archaeologist shared his perspective.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       He reminded us that what we often 'know' or read about ancient sites is built on assumptions that mislead and obscure the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that there is a lot we don't know. And there are many things we know that are completely false.
      </p>
      <p>
       The image of the ball court found above may have triggered a memory, or a story you heard about this game that was played back in the day. You may have heard that the game was played with hoops attached to the outer walls, where points were scored. You may have heard that the winning team was often sacrificed to the Gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       This archaeologist assured me that there has never been a single piece of evidence to suggest how the game was played or what happened to the players following a win or a loss.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few people made assumptions and their story became 'HISTORY'.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       He told us a story, from a different site, where they found a short tunnel that led to an underground pool next to some hand carved stairs. The bottom stair was worn away from use. Assumptions were made that there must have been an ancient foot-washing station next to the pool. People sat on the stairs and had their feet washed which led to the wear and tear they were seeing on the bottom step. This theory was accepted immediately and with the new information the culture of the people was adapted to house this new data.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are probably guessing at this point, but YES, they were WRONG.
      </p>
      <p>
       After many years, another worker at the site noticed something very strange. A few times a day, a local bird was going into the area with the underground pool. The bird was taking local tree nuts and smashing them on the worn away rock. This behavior, over time, was most likely responsible for the weathering.
      </p>
      <p>
       The archaeologist explained that while they had most likely found the easiest explanation, it was too late. Books had been written, theories had been proposed and a generation of people were now teaching inaccuracies. He said that this pool and rock had been discovered in the 1970's. Forty years later and he still hears the misinformation being shared.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       What other theories, or stories, from ancient sites have we gotten completely wrong?

       Hi!  You are visibly extremely intelligent.  I will pose this question to you then, now.  What with the staggering advancements in scientific discovery, innovative application, ingenious engineering, why is the condition among humankind so disparately unfair?  Is this the way it is supposed to be?  Thanks for your time and have a great weekend.

       I would blame systems like gender, religion, racism, capitalism, etc. They are designed to magnify small differences in order to naturalize highly disparate outcomes. I don't think things are necessarily supposed to be this way, but it seems like this is an effective way to organize functioning (if unequal) societies.

       That is too blatantly obvious for some.  Somehow they construct this
       <em>
        false and imaginary
       </em>
       premise of an egalitarian society and ignore the fact that for all of human existence there was inequality and power dynamics.  Even when we were just primates.

       I once asked a professor of geology if there were any truth in the theory that the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid were built a 1000 years apart instead of being roughly contemporary.

      <p>
       He told me "Absolutely!" based on their patterns of erosion.

       I read a couple times about only viewing it from the air in the photos, but I didn't read whether or not the 8 sides were seen from the ground during the equinox. Seems like they would be. To bad we can't see it with it's fancy coat.

       It's so funny to me that people only get worked up about this segmentation when it comes to history. I'm an environmental consultant. The macroecologists don't talk to entymologists or fucking dendrologists. They publish is seperate journals. You know how many problems would avoid if they spoke to climatologists? We would be advancing MUCH fast as a society if we all worked off one book.

       All it takes is an assumption from any qualified "authority" figure. And once it's in the books, it's history, period. (until it's disproven, but often times, mainstream historians will buckle down rather than change a long-standing narrative, or they'll change it in half-truths very very very slowly).
      </p>
      <p>
       The most aggressive ones are those with lots of schooling/education in history. They think they know the truth because they studied it for years. I know a few history majors like this. They are able to recite all kinds of dates and other data through their required rote memorization, but if you bring up anything that goes against their schooling, they write it off without a second thought, because anything that threatens the foundation of their memorized facts must be preposterous.

       I think this is a common problem all around. Feelings of entitlement due to education and experience. Sometimes, it's true, but it was a common theme when studying early psychology too.

       Note that one group ("We were Kings!") and another group ("We were slaves!") base much of their tribal stories on those narratives. The latter group in particular is quite protective of the "ancient historical facts" they've gotten so much mileage out of in the last 70 years.

       a comment I saw recently about archaeological evidence during 'Operation Iraqi Freedom':

      <blockquote>

       <p>
        Something in 'Mesopotamia', if brought to public consciousness, would blow the shit out of the whole Abrahamic Fairytale Narrative. That 'something', in the eyes of our "democratic ally in the Middle East™", justified sending the U.S. Golem on a side-mission in Iraq, to either:
        <br/>
        1. Confiscate that 'evidence', or
        <br/>
        2. Bury and pave over 'inconvenient' history.

       These are the kind of people that you don't need in your life anyways. History is never settled, same a science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of history or even science is simply a belief to most of us,we either lack the time,intelligence, or simply the interest to be able to confirm as fact. Educated guesses and theories are what encompass what most  of us believe are "fact"

       Not just ancient sites, butour entire historical teachings are assumptions and many are fabricated lies told by the victor. "His Story" is just that, the story told by those who won the monetary  and politcal grab bag of power over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most ancient sites are considered bot connected but we see similar vuilding patterns across the entire planet. There are pyramids on every continent. Plants indigenous to South America have been found in ancient tombs in Africa and vice versa. There is proof that people had connected long before Christopher Columbus and his band of genocidal men had crossed the Atlantic, even further before the Vikings had done the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also due to decay and long term global changes such as glaciers grinding everything beneath it to dust. There could have been multiple civilizations in the past, some technologically more advanced than ourselves right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The list goes on and on to how much we don't  know or we are knowingly telling lies to maintain power or the perception of it.

       Except it isn't at all, they are mostly gatekeepers, keeping the truth from being outed. They purposely diminish critical thought. So I don't really know what you are talking about. In general yes academia is supposed to be critical but in the context of this forum, they are not due to power and what the truth does to change those in power, namely the heads of academia.

       I am arguing from evidence. But I don't need to cite the hundreds of cases where academia lies to support the false truth because I have already done my research and come to a conclusion. It sounds like you have not done any research. Here are some topics for you to consider: Giants, pyramids on every continent, plants found on different continents not indigenous to their area in tombs  from decades to thousands of years before academia says anyone had access to the Americans, Gobekli Tepe, etc.

       If you are too ignorantly biased to consider you have been lied to for many reasons, then enjoy the mainstream koolaid, it is definitely easier to be ignorant, since it is bliss. Enjoy your cognitive dissonance.

       while I cannot speak for u/imminent_disclosure, my education is not solely from youtube. I don't know anything about cocain on King Tut etc, however the findings at Gobekli Tepe do conjure up serious questions about the common timeline of civilication and it's progress from hunter gathere to what we are now.

      <p>
       Those are heavily brigaded, rightly so in a way because there is not enough evidence yet to SURELY make assumptions, however it is astounding how deaf some people get when new evidence is uncovered.

       Yeah I am not going to tout my degree in a conversation with someone like that because it is irrelevant. Even if someone was basing their information entirely off of youtube they could be extremely informed. What is interesting is that even in Academia do they acknowledge that once the old members die do new ideas then get accepted into the fold of what is true and what isn't.

      <p>
       I think there's a potential for cognitive dissonance on both sides. The point being that we, outside of available evidence, do not know. The issue may be that the theories you're inclined toward are deemed less respectable than the others, although those theories are often only different interpretations of the same evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really dislike citations. Always felt it's more of an ego stroke than important to process of discovery. That said, when trying to counter theories/interpretations, you're not dealing with empirical evidence. You're dealing with one person or groups interpretation of that evidence.

       What you're describing is a problem with the popularization/sensationalism of science, not the science itself. The people doing the actual research should be (and usually are) cautious in their interpretations and always open for reexamination if new data emerges.

       Also any scholarship about Meso America is upfront with the fact its based on assumptions and the fact it pulls from a relatively small pool of artifacts and data. Academic History isn't also nearly this cut and dry, one author making a claim and even having some evidence doesn't always mean it becomes part of the literature on a subject.

       Objective observation relies upon assumption. It's not

       , it's
       <em>

       How do you assume scientifically the nature of how some bones and ruins are found underground? There is no experiment to do there. You just look at things and compare them to already known (and just as assumed) things and make new assumptions. Nothing scientific there. Just applying of basic logic into very vague things.

       You are right, but it is a silly point to make. Of course, not only science, but everything in human experience apparently rests upon fundamental assumptions of causality, consistency in universal rules, etc. Without them the very concept of knowledge would seem ridiculous. No one but a few ontology philosophers spends too much time thinking about these things, they are indeed taken for granted because we would descend into madness if we had to doubt our reality every second of our existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the word assumption carries with it a lot of negative connotations for many people (i.e. that an assumption is a careless mistake), and the preferred word would instead be hypothesis (a proposal aware of its uncertain nature, with the intent to be systematically tested).
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem of archeology, anthropology and history is that they often present their assumptions as facts, rather than theories. The amount of unsubstantiated extrapolations and fanciful assumptions is astounding the further back you look. They are not "hard" sciences where most things can be experimentally tested and replicated with any consistency so we can have a sufficient degree of confidence on their reality. They're often making crazy stories of how a people must have lived, what they believed in, etc based on a few pottery fragments and eroded building foundations... passing them as facts instead of saying "we basically know nothing".

       It's kinda sad because even if you say it is wrong, you weren't there, no one was there to see it first hand, so everything about these ancient sites is all hear say.

       All I said was that there IS evidence. Reliefs, paintings, murals, pottery, figurines and the courts themselves.

       Yes,most of what we assume to know about the game comes from interpreting artwork and architecture, which is never going to be perfectly accurate, but even archaeologists have disagreements about the the purpose of the game.

       Agreed! Who had a say in creating the food pyramid and WHY?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        In April 1991, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) halted publication of its Eating Right Pyramid,
       </em>
       <strong>
        <em>
         due to objections raised by meat and dairy lobbying groups concerning the guide’s display of their products.
        </em>
       </strong>
       <em>
        Despite the USDA’s explanations that the guide required further research and testing, it was not until one year later—after its content was supported by additional research—that the Eating Right Pyramid was officially released. This time, even the guide’s graphic design was altered to appease industry concerns.
       </em>
       <strong>
        <em>
         This incident was only one of many in which the food industry attempted to alter federal dietary recommendations in their own economic self-interest.

       Growing up in Texas, I remember all my mom's friends eating so many of those Snackwells devil's food cookies thinking they were healthy. "Fat free" was all that mattered. Then you find out the sugar industry played a huge role in developing the pyramid.

       20,000 years from now our archaeologists will find the Starbucks logo everywhere in the ruins of civilization all over the world and argue about the goddess cult it must have represented. And wonder how it coexisted so easily with the Ronald McDonald cult.

       Maybe, maybe not.  In some cases certainly.  In some cases, traces will be left that can be analyzed.  That's how we know, for example, that most medeival castles were painted with a whitewash, and not bare stone as we see today.  In rare cases, depending on the quality of the soil in which they were preserved, more than traces may be left behind.

       Roman and Greek ruins are much more legit. We have sketches documenting the condition of buildings like the Colosseum (built 72 AD) going back  hundreds of years. The Parthenon (Ancient Greece, much older, built circa 450 BC) was actually in pretty good condition (very well constructed, it was nearly fully roofed still) until right before the 18th century. The Turks were using it to store fucking ammunition’s and the Venetians hit it with artillery. That’s when it blew apart.

      <h2>

      <p>
       A lot of Aztec and Mayan ruins are actually much younger (1200 AD+) and we’re in really bad shape until recently. Harsher climate, generally. Most have  been largely reconstructed recently. There are some small original structures in the jungle.

       This is the same case with all established sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream scientists are afraid to go against the dogma.
It is all a phony show.
      </p>
      <p>
       The electron, photons, gravity, atomic theory - we are not allowed to question any of the established theories. 
Our children are "taught" by robotic sheep people who parrot the offical narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       No electron was ever found. Because there is no such thing.
Magnetism is not understood and no explanations are available even today.
Gravity is not an explanation. It is merely a name. Why does the apple fall? "Gravity, dumbass. F= ma".  Oh thanks, that clears it up. 
The photon is a "particle and a wave"? I dont know,  i think... "shut up! The greatest genius ever to live won a Noble prize for the photo electric effect. His name was einstein and I'm sure that your intellect isnt even half of his."
Question these things and prepare to be ridiculed and called stupid. "Go back to elementary school".

       At least half of all people are npc robots. They have no will to think original thoughts. They exists to maintain order.

       it's not that they're exactly afraid of going against it. More like that most of them are hardwired not to. Think of science like a religion. Would a devout christian go against god?

       Great write up. Primary school always made it seem like we were just a couple of questions away from understanding everything in the universe. Got a little more education and started realizing we don't know a goddamned thing about our world.
      </p>
      <p>
       From genetics to astrophysics to human evolution, brain function, weather patterns, ecology, you name it, we are just pulling our heads out of our arses. Archaelogy is notable for exactly the assumptions you maintain.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much of our understanding of older civilizations is based on colonial-European "truths" about the limited mind of the savage. There's no way they could've had a written language...etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't until I started looking into the "Olmec heads" that I realized the term "Olmec" was made up by the people who first found the heads--not the people who made them. No one knows what those people called themselves. This pattern of assumption-to-knowledge happens constantly. Thanks for the check.

       The point of school is to teach a little bit about a lot of topics, and the earlier in school the topic is covered, the more simplistic the explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many topics are difficult to boil down to an ELI5 overview without loss, but knowing more takes work many novices don't see the point in expending.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of facts out there, but unless we do all the experiments ourselves, knowing the facts often requires trusting someone else who did the research.

       You're right, I get that there's a limit to the complexity you can teach any given age. My intent is to point out that even adults were convinced of the certainty of the universe not that long ago. Before it was punctured by QM, the failure of logical positivism, Freud's insight into our limitations and spun us into an age of reconciling for data corroboration and probability over certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're in the tail end of that reconciliation, IMO. So yes, for sure we're taught with a different attitude about the world when we're young. I just meant it in a broader way.

       "The first use of the term "Byzantine" to label the later years of the Roman Empire was in 1557, when the German historian Hieronymus Wolf published his work Corpus Historiæ Byzantinæ, a collection of historical sources. The term comes from "Byzantium", the name of the city of Constantinople before it became Constantine's capital. This older name of the city would rarely be used from this point onward except in historical or poetic contexts. The publication in 1648 of the Byzantine du Louvre (Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae), and in 1680 of Du Cange's Historia Byzantina further popularised the use of "Byzantine" among French authors, such as Montesquieu.[10] However, it was not until the mid-19th century that the term came into general use in the Western world.[11]
      </p>
      <p>
       The Byzantine Empire was known to its inhabitants as the "Roman Empire", the "Empire of the Romans" (Latin: Imperium Romanum, Imperium Romanorum; Greek: Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων Basileia tōn Rhōmaiōn, Ἀρχὴ τῶν Ῥωμαίων Archē tōn Rhōmaiōn), "Romania" (Latin: Romania; Greek: Ῥωμανία Rhōmania),[n 1] the "Roman Republic" (Latin: Res Publica Romana; Greek: Πολιτεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων Politeia tōn Rhōmaiōn), "Graecia" (Greek: Γραικία),[14] and also as "Rhōmais" (Greek: Ῥωμαΐς).[15] The inhabitants called themselves Romaioi and Graikoi,[16] and even as late as the 19th century Greeks typically referred to modern Greek as Romaika and Graikika."

       I took an archaeology class and that was the biggest lesson I drew from that class.   Most of our education regarding history is taught as indisputable fact instead of the crafted story it really is.  Events close to us are generally well known because we have plenty of writings to tell us that the events did occur.  For history prior to the enlightenment, we can only rely on writings made by influential people backed up by circumstantial evidence.  Even then, the writings were created by people who often had incomplete pictures of events themselves and could have had motive to change descriptions of events.  The world leaders had a vested interest in shaping perceptions of their people.  It’s not unbelievable that they would alter records to meet their vision.  Likewise, artifacts can tell a story, but it’s a story created in your own mind, influenced by your own biases.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you’ve ever played Dark Souls, history is like the lore from those games, but even more ethereal and incomplete.  There is no telling what we might have gotten wrong.

       For decades the prevailing wisdom was the Maya were peaceful stargazers, they actually were  warmongering city states fighting for their own interest.  The two largest city states Tikal and the recently discovered Calakmul  fought a series of wars over 3 centuries that was as politically complex as the Hundred Years War or our own cold war.  Fourtune changed hands several times and they even had a cold war that had client states fighting and rebelling rebelling ect.

       The Qin empire is another, China is named after it, their language and writing all come from it but after the death of the first emperor it collapsed on itself.  It's as if ancient Rome only lasted 30 years and still had the influence over Western culture it does.

       Yes how Pyramids are assumed to be tombs when not only is there no evidence that they ever served such purpose, but that there is no record anywhere of what we know as the egyptians depicting themselves building the pyramids. There is no record of them claiming to have built them. The entire timeline was formed around the "khufu" discovery and that was proven to be fake as it was written on the surface on the stone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The water erosion is undeniable evidence that the Sphinx is older than thought, it has to be at least 10,000 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Historians put their fingers in their ears and don't want to listen to the fact that our historical record is wrong. Our timeline is false, and truthfully built around the birth of a man that there is no hardcore proof ever existed. Yes it will shake society, but we will adapt. This history was recorded to be shared.

       Start questioning your sources, go to libgen and read a little more. It is like the only thing that people read here is popular science.
       <br/>
       Most books that i read about archeology did not present themselves as absolute truths. Here in brasil our graduation courses heavily focus on the actual building of knowledge not just experimentally but also in the construction of other
       <strong>
        possible
       </strong>
       narratives. Unfortunately there is a proliferation of colleges in which  all-in-one books are given to the student, which practically kills research initiative in the student.

       Not knowing the real truth about ancient times isn't quite as bad as not knowing the real truth about our more immediate history and not too distant past. History that still has an effect and that still shapes many of our ideas, beliefs and attitudes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the history of the American west, for instance. A history that's actually had a somewhat profound effect that has been constantly reinforced in countless books, movies, and TV,  and all of the so-called heroes, villains, and what went on with the American Indians that was all highly romanticised and fictionalized even at the time when it was reported in the eastern newspapers which most of that history is based on.

       That isn't really a conspiracy to me. Though at the sites themselves, they should have another plaque right next to the ones you read but fill them with questions that they don't know the answers to. What you're describing sounds like a function of our system and publishing. There is no real official wikipedia everyone works off of.

       This is a good post, and it's true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I study a lot of medieval history, British medieval history in particular, as a hobby.  Two of the most famous battles in British medieval history are The Battle of Hastings, which sealed the Norman Conquest of England, and The Battle of Bosworth Field, which ended the Wars of the Roses.  Both battlefields are historical landmarks in England today.  There are actually reenactments of the Battle of Bosworth Field done yearly on the site where it is said to have taken place.  The problem is, both sites are probably wrong.  Recent archeology (within the past 20 years) has discovered that the Battle of Hastings likely took place several hundred meters away from where the historic battlefield is and is underneath a roundabout today.  It's also taught that Harold Godwinson, King of the Anglo-Saxons, died at the battle after being shot in the eye with an arrow.  He may have been.  There is some evidence to support that theory.  However, it's not nearly as certain as many history books and documentary shows make it out to be.  There is other evidence which claims that he was killed by a thrown spear or javelin, yet other evidence that claims he was hacked up by four knights using swords, and other evidence that claims he died after being trampled by horses.  It's really not known how King Harold died, but the arrow through the eye is the best story, so that's the one that has been passed down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Battle of Bosworth Field almost certainly happened about two miles Southwest from where the historical site says it did.  It's under a farm today.  King Richard III, who lost and died at the battle, has been historically depicted, most famously by William Shakespeare, as being a shriveled and deformed hunchback.  This depiction went mostly unchallenged for several hundred years.  Later historians and scholars began to debate this idea though.  The victor of the battle, Henry Tudor, who became King Henry VII, a lot like Donald Trump today, had a habit of blaming everything wrong in his country on the previous administration, and many scholars argued that the depiction of Richard III was wrong, that he wasn't a deformed hunchback, that he was competely normal, and that the depiction was just a bit of propaganda by the Tudors to make him appear and seem more evil and sinful.  The debate wasn't settled until 2012, when Richard III's grave was discovered underneath a parking lot.  The truth is that Richard III had extreme scoliosis or curvature of the spine.  He wasn't a hunchback, but he wasn't completely normal either, and the historical depiction was more of an exaggeration than an invention.

       You do notice that the number of sources decreases the farther back you go. That's not surprising if you think about it, but we don't think often about it and the effects are what you describe. It's scary really how incomplete our understanding is.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.g take
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus">
        Josephus
       </a>
       , his name pops up all over ancient history and his word is rarely challenged. Our entire worldview is built on what happened in one small part of the world thousands of years ago, and a lot of it has only Josephus as a source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or what about
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Carter">
        Howard Carter
       </a>
       , he was dynamiting his way through Egypt's ancient history on excavation missions that were basically wholesale looting. We take his word on a lot of things too.

       How do you assume scientifically the nature of how some bones and ruins are found underground? There is no experiment to do there. You just look at things and compare them to already known (and just as assumed) things and make new assumptions. Nothing scientific there. Just applying of basic logic into very vague things.

       You are right, but it is a silly point to make. Of course, not only science, but everything in human experience apparently rests upon fundamental assumptions of causality, consistency in universal rules, etc. Without them the very concept of knowledge would seem ridiculous. No one but a few ontology philosophers spends too much time thinking about these things, they are indeed taken for granted because we would descend into madness if we had to doubt our reality every second of our existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the word assumption carries with it a lot of negative connotations for many people (i.e. that an assumption is a careless mistake), and the preferred word would instead be hypothesis (a proposal aware of its uncertain nature, with the intent to be systematically tested).
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem of archeology, anthropology and history is that they often present their assumptions as facts, rather than theories. The amount of unsubstantiated extrapolations and fanciful assumptions is astounding the further back you look. They are not "hard" sciences where most things can be experimentally tested and replicated with any consistency so we can have a sufficient degree of confidence on their reality. They're often making crazy stories of how a people must have lived, what they believed in, etc based on a few pottery fragments and eroded building foundations... passing them as facts instead of saying "we basically know nothing".
