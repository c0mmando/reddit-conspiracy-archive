Every single year since I have owned an iPhone, around the time the new model is set to be announced my phone starts acting fucky.  Sometimes it won&#39;t load emails correctly, sometimes it will crash randomly, and sometimes it will have battery issues.  Every single year, right after the new iPhone is released, all of that goes away.  I just had my phone charged to 100% and it went down to 1% within 3 hours of just sitting in my pocket.  I plugged it in and now it&#39;s back to 80% in two minutes.  The cycle has begun...</p>

<p>You can revert firmware updates <strong>if</strong> you have prior foresight to make full localized backups and regular intervals.</p>

<p>Unfortunately reverting to an old image, means you also lose any new information, contacts, settings, etc added after the image was taken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ICloud by default comes with a maximum of 5 Gigabytes of free storage space. If you need more you must buy it in advance. When backing up up to iCloud the chances of exceeding the 5gig limit are near 100%! Running out of storage space while doing a back will cause it to fail with NO ERROR MESSAGE! It just does not complete! To solve this, I purchased the minimum upgrade which is 100 gig at a reasonable price. I now do all of my backups and file saves to iCloud.</p>

The only thing I see fishy is the constant push from apple to update, although its still reversible if you have minimal knowledge of computers and expect it..   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rule of thumb... with any given iPhone, only upgrade to a new full version of iOS once. For instance, my iPhone 6 came with iOS 9 and I’m currently on iOS 10 and will not upgrade it to 11. My iPhone 8 came with iOS 11 installed and I will upgrade it to 12 and then stop. The Mac has a little more mileage as far as OS X upgrades. If you ever have to restore your iPhone, well then you’re screwed and will be forced to upgrade to the most current version of iOS that will run on your particular model of iPhone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve had the iPhone 6S+ for three years now, and I still love it. I had to get the battery replaced this year, but batteries wear down in everything you buy. It’s to be expected. Also, Apple is currently offering $30 battery replacements for this year only, so get it replaced and it’ll be good as new. Mine was. My old battery was at like 50% capacity when I had it replaced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you mean as far as software. I have an older iPhone and heard the new ones are worse about the batteries. Mine was doing this for a while and I was able to stop it by just letting it fully charge. Even after it reaches 100% leave it on for another hour. You have to treat your battery right as a lot of people don&#39;t get that partially charging them over and over will ruin your battery. </p>

<p>Number 3, I knew my phone refused to back up on iCloud so I would manually transfer things to my computer periodically but I did lose a lot of stuff I hadn’t yet transferred and all my texts, most of which were from my fiancé who had died several years prior. </p>

<p>It is NOT my fault thatno one can explain to me why I have never been able to back up my phone to iCloud. I’ve had iPhones for years and have never been able to do a successful backup. I can’t do more than go to multiple Apple stores and talk to the people who are supposedly experts and try to get an answer.</p>
