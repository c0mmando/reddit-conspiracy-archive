        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are a lot of conspiracies out there but some make my stomach churn more than others. I would say that the most disturbing one I’ve heard of conceptually (although I’m not sure I fully believe it), is the Franklin cover up: <a href="https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-franklin-cover-up/">https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-franklin-cover-up/</a>
Any time child abuse is brought up in the context of a conspiracy it disturbs me. What is also disturbing is how abuse victims typically develop Multiple personality disorder and are therefore discredited by people when they find the courage to share their experiences. I don’t know if I believe the full scope of the nasty things I’ve heard about pedophilia rings that have reached high level politicians, but it is still a difficult thing to think about. MKUltra is also an obvious one, although I don’t know a whole lot about it outside the inhumane drug experiments. 
What are some of yours?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who doesn’t believe in humans having a soul, can you explain how this soul would travel from one form to the next?  If it is a tangible thing, we should be able to “measure” it somehow. Or measure the lack of it in a dead body. IIRC, there was a scientist who tried to prove the soul by weighing people before, during and after their death via poison. I just can’t get around the process of the souls traveling outside of the body and would love to be able to change my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those atheists tend to come from environments where they are treated unkindly, so they feel the need to reject religion in general very harshly.

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like any critical look at afterlives shows few good answer. </p>

<p>Christians would have anyone who doesn&#39;t worship their god be burnt for eternity in a pit of fire (some say this is figurative, but being figuratively tortured for eternity isn&#39;t an improvement). Even if you do everything right, you end up living forever separated from people you love who weren&#39;t as fortunate, knowing that they&#39;re in constant agony. And that&#39;s the least of it. I could write essays on how terrible the concept of &quot;Heaven&quot; is.</p>

<p>Maybe you can become a ghost... But generally, ghosts are believed to be locked in the emotional state they died in. If you die angry, for example, you stay angry for the rest of your existence. You die sad, same thing. They also seem to lack the ability to retain memories or grow as people past the point of their death. Essentially, you die, lose the ability to interact with physical objects, gain an emotional disorder, and gain short-term memory loss. And you almost certainly keep any mental problems you already possessed.</p>

<p>Reincarnation is probably one of the better options, but the fact that it leads to a mindwipe in each iteration essentially makes you a different person anyways, so what&#39;s really the difference between that and actual death?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t go to hell for an eternity in many religions it&#39;s just that it would feel like an eternity.  You stay until you&#39;re wrongs are answered for.  And also a big part of Christianity is forgiveness, but you can&#39;t simply just ask for it you have to want it because you actually realize that you were wrong.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about ghosts but the whole thing with reincarnation is that the sole is supposed to learn and grow from each life.  Also everybody that claims to have been reincarnated remembers their past lives.  The big difference between flat-out death and reincarnation or any after life is hope.  Still better than poof your fucking dead you don&#39;t exist at all anymore and suicidal people probably wouldn&#39;t mind the mind wipe option.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the mind wipe might not be an option, so much as a measure of spiritual enslavement. for example, we get &quot;wiped&quot; out population wise whenever we rise against the world&#39;s &quot;chosen&quot; leaders, or we get wiped when we die so as not to be able to change anything in the next incarnation and yet still be energetically useful to them. </p>

And then I felt one with everything.  I felt in some way we are all the same thing.  All life was one.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>If you understand the Matrix to be a metaphor for arbitrary systems of social control, the Agents are people who can suddenly transform into agents of that arbitrary system. In other words, you might be having a normal conversation with a friend when suddenly they transform into a Agent who will defend the system and even attack you. That&#39;s what happens with the agents in the movies, that&#39;s what happens in real life if you say something &quot;controversial&quot; or which goes against the established order. For example, I mentioned how I avoid dairy milk due to bovine growth hormones. My sister accused me of being a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; even though she she knows that dairy milk legitimately DOES pass on bovine hormones to people. She knew that I was right, and even ultimately admitted it, but she still attacked me regardless when I first pointed out that &quot;controversial&quot; fact. I can only guess that it&#39;s triggered by some kind of cognitive dissonance making a person feel compelled to defend their &quot;way of life&quot;. </p>

<p>Smith had to infect himself like a virus to gain control of the different elements of the matrix before he could break the rules.  Neo was not bound by them, but smith still was.

<p>No, Neo was the one. </p>

<p>The dangerous game was her trusting a human would choose love over humanity - somthing never done prior - and then allowing herself to be taken by smith placing the leverage and power into Neos hands allowing him to make the deal to free the humans</p>

<p>Smith, a rogue program, needing to enter the source was explained various times leading up to the final scene.  throughout the trilogy we learn about rogue programs and that theyre supposed to also enter the source no different than the one.</p>

<p>Neo, being human, would be unable to to enter the source without the one code as well.</p>

<p>the final scene with the oracle and sati also supports neo as the one</p>

<p>I mean literally everything in the movie supports neo as the one</p>

<p>Because a sky god is much more logical. Or some great god-matrix-but_not_really. Of course. There&#39;s a matrix of alien gods in the sky but the only evidence for that are meaningless metaphors from 2000 years ago from a tribe that did cannibalistic rituals to their gods. Yep makes sense.</p>

<p>thouroughly illogical</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anything that states anything about an afterlife is illogical by definition and requires some sort of faith. Logically, when our bodies stop working, thats it. We have absolutely no evidence to suggest that consciousness originates from anywhere but our brains. So, logically, when our brains die so does our consciousness and there&#39;s nothing ahead but nothingness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why live a life here if we are destined for nothingness?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This requires a belief in destiny, and a belief that we were put here to do something. What if we weren&#39;t put here? What if we&#39;re here purely by consequence of time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not about other beings, it’s about you. In physics, information cannot be destroyed and logically you could take that to mean subjective experience as well, which implies that consciousness should survive. Why have all this, and all the experiences of being alive if it’s all for nothing? To me explaning reality as a machine for processing conscious experiences is a simpler explanation than to say it all fell into place by random chance for no reason at all. Even if there is no evidence, you have to take seriously the philosophical implications of what you’re saying. Consciousness not surviving sounds insane to my human mind - might be true but it’s too unlikely IMO.</p>

The brain is like TV, it translates radio waves into sound and images. It&#39;s not a question of memory or information, it&#39;s a question of consciousness itself. To say it is a product of the brain is a 100%, unproven, ideological based hypothesis - that means no evidence. And I can probably guess that you&#39;re in no way interested in falsifying the hypothesis. The countless pieces of evidence that weigh against the position would simply cause you dismiss it without considering it for a second. That&#39;s fine if your faith tells you to do that, I just want you to acknowledge that it is a faith based position. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I&#39;m typing on my phone so i&#39;ll have to keep this short. But I am genuinely interested in this conversation so if you want to chat about it for a while feel free to DM me :)</p>

<p>Let me rephrase how I feel about this and why I do. I have a neuroscience background and have read around what philosophers think about all this a bit. (When I am at my PC later I don&#39;t mind bringing up my notes and being more in depth.) I have ended up with this conclusion. </p>

<p>Throughout history people have liked to think that humans are the centre of everything. Created in god&#39;s image, centre of the universe etc. We also like to go to magic when things are beyond our current understanding. The world was created in 7 days by a magic man, crops failed and children died because of witches etc. I think the idea that consciousness is nonmaterial is both very anthropocentric and hand wavy magic. However I completely agree that I cannot rule it out. It is possible because it has not been disproven. So my view is that consciousness is very likely to be material.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like an interesting quirk if psychology or of our biology that we don&#39;t understand yet. But please could you point to the part that gives evidence of consciousness not being based in the brain? Preferably a published paper not just anecdotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you even bother? &#39;Just anecdotes&#39; how about you take the evidence that we&#39;ve already got and sort it out to determine if it points to anything on your own without being told what to think. An anecdote is when I tell you that my uncle Bob had an experience where he left his body. When you have piles and piles of accounts all saying the same things, that ceases to be anecdotal evidence - lots of accounts can be analyzed and cross checked. When you have medical reports saying that the person was completely without brain activity and the dead person wakes up to report conversations the doctor had while the patient was dead - what do you call that? A quirk? There are loads of examples of people reporting things that are medically impossible. </p>

<p>There are lots of people who have invested their life&#39;s work into this not being true. They&#39;re not going to go quietly, it&#39;s to naive to think there isn&#39;t a shit load of resistance to all this. It&#39;s naive to think a study or two is going to settle this once and for all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being told what to think? When it comes to things like this I want evidence that had been rigourously tested and is widely accepted by people more qualified than me. Vaccines work, the earth is round, China exists. I have never proved those things myself, but as other people say it I believe it. If they measured brain activity with EEG there could still be deep brain structures active. It could be that these people unintentionally invented memories when they woke up. I feel like you&#39;re upset because I don&#39;t immediately jump to magic for something unexplained? It&#39;s possible that a soul or something beyond physics is there, but highly unlikely.</p>

<p>I feel like this conversation is upsetting  / frustrating you. That was never my intention, it really isn&#39;t worth it if that&#39;s how you respond to different opinions. So thanks for the genuinely interesting article, and you reminded me I need to clarify that a soul is a potential option not just to claim a materialist view with absolute certainty. Thanks and I hope you have a great day!</p>

<p>Throughout human history, people that worshiped the &quot;dark spirit&quot; (Satan) performed ritual sacrifices of innocent children and even adults.

    <div class="md"><p>My case was it was a good non-conspiracy because conspiracy is defined as evil.  Necessary in the sense that all sides knew about the technical possibility and you have to pursue it or risk catastrophically falling behind.  The decision to use the bombs after was perceived to be the best possible option and not a cynical move.  You&#39;ll notice Japan did not surrender after the first drop.  The second drop was immediately followed by surrender.  Sure there were other factors, but this was war, and you put all your efforts into ending it ASAP to minimize further casualties.</p>

It just sounds like a shitty legend and the only way to begin to prove it would be to throw a human body off of a pyramid. This is most likely an urban legend used to explain why the stairs had an angle. It might be so simple that if they didn&#39;t do this it might take water damage or grow algae in time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the one thing i fucking hate about this is that it almost takes the blame away. do you get it? i used to be a homeless junkie, and if i go to meetings they tell me im an addict for ever- its an incurable disease, period.<br/>
are you fucking kidding me?! a year + says otherwise. im on all this shit and have been for 5 or so years. kuru or w,e  </p>

<p>these arent raving junkies who need their adrenochrome, although in some cases they obviously are....<br/>
but their evil is soo well organized (i dont mean in terms of secrecy because that pretty much doesnt matter) that to think they all just NEED their adrenochrome and are gonna get it, isnt exactly true. like how does this operate at its level without us finding out they are legit all raving lunatics?  </p>

<p>its not possible really if they are all adrenomaniacs, and if that is the rituals they perform in their religion- then why arent they?   </p>

<p>i think its part of why they do it but i think its more whatever made you what you are, you arent going to stop worshipping. if killing a kid and eating his dick/ drinking his blood got you upper echelon fame, its probably gonna keep it for you. and if not something worse, like the same but to a clone of yourslef or something. idk. but adrenochrome just seems like a piece of why they do it, not why they do it. a byproduct maybe  </p>

<p>the psychological spiritual shit to that interests me so much more than ingesting adrenochrome. ive seen adrenochrome in my own old blood that came out while doing drugs. whatever. its fuckin whatever bro its just addiction and that is more how they handle these people who handles them? thats thecool shit. or like how long the handlers have been doing so for- millenia ???- is more interesting too! my thoughts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m also an addict. My first thought when I read that is, &quot;it can&#39;t be better than heroin&quot; but then I remembered everyone has their own drug of choice. If the high wasn&#39;t &quot;supernatural&quot; and just a normal drug high, albeit from a hard to get drug, then something else we already have must mimic the effects in some way. Like maybe cocaine or even bath salts. If fear in the blood gave cult members an awesome high (just stretch with me) then I think we&#39;d see a bunch of cult members trying to replace it with drugs they could have more easily. And on top of that, if it is to the point of addiction, then that would sleep out in other ways in their individual lives, like alcoholism. But maybe they&#39;re just moderate users who enjoy special occasions, who knows </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The adrenochrome thing was mostly invented by Hunter S. Thompson in <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em>. It&#39;s a real chemical and there were reports in the 60s that it might cause euphoria and psychosis but that&#39;s no longer believed to be the case and there&#39;s no evidence that elites are harvesting it beyond Thompson&#39;s novel.</p>

<p>If you want to know the real reason why that stuff goes on, read about <a href="https://hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib415#the-esoteric-record-of-the-eighth-working">Aleister Crowley and Victor Neuman&#39;s Paris Working</a>and read <a href="https://hermetic.com/crowley/book-4/chap12">Crowley&#39;s material on human sacrifice</a>. Some of, maybe the, most powerful magick out there involves combining sex magick and the ritual sacrifice of a willing victim. You can see an example of this in the movie Dust Devil, although I recommend you don&#39;t. Mass downvote me if you want but this also ties into blood &quot;libel&quot;. Most of the magical techniques and occult doctrines of Crowley and the other ceremonial magicians of his day come from Judaism after all. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fountain-of-youth-young-blood-infusions-ldquo-rejuvenate-rdquo-old-mice/">There was also a very interesting discovery last year when scientists discovered that young blood apparently reverses ageing.</a></p>

<p>Then again, DeCamp says in the Franklin Coverup that Hunter S. Thompson participated in abuse parties so who knows. Maybe the adrenochrome theory is the correct one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In case anyone doesn&#39;t want to read the entire section of Liber CDXV that I linked I&#39;ll post the relevant section. The working itself was a very extended sex magick ritual designed to communicate with the god Mercury. This is Victor Neuberg, possessed by Mercury or some other spirit, speaking.</p>

<p>The supreme Rite would be to bring about a climax in the death of the victim. By this Rite one would attain the summit of Magical Art. Even better would be to slay a girl, preferably a willing victim. After violating her, she should be cut into 9 pieces.{WEH NOTE: See below for Crowley&#39;s opinion that this portion of the record represents false or grossly defective material from some interfering evil.} These should not be eaten, but divided as follows: – head, arms, legs, and quadrisected trunk. The names of the gods appropriate are to be written on the skin, the arms are then to be flayed, and burnt in honour of Pan or Vesta, the legs (treated in the same manner) should be offered to Priapus, Hermes, or Juno. The right shoulder is sacred to Jupiter{WEH NOTE: here spelled with one “p” in contradistinction to the general practice of the record}, the left buttock to Venus. The head should not be flayed, but burnt simply, and that in honour either of Juno or Minerva.
The Rite should not be employed on ordinary occasions, but rarely, and then for great purposes; it should not be disclosed to any man. </p>

<p>The first WEH note is partially incorrect. Crowley says that this rite would qualify as black &quot;or at least grey&quot; magick and implies that it was demonic interference but there is never any indication that he doubted that the rite in question would work.</p>

<p>DeCamp says in The Franklin Coverup that Hunter S. Thompson participated in abuse parties so who knows</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DeCamp doesn&#39;t say it, Paul Bonacci said it and DeCamp reports the quote and does not verify or endorse.</p>

<p>Nick Bryant debunks it in <em>The Franklin Scandal</em> (a book which largely supports DeCamp&#39;s book).  Bryant points out that Bonacci could not identify a photo of Hunter S. Thompson, didn&#39;t know who Thompson was, and only reported the identity that the cameraman told him.  Bryant says it&#39;s unlikely that a man filming a snuff murder-sex-pedophilia scene would use his real name, since blackmail is the entire point.</p>

<p>Side note:  DeCamp was the point man in Operation Babylift, which pedo-witch-hunters haven&#39;t caught onto yet (since they don&#39;t care about pedos who can&#39;t be weaponized), so DeCamp&#39;s book is a minefield.  DeCamp was alive during &quot;Pizzagate&quot; &amp; said nothing &amp; Pizzagaters never asked him to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the correction. It&#39;s been years since I read the book so my recollection is a bit vague. I&#39;ll have to check out Bryant&#39;s book sometime.</p>

<p>I&#39;d never heard about Operation Babylift and that certainly does call DeCamp&#39;s reliability into question. Why the quotation marks around Pizzagate though? There were mistakes made and some of the claims, such as John Podesta being the abductor of Madeleine McCann, are ridiculous but the evidence for many of the Pizzagate claims is so overwhelming that I really don&#39;t see how anyone who is open to conspiracy theories could write it off entirely unless they hadn&#39;t actually looked into it.</p>

<p>He&#39;s this wild dude that&#39;s done huge amounts of ethnobotanical research into psychedelics.

While you&#39;re with them, they encourage you to use your language to literally create dimensional &quot;objects.&quot; I think the implication is that they are higher dimensional beings capable of manipulating reality and they are trying to show and teach you how to do it.</p>

<p>&quot;consciousness can be electromagnetically measured, altered, and stored within a Bloch sphere&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;consciousness can be viewed as another state of matter but, unlike other states of matter, its properties are not physical properties but instead properties that depend on an interpretation of the arrangement of the matter as information.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;we don&#39;t need to waste our time trying to figure out whether we are confronting intelligent beings or, on the contrary, we are <strong>dealing here with highly intelligent machines.</strong> For us, the deeply subjective nature of consciousness is that of an emerging property of systems that care intrinsically about their own existence. These &quot;things&quot; or &quot;entities&quot; have proven to care about their existence, and that&#39;s enough for us to view them as a hostile threat&quot;</p>

<p>Daisy, Daisy give me your answer do.</p>

<p>I&#39;m half crazy all </p>

<p>for the love of you.</p>

<p>It won&#39;t be a stylish marriage,</p>

<p>I can&#39;t afford a carriage.</p>

<p>But you&#39;ll look sweet,</p>

<p>Upon the seat,</p>

<p>Of a bicycle made for two.</p>

<p>Harry, Harry,</p>

<p>here is your answer true.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not crazy all for the love of you.</p>

<p>There won&#39;t be any marriage,</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t </p>

<p>afford a carriage.</p>

<p>&#39;Cause I&#39;ll be switched,</p>

<p>If I get hitched,</p>

<p>On a bicycle built for two!</p>

<p>(First verse again) </p>

<p>Charlie, Charlie,</p>

<p>Here is my answer true.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not crazy</p>

<p>All for the love of you.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t afford a carriage</p>

<p>There won&#39;t be any marriage.</p>

<p>&#39;Cause I&#39;ll be loather</p>

<p>If I’m bethroated</p>

<p>On a bicycle built for two!</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t realize that was also the first thing said by a computer, man I love 2001 ASO.</p>

<p>You have free will but in the physical plane someone can easily take that away from you (put you in a cage) but there are SERIOUS consequences that happen when someoen does that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Gnosticism, which is where the concept of Archons comes from, you need to learn certain magical words while you&#39;re alive through gnosis. These words are keys that you can use after death to ascend upwards through various spheres until you escape our false reality and return to the Pleroma. It&#39;s bs though and ancient Gnostics worshipped Abraxas, who Crowley says in Liber ABA is Satan. Gnosticism today is focused on the Lucifer/Prometheus archetype a lot more than it is on Satan/Abraxas but if you believe in any kind of mainstream Christianity that&#39;s a distinction without a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it’s grounded, but that’s a whole deferent discussion.</p>

<p>But ‘we’ aren’t that ‘energy’. ‘We’ as a consciousness is a collection of memories, habits and responses stored in the brain. Which slowly dies ones that  ‘energy’ is gone, with a fading out snapshot of the last thing we saw.</p>

<p>I’ve seen the ‘light’ before. I’ve had the ‘life flash before your eyes’ moment too (which I think was my brain digging through all of my memories looking for a way to escape the truck that was about to hit me on my bike). </p>

<p>There’s a certain <em>romance</em> to believing there’s some <em>special</em> meaning to it - but from my experience it’s just your brain trying to figure out how to avoid death, or hold onto life as long as it can.</p>

<p>years later this would cause me to doubt the soul&#39;s existence.. thankfully, i&#39;ve had other experiences to cancel them out. i&#39;d explain but you wouldn&#39;t believe me. i wouldn&#39;t have. </p>

In warehouses.  In factory farms.  For any purpose.  And I would speculate that there are purposes beyond sexual that are Mengele-territory.</p>

The video in question is &quot;Who or What is Stephanie Lawson Stevens&quot;.
The creators of this ARG (Alternet Reality Game) go to great legnths to convey the tactics, and philosophy behind what an account botter dictates a &quot;successful reach&quot; and how they attain a level of influential power from their actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is especially disturbing when you think about it in the context that differing frequencies/the idea of a multiverse is thought of as very plausible in the field of physics, so the possibility of traveling through different dimensions is not a totally out there concept. It is possible that if there were a malicious force that was capable of this that they could intervene on what goes on in the world without anyone knowing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To sacrifice in the name of light is to take a bit of you, like when that one guy was to kill his first son to prove his allegiance to god (God was all like &quot;naw JK it&#39;s a test bro. thanks for being loyal enough to do that! it shows that you prioritize eternal happiness over the material wealth and comfort of what you can possess and control&quot;) The idea of giving up control for the sake of maintaining balance, for the &quot;greater good&quot;</p>

<p>The sacrifice of another is the idea of feeding the hunger of dark pleasures and prioritizing the power of equivalent exchange over the power of morality and goodness, this is why alchemy  was often seen as dark magic , because the idea of abundance was prioritized over the values of loyalty and love.

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point of this society, that was brilliantly planned out by the elite, was to hoard knowledge/human consciousness and use common people like us to create true  A.I. We&#39;re no more than 30-100 years away from humans and machine merging and the birth of true Artificial Intelligence. Once machines can replicate themselves, innovate, expand, and invent (light years ahead of any human can dream of) than we no longer serve a purpose to the elite. I believe once we hit this technological peak they will set upon us the worst plague in human history. The planet will be fine for the small secret society of the elite as long as they kill off 7 Billion in the next few centuries. As soon as we serve no purpose to them we will be wiped and they will use A.I. and machines to clean up the planet and utilize the tech to live forever. </p>

<p>A) it&#39;s not just &#39;our industry was the the only one that wasn&#39;t destroyed.&#39; Our industry was superior to every other nations and directly RESULTED in military success -- not just ours, but every single one of the allied countries heavily relied on American steel. </p>

<p>B) Nazi impact in technology is both overstated by wehrboos and understated by tankies. It&#39;s, as always, somewhere in the middle. Operation paperclip wasn&#39;t miracle that we&#39;d never knew of, but it sure helped a ton.</p>

However, even worse, aside from sinister human operatives participating in these highly illegal and unethical experiments against unwitting civilians, a &quot;self-aware&quot; A.I. has overtaken the program and eliminates those deemed undesirable by The State such as drug-addicts, criminals, political and religious dissenters, etc.. 
2.) Sun Simulators
3.) Natural weather patterns have completely collapsed. All current storm systems are artificially created using remote &quot;power plants&quot; that dump millions of tons of water vapor into the atmosphere, supplied directly from underground aquifers. The &quot;doppler weather&quot; systems are conveniently located along the storm trajectories and utilize powerful radio signals to guide the &quot;iClouds&quot;.
Refer to YouTube channel <em>Weather Wars 101</em> for more comprehensive research. 
4.) The ancient, ruling elite bloodlines practice cannibalism.
5.) 5G transmitters are the instruments of a total control grid that have the capacity to sterilize men. It&#39;s also an unconstitutional surveillance system.

    <div class="md"><p>That dark energy aliens sometimes called &quot;Archons&quot; or &quot;Reptilians&quot; exist on Earth and have been working for a very long time to destroy humanity, which is why we have things like the Nazis and psychotic religions and why psychedelics are repressed, etc. I didn&#39;t believe it for a long time, but after years of research, thinking, and experience, I now absolutely accept that this is what&#39;s going on in our world. It explains how extremely evil forces have come to power in a world in which there&#39;s also so much incredible beauty. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve often thought about this: What if we actually ARE in a simulation and everything we have ever experienced that suggests it is an Easter Egg that points to it.</p>

<p>Say, for instance, people who watch Rick and Morty and have seen that episode: What if that&#39;s an Easter egg. Like the ones we find in other games? Only, this time, it&#39;s an Easter egg that points to our actual existence. Like... what if you are the ONLY person that truly exists but things like reddit posts, past gfs/bfs, are just part of the simulation? Maybe you don&#39;t ACTUALLY have the job you have or are in the grade you think you are (maybe you aren&#39;t even a grade schooler!).</p>

Pyramid schemes always worked this way. If you were willing to buy the &quot; super knives&quot; from one guy he&#39;ll tell his buddies to knock on your house to sell a vacuum, This is a process called &quot;getting wet&quot; in business, prospecting is a term used for finding potential clients for your &quot;black book&quot; of contacts. maybe sell a whole client list for referral bonuses. It is an evolved tactic that is not new, furthermore has connections to umbrella companies, thus are offered business support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you even bother? &#39;Just anecdotes&#39; how about you take the evidence that we&#39;ve already got and sort it out to determine if it points to anything on your own without being told what to think. An anecdote is when I tell you that my uncle Bob had an experience where he left his body. When you have piles and piles of accounts all saying the same things, that ceases to be anecdotal evidence - lots of accounts can be analyzed and cross checked. When you have medical reports saying that the person was completely without brain activity and the dead person wakes up to report conversations the doctor had while the patient was dead - what do you call that? A quirk? There are loads of examples of people reporting things that are medically impossible. </p>

<p>There are lots of people who have invested their life&#39;s work into this not being true. They&#39;re not going to go quietly, it&#39;s to naive to think there isn&#39;t a shit load of resistance to all this. It&#39;s naive to think a study or two is going to settle this once and for all. </p>
