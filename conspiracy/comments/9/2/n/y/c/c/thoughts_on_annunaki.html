        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi all; I&#39;ve been wondering to myself lately whether or not there is legitimacy to the Annunaki claims made by Zecheriah  Sitchin. I&#39;ve been trying to get through the 12th planet but haven&#39;t get because often times I feel it delves into gibberish. I have always been curious about this topic but unable to get really reliable information. What do you all think of this idea? I&#39;m conflicted, but kind of leaning towards the hoax camp. I think it&#39;s definitely possible that there was some kind of extra terrestrial contact in the ancient times, but I don&#39;t think its true to the extent certain people would like you to believe. </p>

<p>On the contrary:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a (good) chance Aliens don&#39;t exist, and the whole Sumerian/sitchin annunaki theory can be interpreted by changing the term <em>aliens</em> (as in: &quot;from another planet&quot; to <em>fallen angels</em> as  in: also from this world).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao, you dont know much about the annukai do you. If you really look into the old storys there were multiple gods, mainly a royal family line of this race, they couldnt all agree on what do do with us, so as the story goes they used their own dna to seed the different races we see on earth and they each had their own humans they were responsible for. Some of them were nice, some of them were not so nice, apparently these beings were cannibals, and some of them enjoyed human flesh, as well as other sins of the flesh, (the nephilim anyone). Why do you think virgins and babys were sacrificed, i imagine they are much tastier than your average 40 year old tough ass piece of meat. Other aliens were quite nice and seen humankind as children, and not slaves, but most of them didnt like this idea. It makes you wonder about the bible and the war between good and evil, maybe a war between these siblings did exist and to us peons it would have been devastating watching gods fight each other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My intuition sides with the David Wilcock, Corey Goode type explanations.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s likely genetic engineering within the human genome.  I think it&#39;s highly likely that aliens came to Earth at times in the past and posed as gods with a little G.  I doubt that the annunaki or draco were the ones that created our genome.  I think the bulk of our genome came from a more advanced race, but the &quot;evil&quot; aliens are allowed to mess with us but only within certain parameters kind of like adults allowing horseplay between kids of different ages, but only if it doesn&#39;t cross the line.  I think the annunaki and draco are only slightly further than us in terms of advancement, but I think they&#39;ve been stagnated there for a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like people remain pretty divided on this issue. I lean towards the idea that there is definitely a “non human” element at play although I don’t fully buy the annunaki narrative. If the annunaki genetically engineered us, they would have had to come from somewhere, so at some point a kind of evolution occurred. I hypothesized that the annunaki were possibly a result of interbreeding? with different animal species (think of how people described them as reptile, fish or bird “people”), and were simply years ahead of us technologically. But another part of me thinks it’s merely science fiction and that such entities are the product of people with wild imaginations. If such beings did exist, couldn’t one of the elite have snapped a picture of them and put it online at some point? I’ve personally not seen evidence for them in my lifetime, only theories in what I’ve read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only argument I can think to that is that mining gold is only part of our usefulness. In the beginning we would obviously be incredibly inefficient but we&#39;ve since made machines to aid us in mining and humans can do all sorts of other novel tasks a robot wouldn&#39;t be able to. Maybe there&#39;s some benefit in having biological machines as opposed to nuts and bolts machines. Just spitballing here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe their depictions of the bark &quot;boat&quot; which carried them between places is shaped like a vortex or worm hole for a reason.  Also their most prominent finely detailed and precision stone carvings depict the giants reaching out at eye level to punch a pinecone.   They chose very specifically what was most important to document to put that much effort into carving.  I believe that they are referring to internal dimensions and contact through the third eye,  pineal gland.</p>
