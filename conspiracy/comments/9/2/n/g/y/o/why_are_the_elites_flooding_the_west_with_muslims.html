        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Serious question.  Politicians in the UK claimed it was about getting votes, but they could have just opened the flood gates to Brazilians, Columbians, Indians, Thais, Cambodians etc.  All are from compatible cultures and would assimilate in next to no time.  So that is obviously a lie.</p>

<p>We know our governments will never act in our interests, nor do it for altruistic reasons.  Only a tiny minority of Islamic immigrants even claim asylum, less than 1% are refugees.  So it&#39;s not about obligations to take in refugees or about giving a better life to the immigrants.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s also extremely unlikely to cause real civil unrest because there is still food on the shelves and most people are too busy at work to pop out for a riot in the evening.</p>

<p>The only thing I can come up with is they are used as a way to easily bump up the population, increase demand for goods and services, pay tax - all so the boomers get their pensions.  Every other angle leads nowhere.</p>

<p>Is the destruction of the west really being done just so the scum boomers can get their pensions?  Please point me in another direction.  There must be a more sensible endgame.</p>

<p>SOS Clinton and Obama destabilized and targeted Lybia in order to flood europe with refugees.  I feel the main reason is to continue a war with the Muslim world, vs. the zionist /christian world for the MIC and mainly for Israel.  The long term goal is the greater israel project, so Muslims will always be used as the enemy when really the enemy are the Israelis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it is altruistic but not for the obvious reasons. I think that at some point, oil production will not support the middle eastern countries that have very little other natural resources. This will cause mass destabilization. The rest of the world needs to be used to successfully living with such different cultures. The people in these areas will need to be productively relocated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The oil companies are nearly all foreign owned anyway.  The average person in the middle east doesnt benefit from oil either.  Oil is another one percenter game.  Also, if it is altruistic youd just shoot the leaders of those nations, install puppet leaders, build factories there, develop internal markets for goods and services, provide education for them and improve those nations. </p>

<p>It makes no sense to remove a chunk of their populations and plonk them in the west. The people who are left behind will fuck like rabbits and increase the birth rates in their homelands and you&#39;ll be back to square one again.  Poor people breed, rich people dont. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol the destruction of the West. </p>

<p>The UK population of Muslims is what.. 7-8%? 50%+ of which are Bangladeshi and Pakistani. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no flood of pro jihadi Syrians or Iraqis like this sort of fear mongering leads to believe. Most of the Muslims that you see today are British and had family here for over a century. </p>

<p>The first mass migration was 1869. This is about 30 seconds of google. </p>

<p>For the other part as to why there is so many seeking a safe haven now? Well, if my country was constantly bombed and used as a damn proxy war battlefield I would want to move too. </p>

<p>The easiest way to make us desensitized to the shit our government does is to make them into the enemy. No empathy for terrorists, so why give a fuck when we bomb them eh? </p>

<p>Just think of the poverty in the West vs the money spent on war, creating even more in the east. It&#39;s a vicious cycle and we are all blaming each other like dumb fucks. </p>

<p>Well played 1%, well played. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well somewhere like london has a 12 percent muslim pop in 2011 so i would guess that its much higher now. The problem is that they do not integrate at all. They tend to break off into their own muslim exclusive neighborhoods. Their religion constantly talks about how evil the west is so why do they come here. I get that the middle east sucks and is bombed to shit because of western imperialist wars but why come here if you hate the culture so badly and dont even want to be part of it. The middle east is fucked because of western wars but also because their religion is really backwards and doesnt promote progress at all and never will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Islam talks about how evil the West is? But....I mean....if you think about it....we bomb the fuck out of them relentlessly. That is pretty fucking evil, don’t you think? Look at the drone strike data alone. You’ve got to educate yourself before you speak, young man. Don’t be ignorant. The Quran doesn’t talk about how evil the West is. And before you do it, I’ll do it for you. In the Quran, chapter 9 (before you take it out of context) read the entire chapter; don’t pick and choose verses for confirmation bias. If you want to read about hatred, read the Talmud. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you mean.  Islam&#39;s history in Britain goes back a very very long time and Muslims have been at Cambridge and Oxford university since they opened.   </p>

<p>The new wave of immigrants arent coming from the war torn areas though.  Also,  most Muslims (Pakistani,  Bangladeshi, Gujarati) are now most likely to be refused any kind of visa to the UK.  Thousands of those Asian Muslims are leaving each year to marry. Their wives are refused visas.  They are being replaced by African Muslims. </p>

<p>I also dont have a problem with Islam, I&#39;m not anti Islam in any way.  I just scratch my head as to why the hell western leaders want to turn the west Islamic.  Which will happen!  Islam is the fastest growing religion across the whole of the west, and the rate of conversion (reversion) is growing exponentially.  This rules out the greater Israel theory.  If the west becomes Islamic, the Jews can kiss their asses goodbye. </p>

<p>Look at the stats yourself, if current trends continue Britain will be majority Muslim in just 20 years (birth rates plus growth in religious conversion).  </p>

<p>People keep saying Britain will become like Brazil. It wont!  Brazil is made up of a mix of almost exclusively christian people&#39;s from all over the world and remains a staunch Catholic country.  </p>

<p>Again. Why Islam?  There must be a logical endgame.  Add not greater Israel to the list of impossible endgames.</p>

<p>They want the local white westerners replaces by migrants so they can steal elections for the forseeable future. That’s why democrats in the states are so pro illegal immigration and against voter id. The more illegals/migrants, the more votes they get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I might be a bit controversial here but I disagree with your premise that Indians, Colombians, etc can “easily” assimilate to the West. I’m actually Colombian by birth but am an American citizen (thank God). I also live in S. FL and I see how Hispanics refuse to assimilate here and come for the benefits of the state and not to truly contribute. They refuse to learn English (my mom for example, my dad speaks fluently, with an accent obviously, but perfectly fluid). They refuse to adopt the culture and economic values that made this country as prosperous as it is. So, I believe that if you aren’t willing to adopt American values you need to go home. </p>

<p>Plus, Indians have a high degree of inbreeding and a serious rape culture (a real one, nothing these “feminists” complain about here) so no, I definitely don’t think assimilation is “easy.” Only European whites easily assimilate, and everyone else has a hard time or never at all. So I think we should severely limit all immigration unless it comes from Europe or East Asian countries like South Korea or Japan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll be hard pushed to find non assimilated third generation Columbian, Mexican, Brazilian Americans. Theyll all call themselves American.  </p>

<p>There always comes a generation that takes a look at their parents and decides that life isnt for them, so they work hard at school, get the grades, go to college then land the good job and forever leave the ghetto.  If this doesn&#39;t happen with the second gen, it&#39;ll hit the third.  A 50 year wait is not long in the scheme of things.  Don&#39;t forget, there are a pile of Spanish Americans who went after WW2 and today many cant speak Spanish.  They&#39;re called Americans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet they vote consistently for big government policies... policies that have ruined their countries of origin. Statistically even 3rd generation Hispanics will vote overwhelmingly for Leftists. So eventually, by the way things are going we are going to turn into Mexico or Honduras with people voting for even larger governments. These are not representative of the economical and political values that made America great and prosperous. </p>

<p>Every Hispanic I know, and I’m talking about people whose grandparents came here, all want socialized medicine. So my reaction is “Seriously, why are you trying to make America the place your people and my people fled from?” </p>

<p>Plus even if what you do say is true, and I doubt it considering there are people on 3rd generation welfare, we don’t have 75 years to hope people assimilate. I mean the Democrats are trying to legalize all the illegals to secure their voting base, that would guarantee we become a one party country.</p>

<p>No thanks. Again, adopt the values of small government and individual freedoms or you have to go home. And I say that as an immigrant who considers herself assimilated. I will be giving up my foreign citizenship up as soon as I get the chance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a possibility i guess. Bring over Muslims, the first wave keep their traditions but their children receive a western education and question a lot of the obvious bullshit in their religion.  This weakens that religion.  Thelema is presented as the truth (it also has a rock solid qaballah attached with cipher 6 - which even works with the Qur&#39;an).  </p>

<p>My problem with this is that thelema requires a more intelligent populace as the number systems and counting well are difficult for non maths heads to work with.  It tends to be computer programmers that really get into it.   Almost all thelemites ive met work in senior IT roles.</p>

<p>A possible reason though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not about Muslims, its just about uneducated people with a incompatible culture. Anyone who fits this criteria is &quot;welcome&quot;.</p>

<p>The problem is that it is the mother of all shortterm thinking. European Population is aging. Crime was going down, and wages where going up.</p>

<p>Europe has a huge problem concerning Contracting Agencies and companies, a very popular way to circumvent pesky laborlaws and keep workers at minimum wage. But that kind of system is very unpopular and only really works when there is high unemployment. Unemployment has been going down steadily and thus workers do actually have a choice now.</p>

<p>Workers with a choice is something where the CEOs and Politians just get a temper tantrum from. Workers with choice means they can and will push for higher wages. A higher wage means that they dont just survive, they live.</p>

<p>People who are alive are very difficult to control, because they are not afraid. They can afford to skip a day of work and join a rally. They can afford to pay back a loan and end a cycle of perpetual debt. </p>

<p>On the contrary people who live in poverty are incredibly easy to control. They dont care if a company is polluting the enviroment, they dont care if a politician is corrupt because poverty goes often hand in hand with education of their children. Poor people need loans to stay alive, you work to pay your car, you need your car to go to work. Politicians can influence people who are fighting to survive much easier.</p>

<p>Everybody who is in control, everybody who is a major influencer wins in this arrangement. Politicians can be busy enriching themselves because the populance is too busy to organize themselves. Companies can continue to lower wages or increase costs. High poverty also means more crime, which helps to pass more survailiance laws and keep the Population in their place (as slaves to the elite).</p>

<p>But what if there arent enough people? (or there is so much growth that you need more workers)What if some companies have such trouble finding workers they offer to pay more then another? Well then you have contemporary china.</p>

<p>The system of control crumbles. with the afromentioned effects. The corruptors, Traitors and slavedrivers are exposed and will over the longterm have to worry that their wealth wont survive a 3rd generation. People organize and vote out established corrupt parties and officials.</p>

<p>The solution!</p>

<p>Immigrants, People who will take any job, at any rate. Keep wages low, and unemployment high. They push up crime and keep the population in a state of chaos. </p>

<p>The old system works again. I am an immigrant myself (legal, white-collar). I came to my host country so i can have a better live. Its a normal reaction that people may take.</p>

<p>The 2015 refugee crisis was a godsend for established politicians and industrial folks. In one fellow swoop they eliminated a big threat to their Parasitic existence. </p>
