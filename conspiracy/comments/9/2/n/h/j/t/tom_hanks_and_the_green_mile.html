       After hearing about Tom Hanks being a pedo, I was floored with the recollection of plot of The Green Mile. A pedo gets a job for a farming family, kills 2 little girls, a black man gets the blame. Isn't that what a pedo would love to see? I mean it's beyond fucked up when you put this all together. They are showing us what they do to our faces, and we were too asleep not to get it. All I can think of now after figuring this out is now I must consider all of the plots to all the other Hanks movies. They will spell out things we have not uncovered yet. And here's the kicker. The actor that played John Coffee, Michael Clarke Duncan died from a heart attack. Really? I suspect there's alot more to this than meets the üëÅ.

       Your a complete idiot. Tom hanks was just an actor in that film, for your theory to make any sense the writers, producers, directors and all those in the company that funded the making of the film would all have to be peado's that for some reason want to hint to their activities?

       Because that's how twisted minds work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Create film to hint (well, more of a smack in the face)at what is done in your secret club, make a point that they have power, laugh at us for spending FUCKING BILLIONS to go see every film they create.
      </p>
      <p>
       We eat up this shit as much as they eat babies. 
We fucking love it. 
All films now are sick and twisted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even kids films push alot of adult content. 
Oh, same comparison by the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       A child doesn't know a dick joke in their favourite film, but the adults have a slight giggle while taking the kids to the cinema.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't know a inside joke created by the film producer etc.. But they laugh so hard because you pay to go see it regardless.

       What the fuck? I haven't covered for anyone I've said you're lacking evidence to back up you malicious accusations, you also make horribly tenuous links, you lack the ability to think logically. Are you American by any chance? That could explain a lot, not sure what being English has to do with peado's?

       Its easy to find ediots to carry out an agenda. We see agendas pushed in all of the big blockbuster films today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Narcissistic people are drawn to Hollywood, seeking fame and fortune. They are easy to control and blackmail.
      </p>
      <p>
       The jews run hollywood. The news is out about how Weinstein exploited countless woman and men. That is just the tip of the iceberg in Hollywood.

       Since when was Tom Hanks a pedo? Is there any evidence for this other than someone posting "Tom Hanks is a pedo" on a social media site one time?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm by no means suggesting that there aren't pedos out there, there obviously is. I just missed the part where Tom Hanks is 100% a pedo, no potentially, but rather he definitely is one. Anyone got any links? Anything to back this up? (I will actually look btw.)

       But if you try to link that to he initial point if his thread it falls down. Hanks is the child, how does that point to him being a peado? Surely in that situation the woman is the peado and hanks the victim? Its all so tenuous

       I'm not defending anyone, I'm saying hanks isn't a writer, he's an actor, he gets told what to do and say, he isn't taunting you with his work, as he has very little control over what work he produced, especially in the early days when he was making films like big. Just think of all the people that were involved in selecting him for that role, there is no way all of them colluded to select a peado that they could taunt the audience with, do you think part way thru this interview/audition they ask if he's interested in sex with minors? And if they did, it was missed by almost everyone so how is that taunting anyone? Non of his makes sense.

       I've loved some of his books, too. He's a very good populist writer. 11/22/63 was phenomenal entertainment. But now, in hindsight, it looks like another pop culture attempt to cover up the inside job.

       All dealt with transgressive material and all produced iconic works. At some point you have to separate the artist from the art, or if taboo subject matter isn't allowed to be broached at all, go get your torch ready for a book burnin', and if you feel that way, go fly a kite.

       I've read BEE, Palahniuk, Nabokov, Miller, Nin. I only liked Nabokov and Miller was okay. I would say those two are literature, with Palahniuk on the borderline. I'd say no, but can understand why others might not.

       None of the best stuff above is on the same level with the transgressive mean-spirited and ugly cheap humor that were talking about here with Roiland and Harmon's most debased "jokes." Not close to the same thing.

       also produced beautifully-executed transgressive material, which are not elevated in the same way. Worse, these works are actively suppressed and ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way to put it - do you think Zola‚Äôs success and fame can really be separated from the Dreyfuss affair, and the political interests it represented? Do you think his mediocre writing would have otherwise brought him such recognition?

       Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not disagreeing with the substance of your argument; I‚Äôm merely adding nuance to it. There is transgression and transgression; sometimes it fits better than others.

       De Sade's works were and continue to be incredibly influential. No one is saying that he wasn't a deviant because he most definitely was. But to discredit his works and say that he's only famous because of other deviants is a discredit to his work. There are plenty of literary scholars who will list De Sade's works as classics.

       Still no response to any of my points. You're clearly a  troll nobody can be this thick. You generate hate because nobody ever loved you. Enjoy being lonely you sad little prick.

       Ahahaha ooohh here comes a spooky shill. I had an account up until a year ago, my user name was RawdawgAssassin. I didn't see a point in participating in conversation due to the constant arguing, partisanship, and religiousity PLAGUING this subreddit. I lurked until I realized I could just back and insult lying morons like you. This sub is fucking ruined so why not have a little fun shittalking some fucking fools like you?

       Not sure if this was mentioned already. The movie BIG contains a young teen boy,13 maybe?, hooking up with a late 30's woman. I'm not saying this is part of a certain narrative, but the examples are out there. Regardless of the TH accusation I do believe there is a huge problem in Hollywood and Dc and a little bit lesser of one elsewhere globally 1 in __ kids are sexually abused before 16. Pick a number to fill the blank then divide it into 7 Billion. that is the scope.

       Are you better off than your parents were at your age? Can you afford to seek healthcare without incurring a depressing level of debt?  Can you afford retirement when you reach that age?  Why is that every generation previous was able to do better that the ones before it, but the last two generations are sliding backwards?  Who stands to profit?
