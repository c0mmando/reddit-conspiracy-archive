        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After hearing about Tom Hanks being a pedo, I was floored with the recollection of plot of The Green Mile. A pedo gets a job for a farming family, kills 2 little girls, a black man gets the blame. Isn&#39;t that what a pedo would love to see? I mean it&#39;s beyond fucked up when you put this all together. They are showing us what they do to our faces, and we were too asleep not to get it. All I can think of now after figuring this out is now I must consider all of the plots to all the other Hanks movies. They will spell out things we have not uncovered yet. And here&#39;s the kicker. The actor that played John Coffee, Michael Clarke Duncan died from a heart attack. Really? I suspect there&#39;s alot more to this than meets the üëÅ.</p>

Tom hanks was just an actor in that film, for your theory to make any sense the writers, producers, directors and all those in the company that funded the making of the film would all have to be peado&#39;s that for some reason want to hint to their activities?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that&#39;s how twisted minds work. </p>

<p>Create film to hint (well, more of a smack in the face)at what is done in your secret club, make a point that they have power, laugh at us for spending FUCKING BILLIONS to go see every film they create. </p>

<p>We eat up this shit as much as they eat babies. 
We fucking love it. 
All films now are sick and twisted. </p>

<p>Even kids films push alot of adult content. 
Oh, same comparison by the way. </p>

<p>A child doesn&#39;t know a dick joke in their favourite film, but the adults have a slight giggle while taking the kids to the cinema. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t know a inside joke created by the film producer etc.. But they laugh so hard because you pay to go see it regardless. </p>

<p>Why would they portray him as the victim? </p>

<p>To put it in plain sight and laugh at you while they piss away your hard earned money you spent to go see that shit? </p>

<p>If your going to defend him, then I&#39;m not really interest. I&#39;m exploring facts and finding connections. </p>

<p>I have no bias. 
I loved some of his films. </p>

<p>But he owes me nothing. I owe him nothing. </p>

<p>I am able to detach and look at all aspects. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just researching. I suggest you do a bit yourself as many of your questions will be answered. </p>

<p>If not, make a post and ask questions. 
This is a discussion board.. :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not defending anyone, I&#39;m saying hanks isn&#39;t a writer, he&#39;s an actor, he gets told what to do and say, he isn&#39;t taunting you with his work, as he has very little control over what work he produced, especially in the early days when he was making films like big. Just think of all the people that were involved in selecting him for that role, there is no way all of them colluded to select a peado that they could taunt the audience with, do you think part way thru this interview/audition they ask if he&#39;s interested in sex with minors? And if they did, it was missed by almost everyone so how is that taunting anyone? Non of his makes sense. </p>

<p>Jean Genet. Henry Miller. Anis Nin. William Burroughs. Pierre Guyotat. Dennis Cooper. Brett Easton Ellis. Chuck Palahniuk. Michel Houellebecq. Vladimir Nabokov. The list goes on and on and on.</p>

<p>All dealt with transgressive material and all produced iconic works. At some point you have to separate the artist from the art, or if taboo subject matter isn&#39;t allowed to be broached at all, go get your torch ready for a book burnin&#39;, and if you feel that way, go fly a kite.</p>

Worse, these works are actively suppressed and ignored.</p>

<p>Another way to put it - do you think Zola‚Äôs success and fame can really be separated from the Dreyfuss affair, and the political interests it represented? Do you think his mediocre writing would have otherwise brought him such recognition?</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not disagreeing with the substance of your argument; I‚Äôm merely adding nuance to it. There is transgression and transgression; sometimes it fits better than others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>De Sade&#39;s works were and continue to be incredibly influential. No one is saying that he wasn&#39;t a deviant because he most definitely was. But to discredit his works and say that he&#39;s only famous because of other deviants is a discredit to his work. There are plenty of literary scholars who will list De Sade&#39;s works as classics.</p>

<p>I know thats hard to accept but its the only way the anti pedo movment gets legs with balance;  go to hard scare away all pedos and turn them into victims of a witchhunt at the same time. Go to lighy and they continue to operate under protection of grater powers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if this was mentioned already. The movie BIG contains a young teen boy,13 maybe?, hooking up with a late 30&#39;s woman. I&#39;m not saying this is part of a certain narrative, but the examples are out there. Regardless of the TH accusation I do believe there is a huge problem in Hollywood and Dc and a little bit lesser of one elsewhere globally 1 in __ kids are sexually abused before 16. Pick a number to fill the blank then divide it into 7 Billion. that is the scope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you wasting brain cells on this bullshit when there are actually real conspiracies happening on global level? </p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious that you (and other OPs posting about random celeb is a pedophile or lizard person or whatever) is a distraction from the shit happening around us out in the fucking open.  But don&#39;t believe your lying eyes, right?</p>

<p>Are you better off than your parents were at your age? Can you afford to seek healthcare without incurring a depressing level of debt?  Can you afford retirement when you reach that age?  Why is that every generation previous was able to do better that the ones before it, but the last two generations are sliding backwards?  Who stands to profit?</p>
