    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps, however I think more important was the escape of his 2nd-in-command, Reichslieter Martin Bormann who facilitated the continuation of 750 German armament, industrial and chemical conglomerates in the post war era.  </p>

<p>&quot;Anticipating the defeat of the Third Reich, Reichsleiter Martin Bormann set up 750 corporations in neutral countries, primed as vehicles to receive the liquid wealth of Germany in addition to patents and other proprietary industrial information. An organizational genius and the real power behind Hitler, Bormann, known as the &quot;Brown Eminence&quot;, successfully fled Europe for South America and administered a &quot;Reich in Exile&quot; in the years following the war. With remnants of the SS as an enforcement arm, former Gestapo chief General Heinrich Mueller as security director, the 750 corporations as a base of economic power and the willing silence and cooperation of the Western Allies, Bormann guided his organization to a position of consummate power. One banker quoted by Manning termed the Bormann Organization, the &quot;world&#39;s most important accumulation of money power under one control in history&quot;. Controlling Germany&#39;s major corporations, the Federal Republic itself and much of Latin America, the Bormann Organization also maintained a formidable circle of influence in the United States.&quot; </p>

<p>[Paul Manning&#39;s book on Bormann which argues he died in &#39;45]<a href="http://spitfirelist.com/books/martin-bormann-nazi-in-exile/">http://spitfirelist.com/books/martin-bormann-nazi-in-exile/</a>) however other <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/cr/0340162414/ref=mw_dp_cr">researchers have argued he did escape</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bormann at no point ever was the 2nd-in-command. </p>

<p>Göring held that place for years. He shortly was replaced by Himmler and then by Goebbels who governed the german reich for a few hours before commiting suicide.</p>

<p>After the suicide Johann Ludwig Graf Schwerin von Krosigk (the grandfather of german alt right leader Beatrix von Storch) as Reichskanzler (the governer) and the highest ranked Admiral Dönitz took over as president. </p>

<p>At NO point in time Bormann was the successor of german neither in official rank nor inheritance. </p>

<p>All the 3 Military Leaders (Göring - Luftwaffe, Keitel - Wehrmacht and Dönitz - Marine) and every minister (Ribbentrop, Goebbels, Krosig, Speer, Himmler and some more where infront of him.)</p>

<p>Though ofc as he was the Chief of Hitlers staff he had a lot of influence over Hitler.</p>

<p>Also to be noted that Bormann killed himself shortly after Hitlers death. </p>

<p>Most theories of him escaping existed bc his body wasnt found until 1972. From there it was clear that it was actually Bormann. </p>

<p>The teeth, the bones, the way of death (prussic Acid), the cloth made it pretty obvious.</p>

<p>In 1998 the identity was confirmed by a DNA test. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think more interesting and poignant than this is the fact that Hitler himself knew and anticipated the end of the third Reich. He had a lot of his best philosophical, sociological and scientific minds on it during the war. </p>

<p>The fact that there was planning for a fourth is very telling. I have heard these plans resemble post war European union in some aspects. I don&#39;t know personally how to go about tracking down or accessing any primary material about this but I&#39;m confident it exists. </p>

<p>The question it raises to me is at what point did it become obvious, how was it accepted and what did they plan for... I guess that, if it is true about the level of support in German industry circles, that Daimler benz and more would have been coercing events after the war.</p>

<p>Bormann may well have been acting on orders decided well before the end of the fight.</p>

<p>“CIMELODY-3 [a code name] was contacted on 29 September 1955 by a trusted friend who served under his command in Europe and who is presently residing in Maracaibo,” the acting intelligence chief in Caracas, Venezuela sent to his supervisor days later, on October 3, 1955. “CIMELODY-3&#39;s friend stated that during the latter part of September 1955, Phillip CITROEN, former German SS trooper, stated to him confidentially that Adolph HITLER is still alive.&quot; It continued, “CITROEN commented that inasmuch as ten years have passed since the end of World War II, the Allies could no longer prosecute HITLER as a criminal of war.”</p>

<p>the whole idea of him committing suicide was from the german soldiers. There is NOT A SINGLE SHRED of evidence proving he committed suicide. The FBI were creating sketches of Hitler without his mustache because they believed he may have escaped to New York City.</p>
