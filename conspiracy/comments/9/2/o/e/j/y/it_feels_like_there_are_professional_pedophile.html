<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious to see this is a coordinated effort. These people don&#39;t care about being banned, nor will they be for political reasons, but somehow you are now able to call other users or imply that they themselves are a pedophile or &quot;pedophile-defending&quot;.</p>

<p>These people haven&#39;t even been to court and convicted but they are being tried by right wing mob rule. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am liberal, but people have changed the definition of liberal.  </p>

<p>&quot;Liberalism  was  the  crop  which  emerged  from   this  soil.  In  its  broadest   aspect   liberalism   believed  that   men   should   be  freed from coercive  power  as  completely  as  possible.  In  its  narrowest  aspect  liberalism  believed  that  the  economic  activities  of  man  should  be  freed   completely  from   &quot;state  interference.&quot;  This  latter belief, summed  up  in  the<br/>
battle-cry  &quot;No  government  in  business,&quot;  was  commonly  called   &quot;laissez-faire.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Liberalism,   which   included   laissez-faire,   was   a  wider   term   because  it  would  have  freed  men  from  the  coercive  power  of  any  church, army,  or  other  institution,  and  would  have  left  to  society  little  power beyond  that  required  to  prevent  the  strong  from   physically   oppressing the   weak.&quot;  </p>

<p>The pattern I see is that these people are New World Order globalists, who practice certain religions.  The religions they practice involve pedophilia, ritual human sacrifice, and more.  So, if someone is involved in these religions, then it is reasonable to assume that they practice their rituals.  </p>

<p>I am willing to bet that some people you think of as being &quot;right wing&quot; are really Marxists.  People like the Bush family.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are looking at it from the Democrat versus Republican context.  The reality is that the Democrats and Republicans are all on the same team.  They are mostly New World Order globalists.  They are members of the Council on Foreign Relations.  Some are members of the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission.  At least, they get their instructions from these groups.  </p>

<p>Do you understand this?  They do not represent the American people.  </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve always said Republicans are even more liberal than liberals in the right wing context.&quot;  I am not sure what you mean by &quot;right wing context&quot;.  Consider this example.  The same group of people who pushed for the legalization of same sex marriage (left wing, from your point of view) in the U.S. also supported ISIS (right wing, from your point of view).  How do you reconcile this?  ISIS was throwing homosexuals off of buildings.  It seems like a contradiction until you realize the real agenda that these people have.  </p>

<p>&quot;Things like anti-abortion is something that a real liberal would say or believe. 100% social justice.&quot;  I am not sure what you mean.  What is better?  Giving women the right to have an abortion, or taking away this right so that baby body parts are not being sold or used in Satanic rituals?   </p>

<p>If I am anti-abortion, it is not necessarily because I want to deny women their right to choose.  Maybe I am against the Satanists, and am choosing the lesser of two evils.  </p>

<p>&quot;Yet... you&#39;re a liberal and do nothing but attack liberals. You just don&#39;t make sense. Because you&#39;re lying.&quot;  Yes, I was backing Bernie until I realized what was going on.  He got screwed, and proved to be weak.  I noticed in February-March of 2016 that certain established Republicans were saying that they would vote for Hillary if Trump was the Republican nominee.  I thought this was really strange because these are the same people who wanted to impeach Bill Clinton, and they have always publicly hated Hillary Clinton.  Why would they shun Trump and vote for the hated Hillary?  </p>

<p>Well, the answer is because Trump is not associated with the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group, or the Trilateral Commission.  Trump is not a member of the same secret societies, and Trump is not NWO.  </p>

<p>You interpret what I do as attacking liberals.  The reality is that I attack the NWO globalists.  The Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderberg Group, and the Trilateral Commission are all NWO organizations.  </p>

<p>People accuse me of supporting Trump and Putin, but Trump and Putin happen to also attack the NWO globalists.  Trump and Putin are nationalists.  </p>

<p>I make sense once you understand who people really are.  If you look at it from the Democrat, Republican, left wing, right wing point of view, then my position does not make sense.  </p>

<p>The Bushes, John Kerry, the Clintons, McCain, Schumer, Pelosi, Paul Ryan, Pence, May, Merkel, Trudeau, etc. are all NWO globalists and they all work together to further the NWO agenda.  </p>

<p>Here is another example.  Bush Jr. and John Kerry are both members of Skull and Bones, and they are both associated with the groups I mentioned above.  In the 2004 election, it did not matter who won because the same NWO agenda would be implemented.  People think that they would vote for Kerry because he is a Democrat and they would get a different result than if they voted for Bush Jr. who is a Republican.  The reality is that it did not matter who they voted for.  They would get the same thing.  </p>

<p>The metoo movement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This too. There was definitely a coordinated effort to smear a bunch of people. Of course some men are sexually assaulting away. Most victims stayed silent. Nothing I can do about it then. They accepted it so I must. </p>

<p>It is 100% normal for the majority to be anti-pedophilia just like the majority don&#39;t want nuclear war, don&#39;t want to eat poison, don;t want crime in their neighborhoods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Help me understand, but if I were to call someone a pedophile, especially in a public way with sound/visual evidence, would they not be able to sue me for libel and seek compensation for any damages or grief etc? Ashcroft has stated that from her exposures, &quot;Sue me&quot;. Either the accused will not come forward to deny it for fear of others coming forward with similar, or even worse the same, claims, or if innocent can just sweep it away as a delusional attack. In false accusations it could also be said that an innocent can be negatively affected just by saying &quot;I am not a Podophile&quot;. </p>

<p>I think this is the #metoo movement moments for the many victims of child crimes. There are, if government and advocate global numbers, HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of people who are viscously abused as kids. I will not convict anyone in my mind without  solidity of evidence, but more importantly I will try to listen to and actually hear those speaking up about the most pressing and abhorible aspect of our planet today. And yesterday. Look into Jimmy Saville and the Franklin cover up then get back to me.</p>
