The building collapses were physically impossible as described, there was proven insider trading on the event, there are peer reviewed papers showing explosives at the WTC cite, the official story has essentially no evidence and prominent politicians and members of intelligence essentially admitted it was a false flag.</p>

<p>My question is what prominent conspiracies and topics on this sub do you guys think have enough evidence to end any logical debate? What ones are you still uncertain about and why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most recent US federal government investigation concluded &quot;Probably assassinated as the results of a conspiracy; with a high probability of a second gunman&quot;. I am interested in where you think the audio info was debunked. However, but my opinions regarding JFK are based on much more than that.</p>

<p>If you are actually interested in researching read the book &quot;The Last Investigation&quot; by Gaeton Fonzi. He was an investigator on the house select committee on assassinations. It doesn&#39;t so much delve into the details of the assassination as go over the bureaucratic pressure to make sure the public was satisfied with the story they were given rather than finding the truth and an intelligence asset named &quot;Maurice Bishop&quot; who sent a team of anti-Castro Cubans armed with rifles to Dallas. Bishop was later identified as David Atlee Phillips, CIA ops chief in the Western Hemisphere</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not simply the radiation in the Van Allen Belts that&#39;s deadly but the incoming solar and cosmic radiation that it traps and repels and protects the planet against that is just as deadly and the astro-nots would have been constantly subjected to all of that radiation all of the time on their way to, time on the Moon, and then coming back from it. That&#39;s one of the major reasons why I don&#39;t believe they ever went.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s no doubt being in space exposes the human body to much greater levels of radiation than normal. But it is easily shielded against and anything that would be energetic enough to get through even a small amount of shielding will be of low flux. </p>

<p>Particle radiation in LEO and MEO comes from energetic proton and electrons. The USAF has been doing radiation belt studies since the 40s and they continue to this day, there is a rather sophisticated simulation program that is available to the public that is used to model radiation belt flux called “AE9 and AP9” with the number being indicative of its version. The majority of the flux we see in LEO can be screened using a few inches of aluminum. Anything that would pass through the simple aluminum shielding will have a low enough flux to not be fatal. We put much more additional shielding on our space craft as we don’t want our astronauts to die shortly after they return, but the radiation belt isn’t as scary as most seem to think on this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anywhere above a low Earth orbit, about 250 miles up, and beyond the Van Allen Belts and away from the Earth&#39;s protective magnetosphere the amount of cosmic and solar radiation that permeates our entire solar system on a continual basis is perfectly &quot;lethal&quot; to any and all life forms that inhabit this world and that are totally dependent on ALL of the conditions and the continual interactions that are unique and exclusive to this world, including it&#39;s distance from, and orbit around the Sun. </p>

<p>Any changes, even modest ones in any of those conditions and life as we know it would immediately cease to exist. </p>

<p>We are both a product of and intimately linked to all of those conditions and processes that are the only ones that support and sustain the life that presently exists on this world and nowhere else and only within the confines of where this world happens to exist in space. </p>

<p>I suggest that you not only think about that, but think &quot;seriously&quot; about it and begin to understand that we aren&#39;t going on any physical journeys beyond this world through the physical space of the Universe in any strictly material ways because we don&#39;t even begin to know the full extent and complexity all of those conditions, much less how to artificially re-create everything that is necessary and that can only exist with this Earth&#39;s parameters in the manner that it does.</p>

<p>Now the Moon has absolutely no protection against those forms of radiation and degree to which they alter and affect even the basic chemistry of the rock and dust on it&#39;s surface is a both a testament and a warning about that.</p>

<p>The research and discoveries made in relation to that have all been long after the so-called Apollo Project that not only didn&#39;t take any kind of radiation into consideration at all it didn&#39;t provide for any in either the design of the lander or the astronaut&#39;s suits. </p>

<p>That is a fact that NASA itself has sheepishly admitted on more than one occasion. Taken together with the so-called  &quot;lost technology&quot; and so-called &quot;lost telemetry&quot; and the notoriously fake &quot;Moon samples&quot; and you have all the ingredients of a hoax that there simply aren&#39;t enough excuses to continue to believe any more.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Anywhere above a low Earth orbit, about 250 miles up, and beyond the Van Allen Belts and away from the Earth’s protective magnetosphere </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earths magnetosphere extends around earth in a tear drop shape, with its minimum extendinG approx 40,000 km from earth, and its maximum up to 1.3 million km away as measured by unmanned satellites for the past 50+ years. <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/EP-177/ch3-4.html">citation</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>permeates our entire solar system on a continual basis is perfectly “lethal” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It very much is lethal, if you have no protection. From other studies and personal research the majority of radiation which occurs within our magnetosphere can be shielded against using a few inches of aluminum. 400 MeV protons can be shielded against using ~ 250mm of aluminum alloy. I can’t find a citation on this, but from personal lab experiments using high powered synchrotrons and our particle detectors, i have seen this to be true. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection">indirect citation</a></p>

<p>For anyone else interested, some very interesting studies are being done measuring the particle flux on the edges of these magnetic fields. They get stuck in the field and some very physically interesting things happen. <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/17apr_magnetotail">link</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any changes, even modest ones in any of those conditions and life as we know it would immediately cease to exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This just simply isn’t true. The intensity of solar flux changes all the time, along with the intensity and orientation of the magnetic field. Don’t fear monger. ( obviously a severe change would impact life, but it would have to be something so severe that there really isn’t a physical way to it)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>suggest that you not only think about that, but think “seriously” about it </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This irks me. As i mentioned in my parent comment, i have been doing radiation belt studies for more than a year now. And not just reading papers and documentaries like what is available to you, but taking physical data with satellites i have had a hand in designing and launching. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>we don’t even begin to know the full extent and complexity all of those conditions, much less how to artificially re-create everything that is necessary and that only exists within this Earth’s parameters in the manner that it does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do though. There’s been almost 75 years of radiation science in space. Basically sense the first satellite we have been increasing our understanding of the conditions in and out of the magnetosphere. There is a big old chart at my place of work which maps out the history of radiation satellites but i can’t find it available online. As proof to our understanding, the models i mentioned before are usually within 5% of what we physically measure with current detectors in orbit. <a href="https://lws-set.gsfc.nasa.gov/documents/AE9AP9_overview14Jun2012.pdf">ae9 ap9</a>&gt; that they alter and affect even the basic chemistry of the rock</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the degree to which we now know that they alter and affect even the basic chemistry of the rock and dust on it’s surface is a both a testament and a warning about that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Non biological material which has existed on the moon for billion + years is very different than having an astronaut on its surface in a radiation hardened suit for less three hours.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The research and discoveries made in relation to that have all been long after the so-called Apollo Project that not only didn’t take any kind of radiation into consideration at all it didn’t provide for any in either the design of the lander or the astronaut’s suits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just not true. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1netr5/how_did_the_apollo_11_mission_protect_against/">personal explanation</a>
<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf">technical report</a></p>

<p>To end with, i love when people question the status quo. Its what keeps the field of science alive and progressing, so please dont take this as a personal attack. But anericans and the world worked for decades to explore the moon. Millions oF papers and research is available to be reaD on the subject. I personally have used a sodium laser to reflect off of the reflective plates left on the moon; something i feel everyone should have the opportunity do. Basically, what is the more reasonable conclusion after truelly considering both sides; that 25 years of scientific evidence progress and research and physical  is fake, involving thousands of lying engineers and physicists, or that we went to the moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not talking simply about the belts but the space beyond them and the high intensity &quot;cosmic radiation&quot; from a Universe of sources out there in addition to the mega-micro-meteorite storms like the ones <em>that we now know</em> hit the Moon roughly every 48 hours. </p>

<p>As for the situation here on Earth, if our orbit around the Sun came any closer than it does, or was any further away than it is, then no we wouldn&#39;t be here and the margins for that are far smaller than you might think. </p>

<p>A thicker atmosphere or a thinner one or one with even a slightly different composition from the one we have and again life as we know it would no longer be possible. </p>

<p>To that you can add the Earth&#39;s rotation that keeps it from being a burnt-out desert on one side and a dark and frozen wasteland on the other. Of these, amongst a myriad of other facts, both known and unknown, that are all interconnected and connected to our own physical biology and it&#39;s bio-chemical and electro-chemical functions that can&#39;t and don&#39;t operate independently from them, you take no notice of at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have citations for any of this? I have a degree in astrophysics, a few years of space based internships, and continuing my masters/PhD this fall in astrophysics, and i disagree with almost every single thing you just said.</p>

<p>Cosmic radiation, while intense, occurs at such a low flux that any truely energetic particles will be unlikely to both hit you and interact with you at all. </p>

<p>Our orbit varies more than 5 million km depending on what stage it’s orbit is in, and has almost no effect on life on earth. See earths aphelion and perihelion.</p>

<p>Earths atmosphere has changed dramatically in the past, and life has always been able to adapt and thrive. See oxygen levels/carbon dioxide levels in various epochs in the past (think dinosaurs)</p>

<p>The timing of earths rotation isn’t anything special, as long as the planet isn’t tidally Locked it will support water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles. I will concede that earths tilt is useful for life as we know it, but is by no means necessary for life to exist. Mind you this has nothing to do with space exploration</p>

<p>I’m not going to address the “unknown facts” portion of your comment, it’s non scientific. </p>

<p>Radiation is easily screened at the levels that are found between here and the moon. Read the link i gave in the last comment. The ISS is where it’s act because that’s where they wanted it to be. It was the most cost effective to allow for planetary and space study, in addition to allowing astronauts to stay in orbit for a very long time. (Clearly being closer to earth helps with radiation, which was a factor for the ISS. The lunar missions time scales were much much much shorter than the projected timescale for ISS astronauts and the mission it self. It’s not very useful to compare the two as they have very different scientific goals) Please tell me about the better observations it could make at higher altitudes, because that doesn’t make any sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting article. It seems to me though that it largely supports everything i have said before. The ISS astronauts will receive approx 100 milliseverts of radiation on a 6 month trip, while a trip to mars (which would take significantly longer and offer even less protection from radiation from earth) would expose the astronauts to 300 miliseverts of radiation. While this increase of radiation is significant, it is my no means an instantly lethal dose. I believe the part you found significant was the cosmic radiation bit, but it is in accordance to what i have been saying this whole time. Solar radiation is easily shielded, and cosmic radiation occurs at such a low flux that it was largely not needed to be accounted for for a lunar mission. It will start having an effect on longer missions further from earth like those to mars: remember we are discussing a LUNAR mission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that you are going to hear more and more about just how very dangerous the radiation in and beyond the belts actually is and that the difficulty of overcoming it will take untold decades to ever safely resolve.</p>

<p>There is also the new and additional fact that there is yet another plasma belt within the Van Allen Belts that has nothing to do with the magnetosphere that envelops the entire planet approximately 7,200 miles up. </p>

<p>Moreover it is that &quot;hard shield&quot; as the scientists refer to it that actually intercepts and stops most of the inbound radiation and the scientists at MIT who made that announcement have no idea at all how it manages to do that. </p>

<p>What I&#39;ve been trying to point out to you is that all we apparently know is simply a drop in the bucket and that human beings are far too fragile and far too deeply connected and dependent on this very unusual little world of ours to ever travel to or stay on any of the others. </p>

<p>And make no mistake this world and how it evolved to be the way that it is, when you take all of the conditions, events, timing and sequence of them and the rare but modest little Sun we&#39;re parked in just the right orbit around, the odds on there being another one like it would take as many universes as there are stars and planets in this one to ever find another that is equal to it.</p>
