<p>The majority of cancer diagnoses are end-of-life -- at which point, chemo is associated with a 3 month extension of life.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t refusing it because they think chemo doesn&#39;t work, they are refusing it because it won&#39;t work for them and they&#39;ve seen the medical reality. There&#39;s a similar pattern with DNRs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His diet was the complete opposite of what kills cancer. Cancer loves sugar. Jobs fed the cancer instead of starving it. Without sugar, cancer dies. Healthy cells can run on alternative fuels (ketones), but cancer cells cannot. Fasting is the cure. In fact, most people who fight cancer with Chemo are fasting due to loss of appetite from the drugs. So what&#39;s actually curing the cancer? Is it Chemo. No. But they love all the things they can bill you for. What&#39;s the cost of fasting? Zero. The media would NEVER be allowed to tell people to not consume.

<p>How can you &quot;fix&quot; cells? They&#39;re damaged at a DNA level. </p>

<p>Eating healthy means not introducing carcinogens, etc that create the mutated cells in the first place, which I 100% agree with you. </p>

<p>But I&#39;ve seen no evidence of eating certain foods to <em>target</em> cells and fix their dna.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a number of diet related approaches, none of them are a perfect cure. Yet, there are many who claim it worked for them.</p>

<p>These methods are not as extensively studied due to a lack of profit potential. They mainly just make you eat unprocessed plant foods. Plant foods are not raking in the money.</p>

<p>The real issue is the double standards. When chemotherapy saves just 2 or so more people per 100 it is considered a relative benefit and accepted as a treatment. When a diet related approach does much better than that it is not seen as a cure, because it doesn&#39;t save 100% of the participants.</p>

<p>We let money decide public policy and medical policy. Actually, there are cheaper and safer ways to deal with many of our illnesses with nutrition. Our doctors are very ignorant in this field though.</p>

<p>How much would you trust a car mechanic if he demonstrated that he totally disregards checking your brake fluid, engine oil, transmission fluid or power steering fluid, but repeatedly wants you to make expensive repairs as the parts of these very systems fail?</p>

<p>Well, you&#39;d think he doesn&#39;t care about you or your vehicle, only his own income. Well, that&#39;s how the medical professionals work. They ignore the chemical inputs needed to maintain our vehicle in proper working condition, because they want us to pay them for expensive interventions. This is not done at the doctor level, but th education level. Doctors are good people, but they are set up to be ignorant by shrewd businessmen that profit from the medical industry.</p>

<p>The truth is that the body fights cancer by default and we get it regularly. It takes time to grow into tumors. Usually it dies long before then. If it does make it to a tumor, it means our body isn&#39;t fighting the cancer. Many times that&#39;s because it lacks the chemical tools it needs to do so. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a magic bullet. You can&#39;t always fix the vehicle by giving it what it needed the day before yesterday. Fortunately, unlike cars, we can heal. Unfortunately, we do not have the diagnostic capacity to effectively ensure it will work. It&#39;s a gamble and many will fail.</p>

<p>Some compare the gamble to the one they get with hundreds of thousands of debt, mutilation, radiation and poison. They often find death preferable to an expensive, miserable aftermath. We forget that we all will die one day, no matter how well we eat, or how many exotic medications we take. </p>

<p>Absolutely, Big Pharma ones cause carnage, everyone one I know who had chemo and radiotherapy died soon after, simply not worth the risk.  And even if you leave you&#39;ll be left in a weak and vulnerable state after all of the heavy damage from the toxins.</p>

<p>There are many people who have used themselves as guinea pigs, after being sent home to die by modern medicine, having been told they have days to live, and they fully reverse their cancer using natural methods.  It&#39;s actually becoming quite common these days.  Big Pharma don&#39;t want you to know that as they want $100K+ for brain and immune system damaging carcinogenic chemotherapy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good source, but it&#39;s missing some important information. It&#39;s critical to greatly reduce all sources of added sugar too. And overall, monitor closely sugar intakes. Added sugar are in like every single food. </p>

<p>Fasting is great to prevent cancer. I fast for a month long each year. </p>

<p>Your link mentions reishi mushrooms. I consume that while I fast. It tastes like shit, but this mushroom&#39;s properties are well known and have been well documented. They have consumed this for over 1000 years in Chinese medicine. </p>

<p>The truth is your best bet to fight cancer is to take preventive measures to start with. and it essentially boils down to the right diet. Once you are diagnosed a cancer stage 3 and over, whatever you do, chances are it&#39;s too late. Even stage 2 I think. Most people won&#39;t follow these preventive measures, because they involve a lot of self-discipline and self-control. Most people cannot resist it when they go to the commercial center and see and smell all kinds of junk foods, and unhealthy foods. </p>
