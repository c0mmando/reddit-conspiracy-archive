<p>There are so many things that I seriously would say are insane. But never comment on.  Then I might google and figure, wow that’s a interesting theory let me investigate.  Could be right could be wrong.  Anyway, I’m a lurker.  Let me be clear: some of this stuff is like sci-if.  But some of it is may not, and it causes me pause.  </p>

<p>BUT I’m afraid to post and comment.  I see viral posts going all the time that run people into trouble. (Mostly dumb stuff). </p>

<p>Why am I afraid to contribute, put things in writing (all innocuous comments)?  I’m well versed in 1st amendment issues and actors acting under color of law. So no concern here. I’m afraid that someone like me who does not have enough courage to express their views in light of some sort of backlash, is being silenced by news stories of something bad happening on the internet.  Literally took me a while to post something with a picture because the Internet is the Wild West “who knows what will happen.”  </p>

<p>That doesn’t contemplate being anonymous.  Not to say you should blast personal information.  But if you have to be anonymous to express opinions then what is the point of freedom of speech.  Note: I recognize the difference between the right as upheld by the constitution and public opinion.  My point is this:  when you cannot be jailed for an opinion, there still is a way of crushing you.  Public opinion.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I meant to reply to another comment when I replied to this.  I am sorry.</p>

<p>Thank you for your comment.  Can you review my edit and comment on your thoughts?  I am interested in stifling free discourse due to an ambient threat of backlash.  I also researched Reddit more.  I think I am starting to understand Karma, gold, and upvotes and down votes.  The structure of getting upvotes and protecting your karma appears to be very important to people.  So much so that protecting karma and manufacturing an environment that cultivated a belief that this is important can be used as a passive means of nudging people to self regulate.  It’s fascinating.</p>

<p>I am not advocating for any position, theory, or “conspiracy.”  I am thinking about how the structure we build and utilize to communicate with each other turns into a self regulating system.   Then, is there the possibility this can be manipulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if it is genuine, the up votes and downvotes, then isn’t that what we want?  A platform for speech?  The problem is manipulation of that platform.  That is my issue.  Or is it just a fact of life.  Be aware of it.  BUT, then everyone is being accused of being a bot or manipulator.  Then nobody knows what is true.  But then that’s ok, because we just call it “fake news.”  So that’s great, we called it out as fake news.  But then it ends there.  Nobody does anything about it.  Myself included.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think part of the reason writing or contributing to a site like Reddit is intimidating is because the words are now out of your control. You can never unsay them and people are free to twist them however they can, even if you didn&#39;t mean whatever their twisted conclusions are. It&#39;s a kind of trust required, or perhaps just a firmer belief in yourself. And fwiw I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever a bad idea to be cautious about what you write on the internet. As my mom said, don&#39;t type anything you wouldn&#39;t want read in court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m talking about social media in general.  The slightest thing can go viral.  For example, there was a post recently of a video of a guy shoving his bag into the overhead compartment on an airplane.  I’ll agree, it was less than graceful, but someone took a video of it and I saw it.  Thousands of people commented on it.  Made fun of the guy, etc.</p>

<p>Point is, anything you do can potentially go viral.  I think this fear will can tend to chill free speech.  People are reluctant to comment, post, or express views because of this.  I’m worried I might trip and fall over something in the airport and I become a meme.  I’m careful about what I say and do because something innocent can be twisted.  </p>

<p>There is the real possibility that this can be manipulated.  By who?  I’m not going to say.  I won’t say TPTB.  I don’t know what that is.  I will just say “interested parties.”  This may be obvious to everyone here, but this light bulb just went off in my head.  What was meant to be a bastion of free speech — the internet — can be manipulated.  Is Section 1983 even a recourse if we find out public servants manipulate the internet?  Maybe they do, maybe they don’t.  I don’t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  I just feel like I shouldn’t be a lurker.  Again, some of the things that are pushed here are out of control.  Flat earth, for example.  But yesterday after work I saw all these posts about Buzz Aldrin.  One of them had a comment that linked a video about a fake moon landing.  Honestly, it was pretty good.  Assuming the footage was not altered.  I wanted to comment about it.  But I didn’t.  I don’t think the moon landing was fake.  And I was not yet born when it happened.  I kind of would like to comment my observations without being looked at like an outcast.  That’s my point.  Why the fear?  Why should I be deterred from exploring?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we all met up in a park, would we harass each other or have a civil conversation.  Why is it on the internet people harass each other?  Is it because we are all behind a screen?  Possibly.  Or is there an underlying structure that cultivates this.  Meaning, you don’t just sit on a park bench and listen to my message.  You go through my post history and gain insight on who I am.  You make judgments base on the age of my account.  Do these exchanges, in essence, turn into ad hominem attacks?  Rather than thoughtful discourse based on the message?</p>

<p>Have we built a structure to communicate with each other that nudges us to judge the messenger and not the message? Does this structure lend itself to manipulation.  Are we in essence manipulating ourselves by using this structure.</p>

<p>Here’s the interesting flip side:  if we meet in a park, will you judge me by the clothes that I wear?  I bet you will.  So is this just the nature of our reality.?</p>

<p>It’s absolutely fascinating.  The dissemination of information I think goes to the core of everything.</p>

<p>You are totally on the right track, we are products of our environment, and that includes the environment of where we inhabit in relation to the internet. Think of a Call Of Duty lobby for a minute if you can- Assuming everyone has a mic, the guys who are on the top of the scoreboard are treated better than those on the bottom. Interms of Reddit, the higher your points, the more times you&#39;ve been rewarded gold, and of courses this generation is participating actively in the &quot;If it&#39;s got a red line it&#39;s not worth my time&quot; mentality. </p>

<p>What&#39;s even more dangerous is that toxic information is being presented by everyone, to everyone *Every single time a mic is used* or in terms of Reddit *every single time a post is made, either to the site or to a thread such as this* </p>

<p>A great quote, &quot; he <strong>illiterate of the 21st century</strong> will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn&quot; – Alvin Toffle </p>

<p>Now, if we have children being actively raised by internet communities, and we can establish that although they can read and take in information as the speed of which was only previously accessible by literary scholars, than I believe it is fair to presume that can be used to create sleepers on a macro scale, simply by shitposting and having everyone see the same things, the ones who move on and accept the information bury it into their subconscious- the ones who move on and dismiss the information, do not. What happens next? An evolved class structure not based on economic or ethic foundations, but instead based on your very way of thought?</p>

<p>This is noted to bring together why I made it a point to acknowledge focused marketing tactics, and how everyone&#39;s information is logged by AI... It&#39;s all in the cloud. The solution? Host your own server? To be honest, that much is ahead of my personal comprehension, but I will continue to do my best to make sense for you. #Discussionism</p>

<p>Thank you for your comment.  Can you review my edit and comment on your thoughts?  I am interested in stifling free discourse due to an ambient threat of backlash.  I also researched Reddit more.  I think I am starting to understand Karma, gold, and upvotes and down votes.  The structure of getting upvotes and protecting your karma appears to be very important to people.  So much so that protecting karma and manufacturing an environment that cultivated a belief that this is important can be used as a passive means of nudging people to self regulate.  It’s fascinating.</p>

<p>I am not advocating for any position, theory, or “conspiracy.”  I am thinking about how the structure we build and utilize to communicate with each other turns into a self regulating system.   Then, is there the possibility this can be manipulated.</p>
