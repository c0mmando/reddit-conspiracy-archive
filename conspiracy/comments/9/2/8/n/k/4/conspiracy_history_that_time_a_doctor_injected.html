    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, people have been having tons of sex of 100s of thousands of years, using drugs and starving just as long, but then in the late 80s this weird thing happens and people start dying from strange illnesses...</p>

<p>But then we find this virus shows up, which if the viral titers get higher, people start to get aids defining illnesses, and when treated with anti-retroivrals, the symptoms get better and the titers drop, while cd 4 counts increase.... and then there are people who lack the proteins that allow viral entry into the cells and so are immune to aids... so all the puzzle pieces fit...</p>

<p>But blackdeath2018 thinks that its all from tons of sex, drugs or poor nutrion based on god knows what and all those doctors are just lying to everyone... </p>

<p>Good god, people need to step back and consider their theories a bit... and think if they make sense... because clearly tons of fucking sex or drug use or in Africa poor nutrition have been going on for ever but AIDS is only documented in the last 50 or so years...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HIV/AIDS was accidentally created by making tainted smallpox vaccines that were injected on the tongue (a mucous membrane) from monkey kidneys which carried the virus for ages.  The reason it was never in humans is that until the vaccines there was no vector for entry.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that the pharma industry buried overwhelming evidence of this and ruined careers and then continued to produce and distribute these vaccines.  When the heat finally got too high in developed countries, they dumped them all in Africa as “medical aid” and used it as a human experiment.</p>

<p>Read about Bernice Eddy for an intro to thesis rabbit hole.  It is actually all backed up by decades of non-controversial research and legitimate science.  The conspiracy is that they still manage to keep this straight forward case from being public knowledge.</p>

<p>This would be the study you&#39;d have to refer to: but it doesn&#39;t suggest that. There was reduced incidence, not immunity; but looking at the numbers, the negative bloodtype was also quite uncommon in the population, suggesting that the difference could be statistical noise.</p>

<p>But if it were a real effect, then perhaps it has a harder time jumping from a positive to a negative blood-type.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on what is this alleged claim... since the advent of antiretrovirals terminal AIDS cases have plummeted, and people are living so long that they are running into some of the chronic side effects of anti-retrovirals (heart disease for example) although newer antiretrovirals carry less risks and side effects. </p>

<p>Early in the aids epidemic people were dying in 1-2 years from AIDs, people now live nearly normal life spans on anti-retrovirals. Yes every drug carries side effects, but if you went to a hospital the late 80s there were entire wards of patients dying for aids defining lesions... Now there are not... what changed? Anti-retrovirals. </p>

<p>a)  people develop aids without HIV -&gt; so then they should be dying at the same rate.</p>

<p>Nowhere do they make it clear those people have aids.. there are other causes of t-cell dysfunction and yes this can cause some opportunistic infection.</p>

<p>It is also possible, that these patients are what we now now to be people who are slow progressors to AIDS and have low cd HIV titers which may have been too low for their test to pick. Also they could just have had rare autoimmune syndromes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, ok, so clearly you know almost nothing about biology or medicine but still feel that you can comment authoritatively on the subject. </p>

<p>Everyone has CD4 counts (well everyone with a functioning immune system), we use CD4 count track progression to AIDs, once CD4 counts fall below 200 you start to see aids defining lesions. </p>

<p>Titers are not a specific test. Titers are looking at how many infective particles are in a given volume, in this case volume of blood. There are many ways to measure this. </p>

<p>Most modern high volume assays use an antibody test to determine viral counts but research labs use a variety of techniques to determine viral titers, some that use antibodies some that do not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>oh Titer is an Antibody test - if you knew anything at all you wouldn&#39;t even mention those.</p>

<p>Yes you&#39;re right they&#39;re not a specific test they&#39;re a sensitive test. Infective particles, how do they determine what are the infective particles when HIV has never been isolated? </p>

<p>They all use antibodies the one test that does not weighs the cells inside the blood sample and anything at the weight of 24 pascals indicates HIV seropositivity. They call it the P24 antigen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you going on about. Nobody weighs anything. </p>

<p>ELISA and Western blot are totally different assays. </p>

<p>Yes, all use antibodies, but antibodies against different epitopes with different  ways of running the test. </p>

<p>Rapid antibody testing is a version of ELISA and there are different tests. </p>

<p>Viral titers are separate from HIV qualitative testing. </p>

<p>They also genotype the viral strains as well which is a separate technique that uses PCR. </p>

<p>These test rely on different detection techniques. </p>

<p>Western blot uses an enzyme to break down reagent produces light that interacts with film. </p>

<p>Elisa usually uses a flourophore but rapid antigen testing usually uses a chemical detector. </p>

<p>Real time PCR is just amplifies regions of DNA and using either die that intercolates double standed DNA or specific target peptides with flourophores. </p>

<p>No one weights anything, P24 is just the name of a core antigen, how did you infer 24 pascals from that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gish gallop, gish gallop. You keep conflating topics and tests. There is no cross reactivity in PCR in the same way there is with antiibody testing. There are autoimmune disorders that’s affect cd 4 counts. That does not preclude hiv as being an acquired cause. They’re is over 30 years of biochemical and clinical analysis of hiv/ aids and decades of treatment experience. You parse out isolated phrases and data form 20 year old case reports. The evolution in analytical techniques has been immense. We have sertyped hiv, we can even track how different serotyoes branched off, when it hopped yo humans, how people responded to treatment, and are working on isolating vaccine targets. You are so arrogant in your ignorance... you don’t understand basic terms or techniques or biochemistry and yet presume you know anything because you skimmed the abstract of a 30 year old paper.</p>

<p>No. PCR amplifies HIV RNA to assess viral count, it looks at the realt ime amplification quantifying the rate of amplification, as the more copies of viral RNA, the greater the rate of amplification.</p>

<p>T-cell counts are done with flow cytometry which is at totally different technique. </p>

<p>HIV uses T4 tcell to replicate, it then lyses the T-cell to release the virions to infect other t cells, so of course it makes sense to grow HIV in Vitro in t-cells...</p>

<p>ANSWER THIS;</p>

<p>What kind of Virus can create Cancer where cells multiply rapidly (Kaposi Sarcoma) in addition to wasting disorders where the cells die rapidly (traditional AIDs cases). How can one virus do two opposing things...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All sort of viruses and pathogens cause cancer. From HPV to EBV there are associations with cancer. KS is caused by HHV8 which is normally kept in check by T cells. T cells fight intracellular pathogens, viruses are one such pathogen. When they disrupt cellular function to create copies of themselves you can get aberrant cells that then become cancerous. T-cells keep both the virus and cancer cells in check, but in the case of AIDS they are dysfunctional. When HAART is initiated and T-cell counts go up, lesions often resolve and treatment with HAART early can prevent occurrence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are other viruses like Herpes tested by taking a sample and placing it under an electron microscope, why is HIV the only Virus that has an antibody test? (im aware that there are other antibody tests now, but at the time HIV was the only one)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong? Tzank smears are a test for HSV. There are both PCR probes and serology for HSV. HSV serology is tricky because 95% of people are seropositive for HSV1 (common cause of cold sores) although HSV2 which is more commonly associated with genital herpes is also quite common and can cause both cold sores and genital herpes... although genital herpes, if I remember correctly, can be as high as 25%. </p>

<p>But we PCR and antibody tests, be it titers, serology, serum antibodies etc. for many viruses and bacteria. </p>

<p>Of course aids defining illnesses exist without aids, because HIV makes you susceptible to infenction and cancer by taking down your immune system.

It is a mutated form of Simian Immune Virus, which is why it’s so new, not because it’s fake. The reason ooh believe it comes from partying, drugs, and sex, is because the government told everyone that so the virus would go on freely decimating the gay population.</p>

<p>If you like documentaries, And The Band Played On is a great one based on a book about the above. I hate to be a hypocrite but I’m not dedicating my time to watching a doco that tries to prove this illness fake, I’m too busy and have had too much primary and secondary experience with victims of it. Please be safe, and any fellow gays reading this who still think it’s fake PLEASE don’t expose yourself to danger.</p>

<p>Oh my sweet summer child.</p>

<p>No, it doesn’t make me an expert on HIV/AIDS. But I can tell you as a member of the community nothing has ever or will ever affect our community as disastrously as ignorance to this virus.</p>

<p>In the 80s the gays were invincible. Disco was happening, the Harlem ballrooms were hotter than ever, people were accepting us more. So many were happy with what we had, they put their heads in the sand and ignored their friends inexplicably dropping like flies around them.</p>

<p>You’ve got some crackpot theories about HERV and poppers and viral loads, great. What I have is actual understanding of how a fucking std works and a strong personal motivation to make sure everyone knows this disease is real, it is deadly, and it can affect you.</p>

<p>If you don’t have time to read the book at least watch the movie of And The Band Played On, because that’s the HIV conspiracy tree you should be barking up.</p>

<p>I absolutely agree, I think everyone should wear condoms always unless with a monogamous partner and both of you are tested. Even minor STDs can put you back a lot of money for identification and treatment.</p>

<p>A lot of gay men still have sex without condoms, unfortunately, because it’s somewhat ingrained into our community as a fetish. PreP can help these people but only so much.</p>

<p>Not especially sure what you mean by this but considering the US government’s treatment of the epidemic in the first place it isn’t surprising to me that treatment hasn’t been hugely successful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An HIV monoinfected patient is a patient with HIV and nothing else. These people develop AIDS. If you say that HIV doesn&#39;t exist, then what is causing their AIDS? 
You just said in your last post that HTLV is real. Now you&#39;re saying that it doesn&#39;t exist. 
Can you reference any of these &quot;findings&quot; that you&#39;re talking about? Are they all from the youtube video in your post history? 
There are many ways to quantify HIV viral load. See here: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15006182">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15006182</a></p>

<p>These viruses were not &quot;synthesized in a lab&quot;. That was technically infeasible at the time. All retroviruses have a reverse transcriptase. That&#39;s how they work. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I asked you to stop being such a condescending douchecannon in your replies, and you have not stopped. Also, none of your logic is consistent. I&#39;m assuming that you&#39;re a troll at this point, so this will be my last reply. </p>

<p>Viral load is not double speak for CD4 and TCells. Viral load is measured HIV-1 RNA concentration in a patient&#39;s blood. This is monitored <strong>alongside</strong> CD4 positive T-lymphocyte counts in HIV patients. They are two very different things. </p>
