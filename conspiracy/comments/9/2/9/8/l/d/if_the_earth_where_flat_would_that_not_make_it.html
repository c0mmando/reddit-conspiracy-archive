    <div class="md"><p>They are related.  The reason for the wet spinning ball in a place called &quot;outer space&quot; lie is to create more nihilists, agnostics, and atheists.  If everyone knew the truth that we are in a flat enclosed cosmology these types of people would look at Genesis in the Bible and see truth instead of fairy-tale.  The lie is to discredit the foundations of the Bible so in a way it&#39;s covering for the greatest evince of God there is which is the creation itself.  The only thing that the true powers that run this world don&#39;t want you to know is all you need to do to receive eternal life is to repent and believe this:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Catholicism has officially adopted modern cosmology and the big bang.  The Jesuits were responsible for that deception in the first place so that makes sense.  Most eastern religions and Buddhism are tied it&#39;s &quot;cosmic&quot; stuff and heavily involve outer space.  All New Age is intrinsically tied to outer space.  The only one that shares the flat earth is Islam.  They also recognize Jesus Christ and know he will be coming  back to defeat the Antichrist in the end times.  They just don&#39;t think he&#39;s God incarnate who paid the price for their sins which is the part that matters the most.  Once you whittle all he possibles down it&#39;s easy to tell King James Bible believing Christianity is the most derided &quot;religion&quot; there is.  They support Islam and it&#39;s spread.  The main thing the world is against is the blood atonement of Jesus Christ.  Anything else they are ok with.</p>

<p>Cold hard facts don&#39;t like. Results that we can all go test.</p>

<p>You were given simplistic ways to test that FE isn&#39;t real. Why not try it?</p>

<p>Oh, cause like you just said, that would mean the past few years beliefs were all wasted.</p>

<p>And some people can&#39;t get over their ego to accept new information.</p>

<p>People, please stop watching videos with good production values as if they are educational.</p>

<p>Go read a well sourced book and test the knowledge you want to learn about yourself.</p>

<p>Best line from you yet. . . &quot;I&#39;ve watched two years of videos. It&#39;s a deep rabbit hole. I wouldn&#39;t know what direction to point you in.&quot; - in response to the question &quot;Any good sources for a convincing FE theory?&quot;</p>

<p>Why do things way more at the poles than at the equator?</p>

<p>That one is even pretty easy to figure out yourself. Have you ever sitten in a roundabout? When it spins you are pushed to the outside. This is centrifugal force. The same happens with the rotating earth. There you have gravity pulling you down and centrifugal force pushing you away. Of course gravity is much stronger in this case but this is the explanation. This is also the reason launching rockets near the equator requires &quot;less&quot; energy than closer to the poles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just hypothetically: Gravity works wherever you have mass. But in order for it to act in the way that you could stand on a flat disc shaped object and have a force pulling you down vertically to the ground, that disc would have to have a lot of mass. Also how this mass would have to be distributed is an interesting mind game. Would it have to have gradually more mass on the underside of the disc the further to go to the outside? How would that object keep its shape instead of deforming and becoming a sphere eventually?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all seriousness, Flat Earth people legitimately believe that it&#39;s all magic. Everything is the way it is because God wanted it that way. It&#39;s one big magic playground he created for humans to live in and the rest of the Universe is a fancy backdrop which is just there for us to look at. It&#39;s pointless to even bring physics into the discussion because it&#39;s merely an afterthought in the Flat Earth model and it can work in any arbitrary way without breaking their worldview.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another good one: if the horizon is caused by light distortion through atmosphere, then why can you see for 150 miles or more from an airplane but not from the top of a building? Why do these line of sight observations perfectly match the predictions that the Earth is curved almost exactly like a ball? Another similar observation: why is sunset significantly later in an airplane than it is on the ground below?  You curvature of the Earth is something which can be appreciated with your eyes. People complain &quot;but the horizon looks pretty flat even at high altitude&quot;. Slow down. Think. Why is the horizon a <strong>circle</strong> that goes all around you and why does that circle get bigger when you climb altitude? That&#39;s the curvature. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would. </p>

<p>Now we have to decide how all the World Leaders come together to <em>disclose</em> that we live on a FE under a Dome without World Wide Chaos breaking out.</p>

<p>You also have to decide at that point how this will be <em>handled</em> without it becoming that Dreaded NWO or One World Religion! AND that one is a huge linchpin in the whole Disclosure Deprogramming Project.</p>

<p>If the little people realize that Rockets can only go so high, that they do not <em>race</em> around a spinning ball - that makes Mass Attacks really scary. We&#39;re all vulnerable but MAD already addressed that so we just have to <em>curb</em> the little tin-pot dicktaters, right? </p>

<p>It has been trotted out for years now that between Saddam and Gaddafi that they came across a pretty huge religious (shift/awakening?) A Portal or Door and that Giants DNA was unearthed as well. Some believe he/they had discovered plates, scrolls, texts that only the Vatican is/was suspected to have. They were fine with him/them turning their Country around, only Up to a Point. When they wanted to release the Information to the World they unleashed the Kraken on the Middle East Disclosure. </p>

<p>All the high strangeness going on at Antarctica? The only place on the Earth that every Massive World Leader can agree that Peace Exists Unilaterally, no matter what is happening on the other Continents!? Really?!</p>

<p>There was a similar awakening or revival that was building in the mid to late 1800&#39;s and that fomented what we call the Great Wars. The sheep, the lowly cattle were waking up to the Reality of the World and they had to shut that down PDQ!</p>

<p>So, rather than debating the Shape - how would World Leaders go about the Disclosure? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a huge Box to unpack. Or as others have said, they have us all twisted into a Simulation, which for me is depressing, unnerving and a worse Void that I just struggle to embrace at this time. </p>

<p>Every major religion at some point has had the FE as a Model of Creation. </p>

<p>While not every conspiracy theorist embraces Predictive Programming many do and there&#39;s tonnes of FE PP to dive into.</p>

<p>FE from creationists POV vs atheists can be very contentious but some have found enough common ground. Watching atheist agree that science has become a &quot;religion&quot; is pretty strange optics to me. Even watching all the various creation sects battle this out in their little YouTube world has been kinda crazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Kraken but also...look up the word Sulanuth. It is a bit more descriptive in Jasher but it comes up sounding like an Octopus. We&#39;ve seen an increase in <em>news reports</em> about how incredibly smart these creatures are, yes?</p>

<p>It is quite descriptive of a Tornado as well. The roof is torn off, house utterly destroyed, people whizzed away to the sky and yet a table with a cup of coffee and the morning paper is left untouched. </p>

<p>So, our minds can go several directions if we do not get <em>boxed in</em>.</p>

<p>While so many love to ridicule and discredit free thinkers...the moment a large Government gives disclosure to say, manipulating weather - all the Real Freak Naysayers suddenly disappear and the next round of Mind Games begin with the second wave of RFN. </p>

<p>It can be annoying after many many years but WTH I&#39;ve little else to lose and another persons ideas, thoughts or theories cost me nothing in my daily life.</p>

<p>I tend to agree that disclosure would be veiled as <em>something else</em> and for me that takes me to NASA, Space, Universe and mans religion. It will have to be Aliens or Catastrophic Weather?</p>

<p>As others in here have been open to Simulation Theory, Hollow Earth or Off World Colonies,  the majority will shut down hard to straight up End of Days Creation and perhaps some of that is correct <em>thinking</em> given how dark most people find God to be.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t watch TV unless it comes off an internet query. I ditched TV before 9/11 hit. I&#39;m limited in a small town by time, budget and physical constraints to Library etc. so lots of PDF that I then have to back-channel research. </p>

<p>Enjoy your day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See I felt the same way 2 years ago and set out to disprove it and here I am now, it’s a personal journey because it’s lead me to smite and deeper truths alit of people won’t connect the dots. But I say the best way to approach it is with the idea of trying to disprove it. You’ll soon realize it is not extremely difficult which it should be </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another good one: if the horizon is caused by light distortion through atmosphere, then why can you see for 150 miles or more from an airplane but not from the top of a building? Why do these line of sight observations perfectly match the predictions that the Earth is curved almost exactly like a ball? Another similar observation: why is sunset significantly later in an airplane than it is on the ground below?  You curvature of the Earth is something which can be appreciated with your eyes. People complain &quot;but the horizon looks pretty flat even at high altitude&quot;. Slow down. Think. Why is the horizon a <strong>circle</strong> that goes all around you and why does that circle get bigger when you climb altitude? That&#39;s the curvature. </p>
