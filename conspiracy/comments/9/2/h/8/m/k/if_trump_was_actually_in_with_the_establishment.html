    <div class="md"><p>I thought Trump vs. Clinton was a CIA &quot;Red Team&quot; vs. &quot;Blue Team&quot; exercise since the primaries.  Both of them are corporatists; and both pass their AIPAC test.</p>

<p>Trump got 75x more coverage than Bernie--even though there was a field of over 12 candidates in the Republican primaries; while the Dems were basically Hillary and Bernie.</p>

<p>Bernie was shafted because he: a) wanted to tax Wall St.; b) wanted to allow local post offices to offer basic banking services; c) is critical of Israel&#39;s treatment of the Palestinians; d) is critical of overthrowing governments.  </p>

<p>I think the billionaire class wants a divided America--easier to control.  Having such toxic figures in both parties feeds the news cycle and gives Americans the false &quot;freedom of choice.&quot;  Toxic politicians also assures no real issues are ever brought to the forefront--just clickbait BS gossip-level crap.  </p>

<p>In the end, only 47% of registered voters actually voted--imagine if there were no Trump or Clinton...would the 2016 election have been under 40%?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he&#39;s in on it. He jumps in cuts regulation and all this shit, the rich get encased in gold and their societal positions protected. They then drop the economy and trump makes a face saving tough call to war after a vile event. A savior comes in and cleans up all trumps wrongs and praises trump for his courage and will to stand up to evil. The people will be scared to elect an outsider or challenge the 2 corporate parties. The rich won&#39;t have to compete as we switch to a servuce/ technology economy. The rich have bought up all the stock and properties and we become serfs meant to rent and lease and have microgains I the economy. We level our empire with Russia and the EU to compete against Asia. America doesn&#39;t have to be the sole shame of global echelon cronyism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama really laid down some of the finishing infrastructure for the world government system. I was ready to go, but required a big event to kick off the transition. I think WW3 was going to be that event. Obama&#39;s admin was trying hard to provoke Russian. Hillary had stated she would take military action with Russia over hacking. The whole Russia think is still going on. So war with Russia was going to kick off WW3 and they would create the world government out of the ashes...IMO  The first world war was supposed to be a war to end all war. This time the slogan would be a world government to end all war. </p>
