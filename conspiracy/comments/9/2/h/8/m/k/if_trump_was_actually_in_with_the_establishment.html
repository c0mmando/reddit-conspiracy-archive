       I think hes really big. He has done a lot for reinstating faith in America to many Americans. Has grown over the months.

       I thought Trump vs. Clinton was a CIA "Red Team" vs. "Blue Team" exercise since the primaries.  Both of them are corporatists; and both pass their AIPAC test.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump got 75x more coverage than Bernie--even though there was a field of over 12 candidates in the Republican primaries; while the Dems were basically Hillary and Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie was shafted because he: a) wanted to tax Wall St.; b) wanted to allow local post offices to offer basic banking services; c) is critical of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians; d) is critical of overthrowing governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the billionaire class wants a divided America--easier to control.  Having such toxic figures in both parties feeds the news cycle and gives Americans the false "freedom of choice."  Toxic politicians also assures no real issues are ever brought to the forefront--just clickbait BS gossip-level crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, only 47% of registered voters actually voted--imagine if there were no Trump or Clinton...would the 2016 election have been under 40%?

       So it's not scripted as in "written line by line" but essentially what you're saying is that it is controlled in terms of the outcome. Colloquially, it's the same thing.

       I think he's in on it. He jumps in cuts regulation and all this shit, the rich get encased in gold and their societal positions protected. They then drop the economy and trump makes a face saving tough call to war after a vile event. A savior comes in and cleans up all trumps wrongs and praises trump for his courage and will to stand up to evil. The people will be scared to elect an outsider or challenge the 2 corporate parties. The rich won't have to compete as we switch to a servuce/ technology economy. The rich have bought up all the stock and properties and we become serfs meant to rent and lease and have microgains I the economy. We level our empire with Russia and the EU to compete against Asia. America doesn't have to be the sole shame of global echelon cronyism.

       They were completely ready for their one world government transition until Trump came along. The only way this scenario works is if they, for some weird reason, changed their mind about the one world government they had been working towards for decades.

       Obama really laid down some of the finishing infrastructure for the world government system. I was ready to go, but required a big event to kick off the transition. I think WW3 was going to be that event. Obama's admin was trying hard to provoke Russian. Hillary had stated she would take military action with Russia over hacking. The whole Russia think is still going on. So war with Russia was going to kick off WW3 and they would create the world government out of the ashes...IMO  The first world war was supposed to be a war to end all war. This time the slogan would be a world government to end all war.

       Not to take away from the trump worship but I thought the Obama worship was just as good.  The Bush Jr.  was good too.  In fact, in all times a prez gets in there is nothing but bullshit admiration and whitewashing going on.  To pave the way for their presidency.

       no. This never happened before. Obama had this bullshit legacy. Bush? They thought he did 9/11.

       I'm sorry but this is totally NOT the case. I know America is a big place but where are you from that this is the overwhelming opinion? Pretty sure majority of Americans see him as sociopathic imbecile that he has continuously proved himself to be.

       Yeah but that's my point......you're believing the media when they hype all of this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are going to want to jack people up and get them fighting....they'll do it.  If they can get people to think that other supposedly very racist idiots think the man is a gift from god, they'll tell you that too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, I don't think you should take anything they say seriously and especially when it angers you amd makes you feel like you're in a minority in a machine driven by a madman and his disciples.
