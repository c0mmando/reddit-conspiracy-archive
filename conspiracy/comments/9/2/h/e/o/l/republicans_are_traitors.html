        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This meme has steadily been increasing momentum on reddit, and I believe it to be a concerted effort behind its creation. The council on foreign relations would love nothing better to have the right be diminished into insignificance so a one party system can come into being. Are republicans great? Well, for the most part no, they aren’t. I’ve actually disagreed and even despised many of them since I started questioning authorizes since 2001. Regardless, there is not even close to enough hard evidence to prove that they are actually controlled by Russia. Did Russia help them? Maybe so, but does that make them culpable? Simply put, I believe the powers that be are trying to convince the left that the right is not only racist and elitist but also completely controlled by Putin. How he did it doesn’t seem to be important, but the idea that he somehow has direct control of half of our government is spreading like wildfire. Folks, first conspiracy theorists and republicans were lumped together when Alex jones endorsed trump, now trump and Russia are colliding because trump didn’t put sanctions on them and asked them to find Hillary’s emails. This is not quite enough evidence to convict him of treason in real life, but on Reddit it seems to be a settled conclusion. I believe we are witnessing an attempt to make USA a one party government that will inevitably lead to a authoritarian regime posing as the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Sorry, but it absolutely is. He conspired with a hostile foreign government to influence the election. Now he&#39;s asking that government how he should run our country. I, for one, remember when the GOP actually despised Russia and Nazis. Now they&#39;re proudly conspiring with Russia and choosing Nazis as their candidates. I&#39;ll probably get downvoted for this comment but Trump conspired with Russia. That&#39;s a fucking actual conspiracy and most of the users in r/conspiracy don&#39;t care. Wtf? </p>
