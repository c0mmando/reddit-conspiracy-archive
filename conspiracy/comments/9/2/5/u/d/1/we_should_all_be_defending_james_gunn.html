       Pedo panic is the new McCarythism. The self-proclaimed autists digging up old tweets might think they're fighting for "the children," but what they're really doing is playing foot soldiers in a moral panic that could be turned on anyone, and that's being weaponized for clicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free speech matters - even gross, offensive speech like Gunn's old tweets. And if he can be fired for telling some bad jokes, anyone can have their past dug up and used against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Took a picture of yourself eating pizza? You're a pedo. Tweeted a pic with your arm around your own kid? You're a pedo. Showed even the slightest hesitation about destroying someone's career because of old tweets? You're a pedo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't matter if there's no credible accusation. Doesn't matter if there's no victim. Doesn't matter if there's no evidence at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the mob decides you're a pedo, you're a pedo.
      </p>
      <p>
       James Gunn was just the next victim. Who comes after him?
      </p>
      <p>
       You, maybe.

       I agree with a lot of Sutton's work and acknowledge that there was reason to believe there were spies, but the way the inquests were carried out is wholly wrong in my opinion. It was a panic and in that panic lots of people were targeted simply for being political or personal enemies of the wrong people.

      </p>
      <p>
       "During the McCarthy era, hundreds of Americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or

       </a>
       panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, educators and labor union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was sometimes exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment or destruction of their careers; some even suffered imprisonment. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned,

       I understand you whole free speech part but do you not see what he’s “joking” about. Free speech is one thing An yes everyone has the ability to use it. but using it to talk about children like that shows the type of person you are An the type of things you are into. I don’t know about you but I don’t sit around thinking about doing shit to kids An then tweeting about it

       Free speech has nothing to do with this. He was and is free to say whatever he wants without the government enforcing any kind of laws on him. A company is completely allowed to fire someone for an employee saying something they don't like. They are not the same thing.

       What does the constitution have to do with this? The government hasn't done anything to the guy. People were disgusted by what he said so they are understandably distancing themselves from him. No laws were broken and people are associating freely with who they want to.

       And this is the fact lost on SO many people. An employer has every right to fire an employee who does anything they don't want to be associated with. Just because he said it before he was hired doesn't change that. If he had really changed like he claimed (after the fact) then he would have removed it then, not after it was made a bigger deal. All he is to me is the cheating spouse who apologizes after getting caught. Yeah, I'm sure you are sorry James... that you got caught.

       Oh it's for sure real.  That's why they need to invent terms and social constructs to hide it.  Satanic Panic was a social construct.  False Memory Syndrome, social construct.  Most recently Fake News... a social construct.  OP uses "pedo panic" which may be a social construct they're trying out to see if it sticks.  Not the first time I've seen "pedo panic" in last few weeks.

       Last Man Standing was cancelled because it was going into a season where the cast was due a huge pay bump, and ABC didn't actually own the rights to it. They'd be spending way more than they stood to make from it. That's why Fox revived it - they owned the rights to the show, ABC just licensed it.

       Bill Cosby used to joke about drugging women to take advantage sexually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedophilia must not be tolerated.   A grown man who repeatedly talks and "jokes" about it has horrible judgment and may be a pedophile.  What exactly is the humor in talking about urinating on kids and being in NAMBLA?

       Picasso had his blue period, Gunn his kids decade? Is this where you're going?

       Gunn and his convicted child porn buddy shared child porn.   Child porn is the sexual exploitation of children.   As for the chance of victims speaking up, we'll see.   It can take adults a long time to work up the courage and deal with their trauma.   When the victims are children it gets much more complicated.   I know from relatives who were abused that they did speak up, but the adults decided it was better not to pursue the matter.  In particular, law enforcement convinced the parents of the victim that having her take the witness stand could retraumatize her.

       Explains a lot.   You need to Break on Through to the Other Side..
      </p>
      <p>
       I enjoyed the Guardians movies, they were fine, mostly forgettable like most comic book fare.   Just find it interesting how some people are so quick to excuse pedophilia.  Your position seems to be that publicly talking about raping children, urinating on them, raping an unconscious girlfriend in the ass  etc..  that all of this should be tolerated by an employer.    Most of us live in a world where merely being late to work too many times will get you tossed, heck, doing nothing wrong whatsoever you'll get tossed if the company reorganizes or merges.    So it's fascinating to see some people so upset that a multi millionaire was told his services would no longer be needed after his highly questionable conduct came to public attention.    In Hollywood people are often out of work when they seemingly did nothing wrong at all.   You'll see an actress give a great performance but she doesn't get cast again for years.    I guess it's a bit strange that the pedophile director merits all of this concern.   Besides the people who want to continue normalizing deviancy we have the political aspect of this.   Roseanne deserves to have her hit show cancelled over a couple tweets cause she doesn't hate the President, but Gunn should work forever despite pedophilia because he attacked the President.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sigh,   Not good times for America.  It's like some of the feminists who all of a sudden think Stormy Daniels is a heroine for being a backstabbing blackmailing drug addict whore with a sleazy ambulance chaser at her side.   Supposedly there was a consensual affair a decade ago and she sought money to shut up.   She got paid.   Then she wanted more.   She's not a good person.   Anyway, your boy Gunn has money in the bank and he'll get to do other work.

       Look it’s quite simple. You can joke make a joke about pedophilia without being a pedophile. Roseanne called a black woman an ape — that, in itself, is an act of racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Roseanne’s coworkers didn’t want to work with her anymore because she publicly committed an act of racism. Gunn’s coworkers want him back because he committed no act of pedophilia.

       Nazi panic is the new McCarythism. The self-proclaimed SJW's digging up old tweets might think they're fighting for "minorities," but what they're really doing is playing foot soldiers in a moral panic that could be turned on anyone, and that's being weaponized for clicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free speech matters - even gross, offensive speech like Peterson's old tweets. And if he can be fired for telling some bad jokes, anyone can have their past dug up and used against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Took a picture of yourself drinking milk? You're a Nazi. Tweeted a pic flashing the 'ok' symbol? You're a Nazi. Showed even the slightest hesitation about destroying someone's career because of old tweets? You're a Nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't matter if there's no credible accusation. Doesn't matter if there's no victim. Doesn't matter if there's no evidence at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the mob decides you're a Nazi, you're a Nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jordan Peterson was just the next victim. Who comes after him?
      </p>
      <p>
       You, maybe.

       I understand you whole free speech part but do you not see what he’s “joking” about. Free speech is one thing An yes everyone has the ability to use it. but using it to talk about children like that shows the type of person you are An the type of things you are into. I don’t know about you but I don’t sit around thinking about doing shit to kids An then tweeting about it
