       Why would the leader of a country be exempt from this? If we're talking more power= more freaky cult shit, then this makes total sense. The illuminati and the like make you do crazy weird shit to get into their club, so that they can blackmail you if you ever talk about it Orr go against them. They use you as a puppet to suit their agenda for masses and give you a little pocket change and ten minutes of fame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really fucked up when you think about how this goes down face to face; realizing you would hurt children or do obscene sexual acts just for that...They really must sell their should, cuz there ain't no way a feeling soul could do that.

       Yes, it separates the wheat from the chaff though.  In politics you want a leader who can sleep at night after launching a huge missile attack that will murder thousands of children.  Remember, these leaders see the uncut footage of their carnage.  Slamming your meat inside a few kids then killing them is nothing when compared to what these animals are capable of.
      </p>
      <p>
       With politics comes the media, you must control what the sheep think.  So you push through actors, directors, agents, managers that you meet in your little murder/sex parties.  A gay guy can deduce if someone is gay within seconds, a pedo can deduce if someone is a pedo in seconds too.  So, they only push new actors they feel pretty sure would like to fuck some kids.  If the pedodar was off and the actor isn't 'into it's, you just kill the bastard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop wondering who is a child fucker.  If they're in the mainstream then take it as a fact that they are.  Remember, these pedos control all the media and government on all sides.  All the right wing stuff is controlled by the sabme hands that control the left.  Trump will 100% be a card carrying child fucker, just as the Clinton's, Obama's, Bush's are.  Every celebrity you know will fuck kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the day it was better, actors and government just used to suck cocks and get butt slammed.  Now they need to be child killers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are always some who aren't in the special club.  Some directors, producers and actors won't fuck or kill kids.  They are the ones who never achieve the fame they deserve, or they are merely a flash in the pan, three or four hit movies and they're gone.  The De Niro's, Johnny Depp's and Tom Cruise's are all balls deep inside children.

       Look what they put in the middle of the Oscars2018. Bana Alabed- The 8 year old daughter of a terrorist in Syria was featured in the #MeToo movement song that was at the peak of the show. The little girl was center stage. If they can do this then they can do lots of other very bad things.

       Wow people really do worship that guy for whatever reason, he didn't do shit for us, why do so many people think he did?

      <p>
       He killed innocent children and families through numerous drone strikes, I know that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and he got the Nobel Peace Prize, for whatever reason.  Maybe for keeping Guantanamo open, continuing the wars we've been in for almost 20 years, and doing nothing for education. Just because he was "cool", and hung out with celebrities like JayZ and shit, people overlook all the bad shit he did. Pathetic.

       Obvious? The only person who I can remember who came out and named someone was Corey Feldman. And he pumped up the guy who did it as some MAJOR Hollywood player, that was so powerful, Feldman was afraid to say the name. When he finally names the guy, it is some no name ass guy with like one B Movie directing credit to his name in the '80's.

UPDATE: New Names Dropped. Here's one: Tom Hanks

        UPDATE: Isaac Kappy has dropped more names in new video. These names include Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. Kappy goes on to say that he believes Michael Jackson was innocent and that Jackson hated Spielberg. He claims that the high up the elitist hierarchy you, go, the more sick the people are. He says pedophilia is only the beginning. The next step up is murder, which is the level politicians are at and the top level includes cannibalism, the level where the Rothschild's are.
       </p>
       <p>
        He claims parents of the child actors are aware of this and it is a form of child trafficking that the parents take part in. Most people have a hard time believing this because, according to Kappy, people are generally good and want to believe everyone else is too.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here is Kappy's full list:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Seth Green
        </li>
        <li>
         James Gunn
        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
         Tom Hanks

       For fuck's sake, not every spiral is a paedophile symbol. People have been drawing spiral designs (whether circular or angular) since the days of cave paintings. And the FBI circular stated that they had found those symbols being used only by a small number of people to indicate their own personal preference, so it makes no sense for businessses or government agencies to be using them. How does a sheriff's department have a personal sexual preference?

       Honestly, the idea of Tom Hanks being part of any such thing is fucking laughable.

       At not point have I ever seen or heard of him at any of the 'Nati meetings (as we call them in the club.) /sarcasm

       The burden of proof is on those making the claim. Without evidence these claims can be dismissed without counter evidence.

       The site is riddled with ads and the news first got attention from 4chan users.
       <br/>
       I just feel it's a clickbait from people who want to make quick buck. Web traffic hoarding, if you will.
       <br/>
       There is little to no credibility to these guys and have been just naming things with little to no proof.

       Issac Kappy who? IMDB lists him as short roles actor, again claims like "Seth Green offered me $250,000 to join illuminati" just makes me laugh.

       It is clickbait. Never seen this source but app those _____ pundut websites tend to be shit. The quality of the site is obviously a joke, checked the registration it's to some small place in a random town in NC. Some dude is clearly pumping shit articles out of his basement.

       Yes, it separates the wheat from the chaff though.  In politics you want a leader who can sleep at night after launching a huge missile attack that will murder thousands of children.  Remember, these leaders see the uncut footage of their carnage.  Slamming your meat inside a few kids then killing them is nothing when compared to what these animals are capable of.
      </p>
      <p>
       With politics comes the media, you must control what the sheep think.  So you push through actors, directors, agents, managers that you meet in your little murder/sex parties.  A gay guy can deduce if someone is gay within seconds, a pedo can deduce if someone is a pedo in seconds too.  So, they only push new actors they feel pretty sure would like to fuck some kids.  If the pedodar was off and the actor isn't 'into it's, you just kill the bastard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop wondering who is a child fucker.  If they're in the mainstream then take it as a fact that they are.  Remember, these pedos control all the media and government on all sides.  All the right wing stuff is controlled by the sabme hands that control the left.  Trump will 100% be a card carrying child fucker, just as the Clinton's, Obama's, Bush's are.  Every celebrity you know will fuck kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the day it was better, actors and government just used to suck cocks and get butt slammed.  Now they need to be child killers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are always some who aren't in the special club.  Some directors, producers and actors won't fuck or kill kids.  They are the ones who never achieve the fame they deserve, or they are merely a flash in the pan, three or four hit movies and they're gone.  The De Niro's, Johnny Depp's and Tom Cruise's are all balls deep inside children.

       Look what they put in the middle of the Oscars2018. Bana Alabed- The 8 year old daughter of a terrorist in Syria was featured in the #MeToo movement song that was at the peak of the show. The little girl was center stage. If they can do this then they can do lots of other very bad things.
