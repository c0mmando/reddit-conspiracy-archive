        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I voted for trump and I will never identify as a Republican. (I live in the states, grew up in the south, now go to school in the Midwest) I think with that term comes corruption. My conspiracy is that trump paid into Washington for a long ass time. He knows everyone who’s getting paid to do whatever the rich want. Political views have nothing to do with it. And now he is finally in a position to expose them and that’s why even the republicans in office hate him. Why else would fox and CNN both attack him (not all of fox attacks him but do you catch my drift?) if he was really a monster do you really believe he would be in power? I think he’s a brilliant business man who is an old fucker who speaks his mind and doesn’t make it sound pretty. He knew what the people wanted, he knew how he’d win, and he did what he had to to win. 
But the shit that is posted on Facebook is edited more often than not. And I’m sure that goes for other politicians as well. But it makes sense what I’m saying. I’m not saying trump would be a cool neighbor to have tea with, but I’m saying I don’t think he’s a racist or an abuser. I was raised by an abuser. I know them. I see them everywhere. I know how to spot them. He is not an abuser in the sense the media wants him to be. </p>

<p>But that’s my thoughts. Everyone is welcome to have theirs and it would be pretty cool to have an adult conversation about it. I think it’s important to give views and see what the other side has to say (without swearing and hate). And maybe I’m too optimistic or just naïve, but hey isn’t that what anonymous reddit is for? To say things we can’t say to anyone? </p>

<p>Don’t be an asshole, maybe you’ll change my mind or someone else’s who is open to discussion, but you won’t if you’re an ass about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I see what you’re saying and I agree with it, but I also think he knows what needs to be done to get where he wants to be. Yeah his dad gave him one million dollars (who knows if my or your sources are correct). Also I don’t actually know about his losses, but I do know when people report losses on taxes (correct me if I’m wrong), there are loopholes to end up making money? But from what I know, which isn’t much because I don’t spend my days googling him(again I may have bad sources), is that he is a billionaire, he has many different businesses and is successful at a lot of them, if he wants to do something he does it and figures out who to pay to do it well. I don’t think he is stupid, by any means. </p>

<p>Also what do you mean by “pissed most of it away”? From my understanding he was giving a “loan” or probably actually a trust of one million dollars and used that to start himself. Are you talking about this or just that he was a rich kid who did whatever the fuck he wanted (which is also probably true) Which is not feasible for 99.9% of people and I totally get that and think it’s absurd to think he is entirely self made. Even if he didn’t get money from his dad, he still came from success and has the name. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump has been widely known as a failure. No actual business man looks at him as a genius business man. His father gave him much more than 1 million dollars. His first business venture is still the only successful venture he has had and that was completely financed by his father. The only reason that was successful was Roy Cohn negotiated a sweetheart tax deal with the city. Everything he has done on his own was a colossal failure. His casinos, his (fraudulent) university etc. The actual billionaires in NYC thought of him as a laughing stock. A man who became a celebrity for being rich but they knew he was anything but. His “businesses” are really just licensing deals that he attached his name too. He’s a celebrity, nothing more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there is any conspiracy with Trump at all. What you see is what you get with him.</p>

<p>Trump is saying the same things he has always been saying. His number one focus is the economy, which is the #1 issue with voters every election, every time. His policies have done more for the US economy in 2 years than Obama did in 8.</p>

<p>I truly do believe he has real Americans best interests at heart. He&#39;s doing the stuff no other politician would ever dream of doing. </p>

<p>He&#39;s exactly what we needed at the most critical junction in our nations history and the people see that as clear as ever.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t try to make him look bad, Trump&#39;s behavior is controversial enough that it warrants the negative headlines. He brings it on himself, I&#39;d say 75% of the time it&#39;s his Twitter ramblings. Seriously, if he just stopped using Twitter the news would have almost nothing to report. But the man can&#39;t stop stirring up controversies and unsubstanciated conspiracy theories that are designed to question the credibility of everyone that doesn&#39;t bow down to him. <strong>There is seriously something wrong with Trump&#39;s behavior.</strong> The man has made a habit of insulting our allies, nearly <em>every single one</em>, in fact<em>.</em> He attacks journalists, celebrities and even businesses whenever they do or say something he doesn&#39;t approve of. He attacks our own government institutions and our first amendment rights. He&#39;s called for libel law reform to make it easier to sue journalists for &quot;fake news.&quot; He&#39;s called democrats &quot;treasonous&quot; for not applauding him at his State of the Union. He&#39;s called journalists the &quot;enemy of the people.&quot; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/15/opinion/leonhardt-trump-racist.html">And anyone that thinks he isn&#39;t at all racist is refusing to acknowledge reality.</a>  </p>

<p>And yet he has <strong>never once</strong> said anything negative about Putin. Why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also don&#39;t agree with the twitter thing, I don&#39;t understand why he tweets a lot of what he tweets. There has to be a reason for it, but I do see what you&#39;re saying. I mean I believe he isn&#39;t crazy, I think he is methodical and there is a reason for what he does. but again maybe in naive.

I don&#39;t know what to believe I choose to believe the benefit of the doubt, I don&#39;t want to live in a world where I feel all hope is lost and our president is playing with our country&#39;s future.

<p>Trump kept asking &quot;<em>That political machine over there...  it&#39;s making horrible noise, not working.  and leaking blood all over the carpet.   Anyone going to fix that?  Anyone?</em>&quot;</p>

<p>And never got any response other than &quot;soon&quot; or &#39;why don&#39;t you fix it.&#39;.  </p>

<p>And after 40 years of it not being fixed, he got up off his nice comfy life chair and is damm well going to fix it.         </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. One of many shady things he&#39;s been up to</p>

<p>There&#39;s those patents <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/08/china-approves-trump-trademarks-businesses">Trump was trying to get approved for 10 years:</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>China has granted preliminary approval for 38 new Trump trademarks, paving the way for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and his family to potentially develop a host of branded businesses from hotels to insurance to bodyguard and escort services, public documents show.   </p>

<p>Trump’s lawyers in China applied for the marks in April 2016, as Trump railed against China at campaign rallies, accusing it of currency manipulation and stealing US jobs. Critics maintain that Trump’s swelling portfolio of China trademarks raises serious conflict of interest questions. <strong>China</strong> <strong>already registered one trademark to the president, for Trump-branded construction services on 14 February, the result of a 10-year legal battle that turned in Trump’s favor after he declared his candidacy.</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-tariffs-near-trumps-business-empire-includes-china-ties/2018/07/05/9bfd1056-7956-11e8-aeee-4d04c8ac6158_story.html?utm_term=.f763249f5751">Then there is this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In May, Trump’s partner in Indonesia — MNC Corp. — announced that it had signed a construction contract with another state-run Chinese company, the Metallurgical Corporation of China, for its planned Lido City development. Plans for that project, in a mountainous area of West Java, include a Trump-branded golf course, hotels and villas.  </p>

<p>Days later, Trump announced his support for Chinese-backed telecommunications firm ZTE, a departure from his previously aggressive stance toward Chinese industry that prompted Democrats and ethical experts to question whether the two actions were related.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could go on for another 30 minutes but it&#39;s almost 4am. You get the point. The dude isn&#39;t  going to train the swamp, <strong>he is the swamp.</strong> It&#39;s disturbing that his supporters pretend this isn&#39;t happening but it is. There&#39;s a reason the President is supposed to divest from business interests, especially if they&#39;re international: what if the U.S. needs to take action against a country (for whatever reason) and he has business deals that would be negatively impacted by his actions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I second this. I don’t think he expected himself to win, and would use Hillary/Democrats/rigged election as an excuse. He would have been this American patriot figurehead in the minds of his supporters, his brand would have seen increases in revenue etc. The picture I attached can clearly be taken out of context or just at the wrong time, but with everyone around him being so cheery I think it’s something to consider.</p>

<p>My main issue with him is nothing means anything in this administration and that sets a horrible precedent. He’s recorded saying something on video, 2 hours later says he never said that, and a day later we have the Press Sec spewing the same lie, all while we have the original footage showing he’s just lying. Facts, statistics, nothing carries any weight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s an interesting take on the first point you made. I see that. Also, yeah that’s a great picture for this discussion. He may be internalizing things, he may be disappointed, or surprised or maybe he was napping because he is 72 (lol that was a joke for any grumpy guss out there). For your last point, I’d have to see the video to know what you’re talking about. For those types of things I can’t trust it unless I hear it and see it and see the proof, does that make sense or does it only make sense in my mind? I just can’t speak to it without the video to watch on it but thank you for your commentary, I appreciate your thoughts :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I feel like to, I feel like 99% of Washington is corrupt. Why else would the bush family, the Clintons, and  the Obamas be best buddies now? the politicians from both sides of the isle party together and do whatever the fuck they want, its sad and its all fucked. that&#39;s also why I don&#39;t think its worth arguing about, but the discussions are interested to have </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is a Saruman.  </p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t want to destroy the ring.  He wants it for himself.  He doesn&#39;t want to eliminate the Dark Lord.  He wants to replace the Dark Lord.  </p>

<p>The establishment hates Trump (and the degree to which they hate him at this point is up for debate) not because Trump wants to break them, but because he wants to rule them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying Trump is Super Hitler.  I&#39;m saying Trump isn&#39;t trying to upend or destroy the establishment or the deep state, but is instead trying to rule it and bend it to his will.  </p>

<p>Has Trump stopped or even slowed the NSA from spying on you?  No, he isn&#39;t.  He&#39;s pulling security clearances of people who are being personally &quot;mean&quot; to him.  With a move like that, the goal isn&#39;t to stop the deep state from doing what it&#39;s been doing.  It&#39;s to make the deep state less willing and afraid to challenge Trump.  </p>

<p>And you can look at every aspect of the establishment, and see the same thing happening.</p>
