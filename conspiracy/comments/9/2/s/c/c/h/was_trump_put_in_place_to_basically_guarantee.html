       So I feel like having Trump put in place has basically guaranteed that no matter who he comes up against in the next election is basically guaranteed a decisive victory, most likely 2 terms, while also setting the precedent to keep anyone without a political background out of the White House for the foreseeable future. It will also bolster the next Presidents resume undoing everything Trump has done to bring the US downwards compared to taking the reigns from the a traditional President, making their Presidential impact upon taking office seem bigger than it actually is. Just my 2 cents.

       Approval rating plummeted?   He didn't have an approval rating when he started, it's been rising.  Don't believe the bs they try to feed you.  They also said Hillary would win in decisive fashion.

       What country are you from? A lot of people who voted for him still like him. I donâ€™t mean the hate crap or the edited videos, but he doing or at least trying to do what he said he would do. The people who he promised heâ€™d help, he is helping. He knew exactly who to market to and he went at it full force. There are a lot of people in the states who identified with what he said and what he promised. Clinton did what she thought would sound good. It was rigged for her to win. It should have been sanders vs trump and I think it would have been close (not a sanders supporter). I think heâ€™ll win again, I really do. People who voted for him will vote for him again over a far left democrat. Well I donâ€™t know because a lot of sanders supporters voted for trump because they felt betrayed by the dem party after he lost to her. Idk Iâ€™m not an expert but thatâ€™s how people feel.

       It's remarkable, but he seems indeed to be pushing for his campaign promises, and since those resonated with the voters where it was needed, I do think he'll get re-elected as well.

       Unless of course the democrats run a credible left-wing alternative. In case of Sanders vs. Trump Sanders would have won, because the blue collars would have been inaccesible for Trump. In 2020 Sanders has slightly less chance, because Trump has shown he backs the talk with actions, but Sanders is not without chance there.

       Yes. They voted for Trump in large part because of his stance on trade, which was the same as Sanders' stance on trade. The rest of Sanders' programme was way better for them than the republican-light programme of Trump. But trade was the breaking point with regards to Clinton and Sanders had that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll go even further, Clinton with Sanders as VP would have easily won as well, for the same reasons, more or less.

       I donâ€™t necessarily agree, I know a lot of blue collar people who were always on the trump train. But I do agree sanders and trump had similar views and talking points for many things (I didnâ€™t research sanders stances because I was automatically turned off by him being so far left, which may not even be true, but that was my thinking at the time). 
You may be right that Clinton would have won with him as the vp. Did he ask and he denied her? Or was she too stupid to ask?

       The latter I think. And stupid is not the right word IMHO, as her 'stupidity' is mainly a HUGE disconnect from the voters.

       I donâ€™t think sheâ€™s stupid I was just phrasing the question- but I know itâ€™s not really up to her as she probably has/had a whole team of people telling her what to do. But I agree with that statement as well

       Your 2 cents isn't worth a penny. Trump's approval rating going up, he is clearly gaining support. The more the left throws a temper tantrum the more support he gets.

       But he has no worshipers in any area were there are actual people. Sure all of Montana loves him but there are more people going through the turnstiles of penn station on a Tuesday morning than there are in the entire state of Montana. His worshipers are all from BumFuck,USA. He got crushed in the popular vote and that was before he got on tv and groveled in front of Putin.
