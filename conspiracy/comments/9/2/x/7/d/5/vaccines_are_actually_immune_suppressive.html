<p>When  I was pro-vax I used to hear anti-vaxxer parents say things like &quot;my  second kid is unvaccinated and never ever gets sick!&quot; And I&#39;d roll my  eyes and be like &quot;what does that have to do with anything? Getting a cold or flu has nothing to do with whether or not you got your polio shot.&quot; WRONG.</p>

<p>Vaccines take down the body&#39;s defenses while attempting to create antibodies for what was just injected.  This leaves you vulnerable to  everything else around you. Ever notice how fully vaccinated kids are  always getting bronchitis, ear infections, stuff like that, while these tree hugger hippy unvaccinated kids are always healthy?</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t think this is a government conspiracy to kill  everyone. I really just think the medical community is so entrenched in its <em>vaccines are safe and effective</em> mantra, that they can&#39;t ever go back. No amount of evidence showing their immunosuppressive effects and no amount of vaccine injury government payouts can make them turn back at this point. </p>

<p>This is disturbing. Thought there were supposedly no studies on multiple vaccines at once.  Apparently there is, and the test subjects had some serious issues.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just glancing over the studies that you posted there. Some are so old that they are a bit suspect. Biomedical research moves quickly, and papers published even 10 years ago may be deprecated (not to mind 50 years ago). If there a valid research avenue why do we need to go looking to papers in the 70’s. Also, being published does not mean the research or outcome have any merit. Just stating these facts to help people gain some context.</p>

<p>On the hippy children being healthy theory; I would put forward the idea that these infants are more often breast fed from birth and for longer into childhood. This would confer a fantastic advantage over other infants in terms of immunity to ear infections etc..</p>

<p>There vaccines themselves haven&#39;t been through double-blind trials using inert placebos, they are also mostly tested by the industry who profits from them (keep in mind CDC is an industry-captured too).  The mainstream media received pharma advertising dollars, they push vaccines hard, so be skeptical of vaccines themselves, they are not evidence based, more of a cult or at best a pseudoscience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that breatfeeding stops some vaccines from working, and rather than CDC just ditch those vaccines, they instead recommend delaying breastfeeding, this of course means the milk will dry up and the child won’t get breastfed.  As you can see this is the tail wagging the dog, clearly because CDC is a Big Pharma proxy rather than an agency which is there to give honest evidence based health information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see the argument but the paper published that you linked is not a CDC recommendation to halt breastfeeding. The writer actually says “To be fair, the paper does not recommend that mothers stop breastfeeding, merely that they delay nursing at the time that the vaccine is administered.”. Also, a CDC funded study making conclusions is not the same as a CDC directive. </p>

<p>I don’t like how the US views breastfeeding in any case. I prefer how we deal with it here in the EU and I would trust the EMA over the CDC/FDA (although that may just be location-based bias). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that if you stop breastfeeding even for a short time the breast milk quickly dries up and will not return.</p>

<p>The US government treatment of breastfeeding is the big giveaway that the government doesn&#39;t really care about your children, that they are only pushing vaccines in response to Big Pharma lobbying, as breastfeeding is far more important than vaccination could ever be, yet they make no big push.</p>

<p>A study is valid regardless of age. If it was valid 20 years ago why should it be invalid today.</p>

<p>I believe the reason that we cannot &quot;trust our own observations&quot; is indeed what our educational system is arguing. A certain effect may be found in an individual or a smaller sample, but for a truly representative effect to be determined, data must be gathered from a larger sample, hence why anecdotal evidence is generally not accepted within our educational system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To counter your anecdotal evidence I&#39;ll offer mine. Fully vaccinated as a kid, and I got sick a lot as a kid similar to your eldest with chronic ear infections and pink eye but as soon as I hit puberty I just stopped getting sick ever aside from a mild annual cold (I never take the flu vaccine because I never get the flu and the one time I was forced to get it I got pretty sick for 2 weeks after). When my family would get sick I was always the first to get better and had the mildest symptoms. The last time I got sick with anything other than a mild cold was 2014 (before that was 2008) when I had very mild shingles (weird, I know.) brought on by (I assume) stress due to my dad being terminally ill at the time and about to die. My mom chalks my apparently stronger immune system to the fact that she breast fed me longer than my siblings. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true, but it seems plausible. Anyway, my point is that I have a very strong immune system and I&#39;m fully vaccinated. </p>

<p>African children that got the DTP vaccine were 10 times more likely to die from infections than children that did not.</p>

<p>It seems that vaccine protects against certain diseases but at the same time they can make your immune system less able to respond to other infections.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All currently available evidence suggests that DTP vaccine may kill more children from other causes than it saves from diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis. Though a vaccine protects children against the target disease it may simultaneously increase susceptibility to unrelated infections. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no evidence for this theory of mine but I&#39;ve always thought the increase in autoimmune disorders and weakend immune systems is related to increased sanitation and germophobia. Those hippy kids are healthy because their parents actually allow them to play in the dirt and don&#39;t constantly use hand sanitizer and what not on them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not saying anything is invalid, I’m just saying people should read these with skepticism. Some laypeople seem to think that being published means that what you have done and what you have to say has merit. Often this is not the case. I certainly wouldn’t base any health decision on some random paper published in the 70’s. </p>
