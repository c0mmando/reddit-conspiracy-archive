       The U.S. National Security Agency spied on and intercepted the phone calls of Princess Diana right until she died in a Paris car crash with Dodi Fayed in 1997. The NSA currently holds 1,056 pages of classified information about Princess Diana, which has been classified as top secret "because their disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security ... the damage would be caused not by the information about Diana, but because the documents would disclose 'sources and methods' of U.S. intelligence gathering".[58] An official insisted that "the references to Diana in intercepted conversations were 'incidental'," and she was never a 'target' of the NSA eavesdropping.[58]
      </p>
      <p>
       U.K. agents monitored the conversations of the 7th Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan.[59][60]
U.S. agents gathered "detailed biometric information" on the 8th Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-Moon.[61][62]
In the early 1990s, the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted the communications between the European aerospace company Airbus and the Saudi Arabian national airline. In 1994, Airbus lost a $6 billion contract with Saudi Arabia after the NSA, acting as a whistleblower, reported that Airbus officials had been bribing Saudi officials to secure the contract.[63] As a result, the American aerospace company McDonnell Douglas (now part of Boeing) won the multibillion-dollar contract instead of Airbus.[64]
      </p>
      <p>
       The American defense contractor Raytheon won a US$1.3 billion contract with the Government of Brazil to monitor the Amazon rainforest after the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), acting as a whistleblower, reported that Raytheon's French competitor Thomson-Alcatel had been paying bribes to get the contract.[65]
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to boost America's position in trade negotiations with the then Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, in 1995 the CIA eavesdropped on the conversations between Japanese bureaucrats and executives of car manufacturers Toyota and Nissan.

       I guess we need new confirmation every year then.     Because this had been confirmed many times before.    Maybe we just put it out of our mind.

       The degree of snooping increases every year,  the technologies advance.    All the while the media continues to deteriorate and the political situation worsens.   Our movements are now being tracked like never before.    I guess its time for a bunch of new revelations,   but the media would not report it this time.

       You just highlighted precisely why “Snowden” was a limited hangout psyop. Anyone who was paying attention already knew all this shit. He didn’t “reveal” anything. “Snowden” is likely not even a real person for Christ’s sake.

       Came here to say exactly this. If anything, all Snowden did was get the public at large to start engaging in self-censorship and paranoia that the state was always listening to them. They essentially turned the entire country into a kind of

       You are 100% correct. What the “revelations” from “Snowden” accomplished was normalizing the practice. The general public’s mentality shifted from “oh you’re a crazy conspiracy theorist” to “if you have nothing to hide what are you worried about?”

       For me, what made it an interesting leak was that it revealed that everyone was being surveilled. I think most people can accept that governments and corporations would listen in on important people but it seemed like a serious waste of resources to spy on everyone.

       I not saying it was an entirely new revelation, but for a lot of people it was the first they were hearing of mass surveillance not just on people of interest but everyone. That was largely due to the massive press it got, I myself missed the things you mention from 07 and 08.

       Before Snowden, Echelon was common knowledge pretty much only among IT and "conspiracy" followers. The information was out there, and even occasionally in the newspapers but the average person didn't really pick up on it or fully understand it's implications. Snowden at least raised the profile of these issues, so that the average person had a chance to get a behind the scenes glimpse,

       It was huge news at the time.    But it was still lying.   The NSA was already more than a decade into the practice of wholesale data gathering on US citizens,   a practice that it was trying to cover up,  and US politicians were helping them to cover it up,  as was the media.

      <p>
       Average Joe was effectively complicit in being dupped,   but was still being dupped.    It was never that technically complicated.   The only part technically difficult to comprehend was the scale.   Until you look at the size and budget of the NSA.

       Snowden showed an entirely different scale that Echelon.  Echelon was like an 8 track tape built in the 70s.  The new programs collect every single data stream for instant recall without a warrant, and more importantly, these tools were managed by a third tier defense contractor with absolutely no oversight.
