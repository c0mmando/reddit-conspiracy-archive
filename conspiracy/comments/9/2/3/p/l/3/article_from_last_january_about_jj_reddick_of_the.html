I don&#39;t care if you believe there is no God and we walked on the moon. I actually celebrate opposing views, it breeds conversation and discovery.

<p>How do you feel about the fact that the North star moves and that there are ample references in antiquity to there being no North star? Thoughts on Thuban? </p>

<p>I completely support having a discussion about these things and I would never knowingly force a person to be silent. </p>

<p>How long am I supposed to entertain another persons delusion? </p>

<p>If someone came into this sub and starting saying that 2+2=5 how long are we supposed to have that conversation before it becomes clear that person is either ill, trolling or a shill? </p>

<p>Same with FE (Or dino denial) there is evidence that isnt so easily able to be dismissed. There are facts about our world that have to be ignored to make FE work. Much in the same way you <strong>have</strong> to ignore basic rational thought to believe that 2+2=5 </p>

I asked so many questions like, why our we still painting targets. Why we don&#39;t use satelites to triangulate targets. Why would the world lose 90% of the internet if one underwater cable is cut.

<p>So I generally don&#39;t trust anything man tells me unless I can experience it myself. So my mind can be changed if, I can take a flight into low orbit, if I can see a full dinosaur skeleton that is not just replicas, concrete proof that Jesus actually existed. The evidence that is presented to me doesn&#39;t feel like the truth. And after 40 years of being called a nigger and worthless, its hard for me to believe in what I can&#39;t see or touch. The only person who hasn&#39;t lied to me is myself. So a lot of what I believe is not for anyone else. I not only understand that, it gives me peace. The only thing I am really good at is finding secrets in the old testament. I don&#39;t believe in the new testament but I don&#39;t fault anyone who finds peace in that book.</p>

<p>I cant really attest to any of that. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I feel the same way, blind belief is bad. But I wouldnt use the word &quot;experience&quot; so much as I would use the word observe. I cant observe an electron but I understand how a computer works and the observations I have correlate with what I understand about how electricity works even though its a phenomena I cant see or watch in real time. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We have images from low earth orbit, from concordes and SR71&#39;s that show curvature. But even more simply than that we can observe. You and I can observe other planets and see they are not discs, we can observe them and observe how they fit a heliocentric model and not a geocentric one. We can observe the suns movements. Here is a really simple one. </p>

<p>Why does the sun move 15 degrees an hour every hour no matter where you are? </p>

<p>sure you havent been everywhere but you can measure it for yourself. If the Earth were flat and the sun orbited above us the degrees would be different as it approached and moved away from us. Its would shrink and expand beyond 15 degrees an hour. </p>

Until the questions that was asked in the Book of Daniel can be answered, I don’t believe anything man tells. But that’s just me. I can’t change your mind because you are who you are.

<p>Then:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it is shaped like a footstool because my God says so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are not being logical, but delusional. You constantly ignore facts while at the same time taking baseless assumptions and stories as fact.</p>

<p>You did not address this (because you can&#39;t since it obviously <em>proves</em> with math that the earth IS spherical):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why does the sun move 15 degrees an hour every hour no matter where you are?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Math doesn&#39;t lie, if so you wouldn&#39;t any technology at all (no electricity, no cars, no phones, no pipes, no airplanes, not even a house if the math doesn&#39;t add up).</p>

<p>You are gaining nothing by denying reality. Just accept it and move on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is one experiment I did try and that was measuring the cooling light of the moon with a laser thermometer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another thing easily explainable: The moonlight does not cause an object to get colder. It’s the object in the shade that gets warmer.</p>

<p>Science works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you are wrong, objects in direct moonlight became colder than objects in the shade</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>moonlight does not cause an object to get colder</strong>, it’s <strong>the object in the shade</strong> that <strong>gets warmer.</strong></p>

<p>Is it that hard to follow?</p>

<p>When an object (or surface) is covered or shaded with a hand, roof, tree or cloud, it radiates less of its heat into the night air, and it will become slightly warmer than an object (or surface) that is exposed to the open night sky.</p>

<p>Actually, the Moon’s light (which is, of course, reflected sunlight) doesn’t have much to do with it at all. It’s all about Radiative cooling.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I have a problem with. Ignorance is not a bliss, it&#39;s stupidity. You are deliberately choosing ignorance because it might hurt your beliefs.

    <div class="md"><p>Keep saying what you want to hear, but math is the same anywhere in the universe. It&#39;s not one scientist saying nor two, it&#39;s a <strong>mathematical fact</strong>.</p>

<p>Just like the sun and its 15 degrees that prove Earth is spherical (which you keep deliberately ignoring <em>&quot;for some reason&quot;</em>).</p>

<p>I know you won&#39;t admit here because of your ego, but god is bullshit. That&#39;s unprovable because you can&#39;t prove something is not real <em>when it already doesn&#39;t exist</em>. But you can (very easily) prove that the Earth is round and that the moon is there. </p>

<p>What a fucking shame it is that we have flat earthers (or reality-deniers, or whatever you wanna call yourself) in 2018. Just look up. I sincerely hope you&#39;re trolling otherwise just seek help, whatever youtube pseudoscience videos you&#39;re watching well it&#39;s not doing any good to you. Goodbye and keep living in this spherical planet (like all others in this 14billion year old universe - easily provable with math, observation and experiments that you can do yourself if you also study physics in college)</p>

<p>I doubt anyone who has need to reassure themselves that they&#39;re happy.</p>

<p>Anyways, you can be happy accepting reality. No imaginary god will take away or bring happiness into your life, it&#39;s all on your own.</p>

<p>Also it&#39;s amazing how you keep this farse ignoring <em>every</em> argument presented. You already know the earth is round (it became pretty obvious from the moment you started ignoring the abundant evidence against it), it&#39;s a matter of time now before you forget you even were this delusional.</p>

<p>Once you see it (the truth) you can never unsee it. Everyday when you look at the sun you will see it moves 15 degrees an hour every hour no matter where you are in the <em>globe</em>, and no blind faith will change that.</p>

<p>But of course tptb hacked all of their servers, while online and without them detecting it, photoshopped it, live, and none of them ever notice that it&#39;s flat! Oh the guy who jumped was in a set and was bought, of course. And all the other hackers. And the set crew. And millions of scientists monitoring the skies <em>right now</em>. And all the drones footage. And all people who&#39;s been higher than 35k feet. And anyone who&#39;s literally in space <em>right now</em>. And all countries&#39; satellites. And all of our technology that wouldn&#39;t exist without satellites (like gps, or signals). And all the people who works building satellite (because their math wouldn&#39;t work if it&#39;s not round). And all the people who manage satellites all around the globe. And all the millions of scientists and professors who currently work researching in any field of physics - or any field tbh. </p>

<p>But your book is probably right, it&#39;s not like it involves magic and supernatural things without a single piece of evidence, right? It&#39;s pure blind faith, right? Yeah.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m sorry faith is a christian concept. My God who is only the God of a small group of people does not deal with blind faith. He always gives a sign. I can’t tell you too much because the secret things belong to the Lord and he will fuck me up for helping you because he does not want anyone praying to him except Levi. So I was pretty much an atheist until God gave me a supernatural sign. I will say that soon everyone will know because God is going to give the world an undeniable sign. A lot of people are going to die sadly. He promised to destroy the country that took his priest as slaves. Everything has to end eventually. So live you life to the fullest. Treasure your loved ones. If you are happy, embrace that. I am happy to know where I come from and who my father is.  </p>

<p>The bible says that lucifer is a lion seeking to devour, Yet Jesus is the lion of the tribe of Judah. For he is king of all not the beast that is to devour.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus is not from the tribe of Judah. I can prove it with his own words. I don’t mean to hurt your god, but the truth is from the living God and it can’t be denied. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at God&#39;s Holy Family and the Family of Jesus. This is from lietomenomore.org</p>

<p>The left column is The tribes of Jacob and the eight is the genealogy that Jesus comes from according to Matthew 1:2</p>

<p>The God of Israel<br/>
 has 12 tribes                                The tribes of Jesus</p>

<p>Reuben                                                                     Juda
Simeon                                                                     Reuben
Levi                                                                           Gad
Judah                                                                       Aser<br/>
Dan                                                                           Nephthalim
Naphtali                                                                    Manasses<br/>
Gad                                                                           Simeon
Asher                                                                        Levi
Issachar                                                                   Issachar
Zebulun                                                                    Zabulon
Joseph                                                                     Joseph
Benjamin                                                                 Benjamin</p>

<p>As you can see Jesus lineage differs from the original 12 tribes. Plus where is the city of Judea in the OT? </p>

<p>I will tell you a secret. The other 11 tribes can have other Gods. Levi can’t. The Priest can only worship the Most High. Only Levi can make a sacrifice to forgive sin. Besides prophets and kings. </p>

<p>So it’s ok if you worship Jesus if you choose to. The danger you have is blaspheming God while you do it. Which is what most christians end up doing rather they know it or not. All of Jesus teachings are against the Most High. Even though it sounds nicer But the real God is not all love, love, love. In fact christians call the Most High the devil because he does all evil in the world. </p>
