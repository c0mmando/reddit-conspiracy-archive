        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I enjoy bryan callan as a comic, or doing something funny, but when I watched that Joe Rogan podcast with him relentlessly telling Eddie Bravo that pizzagate has been debunked, i couldnt help but hate this fucking moron. Im not even arguing that pizzagate is true. The way that he kept screaming at him &quot;Eddie, its been debunked,&quot; pissed me off so fucking bad. He sounded like a little kid trying to cover up his lie to his parents when he knew damn well he was lying, or a cheating girlfriend getting defensive when you confront her and turning the situation on you. Hes such a fucking pussy for this, i almost dont even like him anymore. How the fuck is it even possible to debunk something like pizzagate, short of following the accused around with a hidden camera every day for the rest of their life. People in hollywood are litterally fucking pussies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People that tell you something is debunked, without providing you evidence that <strong>proves</strong> your theory untrue (as that&#39;s what it means to debunk), aren&#39;t worth your energy. You cannot expose (debunk) without evidence. </p>

<p>Bryan Callan the comic is funny, Bryan Callen <em>seems</em> to be lacking in critical thinking/reasoning skills.</p>

<p>Eddie Bravo could do with pulling it in a bit though. It&#39;s no use shouting about the truth when you routinely shoot past it, when talking conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah at no point does he provide any evidence. His best example is every credible respectable news station/newspaper has debunked it. I know i shouldnt waste energy getting mad, but its hard not to when the majority of the world thinks this way because of idiots like callan. Youre right, not very good at critical thinking. </p>

<p>That is where the problem lies.  Take any claim from anything really.  What can you really prove either true or false?  What sources can prove any of it true that is reliable?  Video and audio can be edited, no source is to be 100% believed.  What about the pedantic people who will stick on one word&#39;s meaning in your proof? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if no proof can be provided it cant be debunked. </p>

<p>By the way I&#39;m not touting for/against on this. The inability to debunk it is more of a situational anomaly, than any confirmation of conspiracy.</p>

<p>My own view is that it has been vilified very cleverly and to the point where investigation doesn&#39;t really matter, outside of fringe circles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same way. I dont necessarily believe shit went down in that pizza place, so if you consider pizzagate only relating to comet ping pong, then yeah i guess you can say its been lazily debunked. Often times when researchers hear the words pizzagate, they think of the whole picture of pedophilia by strong politicians, and not so much James Alifantis, although that mother fucker is definitely a creep and pedophile. Technically, nothing can be proven true or false, if you want to have a cunty attitude like that. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0ZL_3cDYsU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0ZL_3cDYsU</a></p>

<p>This video explores the recent reactions to #PizzaGate by comedian, actor and podcast host Bryan Callen. Bryan had a strange reaction to the subject during a Joe Rogan podcast. The video reviews Bryan&#39;s stories of his sexual past including being molested at a young age, several near gay experiences and even a &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; style experience where celebrities are present and wearing porcelain masks. </p>

<p>The interesting points are covered including why someone who has inside knowledge and experience in Hollywood would get so triggered by #PizzaGate. I then explore the possibility that his reaction has something to do with his father Michael Callen who is a big bank executive and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, who have been accused of being the acting body and essentially the New World Order.</p>
