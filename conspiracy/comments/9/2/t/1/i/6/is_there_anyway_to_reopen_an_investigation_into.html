       It's not all that complicated once you have the critical information. On the day of the 911 attack, 3 Israelis filmed both planes hitting the 2 towers. They were seen celebrating, dancing, and taking selfies with the burning towers. In addition, two Israeli men were arrested in New York on the day of 911 in a van filled with explosives under the George Washington Bridge. The institutional media totally stopped reporting on this fact once they learned that the men were Israeli. It's hard to notice when the news suddenly stops reporting on something when there is some much else happening regarding the 911 event. Source:

       Regarding the JFK assassination, here is the key information:
Israeli agents stole enriched uranium from America and were using it to create nuclear weapons at their Dimona facility.
JFK told the Israeli prime minister that he wanted to have Dimona inspected for illegal nuclear activities.
JFK also wanted to make AIPAC (American Israeli Political Action Committee) register as a foreign agent.
JFK was also in favor of the right of return for Palestinian refugees to be able to return to their homes.
And Robert was the AG (Attorney General) under his brother.
As the AG, he was prosecuting the Jewish mob, which is a major source of Israeli/Zionists power.
So the Zionists had to kill JFK and have him succeeded by the vice President LBJ (who was an Israeli asset).
Under LBJ, all of the above policies changed completely in Israel's favor.
Later when RFK ran for president and was very likely to win, they killed him also. He had the same beliefs as his brother and if he won, he was preparing to initiate a real investigation into his brothers assassination.
Here's more info on that from Ryan Dawson if you are interested.

       He mentions Saudis there, but I think he's well aware that everyone knows that it wasn't the Saudis. He's basically saying it without saying it.

       For how many years were people saying that Ron Paul was a secret 9-11 truther? How did that go? Donald Trump is using 9-11 truth the same way Ron Paul did. To take the greatest conspiracy of our time and sort of pretend -- wink, wink -- that you are going to reveal it as year after year goes by is the most despicable insult to anyone who ever considered a conspiracy.

       Donald Trumps initial reaction to 9/11 was “now my buildings the tallest”. It didn’t affect him personally other than financially at the time of 9/11 he was so deep in debt any losses were probably welcome write-offs for him. Donald Trump was a true laughing stock in NYC at the time. A walking punch line. The actual billionaires in that city knew he had nothing. Somehow this con man has duped all of BumFuck, USA into believing he’s a hero.

       The last thing Donald Trump would want to do is expose 9/11 as an inside job because it destroys his entire platform. He ran on a platform of bigotry towards Muslims and immigrants in general. What fear would we have of “terrorists” if he exposed 9/11 as perpetrated by our own government.

       Not saying it didn’t. I’m saying the bigotry is trumps world view and his entire platform. If he were to expose that the event was coordinated by our government and not by radical islamists than his platform is a shambles. How do you justify the hatred if there is no terrorist attack? Without the hatred and bigotry trump has very few votes

       Personally, I think a lot of the Trump=bigot is perpetuated by the media. Sure, he has to play to his fan base somewhat, but his die-hard followers will do just that and follow him no matter what.

       I could see them saying that the terrorists did in fact rig the buildings with explosives and they were too embarrassed to admit it at the time. Still wouldn’t explain Bld 7 or the Pentagon though.

       This article is from 28 months ago. He’s obviously not doing anything. The only thing he ever cared about 9/11 for was to brag about his building now being the tallest. Which is in incredibly poor taste and classless.

       They want the UC constituency to be generationally removed by the time the truth gets out to the gullible masses. Revealing 911 now would mean those who saw it young would loose all faith in the current government. I think the soonest the US gov starts to allow the press to investigate 911 would be perhaps 2060+

       The information and people you are looking for died on 9/11. We have nothing that can used as evidence. All we have left is a collection of seemingly random facts.

       Knowing what really happened and

       On the day of the 911 attack, 3 Israelis filmed both planes hitting the 2 towers. They were seen celebrating, dancing, and taking selfies with the burning towers. In addition, two Israeli men were arrested in New York on the day of 911 in a van filled with explosives under the George Washington Bridge. The institutional media totally stopped reporting on this fact once they learned that the men were Israeli. It's hard to notice when the news suddenly stops reporting on something when there is some much else happening regarding the 911 event. Source:
