    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not all that complicated once you have the critical information. On the day of the 911 attack, 3 Israelis filmed both planes hitting the 2 towers. They were seen celebrating, dancing, and taking selfies with the burning towers. In addition, two Israeli men were arrested in New York on the day of 911 in a van filled with explosives under the George Washington Bridge. The institutional media totally stopped reporting on this fact once they learned that the men were Israeli. It&#39;s hard to notice when the news suddenly stops reporting on something when there is some much else happening regarding the 911 event.

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding the JFK assassination, here is the key information:
Israeli agents stole enriched uranium from America and were using it to create nuclear weapons at their Dimona facility.
JFK told the Israeli prime minister that he wanted to have Dimona inspected for illegal nuclear activities.
JFK also wanted to make AIPAC (American Israeli Political Action Committee) register as a foreign agent.
JFK was also in favor of the right of return for Palestinian refugees to be able to return to their homes.
And Robert was the AG (Attorney General) under his brother.
As the AG, he was prosecuting the Jewish mob, which is a major source of Israeli/Zionists power.
So the Zionists had to kill JFK and have him succeeded by the vice President LBJ (who was an Israeli asset).
Under LBJ, all of the above policies changed completely in Israel&#39;s favor.
Later when RFK ran for president and was very likely to win, they killed him also. He had the same beliefs as his brother and if he won, he was preparing to initiate a real investigation into his brothers assassination.
Here&#39;s more info on that from Ryan Dawson if you are interested.

    <div class="md"><p>Donald Trumps initial reaction to 9/11 was “now my buildings the tallest”. It didn’t affect him personally other than financially at the time of 9/11 he was so deep in debt any losses were probably welcome write-offs for him. Donald Trump was a true laughing stock in NYC at the time. A walking punch line. The actual billionaires in that city knew he had nothing. Somehow this con man has duped all of BumFuck, USA into believing he’s a hero. </p>
