<p>You&#39;re posting about a joke about conspiracies, which is fine, but you&#39;re taking it seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? When does he clearly states he&#39;s joking? Because if you watch the video (and literally <em>all</em> other videos of Jim Carey talking lately) he always states he&#39;s being serious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you watch the whole clip?</p>

<p>Where he pretends to be reprogrammed via a phone call? Any aspect before that shows he&#39;s joking, actually. I don&#39;t see how you think he&#39;s being serious. </p>

<p>Yeah, you caught me. I&#39;m doing damage control in case Jim Carrey&#39;s comedy bit from 3 years ago actually exposes Jimmy Kimmel as a pedophile Hollywood elite. </p>

<p>So what&#39;s your take? Jim Carrey does a Kimmel interview (after doing a skit early in the episode) where he uses comedy to mask that he&#39;s actually exposing Kimmel for being part of the Illuminati? Does this mean Carrey is also part of it? If Carrey isn&#39;t part of it, why go on the show and make a thinly-veiled accusation? If he really is being as serious as you think, what&#39;s his motivation? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carey states that he is a part of it. The phone call is an obvious hit at MK Ultra. Look dude, you&#39;re not gonna win anything by ignoring the video.</p>

<p>You&#39;re arguing without even watching Isaac Kappy&#39;s video, which is the whole point. The dude was in there, he was friends with those people. He literally has zero reason to lie, so just watch it before coming here defending pedos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My entire position is based on the video, how am I ignoring it? You think he&#39;s serious, I think he&#39;s doing a comedy bit.</p>

<p>Who said I didn&#39;t watch the Kappy video? Accusations without evidence are dangerous, and he&#39;s doing plenty of that. I just don&#39;t think a comedy bit on late night television is enough evidence to &#39;out&#39; someone. There are real cases of famous people being verifiably outed and making accusations against others because of rumors and unverifiable testimony weakens the cases against those that are actually guilty, at the very least via public perception.</p>

<p>Seeking further proof and evidence is not defending the accused. Don&#39;t try to make those that are actually seeking answers and evidence your enemy simply because your provided evidence is circumstantial and unverified. </p>

<p>Again, to anyone who <em>watched</em> Isaac Kappy&#39;s video <em>now</em> watch Jim Carey&#39;s one. And pay attention to Kimmel&#39;s reaction (mentioned in Kappy&#39;s video with much more depth).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s not gaining traction because he&#39;s just another guy on the internet making accusations. He currently has no tangible evidence and only his testimony. He could be proven right at some point. The chances of him being proven wrong are astronomical simply because of the sheer amount of evidence one would have to provide to prove innocence. The burden of proof, however, is on him, as it typically is with accusations. That doesn&#39;t mean out-right that he&#39;s wrong, but it does warrant further proof.</p>

<p>If we based everyone&#39;s validity on their nothing to win/lose basis, we might as well get rid of courts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was the first thought I had when he said Jimmy Kimmel is part of it...all I could see in my head was Jim Carey coming out on the stage making the illuminati symbol, Kimmel acting like he had no idea what Carey was doing, and Jim calling Kimmel out saying he knows exactly what Carey is doing and what the symbol means. Also, is it not interesting that Isaac Kappy&#39;s video hasn&#39;t gone full viral yet? Absolutely nothing on any media site. Even with Twitter you have to search his name to see anything about him calling these people out, even though he has hundreds of people tagging and retweeting him. Scary, sad, and pathetic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! Everyone needs to keep pushing this video. My God even Elijah Wood has spoke out about the horrific things that go on. When are things going to finally explode and change is forced to be made? What&#39;s even scarier is thinking about how powerful some of the people are (ie government officials, owners of banks) that are also corrupt and involved in this stuff.</p>

<p>This is world is fucked. This is why I don&#39;t want children. Why bring them into a world run by people like this and full of humans who are destroying eachother and this planet.</p>
