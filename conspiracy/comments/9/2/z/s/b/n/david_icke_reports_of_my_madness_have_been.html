        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Icke is one of the most controversial figures from the conspiracy community. </p>

<p>Accusations that have been leveled against him are addressed.</p>

<p>&quot;Icke: Reports of my madness have been greatly exaggerated&quot; - <a href="https://www.lep.co.uk/news/politics/icke-reports-of-my-madness-have-been-greatly-exaggerated-1-9253395">https://www.lep.co.uk/news/politics/icke-reports-of-my-madness-have-been-greatly-exaggerated-1-9253395</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not only does he ask: “Who did?” in regard to 9/11, he also demands to know: “Who benefits from it?” and that leads to even-more-uncomfortable answers.</p>

<p>Many people, upon mention of Icke, will immediately think of that infamous Terry Wogan interview from 1991. Some articles about him today still hark back to that time, often claiming Icke refers to himself as “the son of god”.</p>

<p>To put this into context, several national newspapers were already alleging this in the days before the live interview, and Icke was put on the spot about it by Wogan.</p>

<p>Icke – who in his own words was going through a form of mental crisis at that time, in April 1991 – did then use Jesus as an analogy, saying that ridicule was to be expected if you are relaying messages that do not fit with the norms of the day. And so he was defined – and remains defined to many – by an off-the-cuff remark during a live television interview given 27 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I ask him if shining a critical light on the official 9/11 story has left him open to ridicule. The former Coventry City goalkeeper says bluntly: “I couldn’t give a damn whether people think I’m sane or not, I’m just interested in the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Icke says a fundamental flaw of mainstream coverage of 9/11 is the failure to look at a document produced by the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) whose members included those who came to power with the Bush administration in January 2001.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“But then conspiracies don’t exist do they? They’re only ‘theories’. Of course, if it’s a conspiracy theory that ‘it’s the Russians’, on no evidence whatsoever, we have to take that seriously.”
Icke dislikes the terms “conspiracy theories” and “conspiracy theorists” – understandably so, perhaps, as it sometimes appears he and his work are often tagged with these semantically-loaded labels.</p>

<p>Former TV sports presenter Icke, 66, says these “conspiracy” labels remain powerful psychological tools to shut down any questioning of 9/11’s official story. He sees world events not as random – he leaves that to the “coincidence theorists” – but as a tapestry that shows the direction the world is deliberately being taken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The “Holocaust denier” slur was repeated in the first paragraph of one newspaper article last month. Icke claims that, when his younger son, Jaymie, asked them to provide evidence of that, the line was immediately withdrawn from the online story.</p>

<p>Having interviewed Icke for two hours, and having seen his four-hour show, I do not believe he is racist. Far from it in fact.</p>

<p>He abhors racism and sees identifying oneself with any race as a misunderstanding of who we actually are – more on that later.</p>

<p>And he does not deny the Holocaust. Icke says: “The way the Jewish people in Nazi Germany were treated by the Nazis is grotesque, horrific and almost beyond comprehension.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Icke isn’t all about global politics, though, he’s also interested in the fundamental nature of reality. To put it in layman’s terms – he believes we are all “god”, if you want to use that word.</p>

<p>Icke himself would say we are all a part of the same infinite Awareness with a capital A.</p>

<p>Icke says: “To self-identify with race, let alone be racist, is the ultimate misunderstanding of the nature of reality.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Myth number three is that Icke owns a Bentley and rakes in millions of pounds a year. He actually drives a Mazda3, lives in a block of flats on the Isle of Wight, and ploughs money from his shows and books back into research projects and future tours.</p>

<p>He says he has no interest in material wealth and is driven by a desire to warn others of a global network – a hidden hand that controls presidents and prime ministers on both sides of the political spectrum – that is pushing humanity towards World War Three with the endgame being the assimilation of the human race by artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>He says: “I track this every day, it’s my life, but I have not, since September 11, 2001, seen a single mainstream documentary that has questioned the official story of 9/11. That is so ridiculous that it has to be systematic, rather than random chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly recommend you give the hollow moon theory another open-minded chance... that shit is fascinating. One of my favorite conspiracy theories actually. I had known about it long before I heard Icke talk about it, which only made me like him more.</p>

<p>I believe it&#39;s quite possible that the moon was placed where it is today, and in the orbit and unlikely tidally locked rotation that it is, at the perfect distance to be the same size as the sun that it is, in order to originally terraform the Earth to support life. </p>

It took me a long time to accept as well, but I never really gave it a fair chance. After breaking through to alien land on DMT, it became clear to me that humans are far from alone here and there&#39;s something *much* more wild and mysterious going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand he does expressly mean reptilians and I do happen to lean towards the notion that a malevolent spiritual entity is feeding off of out negative energy.  </p>

<p>Mr. Icke himself even claims most of the people/entities doing the damage are psychopaths.  I may be on the fence about the reptilians but other people may thing it&#39;s preposterous and not watch any of his lectures for that reason alone.</p>

<p>I believe there is too much truth in his work for people not to watch it just because of one point they disagree.  So my best suggestion is to, for a time, presume he means psychopaths since all reptilians are basically psychopaths anyhow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, he absolutely, very clearly means aliens, and it&#39;s too important of a truth to only tell half the story around, in my opinion. But yeah, if people don&#39;t understand that there are psychopath humans, then they&#39;re not likely to accept aliens, but smart people should look at the whole story. I&#39;m absolutely positive this is what&#39;s going on in our world, from years of research, thinking and experience, so I&#39;d rather not mice words. Humans are far from alone.</p>

Actually I find on the surface he makes all kinds of sense, but if you dive deeper, you realize he is crazy and has switched his focus and is redirecting when asked tough questions. Either way, we can pretend he isn&#39;t talking about reptiles from outer space like Alex Jones and his interdimensional child molesters... But he implicitly says he is talking about reptilian aliens and they&#39;re central to everything else he says.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s not what he&#39;s saying, and at this point I&#39;m absolutely positive that these dark alien beings do exist and are attempting to sabotage us. There&#39;s so much to read and listen to on this subject; claims of evil &quot;archons&quot; are all over ancient texts, and there are tons of sightings and reasons to believe they exist. One very serious podcast I recommend which delves into this subject regularly is &quot;Non Human Entities,&quot; which downloads to Youtube. Spend some time listening to that one.... Or check out John Lash, who&#39;s been translating ancient Gnostic texts, which describe in detail a cosmic battle between good and evil aliens.</p>

<p>Or check out &quot;The Cosmic War&quot; by Joseph Farrell; he lays out scientific evidence (though not proof) that there was once a war between alien forces in our very solar system, which ended in a stalemate. What we have today, with our split world, is the remnants of this cosmic war; indeed, we&#39;re still in a cosmic war of sorts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve come to accept that the &quot;archons&quot; as they&#39;re more often called, are very much real, and have been trying to sabotage humanity for a long time. Information about this is all over ancient texts, especially the ancient Gnostic texts; they lay out an entire story about how our planet is created and who these archons/reptiles are. I really recommend the book &quot;Not in HIS Image&quot; by John Lash. </p>

<p>It explains a lot. It explains why we have these bizarre creepy religions, and why the Nazis took power and almost took over the world. It explains why, in a world full of such magnificent beauty with psychedelic experiences perhaps being the pinnacle of that, we also have such horror, war, extreme poverty, starvation. It&#39;s because someone is rooting for us to fail as a species. Give it a real chance. If you&#39;re questioning whether aliens exist at all- smoke DMT. I&#39;ve encountered non-human intelligences myself, as have *so many* people.</p>

<p>IMO this reptilian theory (put forward by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zecharia_Sitchin">Sitchin</a> and elaborated upon by Icke), however interesting, is meant to serve two purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Give the impression the current control matrix is thousands of years old; that the central planners are ETI are therefore overwhelmingly powerful; hence there is nothing you can do about it.</p></li>
<li><p>Absolve the actual (and obvious) culprits.</p></li>

<p>In my own (humble) estimation the global central planners have been at it for a bit over a century and a half, not much more. </p>

Because the resource is mind over matter abilities, it requires a game to set them up. They would refuse to become part of the antilife hive, the abomination people know of as the devil. It has little individuality anymore. They have to agree to use their minds to serve it or the AI can&#39;t get mind over matter abilities.
