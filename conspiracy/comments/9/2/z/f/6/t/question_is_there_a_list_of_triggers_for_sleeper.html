    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just curious, if you go through a list of &#39;sleeper agent triggers&#39; and don&#39;t get triggered what then? Will you keep searching for your trigger words? You really think if there&#39;s a phrase/sound to trigger you, you&#39;d find it easily online? imo that is not how they control ppl and it&#39;s more like sending specific frequencies to people&#39;s bodies to make them react in certain ways. They could play a sound in someone&#39;s head while controlling them with remote influencing tech to make them think it&#39;s related.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am looking for reading material on triggers and what demographics the triggers are for, so that I can then be more aware when doing further research on the topics of the information being presented to me. You are correct that the triggers are subliminal- which means that they will not work if you know that the triggers are such- &quot;Knowledge is power&quot;</p>

<p>Also, because I recently have gone to see a psychologist, and at the end of the meeting he slipped the word &quot;Watson&quot; under his breath, insinuating that my last name was Watson. My instincts kicked in that it was something I *had* to take mental note of, and I want to see if there is any correlation with the word &quot;Watson&quot; and sleeper triggers recorded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heres an interesting story, I was watching House Hunters on TV last night, there was a wealthy husband and wife, they were looking to buy a house in the Colorado mountains. The wife wanted her own space to do her thing, and so did the husband. The house they ended up buying was a gorgeous place, great view of the sunsets from the patio, up in the foothills, but heres the thing, it had a fenced in dog run where the dogs could run beside the house. The dogs could just run beside the house in the Colorado mountains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too believe myself smarter than the average dog, however, and I think this could relate to your topic, it is hard to ignore that pretty much all life operates on a few basic core processes.</p>

<p>Get deep inside those processes and you could program them much like a computer.</p>

<p>It can as with most things also be used positively for example to <em>inject</em> self esteem into someone. To brighten their day. To defuse a tense situation.</p>

<p>Thats what I believe real power is - to create where absence exists. Its an interesting field of research to say the least.</p>

<p>I believe there are easier ways to achieve their &#39;triggering&#39; from what I experienced they don&#39;t need you to hear or read anything and can send frequencies to your brain that affects your actions/thoughts like how EMF exposure causes depression, anxiety, insomnia etc. (They can increase effects of psychotropic drugs in your body to 100% remotely).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he slipped the word &quot;Watson&quot; under his breath</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can mimic people&#39;s voices to sound <em>exactly</em> like them and play it in your head so only you hear it this is used lot more often than forced speech, when the perp says something near you it might not have been under their control. They use this tech for the &#39;alien channeller&#39; Daryl Anka that goes on long rants and always has his eyes closed, they can move around too much when using this tech, when it&#39;s used in stalking the perp will usually say 1 word or a short phrase. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am aware of the stored drugs, I have successfully cycled much of them out of my system, I know this because they have already tried to pull my kill switch to no avail. It took a lot of work, including living in conditions well below freezing, adrenal training, and many many hours practicing holistic techniques. I made sure that the person I met with had both the experience and education necessary to comprehend my foundation of knowledge. As I&#39;ve said in other posts, I have a team behind me, unlike other targeted individuals I have a genuine support system. I will be meeting with him again and will be sure to open dialogue on his side as well to ensure that I can provide support on anything I can, and will relay any new information from our next interaction.</p>

<p>Thanks for the input, I hope that it encourages you and others to evolve beyond acceptance of mental degradation like they want. Pseudo science is truly the new renaissance </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The election itself, wasnâ€™t the Russian government. It was agencies within the Russian borders that promised trump a presidency. Itâ€™s seems imposable. But I assure you, Russia is so corrupt, everyone works for themselves. The election was simply a few people with an intention that possibly had nothing to do with the Russian government . Russia has the most advanced algorithms and  hackers.  This is why there is a denial. Nobody ever worked with the Russian government, but they did work with an organization whoâ€™s employees are probably mostly in Russia. </p>
