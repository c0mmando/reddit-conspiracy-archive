       Since Q came back from the dead, his posts have mostly been a rehash of greatest hits. Today he started posting about the Whidbey Island missile hoax again, but this time added a fun new wrinkle: it was shot down by F-16s with a "specialized weapons package."
      </p>
      <p>
       Do the Qultists recognize special pleading when they see it? Or are they so blind to the manna from their god that they don't see how full of bullshit this is?

       An F-16 from the Air Force Reserve Command Test Centre (AATC) launched two modified AIM-9X carrying the NCADE seeker at a test rocket. The first shot intercepted and destroyed the target and the second recorded the interception said Pentagon officials.

       That test was over ten years ago, and there's almost no available info about the system after that. According to a Heritage Foundation report from last year, NCADE was never deployed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put it this way - if an F-16 shot down a missile over WA, why did nobody see or hear the missile launch? Where is the debris? Where is the record of the planes being launched or firing a missile?

       If your theory depends on magical, unproven technology to work, it will never be anything other than a theory.

       No, you claim its not possible for an f-16 to shoot down a missile as your proof Q is a larp.  On that point you were proven wrong.  It is possible to shoot a missile down with an f16.  so,  again go find something else to PROVE Q is a larp

       A field test performed once doesn't equal a proven and widely deployed technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why clinical trials have different phases, with more and more people involved. You can't prove something works by doing it once.

       True but if they want mogul down, hes down the next day. Rothschild letting it play out for now, and Mercer's will.

      <p>
       BTW there was no strike on AF1. I played a role in s/GA to say there was, but there wasn't.  SOP is not a one shot kill, so to speak, meaning more than one would have been out and not from the island.  There are other means higher in orbit to bring it down.  So OP my compatriot, do not get sucked into any more debate on planes, missles, etc - these are shills paid to distract. They pull readers off path to debate things none of you know, and theorize the ambiguous. Stay on point OP - q is psyop.

       Trump loaded his cabinet and filled the swamp. Start with long time skull and bones graduate steve mnuchin, deep state puppet and now treasury secretary. Then go to Reba Mercer. Bannon, and dont leave out Cohn - the Zbig of our time.

        Boost-phase intercepts are also generally the most difficult to arrange, as they require the interceptor to be within attack range within the few minutes while the missile engines are firing. Given some sort of positive control over the launch, this means there is only a short time for the weapons to reach their targets after the launch command is given. This requires very high-speed weapons located close to the enemy launchers, or weapons like particle beams or lasers that operate at speeds close to the speed of light.

       Put simply, an F-16 can not carry a missile capable of intercepting a ballistic missile after the boost phase, and certainly not during the terminal phase when the ballistic missile will be travelling at many times the speed of sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless the F-16 was within a hundred miles of the launch site, it could not possibly intercept a ballistic missile, even with NCADE.

      <p>
       Listen, I wanted to believe in Q. But my bullshit meter hit red a couple months after he started posting. Especially around Christmas when he was “at the White House party”. And then when the Air Force one pic is proven not to be original. I know that the “Q group” has came out with reasons why all this happened and the masses are regurgitating the same excuses. But I can read through bullshit when I see it. This is a group the is there for monetizing purposes only. They’re feeding on the elderly and people who don’t know better.

       You must be a Q fan, because I would think you’d be interested enough to search YouTube yourself. “Qanon Pamphlet mistake” would be the first things I’d search. Or would you rather me just feed you whatever partisan link I give?
      </p>
      <p>
       User that search, you’ll see one of his followers trying to debunk the simple explanation by someone skilled in the art. Watch that and see what you think. Make up your own mind. But please, please, please DON’T buy any of their merchandise or subscribe to their pay channel. They’ve monetized Q, in my opinion. There’s even videos on YouTube of people who claim to have left the initial group that started Q. Believe what you will...

       I really appreciate your candor and respectful discourse. I would love for W to be real, but I just don’t feel that he’s as real as we would like. If he was truly an insider, he’d give us real tangible evidence that he’s as inside as he says. I’m not an everyday Q follower, but I feel really informed on his posts. Is there something I’m missing that is real and tangible that you can point to that says he is who he says he is?  The explanation about the faked picture really lost me. There’s no way the real Q would have posted that, if he was real.

       Well, unlike most Q readers, I don't really put a lot of stake into his "predictions" or more precise, what people interpret as his "predictions" or whatever.  Haha, sounds like a parlor trick of sorts to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think right now the biggest logical train of thought for me is as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Assume the worst, and that Trump is the toddler everyone says he is.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Trump is aware of Q. Evidence is from the t shirts at the rally, the SS interview with that crazy guy at the hoover dam, and the MSM stories on Q.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Q has taken credit for a lot of things that Trump's been doing.  Like almost all of them.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Taking those into account, if Q wasn't at least working with Trump, then we would have seen this tweet by now (I felt like shopping it to make it more real for you).  Check this out:
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/SNR6nvY">
        https://imgur.com/a/SNR6nvY
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Every day that goes by without this tweet is another proof that Q is legit, as far as I'm concerned.  Maybe circumstantial.  But isn't this whole thing circumstantial?  Eh, take it for what it's worth.

       I see your points about PUSA not discrediting him, but I bet Trump likes the idea of a small army of fanatics who believe that he’s doing all of the things Q has them believing.  I have just a couple quick, off the top of my head things that make me question his authenticity:(on mobile so idk how to format)
      </p>
      <p>
       1) what really happened that time he claimed Hillary, both Podestas and numerous others were arrested?  I can’t remember exactly, but it was about October/November of last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       2). Why the fake photo?  I haven’t researched it thoroughly, but I saw a quick recap about the picture of the islands when Trump went to NK got debunked as fake, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       3). Why only questions?  I’ve heard the claim that it gets around filters, but that sounds phooey. Also, have you noticed major changes in his writing style over time?  That’s explained in one of the videos because the Q group changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) why no real proof of who you are?  Even the Christmas White House party pics were proven to only be taken where tourists can go. As far as I know, no pictures were of the closed party.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s just too many inconsistencies for me to waste my time on believing in Q and hanging on every word. It’s a great Idea and I only wished parts of it were true.(especially taking down the cabal and pedos)

       Man, I started writing a whole response for you, but I don't want to get into "interpretor" territory.  I don't claim to be one of these Q experts.  I think I have a good grasp on a few things, but any answers I give you here would be merely my interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the Trump army thing, I think that's even more reason he would move to discredit.  Even if Trump is an imbecile, he would still have the smarts to know that some random guy online claiming to be working with him, in your words, commanding a small army of fanatics just wouldn't be acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only other response is that the "Great Awakening" will happen within every person, individually, and uniquely.  If there is such a thing.  But my belief is that it is.

        For years the disheveled YAL-1 Airborne Laser baked in the Air Force Boneyard in Tucson, Arizona. Stripped of its chemical laser and turbofan engines, its airframe became a skeletal albatross—a monument to the futility of laser-based missile defense. But in 2014, it was unceremoniously destroyed, and the Defense Department wiped the failure from its memory.

       Another weak minded American, fails in their self control again. Typical of a q follower - you cannot control yourself. You need a messiah, even a two bit, obviously tranparent larp fake like q - its your level. Be in love with your country as it is, broken and corrupt - its people like you 
(reactive, undisciplined, emotional, weak) that let it get to the way it is.
You lose.

       You ever see the comments in great awakening? Some super cringe shit in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, im not going to lie it would be awesome if we had a president who was actually standing up to the elite who hold unchecked power in this world and id imagine it would be quite similar in contrast to the way trump is being treated. Villainized, demonized, with attempts to incriminate or possibly assassinate. The whole concept of q is very elaborate and well thought out, but in my opinion its not legitimate and its quite obvious. Q believers are also borderline cult members who literally have pedophelia paranoia, are hyper fundamentalist christians, and have to be either incredibly gullible or just willfully ignorant of just how little q is actually giving them. They are so convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that q is real, and has provided all these drops and evidence, yet have you ever read some of there analaysis of his drops or some of their predictions? Bat shit crazy stuff, connecting all these dots that are super reachy, long winded theories that just get upvoted and supported by everyone as if its incredibly clever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just basic shit like trump pointing at someone wearing a q shirt and giving a thumbs up is now absolute proof that q is real, yet trump points to plenty of people in crowds during rallies and gives thumbs up its not really that big of a deal. Or the caravan driving by and honking at supporters holding signs, while there just so happens to also be someone holding a q sign so now all of a sudden its confirmed they are honking and acknowledging specifically the q sign? Ok...
      </p>
      <p>
       Following q is interesting to me because it gives me insight into the way trump supporters invision trump, and how far and out of touch with reality they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its disappointing though because these people have hijacked many popular topics in conspiracy theory and are causing actual interest in these topics away from people on the left and "normies" due to their lunacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill be the first to admit i was wrong if q ends up somehow miraculously being legit, but as far as i see it q and q believers seem very deranged and almost dangerous to society to me. I cant imagine what these people as individuals would be capable of doing to others with the way their minds are operating and the world view they hold.

       They're not even slightly interested in reading anything that doesn't conform to their world view that Q and/or Trump are leading America out of the darkness and into the light.

       I'll admit, I like lurking in Great Awakening, because they're so damn hopeful.  They are absolutely convinced something big is coming, and they are positive about the outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are just so relentlessly positive.  It a refreshing change to most of reddit, lol.

       Do they honestly think they'll see HRC do a perp walk?  I guess?

       Completely agree! Trump does some good things but he is not anti deep state by any means. He may be against a certain faction within the deep state however, who he has appointed and his pro war actions say alot.

       Q is the distraction. Its not even worth mentioning, unless you're a shill being paid to give q more coverage. let it go. Not because you're bad, but because its bringing attention to it. the q creators are on the q subreddit, and might use this to help themselves. Delete the thread, because ignoring the q garbage is even better than tearing it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       One need not look farther than first q post to debunk: "Hillary arrested Monday monring between this time and that time"
      </p>
      <p>
       Never happened = q fake, and banned from sub reddit CBTS as well as 4ch and 8 ch boards, until he created his own. THe mods knew it was garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       btw, as former clearance holder  (.mil, nuke base, sub base, ONR, and orbital warfare)  and formerly 1 degree of separation from deep state workings...q is fake. stringers are used that way, opsec would never permit 4ch or 8ch in obvious manner, lets see oh yes there was the reference to a reddit user praising his post -  a user who decoded q as saying that extra dimensional entities have invaded earth on this plane and our modifying our dna to convert us to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... your answer and everyone's answer is that q followers are so broken that they buy snake oil and fall on their faces during pseudo and self proclaimed christian religion services - like the revival days. They're desperate, weak, weak willed, lack agency, share no cohesion but with the lost and weak, and pitiful.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, ignore q altogether. Unless you would like to create a 'q is fake, wake up my fellow people' sub then let me know.
      </p>
      <p>
       or if you want to know about the ds, house of marlborough, how trump is rothschild pawn, and whatever else haunts.
