    <div class="md"><p>Sorry didn’t see this idk if you’re still wondering or not, but it’s mostly personal from what I’ve seen. Idk if there’s studies, but I grew up in churches. I’ve met/discussed with hundreds of Christians and when I said something from the Bible they didn’t even know that it was in there. I’d say a very good chunk had no idea about some pretty major stuff, hence my conclusions. My logic flows the same way it would from major scientific studies, you pick like 1000 from a population and assume percentages based off those people and it’s an approximation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1/3 believers? In Jesus? Many of these people you’re claiming to be believers have never even read the whole Bible. Ever. Not saying that’s the cutoff for Christian heaven, but if you believe in something without reading it entirely, you don’t show much devotion to your beliefs. OP is right in terms of numbers, unless the “angelic population” started off at an insane number. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It matters right now, but it&#39;s not going to matter in the afterlife. It&#39;s about priorities, and the mindset is not that we are in a battle with Satan for souls, the mindset is that the love of God can save people, we&#39;re not supposed to have a battle mentality, Jesus already won the battle against the Devil, now we are walking in his victory. You are thinking in a very humanlike manner, with a war mentality, but it&#39;s no longer an us vs them, and it&#39;s now simply us doing what Jesus did, and I don&#39;t think he was down here with a warrior mentality, he came in the name of love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell was a weapon &quot;God&quot; created to punish the fallen, to torture angels. Human sacrifice is forbidden because it empowers false gods, Jesus a prophet was murdered for evil. Satan&#39;s goal is to be worshiped as if he were &quot;God&quot;.</p>

<p>What happened to people who died before Christ? The spirit is eternal, no sacrifice was necessary for man to ascend after death. The war between good and evil is eternal, Jesus was cursed to bear the memory of suffering from those who celebrate a prophet being tortured to death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, how? This is literally a reflection of the overall Christian go-to belief to argue against “non-believers”. Just another demonic religion - one of the most demonic, in fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a game of any kind. God says &quot;certain things are good, so love them. If you do, I&#39;ve got your back&quot;. Or maybe you just say &quot;I mess up, but I really want to do these good things&quot;. God says &quot;Cool, I appreciate you trying, love you bunches.&quot; There is no equivalency between God and the Devil, that&#39;s a false idea. God created all thing, runs all things, you will do as he planned, like it or not. Victory is assured, even for those of us who sin but keep trying, because there us a larger truth that exists. I don&#39;t think there would be so much simultaneous complexity and uncertainty in the world if there wasn&#39;t something that existed beyond what we understand, or perhaps are capable of understanding, within the bounds of this life. So, to sum, God created the Devil and will do whatever he plans, regardless what the Devil may want (which is still in God&#39;s realm of influence [that realm being all things]). Numbers are a red herring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep worshipping your demonic ancient ruler/s known as Yahweh/El/Enki/Baal/Baphomet/Satan/Ra etc. Look at Semiramis and Nimrod ... quite the similarity to Jesus and Mary (Yeshuah would be included in this). What about deities who were edited out of the Bible, such as the goddess Asherah who was a consort of “both” Yahweh and Baal? The poles sure resemble the crucifix and such. </p>

<p>Oh, did you say “God”? The translation for “Satan”, huh? No? Well, better do your reading and realise that ... oh yes! How could I forget? The satanic favorite of backtracking ... a dog, a morning star, sounds like something celestial that we can all “see”. Oh, I guess I’ve sliced the little human delusion too much at this point, better stop. And let me guess, the Holy Spirit feels real (so that can’t be a devious manipulative force at play), I have no real proof this happened (yes, that’s what your religion is, part of this matrix built on damning duality, “as above, so below”, good and evil, heaven and hell). </p>

<p>It’s all rigged. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t.  I think I live more like Christ than most Christians I know.  But according to their beliefs the numbers are off if good triumphs evil.</p>
