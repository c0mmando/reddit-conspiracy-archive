       How do you know what they really believe? You are forcing your interpretation of god on them. You are also judging them by saying you live more like Christ than them. Jesus said don’t judge lest you shall be judged. Pretty simple

       Fine. I don't care. You'll need me to hold your hand. I can't wait to see some people that have to fulfill some karmic debts. I guess it's a thing to worry about dying. Everything you want is on the other side of fear.

       Jesus said the most important commandment is to "love God" with all your heart, soul and mind.  So whether an atheist may think there a "good" person, it's clear they don't love God.
      </p>

       Remember Jesus's most "Christ-like" action was actually following God.

       Only 1/3 of angelic creation fell with Satan. When the number equals out (it has been theorized) on earth with believers only being 1/3 of the overall total population that has lived in the earth, then the rapture will take place and end of days is upon us.

       Sorry didn’t see this idk if you’re still wondering or not, but it’s mostly personal from what I’ve seen. Idk if there’s studies, but I grew up in churches. I’ve met/discussed with hundreds of Christians and when I said something from the Bible they didn’t even know that it was in there. I’d say a very good chunk had no idea about some pretty major stuff, hence my conclusions. My logic flows the same way it would from major scientific studies, you pick like 1000 from a population and assume percentages based off those people and it’s an approximation.

       1/3 believers? In Jesus? Many of these people you’re claiming to be believers have never even read the whole Bible. Ever. Not saying that’s the cutoff for Christian heaven, but if you believe in something without reading it entirely, you don’t show much devotion to your beliefs. OP is right in terms of numbers, unless the “angelic population” started off at an insane number.

       Faith alone in Christ alone as our savior is all that matters, not reading the book. Through a lengthy study into that book, however, faith is developed which strengthens your relationship so that you may understand more about subjects such as this one.

       That's not how it works, there is nowhere for fallen spiritual beings to go and live forever, Paradise belongs to the children of God who are adopted into the family of God because they were saved through faith in the Son of God, and Heaven belongs to God and his Son, I and the holy Angels who can survive the presence of God would also have no problem being in Paradise with God and his children, so they can be there too, so no, being exiled from the afterlife is in no way a win for the Devil.

      <p>
       The true victory belongs to the Son of God who became a human so that through his righteous life, death and resurrection, he secured salvation and eternal life for those who believe in him, Jesus the Son of God and Savior of Humanity.

       It matters right now, but it's not going to matter in the afterlife. It's about priorities, and the mindset is not that we are in a battle with Satan for souls, the mindset is that the love of God can save people, we're not supposed to have a battle mentality, Jesus already won the battle against the Devil, now we are walking in his victory. You are thinking in a very humanlike manner, with a war mentality, but it's no longer an us vs them, and it's now simply us doing what Jesus did, and I don't think he was down here with a warrior mentality, he came in the name of love.

       Hell was a weapon "God" created to punish the fallen, to torture angels. Human sacrifice is forbidden because it empowers false gods, Jesus a prophet was murdered for evil. Satan's goal is to be worshiped as if he were "God".
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened to people who died before Christ? The spirit is eternal, no sacrifice was necessary for man to ascend after death. The war between good and evil is eternal, Jesus was cursed to bear the memory of suffering from those who celebrate a prophet being tortured to death.

       It’s not a cognitive concept though, it transcends words and therefore books, you speak in the most pedantic of human phrases - OP is speaking from empathy, love and soul. The problem is that Christianity is a cognitivist religion, all about “truth” and “right”. Hmm, sounds a little
       <em>
        poisonous

       if you catch my reference. Keep worshipping your demonic ruler/s Yahweh/El/Enki/Baal/Baphomet/Satan.

       Not a game of any kind. God says "certain things are good, so love them. If you do, I've got your back". Or maybe you just say "I mess up, but I really want to do these good things". God says "Cool, I appreciate you trying, love you bunches." There is no equivalency between God and the Devil, that's a false idea. God created all thing, runs all things, you will do as he planned, like it or not. Victory is assured, even for those of us who sin but keep trying, because there us a larger truth that exists. I don't think there would be so much simultaneous complexity and uncertainty in the world if there wasn't something that existed beyond what we understand, or perhaps are capable of understanding, within the bounds of this life. So, to sum, God created the Devil and will do whatever he plans, regardless what the Devil may want (which is still in God's realm of influence [that realm being all things]). Numbers are a red herring.

       Keep worshipping your demonic ancient ruler/s known as Yahweh/El/Enki/Baal/Baphomet/Satan/Ra etc. Look at Semiramis and Nimrod ... quite the similarity to Jesus and Mary (Yeshuah would be included in this). What about deities who were edited out of the Bible, such as the goddess Asherah who was a consort of “both” Yahweh and Baal? The poles sure resemble the crucifix and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, did you say “God”? The translation for “Satan”, huh? No? Well, better do your reading and realise that ... oh yes! How could I forget? The satanic favorite of backtracking ... a dog, a morning star, sounds like something celestial that we can all “see”. Oh, I guess I’ve sliced the little human delusion too much at this point, better stop. And let me guess, the Holy Spirit feels real (so that can’t be a devious manipulative force at play), I have no real proof this happened (yes, that’s what your religion is, part of this matrix built on damning duality, “as above, so below”, good and evil, heaven and hell).
