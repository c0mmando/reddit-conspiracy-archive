       The Jews are said to have been refugees from the island of Crete who settled in the remotest corner of Libya in the days when, according to the story, Saturn was driven from his throne by the aggression of Jupiter.
       <strong>
        note
       </strong>
       This is a deduction from the name
       <em>
        Judaei
       </em>
       by which they became known: the word is to be regarded as a barbarous lengthening of
       <em>
        Idaei
       </em>
       , the name of the people dwelling around the famous Mount Ida in Crete. A few authorities hold that in the reign of Isis the surplus population of Egypt was evacuated to neighboring lands under the leadership of Hierosolymus and Judas.
       <strong>
        note
       </strong>
       Many assure us that the Jews are descended from those Ethiopians who were driven by fear and hatred to emigrate from their home country when Cepheus was king.

       occupied a part of Egypt, and then built cities of their own, inhabiting the lands of the Hebrews and the nearer parts of Syria. Others again find a famous ancestry for the Jews in the Solymi who are mentioned with respect in the epics of

       Most authorities, however, agree on the following account. The whole of Egypt was once plagued by a wasting disease which caused bodily disfigurement. So

       to ask for a cure, and was told to purify his kingdom by expelling the victims to other lands, as they lay under a divine curse. Thus a multitude of sufferers was rounded up, herded together, and abandoned in the wilderness. Here the exiles tearfully resigned themselves to their fate. But one of them, who was called Moses, urged his companions not to wait passively for help from god or man, for both had deserted them: they should trust to their own initiative and to whatever guidance first helped them to extricate themselves from their present plight. They agreed, and started off at random into the unknown. But exhaustion set in, chiefly through lack of water, and the level plain was already strewn with the bodies of those who had collapsed and were at their last gasp when a herd of wild asses left their pasture and made for the spade of a wooded crag. Moses followed them and was able to bring to light a number of abundant channels of water whose presence he had deduced from a grassy patch of ground. This relieved their thirst. They traveled on for six days without a break, and on the seventh they expelled the previous inhabitants of Canaan, took over their lands and in them built a holy city and temple.

       In order to secure the allegiance of his people in the future, Moses prescribed for them a novel religion quite different from those of the rest of mankind.
       <strong>
        Among the Jews all things are profane that we hold sacred; on the other hand they regard as permissible what seems to us immoral.
       </strong>
       In the innermost part of the Temple, they consecrated an image of the animal which had delivered them from their wandering and thirst, choosing a ram as beast of sacrifice to demonstrate, so it seems, their contempt for Hammon.
       <strong>
        note
       </strong>
       The bull is also offered up, because the Egyptians worship it as
       <a href="http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apis/apis.html">
        Apis
       </a>
       .

       . They still fast frequently as an admission of the hunger they once endured so long, and to symbolize their hurried meal the bread eaten by the Jews is unleavened. We are told that the seventh day was set aside for rest because this marked the end of their toils. In course of time the seductions of idleness made them devote every seventh year to indolence as well. Others say that this is a mark of respect to Saturn, either because they owe the basic principles of their religion to the Idaei, who, we are told, were expelled in the company of Saturn and became the founders of the Jewish race, or because, among the seven stars that rule mankind, the one that describes the highest orbit and exerts the greatest influence is Saturn. A further argument is that most of the heavenly bodies complete their path and revolutions in multiples of seven.

       Whatever their origin, these observances are sanctioned by their antiquity. The other practices of the Jews are sinister and revolting, and have entrenched themselves by their very wickedness. Wretches of the most abandoned kind who had no use for the religion of their fathers took to contributing dues and free-will offerings to swell the Jewish exchequer; and other reasons for their increasing wealth way be found in their stubborn loyalty and ready benevolence towards brother Jews. But the rest of the world they confront with the hatred reserved for enemies. They will not feed or intermarry with gentiles. Though a most lascivious people, the Jews avoid sexual intercourse with women of alien race. Among themselves nothing is barred. They have introduced the practice of circumcision to show that they are different from others. Proselytes to Jewry adopt the same practices, and the very first lesson they learn is to despise the gods, shed all feelings of patriotism, and consider parents, children and brothers as readily expendable. However, the Jews see to it that their numbers increase. It is a deadly sin to kill an unwanted child,
       <strong>
        note
       </strong>
       and they think that eternal life is granted to those who die in battle or execution - hence their eagerness to have children, and their contempt for death. Rather than cremate their dead, they prefer to bury them in imitation of the Egyptian fashion, and they have the same concern and beliefs about the world below. But their conception of heavenly things is quite different. The Egyptians worship a variety of animals and half-human, half-bestial forms, whereas the Jewish religion is a purely spiritual monotheism. They hold it to be impious to make idols of perishable materials in the likeness of man: for them, the Most High and Eternal cannot be portrayed by human hands and will never pass away. For this reason they erect no images in their cities, still less in their temples. Their kings are not so flattered, the Roman emperors not so honored. However, their priests used to perform their chants to the flute and drums, crowned with ivy, and a golden vine was discovered in the Temple; and this has led some to imagine that the god thus worshipped was Prince Liber,
       <strong>
        note
       </strong>
       , the conqueror of the East. But the two cults are diametrically opposed. Liber founded a festive and happy cult: the Jewish belief is paradoxical and degraded.

       Well of course not.  Only God could give divine right.  Would also disagree with the suggestion of metaphor being involved.  And "someone else's land" is also disputed.  Nothing was stolen on the basis of divine right.

       The Bible is a fascinating subject.  I'm not religious and have not been in a church to worship since I was... 8?  The Bible is one book, but really is like 3-5 different story arcs slammed together in one tome.  Some of those are false leads tossed into the Bible during the Council of Nicea, some are ancient stories that are the best histories we have from way back in the day.

       Well, if you're stuck there then sure.  So stuck there you've ignored my note that I do not worship (or pray) and have not been inside a church in decades... but if I can read the Bible I must find talking donkeys and space gods important?  Interesting conclusion.

       Nope, but you clearly have some beliefs that some of the mystical stuff in the bible are actually true (either jesus, good vs evil, aliens or any other random conclusion from random metaphors).
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need to go to church or pray to be religious, you just need to believe in a god. And there are no flying gods in space.

       I believe in Creator God, but that is not the entity talking to humans nor referenced in the Bible.  Some groups still worship Creator God, but they tend to be hunted outta existence by those who follow the Bible's gods (so we're on the same team here homey).  I do not think the occult or esoteric groups worship Creator God, though they claim to.  They worship Demiurge, a creation of the Creator God who "made the material world" (short version of the Gnostic story) and therefore demands our worship.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe energy and vibration are Creator God's "rules," the underlying math or logic or physics of the material world.  Fibonacci, Golden Ratio, etc.  As Above, So Below.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe shrooms etc can connect us to the energy and vibration, or expand our personal vibrations to connect to these larger vibrations.  The DMT experiences people share are way too consistent to be hoaxs or random.  I'm not taking DMT yet, so am speaking from shroom experience (LSD is kinda a party psychedelic, not a true spiritual psychedelic).
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe (know at this point) meditation can be used to connect to these vibrations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Onto the space gods stuff, I think the Sumerian creation story is likely to be true.  More likely than any other creation story we have.  One method of deciphering the bible is Lord = Satan and God = Lucifer, and Enki is Lucifer and Enil is Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think the Bible is a massive pile of astro-theology, and that ultimately EVERYTHING is astro-theology, and all the Bible is talking about is stars and suns and moons and planets and the physical effects those have on humans on Earth (energy and vibration).
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple things can be equally true, the Bible is more than just one thing.

       OT God is demiurge, aka Yahweh (also aka Lucifer and Enki).  Demiurge is a Gnostic term, worth reading about it.  Fascinating thing to ponder whilst stoned.
      </p>
      <p>
       He gave it in person, to Moses, who had to shield his eyes and then take cover behind a rock.  He did not leave a name, but did announce his position relative to other gods.  In theory he left the tablets containing the 10 commandments.
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't much metaphor in the scene(s) where Yahweh gives Moses the run-down.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are several gods in the bible, not just One God.

       Not really fascinating, they are just mythologies. Sadly people actually take them seriously today, in an era where we have robots on Mars.

       Not really a happy thought when you're high to realize that most people actually believe in space gods, but can't accept people's freedoms or scientific facts.

       Interestingly iirc Tacitus identifies the Jews as the Hyksos. The expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt is what Jews, according to Tacitus, call "the exodus".

       Tacitus (56-120 AD) is considered to be one of the greatest Roman historians. He would have had decent sources and have been close in terms of historical memory. At least he represent a contemporary Roman view.

       lmfao. go read josephus or philo. obviously no historical document from that period is "100%" true. if you read other historians, accounts, and look at scientific evidence, his claim is the most likely to be true. but your goal here is doubt and not truth, which is why you support the (((bernie "i like writing stories about raping women" sander))))'s fantasy world.

       Exodus Moses and The Kundalini Energy describes in detail how the Biblical scripture of Exodus has rich allegory surrounding this mystical spinal energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lower mind (or carnal mind as the bible refers to) is mystically represented by EGYPT.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ego which screams at us and keeps us in line = PHARAOH
      </p>
      <p>
       Our spiritual impulse within that helps lead us out of bondage of the lower mind = MOSES.
      </p>
      <p>
       KUNDALINI is an energy which rises up the spine. It is referred to as a female energy and a sleeping serpent. When it reaches the brain it impacts on the PINEAL GLAND which is a conduit for spiritual experiences during meditation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Moses grows he comes into conflict with the other aspects of us and he is driven out into the wilderness of meditation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moses talking to the burning bush representing being touched by the fire or spirit in meditation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stem of the bush is planted, the stem in the centre of the brain and we communicate with the fire which is spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is difficult for religious people to deal with our spiritual realisations. Moses indicates that people of the time will not believe him.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we take the bible literally and believe that God created women out of the rib of Adam then it shows how far away from God we really are. We are dwelling on something that is written in deep symbolisms and taking it literally. Belowwe will discuss the Moses and Kundalini symbology behind the scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exodus 4 : 2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rod becomes serpent
      </p>
      <p>
       Rod = spine = physical aspect of our nature, our EGO. It is our authority and our foundation.  When we put this down and relinquish control of the lower self the kundalini will activate within us becoming the serpent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spiritual force will awaken within us when we sit in meditation and relinquish control of our physical foundation as being our identity and reason for existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exodus 4: 4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hand taken by the tail = point of origin of the kundalini starts with the coccyx at the tailbone. When we throw it down it will become spirit and spiritualize our physical. We still have the physical it does not disappear and we can take back that authority whenever we like only we will see it in a totally different perspective as a result of the insights in our meditation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kundalini rises up to consume all of the fear, hate and guilt within us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hindu: when the flute is on the lips of God the serpent will rise:
      </p>
      <p>
       Exodus 4:  6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hand was like snow (white) =the hand always means energy, the left hand is energy that comes in, the right hand is energy that goes out. So when we place our physical energy inside of our self (our bosom) it becomes white = free of all the stains of thoughts, fear and guilt etc. It becomes as pure as snow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exodus 4 : 7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting hand in again and it was turned as his other flesh = the same as taking control of the serpent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exodus 4: 8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they wont believe you after you have had these spiritual realisations they never will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exodus 4: 9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water on dry ground turning into blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blood symbolically is the same as the fourth stage of consciousness which is fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here we have taken our lower mind (dry ground) and gone into the water which is the second stage of consciousness, we have risen up in the air to the third stage which is no thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water turning into blood means the truth is becoming a spiritual power within you and this comes across in our teaching of others. So when we are talking about the spiritual path to others they may not on the surface be in agreement with us but something deep within them knows that we are talking with authority. We give them the unfolding flower of truth that knows nothing of wars or violence, but is the source of all creation and is nothing but UNIVERSAL LOVE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people have not the slightest idea about why they are alive and what the purpose of that life is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above verse is describing a demonstration of spiritual knowledge within us when speaking to others and we will touch people spiritually in many ways whether they recognise it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buddha says the earth has been made into a hell by the negative vibrations of many people in the world because they are not one with themselves or nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we generally know about ourselves is what we have been told by others, e.g. our parents, schools, employers, religious institutions, government and none of these know either. So we have the ‘wounded child’ within which represents our spirit and this is all God wants; for this child to grow so that we may become enlightened and know ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       To recap we are in the book of Exodus and the movement out of Egypt across the Red Sea to the Promised Land, a journey inside of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exodus 4: 10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moses says that he is not eloquent enough to teach maybe others can but not him. But the whole purpose of this encounter with God is to say YES you can teach because there is a part in you called Aaron – Moses brother.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aaron = the part of us that God will allow to grow in us despite our lack of faith in our selves (if we have been beaten down in confidence). It will take us to Pharaoh and it will allow us to confront the pharaoh (our ego) and say let me go I don’t want this anymore and upon enlightenment we explode with light, love and understanding of what our lifes purpose and human existence is all about. We will then know true PEACE within.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of us have been so traumatised in our life that we have lost all confidence in our spiritual path and ability to follow it.
      </p>
      <p>
       God says Come to the mountain and ill send everything necessary to you as ill show you that part in you that is untouched by all of these things (Aaron) who will confront your ego (Pharaoh)
