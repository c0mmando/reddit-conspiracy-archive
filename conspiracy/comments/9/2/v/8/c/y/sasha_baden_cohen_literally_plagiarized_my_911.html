<p>“Sacha Baron Cohen, for his new show on Showtime, copied your content to make fun of you here: <a href="https://www.truthbrary.org/9-11">https://www.truthbrary.org/9-11</a></p>

<p>Copied from your post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/64z8zd/my_911_theory_based_on_researching_as_much_as_i/%E2%80%9C">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/64z8zd/my_911_theory_based_on_researching_as_much_as_i/“</a></p>

<p>LOL.</p>

<p>Ps: I stand by my theory and if you care about 9/11 you should read it...I forgot I posted it and after I reread it I was proud of how thorough I was with supporting evidence/links and dismissing truly crazy theories like holograms and other disinformation </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to judge his intentions. With or without sources, you have formed a coherent argument and someone stumbling on to this thinking it was a joke might read it and recognise the truth in it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s tongue in cheek, in my view. He uses his platform of satire to give shocking realities an accessible platform, be it about the ingrained racism of certain american demographics and politicians or the still unanswered questions surrounding 911.</p>

<p>Of course you&#39;d have to ask the guy to truly know, but by old the axiom of judging intentions based on their outcomes I&#39;d say his intention was to spread well-articulated (if unsourced) but forbidden truth.</p>

<p>Glancing through some of the other topics, there actually seems to be a surprising amount of correct information on this Truebrary, reaffirming my belief that this goes beyond taking the piss and goes well into the field of spreading knowledge.</p>

<p>Just my 2c, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue is that its blatant plagiarism. It&#39;s also an abridged version which excludes the supporting links. Its one thing to parody, it&#39;s an entirely different matter to steal someone&#39;s content and pass it off as your own (especially when that content is for a show you&#39;re being paid to generate content for).</p>

<p>I think Sacha Baron Cohen can be very funny at times, but artistically, creatively, this is bottom of the barrel scum. If he truly wanted to parody conspiracy theorists he should have actually engrossed himself in it and then cobbled together his own theories for that site. That would make them feel genuine, like parody should, without lifting other people&#39;s hard work.</p>

<p>I agree. The first section on Obama being born in Kenya covers all the sources I was aware of, and then more.</p>

<p>Of course, it doesn&#39;t mention that the &quot;Hawaiian Long Form Birth Certificate&quot; procured by Obama is a blatant forgery. Neither does it mention why Obama being born outside the United States (in his case, Kenya) is significant. </p>

<p>The US immigration and nationality law which in force when Barack Obama was born in 1961 was not the same as today, and at the time a US citizen mother did not automatically confer US citizenship on her child, if it was born outside the US.</p>

<p>Specifically, Obama&#39;s American mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, was too young to be eligible to confer her US citizenship onto Barack Obama in August 1961. The relevant piece of legislation is the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 301(a)(7). Details in the link below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sr7yn/many_people_assume_that_obamas_birthplace_doesnt/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sr7yn/many_people_assume_that_obamas_birthplace_doesnt/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted about this many times, and it&#39;s one of those conspiracies that most people don&#39;t seem to care about. Which is odd, because the fact that Barack Obama became US President when he wasn&#39;t a US citizen at birth, and there is no record of him ever becoming a US citizen subsequently, is one of the greatest con tricks of all time.</p>

<p>Obama being born in Kenya</p>

<p>Cruz born in Canada (end of story) , the constitutional lawyers would have pounced if he had got the R nomination.</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s Keyan certificate is supposed to have been British, the style and content was obvious American composed and written, this was a &#39;Rathergate&#39; exercise ie an obvious fake copy released and distributed first to discredit a correct original.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In fact there is no constitutional requirement that a President MUST be born in the United States. The requirement is that he/she must be an American from birth (&quot;natural born&quot; as opposed to naturalized).</p>

<p>Like Obama, Ted Cruz&#39;s mother was a US citizen and his father wasn&#39;t. But unlike Obama (born 1961), Cruz (born 1970) was a US national at birth because his mother was eligible to pass on her US citizenship. </p>

<p>The 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act was superseded by a new version in 1965, and the clause that disqualified Ann Dunham from passing on her US nationality to Barack Obama was removed from the 1965 (and subsequent versions).  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the point, isn&#39;t it? Not that it would have made him eligible to be President, but there is no evidence that Obama ever applied to become a naturalised citizen. Obama was the tenth US President to be born a British subject, but the first to be ineligible for the office.</p>

<p>No, the point is that for your story to be true his grandparents would have to have been planning for him to run for president at birth.  He didn&#39;t apply to become a naturalized citizen because he did not need to...</p>

<p>Most likely the TOS says that Reddits owns the content you post, but even if not then there&#39;s probably fair use and parody laws that might pertain to it.  You could try and ask in the sub where people ask about legal questions, but I doubt you&#39;ll get very far.  It&#39;s worth trying if you want to, however.</p>

<p>For content, like messages and original fiction, if it&#39;s made/posted on Reddit using your account then Reddit likely has something in the TOS that says they own it.  There was someone would came up with a really cool post about a modern military squad that accidentally gets transported to the past and has to fight a Roman legion, which I think ended up starting the sub <a href="/r/flashfiction">/r/flashfiction</a>.  Some company tried to option the idea from the poster, but last I heard there was some issue with Reddit because they were the ones who technically owned the idea.  </p>

<p>You keep saying reddit &quot;most likely&quot; has something in the user agreement. Why not just <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement">read it</a> and find out?</p>

<p>The current agreement states users retain the ownership rights of what you write here but allows them to use for any reason and even modify the content. You can do what you want with your content but apparently so can they. Previous agreements didn&#39;t have the word &quot;modify&quot; in there, but Huffman broke this agreement and modified users comments (without their knowledge or consent) so they added that word probably to cover themselves ex post facto. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading your theory, I think I&#39;m almost entirely in the same boat - except I do think it was passenger planes that crashed into the buildings. It&#39;s really stupid that we&#39;re supposed to ignore the Israeli &#39;art&#39; students like it&#39;s all made up despite the unexplained video evidence. Also, I vaguely remember a video from 9/11 where there were mannequins positioned in the video and the camera man said &#39;what the fuck.&#39; I haven&#39;t really tried to find it again, though.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure you could&#39;ve crashed 5 planes into a single one of those towers and it would&#39;ve stayed standing.</p>

<p>My biggest problem with 9/11 is just that I flat out don&#39;t believe the evidence agrees with &#39;the towers just collapsed.&#39; Further, George W Bush&#39;s actions carried out after 9/11 make it look like it was a really convenient event for him to carry out his agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny, I went the opposite way. I absolutely believed in most of the theories to start off with but as I tried to justify myself in arguments I realised how many hoops I was having to jump through. Then came to the realisation that most of them are probably untrue. All I really think now is that some elements of the government probably know more than they&#39;re letting on but that&#39;s it and I suspect it&#39;s due to incompetence rather than a grand master plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The official story in 2018 is not all that different from legitimate questioning that was dismissed as conspiracy theory in 2001. Prince Bandar really did fund the terrorists.

    <div class="md"><p>JFK was killed about 18 months after he turned down plans to fake a hikacking pf a commercial airliner to gather support for a war with cuba. That right there takes away about 2/3 of the counter arguments. They would not have asked for a signature if they didn&#39;t have at least somewhat of a plan for keeping the insiders quiet, what to do with the plane, who is going to fly it, etc. They had it figured out back then, and, more disturbingly, they <em>intended</em> to kill, fake, or indefinitely detain a plane&#39;s worth of fake terrorist hostages.</p>

<p>9/11 wasn&#39;t an inside job but the government did some stuff they won&#39;t admit to (controlled demolition of #7, probably shot down one of the planes) as part of their response.</p>

<p>The Franklin Credit Union cover-up and the pedophile groups behind that were connected to Johnny Gosch.</p>

<p>JFK was killed by more than one person acting on behalf of a larger group, probably the Pro War types but maybe the mob.</p>

<p>At high levels identity politics are used to keep the bottom 99% of us worrying about each other instead of the sociopaths at the top.</p>

<p>The Clintons are responsible for at least <em>some</em> of the many suspicious suicides that went down under Bill&#39;s tenure.</p>

<p>Trump colluded with Russia.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t think of any other major ones at the moment.</p>

<p>Yeah, right.  Even if they had wireless detonators on hand, they still would have had to have done a minimal engineering review to determine where to put them, and then convinced people to go place the detonators knowing full well that the building could collapse at any time just like the other two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP I read your theory and I just want to let you know that your final point in “aftermath” about there being “nothing left” is completely false and unsupported by any evidence. The link you gave to support that point actually contradicts your statement. If you look at the last 20 seconds of that video  (#16) you will see the “mountain of steel” and rubble that you say didn’t exist. I like the rest of your theory but this was the one part that obviously stood out to me as a blunder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing with conspiracy theories is that we suffer from iceberg syndrome, e.g. we don&#39;t consciously realize that 90% of that iceberg is below the surface. What makes people angry is anything that conflicts with their larger belief system. Once we acknowledge something isn&#39;t right about the official story we soon realize that our patriotism has been misguided. Every time we pledged allegiance to that flag or sang the Star Spangled Banner we were reinforcing a type of unspoken mind control that only the unpatriotic question the official story on any given topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I take issue with their mention (not by name of course) of PNAC and their mention of the necessity of a &quot;pearl harbor like event&quot; to galvanize the public to support their foreign policy goals. Because that happened, they literally wrote that in a report, and the think tank was a who&#39;s who of Bush Administration officials. Literally Dick fucking Cheney was a founder. By including that 100% factual statement with all the fringe shit it further obfuscates the truth- that regardless of who was responsible, how, or why it happened, the Bush administration <em>wanted</em> <strong><em>something</em></strong> like 9/11 to happen, it did, and then they took advantage of it for <strong><em>previously stated geopolitical goals</em></strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&gt; no one knows what you’re talking about </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m ignorant and that&#39;s your problem!&quot;</p>

<p>Idk man, if you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about have you tried this wonderful new thing called Google? It allows you to search the internet for terms and phrases to find out things that you may not have known before. Here, I&#39;ll go ahead and do it for you (although I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll kneejerk downvote me anyway):  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1992, just before Bush&#39;s father was defeated by Bill Clinton, Wolfowitz wrote a blueprint to &#39;set the nation&#39;s direction for the next century&#39;, which is now the foreign policy of George W. Bush. Entitled &#39;Defence Planning Guidance&#39;, it put an onus on the Pentagon to &#39;establish and protect a new order&#39; under unchallenged American authority.</p>

<p>The US, it said, must be sure of &#39;deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role&#39; - including Germany and Japan. It contemplated the use of nuclear, biological and chemical weaponry pre-emptively, &#39;even in conflicts that do not directly engage US interests&#39;.</p>

<p>Wolfowitz&#39;s group formalised itself into a group called Project for the New American Century, which included Cheney and another old friend, former Pentagon Under-Secretary for Policy under Reagan, Richard Perle.</p>

<p><strong><em>In a document two years ago, the Project pondered that what was needed to assure US global power was &#39;some catastrophic and catalysing event, like a new Pearl Harbor&#39;. The document had noted that &#39;while the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides immediate justification&#39; for intervention, &#39;the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein&#39;.</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/23/usa.iraq1">Article</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Need more sources? Try that Google magic out for yourself. </p>

<p>Anyway, the <em>point</em> of my post (which you desperately seem to wish to avoid understanding) is that by including legitimate, damning information such as that in with all the random fringe theory <em>bullshit</em>, readers will associate future mentions of that information with that fringe bullshit. Seems like it&#39;s already worked on you, you don&#39;t even <strong><em>care</em></strong> about this PNAC shit. I guess it&#39;s all just a coincidence that Bush&#39;s presidency worked out as they wished it to, just like it was a coincidence Cheney&#39;s old pals at Halliburton got tens of billions in no-bid contracts to &quot;rebuild&quot; Iraq. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>just because it&#39;s a conspiracy site doesnt mean it doesnt have factual evidence, right? i clicked through a few of the links and saw eye witness videos, radio interviews, videos of Donald Rumsfeld addressing the 2 billion missing on 9/11. </p>

<p>a good example is the Israeli Art Student claim...the link (<a href="https://conspiracy-cafe.com/apps/blog/show/8636674-preparing-the-wtc-for-destruction">here</a>) i included is a literal conspiracy site, BUT the facts of them being there and the information they provide is still facts. A person should look at any of these sites and use their own common sense / logic to understand and question any bias ... so when i read that article i think &quot;wow that&#39;s crazy, look at all of that potential supporting evidence&quot; but i&#39;m also like &quot;this site/person is making some assumptions and there&#39;s a good chance they were just art students and there&#39;s another explaination, but it&#39;s still weird and worth considering.&quot; </p>

Any of the demographics of people he portrays in his works, seem to feel he is making fun of them. Some of them are probably right, however those people usually are the bigoted, hateful people. By using your real examples, he is actually keeping the story going and keeping a light on it, regardless if you feel it was right or wrong. </p>

<p>You did a pretty good job gathering info on HOW it was done and yes some people made alot of money, but that was just a by product.</p>

<p>The real reason why they fell is because they were BUILT for the sole purpouse that they get destroyed like that in front of the eyes of millions of human beings in the future.</p>

<p>It is all symbolic you see...</p>

<p>The conventiently named Twin Towers represent the two towers/pillars in Masonry.</p>

<p>When they fell, it marked a new stage of the Grand Plan.</p>

<p>A being from the astral plane got freed that day and the whole thing served as a ritual to fool the populous AND as a sacrifice for Someone.</p>

It&#39;s not even supposed to be a rebuttal of the conspiracy theories (it&#39;s not even clear if he&#39;s aware of the theories about them). It&#39;s just a professor talking to some art students about cool stuff he did when he was younger.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find the lecture itself right now but there are videos and pictures of them removing a window up there on the 91st floor to install a little makeshift balcony. They even hired a helicopter to film them from the outside. At the time they called themselves &quot;gelitin art collective&quot; (sic) but they changed the spelling to &quot;gelatin&quot; later on. Those are some good search terms to start with if anyone else wants to do some more digging on them. My second link actually does contain a &quot;detailed&quot; drawing with &quot;coded&quot; language, which is actually a pretty rudimentary sketch of the layout of the floor and the location and nature of the makeshift balcony.</p>

<p>Please note that the quote from the article mistakenly says 148th floor (which didn&#39;t exist) but that the drawings indicate that they are on the 91st.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just the same info and photos the art students released with a bunch of really stupid speculation added. It&#39;s nothing I haven&#39;t seen before.</p>

<p>E.g. the shit load of boxes labeled BB 18. As claimed in the blog post, Littelfuse does make a product with that part number but it&#39;s small enough to fit in a coffee mug and is a terminal for wire that is way larger than would ever be useful in a demolition. There&#39;s not even any reason to think that product is what&#39;s in those boxes. There are probably thousands of products out there with that part number. That doesn&#39;t even look like Littelfuse packaging. When you buy their products in bulk it comes in a box with their logo printed on it and the product number only appears on an adhesive label (I&#39;m an electrician).</p>

<p>Also, the claim that the students are Israeli is pulled completely out of someone&#39;s ass. Also, the author of the post thinks there&#39;s an explosive called &quot;gelatin&quot; (lol) that the group is named after. (There are gelatinous explosives but they&#39;re called &quot;gelignite&quot; or blasting gel)</p>

<p>More salient questions:</p>

<p>Why photograph everything if you&#39;re committing mass murder? Why hire a helicopter to record the balcony? What possible utility would access to 10 square feet of non-structural building facade have for someone trying to take down a skyscraper?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am kind of torn between his new show. I like him as a comedian, watched Ali G in Da House literally 6 times in one day (early 20’s, on a Sunday, no work, smoked a ton of weed and ordered pizza x2 with friends). </p>

<p>When he would “trick” everyone, it was funny, but it wasn’t about politics. It was more to see which big “actor” (or whoever) he could get to fall for his shit and it was funny.</p>

<p>I feel like he’s being too political with this new show. And very bias. One side of the politics. Why not find some stupid democrats to make fun of? There are some. It’s not just republicans. He’s just jumping on the liberal bandwagon at this point. If it wasn’t so bias I could laugh at both sides. </p>

<p>Just tired of politics in comedy. It’s too easy.</p>

<p>As far as my links go, it depends on what you consider “verified or true” info. I haven’t read thru the links since I posted it but I know for sure I included things that actually happened and referenced them accordingly, and included scientific research to back it up (Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth). So I’m not linking ppl to Mashable or Vice, rather supporting my arguement with like, the most verifiable and true info I could find</p>

<p>&quot;Since the collapse of steel-framed skyscrapers due to fires is completely unprecedented, the steel should have been subjected to detailed analysis. So what did the authorities do with this key evidence of the vast crime and unprecedented engineering failure? They recycled it! </p>

<p>The bulk of the steel was apparently shipped to China and India. The Chinese firm Baosteel purchased 50,000 tons at a rate of $120 per ton, compared to an average price of $160 paid by local mills in the previous year.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive been saying it for a while that this subreddit was getting more and more attention then it got brigaded by trump supporters and now its more of a laughing stock pun than ever. People put this subreddit on same level as <a href="/r/donald">/r/donald</a> because so many trumpers flooded it and now you cant read a post without foaming at the mouth red vs blue banter. Both parties are corrupt anyone can be bought doesnt matter what color tie you wear. Yes i vote primarily democrat because Republicans have fallen further faster but look at the DNC and how the NN bill in California got gutted by a democrat paid 60k to fuck us all out of  the best NN bill in the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP I read your theory and I just want to let you know that your final point in “aftermath” about there being “nothing left” is completely false and unsupported by any evidence. The link you gave to support that point actually contradicts your statement. If you look at the last 20 seconds of that video  (#16) you will see the “mountain of steel” and rubble that you say didn’t exist. I like the rest of your theory but this was the one part that obviously stood out to me as a blunder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing with conspiracy theories is that we suffer from iceberg syndrome, e.g. we don&#39;t consciously realize that 90% of that iceberg is below the surface. What makes people angry is anything that conflicts with their larger belief system. Once we acknowledge something isn&#39;t right about the official story we soon realize that our patriotism has been misguided. Every time we pledged allegiance to that flag or sang the Star Spangled Banner we were reinforcing a type of unspoken mind control that only the unpatriotic question the official story on any given topic.</p>

<p>You keep saying reddit &quot;most likely&quot; has something in the user agreement. Why not just <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement">read it</a> and find out?</p>

<p>The current agreement states users retain the ownership rights of what you write here but allows them to use for any reason and even modify the content. You can do what you want with your content but apparently so can they. Previous agreements didn&#39;t have the word &quot;modify&quot; in there, but Huffman broke this agreement and modified users comments (without their knowledge or consent) so they added that word probably to cover themselves ex post facto. </p>
