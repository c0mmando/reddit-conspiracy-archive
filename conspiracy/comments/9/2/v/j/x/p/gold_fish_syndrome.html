        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SS: I ever increasingly am noticing a pattern of goldfish syndrome. It is something we need to, in my opinion, take much more seriously. The barrage of images, media, sounds, colors, things, ideas and information that has been present in my life (29) years has effected an entire generation. We seem to have the inability to remember anything past eight days of it happening.  Las Vegas the largest mass shooting in American history happens. Public freak out. Eight days later: goldfish syndrome. Back to trump,banging out some woman he&#39;d have never gotten if he wasn&#39;t rich. Then 8 days later North Korea is attacking we are going to die...8 days later we have denuclearization and peace talks...and 8 days after that we have laurel vs yanny. 9/11, the Iraq war, Afghanistan, they are bombarding us with so much new insanity that the general public is wiped every eight days, eight seconds whatever.  This is serious. I believe the cause is these screens and social media and addiction to the internet and porn and modern American diet and life style. But it&#39;s hurting us. And it&#39;s allowing the powers that control us to keep controlling us. What other time in history have the Kings gotten away with the absolute theft of the rights and riches of the people with ABSOLUTELY NO PUSHBACK...its 8 seconds later I&#39;m not sure anymore. </p>

<p>Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, making them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the victim and delegitimize the victim&#39;s belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mainstream media and the government are both intimately aware of how reliably short the American attention span is. And just like toddlers, it is used against them to prevent tipping points of outrage on any particular subject or event by replacing the object of their fascination with something new, different, or more distracting.   </p>

<p>When the event is particularly worrisome, like the Occupy Wall Street mass demonstration, interest in it is diluted by the media coverage refocusing the public&#39;s attention on a different aspect. During OWS the media refocused attention on the public nuisance and lack of hygiene aspects of the people gathered and interviewed more than a few inarticulate band-wagoners - all intended to progressively trivialize a mass demonstration of public outage. It was done methodically and with patience while monitoring public sentiment. When that effort coupled with the public&#39;s already abominably short attention span reduced the public&#39;s focus on it, the cops were sent in to drive everyone out without any significant public backlash.  </p>

<p>Totally agree.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Respectfully disagree. If one is going to intellectually accept that the public is not <em>collectively</em> astute enough to know it is being propagandized and thought controlled (and correct it), it&#39;s dishonest to think that they do not also have a commensurate attention span. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>MSM is cancer and it needs to be dismantled.</p>

<p>I think there is a distinct societal need for mainstream media but it absolutely must have the public&#39;s trust which it does not have in its present state. It has abandoned that responsibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MSM refers to specific institutions.  News as a concept is not bad and there is most definitely a need, but MSM is shirking their duties.</p>

<p>Overall, the public is simply too disempowered to be able to organize and enact change.  Two income households that can&#39;t even afford kids, much less take time off to protest, are effectively powerless to march on major issues.  Yet they have just enough that they don&#39;t want to risk it via rioting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because the west is still pretty comfortable. The news is hysterical and people realize it because their lives are either pretty good or the bad things that are happening to them (disease, death, debt etc.) are mostly inevitable.</p>

<p>If America was actually as terrible as people say there would be a lot more unrest. If &quot;The Great Recession&quot; was really anywhere near as bad as the great depression there would have been a revolution in America. It&#39;s all hype.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this is very true. It seems like everyone keeps forgetting major problems in only a few days or less and begins focusing on things that aren&#39;t important. I think is predominately the total failure of the american media redirecting our intrests to unimportant subjects.</p>

<p>For example. California is litteraly on fire right now.... again but no one is focusing on it, only less than a handful of local news stations are reporting on it. There are also heat waves and floods in japan, a great fire in greece, a genocide in malaysia and many other major world problems that no one want&#39;s to focus on.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really think there is a sinister plot behind this, I think that media companies just like other american companies are becoming increasingly more greedy and thus they only focus on news subjects that they know people will pay attention to the most, thus earning them more profit. The cost of this is that the viewers and even the companies themselves are becoming increasingly uninformed about the world around them. I think the internet and media is great for everyone and it&#39;s not like paper news is any more truthful. It&#39;s just corporate greed that is harming our sense of reality. </p>

<p>And no, the jews are not responsible for this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a little of sinister and a little bit just the way the industry works.  The goal now is for everything to &#39;go viral&#39; as in spread quickly and be everywhere.</p>

<p>On top of that we have 24 hour news cycle, so the talking heads are constantly searching for something/anything to talk about.  Furthermore, sensationalism gets eyeballs and sells ads.</p>

<p>Long story short, it&#39;s the corporate media trying to keep ad revenue rollling in, sensationalizing everything to get people to watch, and business and other interests trying to spread viral content.</p>

<p>The fatigue we are all feeling is because they are constantly throwing as much stuff at the wall as possible to see what sticks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a pretty silly argument. What the fuck do you want them to do? Call news outlets and ask them to cover it from now until it gets “solved”? Because guess what, it’s not going to get solved.</p>

<p>MOST people are just trying to get by in life, working a job they hate, married to someone that probably only made them happy enough to believe they couldn’t do better, raising a kid they probably couldn’t afford while wholly lacking the skills to raise them properly. </p>

<p>Not really sure what you’re expecting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The collective <em>we</em> always had short memory. We are completely biased, so biased that we forget our biases right after identifying them ourselves.</p>

<p>This has always happened even in the age of TV. The difference of course is now we are in overdrive, meticulously targeted (almost) 24/7.</p>

<p>Though, one thing that bothers me <strong>even more</strong> is how Google (eg googling) will affect our gray mass long term. Today we don&#39;t try to remember something (say a song, some actor&#39;s name, a movie) anymore, we just google it. And with cloud storage, even memories (photos) can be searched and instantly retrieved, no need for long descriptions (even if mentally). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you are forgetting about goldfish is that people know absolutely nothing about them. </p>

<p>A properly cared for goldfish will grow to 2/3/4 feet in size, they essentially grow to the size of their tank. </p>

<p>This is because people get them because they want something easy and cheap and difficult to screw up ( goldfish can survive in tanks which have been so poorly setup they would kill most other fish ) but in reality they have absolutely no idea how to care for them or how to make them grow and flourish... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in the 90&#39;s. I remember movies used to be slower, meaning the pacing, dialogue, etc. were slower. Nowadays there&#39;s so many quick cuts and movies in general seem fast-paced. I remember watching a video where it showed that the brain enjoys watching quick cuts and scenes rapidly changing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a little of sinister and a little bit just the way the industry works.  The goal now is for everything to &#39;go viral&#39; as in spread quickly and be everywhere.</p>

<p>On top of that we have 24 hour news cycle, so the talking heads are constantly searching for something/anything to talk about.  Furthermore, sensationalism gets eyeballs and sells ads.</p>

<p>Long story short, it&#39;s the corporate media trying to keep ad revenue rollling in, sensationalizing everything to get people to watch, and business and other interests trying to spread viral content.</p>

<p>The fatigue we are all feeling is because they are constantly throwing as much stuff at the wall as possible to see what sticks. </p>
