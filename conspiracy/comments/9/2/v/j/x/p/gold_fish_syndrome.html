       SS: I ever increasingly am noticing a pattern of goldfish syndrome. It is something we need to, in my opinion, take much more seriously. The barrage of images, media, sounds, colors, things, ideas and information that has been present in my life (29) years has effected an entire generation. We seem to have the inability to remember anything past eight days of it happening.  Las Vegas the largest mass shooting in American history happens. Public freak out. Eight days later: goldfish syndrome. Back to trump,banging out some woman he'd have never gotten if he wasn't rich. Then 8 days later North Korea is attacking we are going to die...8 days later we have denuclearization and peace talks...and 8 days after that we have laurel vs yanny. 9/11, the Iraq war, Afghanistan, they are bombarding us with so much new insanity that the general public is wiped every eight days, eight seconds whatever.  This is serious. I believe the cause is these screens and social media and addiction to the internet and porn and modern American diet and life style. But it's hurting us. And it's allowing the powers that control us to keep controlling us. What other time in history have the Kings gotten away with the absolute theft of the rights and riches of the people with ABSOLUTELY NO PUSHBACK...its 8 seconds later I'm not sure anymore.

        Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, making them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the victim and delegitimize the victim's belief.

       The mainstream media and the government are both intimately aware of how reliably short the American attention span is. And just like toddlers, it is used against them to prevent tipping points of outrage on any particular subject or event by replacing the object of their fascination with something new, different, or more distracting.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the event is particularly worrisome, like the Occupy Wall Street mass demonstration, interest in it is diluted by the media coverage refocusing the public's attention on a different aspect. During OWS the media refocused attention on the public nuisance and lack of hygiene aspects of the people gathered and interviewed more than a few inarticulate band-wagoners - all intended to progressively trivialize a mass demonstration of public outage. It was done methodically and with patience while monitoring public sentiment. When that effort coupled with the public's already abominably short attention span reduced the public's focus on it, the cops were sent in to drive everyone out without any significant public backlash.

       It's not short attention span.  It's the complete stranglehold of MSM on public thought.  People really believe the MSM reflects the public, and the MSM purposefully avoids old issues and thus people believe the public's attention span is short.

       Respectfully disagree. If one is going to intellectually accept that the public is not

       astute enough to know it is being propagandized and thought controlled (and correct it), it's dishonest to think that they do not also have a commensurate attention span.

       I think there is a distinct societal need for mainstream media but it absolutely must have the public's trust which it does not have in its present state. It has abandoned that responsibility.

       MSM refers to specific institutions.  News as a concept is not bad and there is most definitely a need, but MSM is shirking their duties.

       Overall, the public is simply too disempowered to be able to organize and enact change.  Two income households that can't even afford kids, much less take time off to protest, are effectively powerless to march on major issues.  Yet they have just enough that they don't want to risk it via rioting.

       It's because the west is still pretty comfortable. The news is hysterical and people realize it because their lives are either pretty good or the bad things that are happening to them (disease, death, debt etc.) are mostly inevitable.

       If America was actually as terrible as people say there would be a lot more unrest. If "The Great Recession" was really anywhere near as bad as the great depression there would have been a revolution in America. It's all hype. Eventually the house of cards will come crumbling down but until then people are rightly NOT freaking out about a bunch of fake news.

       Certain drugs will do that too. If I smoke cannabis I find that reading a novel is almost impossible (reading internet garbage still comes easily). I recently took a break from it and was reading books every night.

       I've heard that from people. I always loved getting high and reading a book; felt like it helped me to become totally engrossed in the world I was reading about. I could never go to the gym high, like some people love to do. Pot effects people differently, who would have thought!

       Actually yes I noticed this as well. I did really well in school all,the way through college. I love learning and reading but since leaving school five years ago I basically moved to information gathering via screen and just started reading Gut and Psychology Syndrome. It takes me an mane amount longer to,retain information and I have to force myself past 25 pages. Not good.

       Yeah this is very true. It seems like everyone keeps forgetting major problems in only a few days or less and begins focusing on things that aren't important. I think is predominately the total failure of the american media redirecting our intrests to unimportant subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example. California is litteraly on fire right now.... again but no one is focusing on it, only less than a handful of local news stations are reporting on it. There are also heat waves and floods in japan, a great fire in greece, a genocide in malaysia and many other major world problems that no one want's to focus on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really think there is a sinister plot behind this, I think that media companies just like other american companies are becoming increasingly more greedy and thus they only focus on news subjects that they know people will pay attention to the most, thus earning them more profit. The cost of this is that the viewers and even the companies themselves are becoming increasingly uninformed about the world around them. I think the internet and media is great for everyone and it's not like paper news is any more truthful. It's just corporate greed that is harming our sense of reality.

       It's a little of sinister and a little bit just the way the industry works.  The goal now is for everything to 'go viral' as in spread quickly and be everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that we have 24 hour news cycle, so the talking heads are constantly searching for something/anything to talk about.  Furthermore, sensationalism gets eyeballs and sells ads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short, it's the corporate media trying to keep ad revenue rollling in, sensationalizing everything to get people to watch, and business and other interests trying to spread viral content.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fatigue we are all feeling is because they are constantly throwing as much stuff at the wall as possible to see what sticks.

       The reason the media moves on so fast is because they’re for rating TV. 24 hour coverage, here is his face, here is how we paint his motives in favor of republican/democrat/whatever the fuck politicol views the news channel is in favor of, and here is the weather. They want ratings, not unbiased coverage.

       This is a pretty silly argument. What the fuck do you want them to do? Call news outlets and ask them to cover it from now until it gets “solved”? Because guess what, it’s not going to get solved.

       The collective
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       always had short memory. We are completely biased, so biased that we forget our biases right after identifying them ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has always happened even in the age of TV. The difference of course is now we are in overdrive, meticulously targeted (almost) 24/7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though, one thing that bothers me
       <strong>
        even more
       </strong>
       is how Google (eg googling) will affect our gray mass long term. Today we don't try to remember something (say a song, some actor's name, a movie) anymore, we just google it. And with cloud storage, even memories (photos) can be searched and instantly retrieved, no need for long descriptions (even if mentally).

       What you are forgetting about goldfish is that people know absolutely nothing about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       A properly cared for goldfish will grow to 2/3/4 feet in size, they essentially grow to the size of their tank.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is because people get them because they want something easy and cheap and difficult to screw up ( goldfish can survive in tanks which have been so poorly setup they would kill most other fish ) but in reality they have absolutely no idea how to care for them or how to make them grow and flourish...

       I grew up in the 90's. I remember movies used to be slower, meaning the pacing, dialogue, etc. were slower. Nowadays there's so many quick cuts and movies in general seem fast-paced. I remember watching a video where it showed that the brain enjoys watching quick cuts and scenes rapidly changing.

       It's a little of sinister and a little bit just the way the industry works.  The goal now is for everything to 'go viral' as in spread quickly and be everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that we have 24 hour news cycle, so the talking heads are constantly searching for something/anything to talk about.  Furthermore, sensationalism gets eyeballs and sells ads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short, it's the corporate media trying to keep ad revenue rollling in, sensationalizing everything to get people to watch, and business and other interests trying to spread viral content.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fatigue we are all feeling is because they are constantly throwing as much stuff at the wall as possible to see what sticks.

       I can get stoned and read digital comics all day but I get bored of reading as well. I need the visual component.

       I mean what do you expect us to do about California? Have a national emergency and freak out every time they go up in blaze? If we did that we’d never get anything done. We’re desensitized to all of this shit now because it happens so much.

       Genocide here, bombing here, shooting here. Nothing surprises us anymore. It’s all commonplace in the world we live in.
