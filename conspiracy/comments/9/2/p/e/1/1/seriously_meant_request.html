Do you know what the angle of repose is and why it should be noticeably different on mars then on earth? In other words they tell us gravity is drastically different on mars so the hill formation on mars should form at a steeper angle then on earth since they don&#39;t we can assume mars is actually Greenland and NASA is a huge money making scam. </p>

<p>It could easily be the same reason they lied in 69. Plus, if they got away with the charade in 69, why wouldn&#39;t they just keep lying. It&#39;s cheaper than actually going, and they could divert the extra cash to anything they wanted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some disagree with your assumptions based on your understanding of the angle of repose</p>

<p>**&gt; 5</p>

<blockquote>
<p>] On Earth, these angles are primarily a function of grain
roughness, angularity, and sorting. Moisture content and
interparticle forces such as electrostatics may also play a role
[
Allen
, 1969, 1970;
Carrigy
, 1970;
Cooke et al
., 1993]. It
has long been assumed that the values of the angles of repose
were independent of gravity. This is because when we exam-
ine the equations for the static angle of repose, <strong>the gravity term
for both the shear and normal stresses is identical and thus
cancels out of the equation entirely</strong> [
Melosh
, 2011, p. 328].
A similar argument, which uses kinetic as opposed to static
friction, applies to the dynamic angle of repose.** </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too many conspiracies opt for mind-numbing complexity and guess-work.</p>

<p>Truth be told the easiest reason that the moon landing may not have occurred as we were shown is that either the US would not want to show the USSR what it was capable of/how it was done - or to fake it to claim the &quot;victory&quot;.</p>

<p>There is a film called &quot;Kubrick&#39;s Odyssey&quot; and it details the life and accomplishments of Stanley Kubrick, his associations and the ridiculous amount of symbology within his film &quot;The Shining&quot;. The film itself is a pay to view production, however this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Koe1YWulsE">10 minute video</a> takes a fair and unbiased view at the film and SOME of its claims (this 10 minute video in no way produces the same understanding as the 2 hour movie I saw).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, you can&#39;t really say <em>&quot;America! Ze bezt&quot;</em> with a blurred photo of some white sand, unfocused dudes and total blackness behind it. It had to be HD-quality (in the 60&#39;s!) like this:</p>

<p>You can <em>almost</em> see the kubrick&#39;s line separating the scenario in the background from the floor, like these ones: </p>

<p>Now, I really don&#39;t think Kubrick &quot;faked the moon landing&quot;. But I do find it possible that he understood the significance of the event and how a few better pictures - probably based on <em>real</em> photos - would be harmless and actually beneficial for the greatest moment of mankind yet. So he gave them a few tips.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if you were as serious as you say you would just use the search bar and find previous posts with dedicated information/links.</p>

<p>Usually people that post these just want to discuss their beliefs that are usually based on content they witnessed in the past but can&#39;t recollect.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t have any real intention of learning anything.</p>

<p>Which is why they want others to post their information instead of taking a few seconds to look for themselves.</p>

<p>And remember, every time you (the public who responds to these posts) give information to these types of posts, you are allowing others to see how.much YOU actually know. And what YOUR beliefs are.</p>

<p>Why is that important?</p>

<p>Well after enough post history, they (being bots, programs and companies), can use this information to get a virtual profile of you.</p>

<p>From there, well it&#39;s anyones ball park.</p>

<p>By all means.</p>

<p>Any reason you couldn&#39;t search for yourself? Im honestly curious.</p>

<p>There are already plenty of MegaThreads. By people who actually contribute long posts with well sourced links.</p>

<p>All this type of thread does is get people to confirm their beliefs on their accounts so as to better give others an  idea of their personality type.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just my educated opinion.</p>

<p>As for the battle of L.A.</p>

<p>Why not watch the various documentaries?</p>

<p>Do you really believe someone on Reddit is going to give you better information than one of the people who try to explain the situation with proven science?</p>

<p>At best people will point you to these documentaries.</p>

<p>At worst you get opinions from people with no real input but speculation and hearsay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They probably figured out they couldn&#39;t go after the promise was already made and billions were already spent... so they just faked it.  </p>

<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The SIMPLEST way to collect convincing footage would be to  have two hand held video cameras rolling simultaneously, pointed at each other. Simultaneous tripod footage would have been possible to fake, but handheld, full motion video from two independent angles would be virtually impossible.  </p>

<p>VERY EASY to do if you really go to the moon... or if you have year 2000+ CGI... but it would have been impossible in the 60&#39;s, 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s to fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i dont have a problem with sats in geostationary and low earth orbits or some unmanned missions, but here are some i remember:</p>

<p>faking earth shots from low orbit in a darkened cockpit, using a circular window, making it appear the earth is far away</p>

<p>the van allen belt radiation is too strong in an unshielded spacecraft</p>

<p>the lander itself looks too flimsy</p>

<p>the shot of the ascending lander.  who took it?</p>

<p>money - stealing taxpayers money is always the name of the game - today, in the past and in the future</p>

<p>modern space walk footage with bubbles and scuba tanks means underwater videography is being presented as genuine even today</p>

<p>numerous other inconsistencies</p>

<p>the fact its all run by masons and that nasa stands for never a straight answer</p>

<p>science fiction writers starting with the likes of h. g. wells or jules verne (and hollywood ofc) indoctrinated many generations with fake beliefs in future utopia and these beliefs must realize in the eyes of the public to prevent mass opt-outs from the whole fraudulent system.  a pie in the sky</p>

<p>ultimately it smells like a long con, a global control mechanism and a distraction from our enslaved terrestrial reality, paving a way for space based weapons and false flag alien threat (the eastern superpowers cant remain the bogey man for too long).</p>
