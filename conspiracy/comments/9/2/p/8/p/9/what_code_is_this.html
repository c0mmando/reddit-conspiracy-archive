    <div class="md"><p>It could be some other crypto as well, XRP was just the first one that was pretty close when I looked at CMC.  If you really wanted to find out you could find the list of all BTC-XRP markets, then pull the historical data from 22:30:00-22:35:00 from the past several days, then look to see if any match.  If it is a crypto trading bot and you know what it is trying to do you could reverse engineer it and potentially find a way to take advantage of it.  Normally exchange logs have more information like a more detailed timestamp, UIDs for the transactions, etc.  If you look at CMC CoinEx Market has been doing a relatively high volume at above average prices over the last 24 hours <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinexmarket/">https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinexmarket/</a> .  It has a pretty big value in BTC range for XRP-{LTC,USD,BTC}  but they are all higher than average so it could potentially be arbitrage trading, currently the spread between exchanges is big enough that one could make $0.03-0.06 per XRP which is 6-12% profit which should be enough to cover transfer fees and commissions.</p>

<p>Also, XRP does have that huge escrow account for price stabilization <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-escrows-55-billion-xrp-for-supply-predictability/">https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-escrows-55-billion-xrp-for-supply-predictability/</a>, if someone found a way to remove small amounts from there it would be big news.  I doubt this is related but</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much for your answer, you seem to be very good informed!!!</p>

<p>I texted parts of your msg back to my contact and got some more information out of him!</p>

<p>Its not XRP</p>

<p>Bot is involved too but not big yet.</p>

<p>Exchange is Bittrex</p>

<p>Maybe you have some more information about that crypto trading bot? For what is that good and why could it be important?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know a lot about trading bots, for this one in particular I have no idea how it works.  Knowing it is not XRP narrows it down to less than 10 other currencies traded on bittrex in the price range.  From there looking at trade history should make it possible to track when the trade was.</p>

<p>To profile the bot you would need to figure out what kind it is, market maker, accumulator, arbitrage, etc.  Once you know that you can monitor the order book to determine how often it will cancel, as well as trades to identify when an automated sell followed by a purchase order is made to work out the spread a market maker is using, in one example.  It can be extremely complicated to profile competitor trading algorithms and bots, and ultimately it is impossible to know if you are right without seeing the configuration of the bot or its source code.  Once you know enough about a bot you could potentially use that information to make sure that you prevent their trades from hitting or help you to make money.  But all that is somewhat beyond the scope of this sub, unless of course this is related to one of those insider pump and dump groups that were popular a couple of months back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow awesome information, thank you so much for sharing!!!</p>

<p>Okay well so there are many diffrent types of bots... but are they all the same in essence? Like just some code or is there allready some ai trading bot stuff going on?</p>

<p>So if we knew where the code belongs to the only thing we could do is prevent their trades or help make money? That seems to be very little, why would he inform me about this, got any more clues?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really seems like a joke of some sort, it could be some sort of pump and dump.  There are plenty of other things you could do if you know enough about the code, like finding out if there are ways to make it sell positions at a loss or trigger emergency bailout conditions for the bot.  It is all a matter of creativity and the amount of resources you are willing to spend reverse engineering the bot.  Unless it is trading huge positions in a very silly manner it is likely not worth the effort.</p>

<p>I have no idea why someone would send you this info, possibly a joke to a wrong number?  If I found a bot trading 9XRP at a time I would joke about it with the people who knew about the bot.  So assuming that the exchange requires integers for the volume with a value this low and has a 1 unit commission a profitable trade round trip would have needed to start with 7 or less units, meaning the trade had to have a profit of at least 28.5%, which technically speaking is a big move, but it is a silly amount to be trading with that sort of commission.</p>
