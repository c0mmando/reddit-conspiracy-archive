       The Shining also has some pedophile stuff, mostly implying Jack has abused his son (I'm blanking on the son's name). That movie is so dense, I love trying to unpack it all.

       There's a bunch of references to Jack's alcoholism and the son's "accident" which I interpret as Jack at the least beating his son badly, if not abusing him sexually. Then there's a weird vision type scene in one of the rooms where a man in a suit is sitting on the bed with another man dressed as a bear or some sort of animal kneeling in front of him. If you Google it there are breakdowns and interpretations of the scene and how the shot is framed similarly to other scenes featuring the son. Its Kubrick so people have picked apart every frame, some of it is compelling and other details seem a stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've never seen Room 237 it's a cool documentary that breaks down a ton of interpretations of The Shining.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the book it's a bit different, referring to former guests of the hotel.

       Not really a conspiracy but Dr. Strangelove features the Dead Hand which is still operational in Russia. I have been unable to figure out if people knew about the Dead Hand prior to that film.

       I don't know if it's just a myth or not but I heard military officials were actually concerned at how realistic the War Room was.

       I actually heard that its the actual room too. Apparently there were picture found of Kubrick with top people at the pentagon found that were taken during the filming of Dr. Strangelove. This could potentially link this theory but who knows.

       That is good info but all it takes is literally two seconds of critical thinking about the moon landing to realize that in 1969, the American public was fooled by Hollywood SFX before they became more well known to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I.e. “the military has technology 20 years ahead of the population”
      </p>
      <p>
       Why shouldn’t we believe the government had 1990 movie FX in 1969 and faked that shit.

       That doesn’t mean your dad saw it land on the moon. He saw it launch into the distance.. over the ocean... seems pretty easy to ya know, dump what you don’t need over the ocean and get ready for the landing charade when the astronauts “return home”

       I'm pretty sure he was the guy they went to whenever they needed to make a fake story in the media. If you've ever seen the movie 'Wag the Dog', imo the movie producer character was definitely based on Stanley Kubrick. Essentially, the movie is about a presidential sex scandal right before the election, so they start a fake war with Albania and use the Stanley Kubrick character to film all of the fake war scenes and whatnot.

       Do you have a shred of proof at all that it was fake? I hate this conspiracy. It's so fucking dumb. When did we actually start going into space and able to do the things we obviously fucking do?

       I think the race had something to do with this conspiracy, USA was in space race against USSR, so the suggestion is USA fake the 1969 moon landing in order to claims victory over USSR for moon landing or something, because previously if I remember correctly USSR has won every previous test (won mean was first to succeed) such as first launch in space, first inhabited launch, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I personally believe that 1969 might be fake in order to win but then they managed to go there later on, that's my view.

       And the advanced nation (russia) wouldn't have called us out on it? They wouldn't observe the situation and prove us wrong with evidence? It is just ridiculous. Getting to the Moon isn't even that hard of a feat. It is rather easy to.imagine how to get there yet people talk like it is impossible.

       Supposedly there is almost 30 minutes of Eyes Wide Shut that was cut out related to the rich dude that the wife was dancing and flirting with. It would end in selling their daughter to the two guys at very end of the movie. After showing the full movie to the execs he
       <em>
        died
       </em>
       four days later.

       Who knows if that's the case. But there is a precedent that the occult have to advertise their actions to the public by symbolism of what's going on so that there is a level of acceptance even if it's subconscious.

       He was an enlightened being who gave us multi-dimensional, spiritual art with many, many levels. A thousand people can watch his something like e.g. The Shining and each see a different movie with different themes. Thus conspiratorial minded people will see that in his movies, because it's there. Then leave the invented universe of e.g. Eyes Wide Shut and project on to what they think is Kubrick's personal life (which they have no clue) what level they saw the movie at (e.g. Kubrick was killed by the elites he portrayed in the movie).
      </p>
      <p>
       The man was a genius filmmaker working on many, many levels at once. He came to earth, rattled our subconscious's and left.

       I think Kubrick was trolling us all because he liked the idea of people thinking he faked the moon landing.  (I mean, the boy's Apollo 11 sweater in The Shining is so over-the-top in-your-face.)
