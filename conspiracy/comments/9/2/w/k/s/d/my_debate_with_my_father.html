<p>I keep all the usual banter for others who want to chat and want to discuss.  Family just stays in that family realm and that&#39;s that.  Consider that no relationship with your father is not preferrable to being right.  </p>

<p>Well, maybe for you you guys can still be pals and debate.  That would be neat.  Don&#39;t see that too often.  Hope it all works out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What’s hand waving or an appeal in this:</p>

<p>R_mu_nu - 1/2 R * g_mu_nu + Lambda * g_mu_nu = ( 8 * pi * G / c<sup>4</sup> ) * T_mu_nu</p>

<p>?</p>

<p>This is an incredibly simple formula. It’s solutions form several other more specific formulas but they all derive directly from this using the basic rules of algebra and calculus.</p>

<p>From this, I can tell you with 100% accuracy where Mercury will appear in the sky at any particular time. Until Einstein, no-one could do that from a formula. They knew from observation but they couldn’t explain why.</p>

<p>His simple formula - which had nothing to do with Mercury when he derived it - perfectly explains this millennia old mystery.</p>

<p>The best part is that you don’t an authority to believe this. You just need to look up at the sky, take some measurements, then do some math that takes a little patience but is absolutely within the grasp of anyone with a high school education.</p>

<p>That’s it. That’s all anyone needs.</p>

<p>Now you tell me what’s handwaving about a prediction that provides 100% accuracy 100% of the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His equations don&#39;t even work out. To the point where you have to add 96% dark matter and dark energy. You might as well believe in the virgin birth. All bs. Scientific goboligook. Einstein was a fraud. Not only that, but he had not a single original thought</p>

<p>Curved space was thought of by Bernhard Riemann. Adding a 4th dimension that of time to geometry to create &quot;space-time&quot;, by Hermann Minkowski. The idea that objects contract in proportion to the speed that which that they move, by George Francis, FitzGerald. The notion that the velocity of light in a vacuum was constant regardless of the motion of any object connected with the light ray by Hendrik Lorentz. Was he the first to bring up the impossibility of measuring light through the ether, after the Michelson Morly experiment null results? No! That was actually Henri Poincare. Did he even come up with the name relativity? NO! that was Poincare. How about no velocity can exceed the speed of light? Nope! Poincare! How about that whole clock business? you know, the fact that if you go at the speed of light, you age slower than if you stood on earth? NOPE That was actually Sir Joseph Larmor. Was he the one who came up with matter crinkles curved space? sorry to say no. That was actually William Kingdon Clifford. okok.. what about E=MC2? nope. J. J. Thomson came up with E = 3/4 MC2 and then later on our buddy Poincare came up with E=MC2 when he spoke to mass density in relation to energy density. I can go on and on...lets not forget all the shit he stole from Oliver Heaviside. Dude was a piece of shit. A simple propaganda tool. A patent clerk with no math background. A tool alright.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to make a statement that is true.</p>

<p>You have allowed yourself to be inaccurate about what people actually thought of Einstein at the time. Anyone who followed physics knew the history and knew Einstein didn&#39;t develop everything in a vacuum. Same thing goes for today. The history of physics is taught to students every day. They show the predecessors of Einstein that Einstein developed his theory on.</p>

<p>Now I am going to point out that even with your own little rant here you are wrong. Thompson didn&#39;t purpose e=3/4mc2 and poincare had his theory completely off base as to what e=mc2 meant. Couldn&#39;t connect it to any actual mass.</p>

<p>What Einstein understood that none of those people you mentioned could wrap there head around was that mass directly equals eneryg. Mass is energy. It was a completely radical approach to the issue. The rest of those people were attempting to create equations showing how much energy there is when effects such as inertia or heat or electromagnetism etc is applied to mass. All the while we&#39;re missing the forest for the trees. Mass is energy directly. There doesn&#39;t have to be anything applied to it.</p>

<p>You have went off the rails in your own mind. Einstein was a fucking genius. He was able to use imagination to put it all together. Obviously there are people that came before that he used their studies and data to come to these conclusions but ultimately they are his conclusions because they all had the puzzle pieces but none were smart enough to put the puzzle together.</p>

<p>Rethink yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the astronauts were doing interviews a few glitches happened with the cgi sceen for instance they became pixelated but the background was unaffected, another time a guy disappeared before he went around a corner. They&#39;ve had cables showing when they do flips a few times.  I think one of the biggest mistakes is when President Bush was taking a tour of NASA and they forgot to turn off the big monitors which was showing an astronaut in front of a blue screen and the ISS background on the other screen with him in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to approach this carefully. You cannot use logic to shift a person who didn&#39;t use logic to arrive at their ideas in the first place.</p>

<p>I recommend speaking to him his an open, non-judgmental mind. Try to have a conversation, but don&#39;t try to change his mind. Feel free to point out if his ideas are internally inconsistent, but focus more on having him explain exactly what he thinks.</p>

<p>Your father probably gets something out of this belief. Some people feel special for discovering something, or are comforted by the idea that a grand conspiracy can be blamed for the world&#39;s problems, or 100 other reasons beyond simple logical deduction. It&#39;s this underlying issue you&#39;ll have to understand and combat. What need does this conspiracy fulfill in his life, and are there other, more healthy ways, to fulfill the same need?</p>

<p>Until and unless you can address this issue, no amount of logical argument, reasoned deduction, or obvious evidence will be able to change his mind.</p>
