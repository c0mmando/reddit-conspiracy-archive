        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I can&#39;t find anything online and I thought this was the perfect sub to ask this question. I know you gotta sell your soul to get famous, but there are celebs who talk about this shit (I actually just saw Kanye West&#39;s speech in which he says that Jay-z has killers and asks him not to send them &quot;on his head&quot;. Damn, how is this so old and I never saw it before?) and rappers that don&#39;t get played on the mainstream radio&#39;s despite non violent lyrics and popularity. There are singers that were quite famous but then they sort of disappeared from the public (I mean, there are articles about them but they&#39;re not promoted very much - maybe they didn&#39;t sell their souls and that&#39;s why?) even though they&#39;re still making music. They&#39;ve got their own little fan bases.</p>

<p>So, are there any celebs that didn&#39;t sell their soul and are still alive and doing well (possibly still making music)? I&#39;m honestly not too deep in the topic, so I don&#39;t wanna talk shit, but Jordyn Sparks and Leona Lewis come to my mind. If I remember correctly, Chance the Rapper somehow got fame not being signed to any label (there are theories on how he&#39;s an industrial plant though and this actually makes sense and breaks my heart at the same time lol. He seems like such a nice dude). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His show was hugely popular but underfunded. He eventually cracked under the pressure and ended up sort of hiding out in South Africa for a bit. He came back but has only recently returned to standup. He also had issues with the show&#39;s popularity interfering with his standup where people would cut him off by yelling show quotes in the middle of his bits. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame, the show was great and with some more funding and help I think they could have churned out a lot more than we got.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t crack at all.  That&#39;s part of the bullshit the media painted him as.</p>

<p>The truth is, he is solid as a rock for standing up and not buckling like many suckers do when given the choice.</p>

<p>They would&#39;ve jusg used him up like the rest and destroyed him when he was no longer popular.</p>

<p>Dave said they wanted to get him hooked on pills.  That&#39;s their control.  Get&#39;s out of line.....pull the plug.....watch him spiral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want trying to paint. that as the absolute truth, just the story I&#39;ve heard. I don&#39;t doubt he had handlers that were trying to get him to do the right dance, but I&#39;ve also never found any hard evidence of exactly what they wanted from him other than more skits, cheaper, and faster. Maybe that was it, maybe they wanted him to push some agenda, I don&#39;t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I know.  Im just adding to your comment because Dave himself spoke a lot about it.  Whk knows what the real agenda was.  I think it was just simple manipulation, control and money making.</p>

<p>Have you heard much about the hollywood star whackers that Mr. Quaid and his wife ran to Canada to seek refuge from?</p>

<p>This is what I think is connected at this level.  Control over TV personalities to make money from and make even more when they run their course and crash and burn in the public eye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! I think Dave knew what was up and just didn’t want to play TPB sick game. He knew he was worth more than what they were giving him for his work. So he said fuck you you don’t want to pay me what I’m worth then fuck you guys you don’t get any of the money that I produce. And left. Seems like a solid dude. Then again I don’t know every little detail about him and everybody’s got their secrets but for the most part I don’t get any shitty bad vibes from the dude and glad that he got out of the situation before it got worse</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts exactly! I&#39;m curious about the people who are sort of famous, like, still popular but not the top level (like maybe Kylie Rye Jepsen, Little mix). There is that, umm, lower level as well, like Nick Murphy and Dennis Lloyd (Joe Badass used to be on that level but I&#39;m pretty sure he sold his soul). Please, don&#39;t sell ya souls you great, super real artists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Chance the Rapper is compromised. (I&#39;d be curious to hear the theory) There are tons of celebrities who haven&#39;t sold their soul, as it were, but if you get big enough, and you&#39;re talking shit about the &quot;Illuminati,&quot; your life is on the line. I like Joe Rogan a lot, he&#39;s a pretty big celeb at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chance&#39;s manager is a billionaire heir that uses his own money to support Chance; don&#39;t need the labels if you can fund everything yourself.</p>

<p>My own personal take on &#39;selling your soul&#39; is that it means: you have to play a character for the rest of your career. You can&#39;t ever be yourself. If lady gaga wanted to just be &#39;Stephanie&#39; for a day and go to whole foods and get some granolla, she couldn&#39;t do that. If you &#39;sell your soul&#39;, you basically have to stop being yourself and only be the character your perform as 24/7. They control your body: &quot;Hey, can&#39;t eat that cheeseburger bud, you got a photoshoot coming up!&quot; &quot;Hey, your trainer called and said he missed you today....gotta look good for that movie we&#39;re shooting next month!&quot;. If you&#39;re a female star and you get pregnant, your manager WILL tell you to get an abortion (they can&#39;t force you to, but please believe they&#39;ll try as hard as they can to talk you out of it). They control your mind, giving you updates about what&#39;s &#39;working&#39; and &#39;whats not&#39;, planting ideas about what you &#39;have&#39; to do to continue to be successful. Here&#39;s who you have to date, here&#39;s what you have to say, here&#39;s where you have to be, day after day after day.</p>

<p>To reach that iconic, pop-star level of fame requires you essentially giving up everything about your personality and yourself to play a character, who&#39;s personality and self are dictated by other people. That&#39;s &#39;selling your soul&#39;. The devil is money and fame. That&#39;s what you sold your soul for, and that&#39;s who you sold it too (others that worship at the alter of mammon)</p>
