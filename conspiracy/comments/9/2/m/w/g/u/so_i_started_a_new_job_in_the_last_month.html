       I've started a new job in the last month. I've been using my girlfriend's cell phone for work. I was unemployed for quite a while so I haven't had a personal cell for almost a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did an "away" trip with work and had her phone so that I could still keep in contact with the office and fellow employees if I needed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       She has been getting "people you may know" suggestions of all the people at the new place I work. I haven't received ANY of them on my Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Facebook is using cell usage to determine connections? Wtf. Who would be giving them this data?

       Her contacts are probably linked to Facebook, so any numbers that have come up on the phone that are linked to other facebook accounts will trigger them on people you may know... then their friends, and so on.

       I'll be getting a new one after this pay period. We don't "share" a cell. She allowed me to use it while I was away so I could be in contact with work. I was off-shore filming something.

       Because at times everyone is curious, so at some point you dig, you see how many calls were from that dude she works with. no biggie. then 1 day he's on your people you may know on Facebook still no big deal, it happened to you to. then you see their already friends.  probably innocent...but that one day you are feeling insecure, and it happens to everyone every now and then, and on that day, the questions start coming. Why is this person that you work with all over your facebook. he called you once when you weren't even at work... still probably innocent, but now u have doubt. and so does she.  or you never say anything about something you see. but eventually, you will see something you have a question about. and those type questions tend to come out at the worst times.

       Trust was obviously not already there if he's digging through her phone. What's he's saying might be true in that it doesn't let trust root and grow. But it seems to me that OP and his girlfriend already have trust established.

       Who is sending the info to Facebook though? A new number coming up on your phone... is instantly cross listed with numbers that Facebook has a record of?
      </p>
      <p>
       That seems extremely invasive to me. Do you think FB would have to have agreements in place with cell carriers? It's pretty messed up.

       It's got nothing to do with the carrier. If you use Facebook on your phone it lifts all the contacts and adds them to suggested friends. It has done this for years.

       This because I deleted my Facebook over 6 years ago and at least three phones ago but when I added a Facebook messenger to my phone without using my old login or info simply the same number it keeps suggesting old people I was only in contact with on Facebook like from HS who I don’t have in this phone. And again I never resigned up for face book I downloaded messenger to send my daughter a couple pictures that wouldn’t send to her phone the only info I used was my phone number but it kept trying to redo my old account.

       I honestly don't believe this has anything to do with contacts, but just location data. They have location data of him and these other people being in the same location all day for days on end and decided that "you may know these people."

       Yeah some devious stuff is going on between cell carriers, social media companies, and probably the government agencies such as NSA. I have a feeling we only know the very tip of what they are doing and why.

       I look at my call history and one contact has two numbers associated with it. There's his real cell phone number plus another one that's all zeroes with my social security number contained in the string of zeroes.  I regularly talk with this person.  What?

       Google knows where I stay at AirBnBs. I never explicitly made the connection.  It's handy, don't get me wrong -- it's soooo much easier to get around a foreign city with a smartphone. And I've had entire lunch conversations via Google Translate. But it's definitely a double-edged sword.

       Facebook doesn't need to get your data from you, they can get it from people who contact or talk about you.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example. if you call or are called by someone who is sharing their contact information with Facebook, Facebook now knows you're connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't have to be direct connections either. You can talk to personA and Facebook can recommend you connect with someone in personA's network.

       Yes. I noticed a few months ago when I started a new job as well. Everyone that was at work with me that day was suggested as a friend. Same when the service staff changed a few days later. It has nothing to do with your contacts. I have/had not entered those peoples contacts into my phone. An to top it off. I do not even use the FB app itself. I use Tinfoil for FB.

       I don't think any of that has to do with it. I'm fairly certain those types of suggestions are purely location based. If you and another person are in persistent close proximity based on your location data, you will be given a suggested friend request.

       I know they can because they do it to me all day everyday. I was a TI for a long time but once they ruined my life basically the stalkers backed off. Now I deal with mind reading, "voice to skull", and then making me feel sick and gross and laughing about it. So you don't have to wonder if its real anymore. I can tell you 100% that it is.

       You sound like a believer from your other comment you know greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. I am not suggesting your not close in your walk but some scripture study might help with fighting some of the things your referencing off. The “web” or “net” are both talked about in the scripture and we are fast approaching what people consider the Tribulation.

       I had a doctor apt and NEVER looked up anything about it, not even the location since it's right down the road.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally a week later I started getting massive ads for this type of doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The device that it came on did not accompany me to the apt, the only connection was an email.

       I assume Facebook has access to your phone's location data.  Check her settings because Facebook might know where she's at(her phone at least), cross reference it with all of the other people at your work who have Facebook, and then assume she knows them.  If you log in to Facebook at your job, from a computer or something, you'll likely end up getting the same suggestions.

       Yes, Facebook figured it out using GPS. It only needs a few things. It doesn't need the app. It doesn't even need you to log-in to Facebook. It doesn't even need you to be friends with any co-workers on your own Facebook. Here's all that Facebook needs:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        You accessed any website on your phone during the trip.
       </li>
       <li>
        You gave your location to this website.
       </li>
       <li>
        This website had Facebook analytics on it (or you went to Facebook.com) and Facebook got your location.
       </li>
       <li>
        Someone else on the trip did the same thing.
       </li>
       <li>
        You and your girlfriend are "in a relationship" on Facebook or even just friends.
       </li>
       <li>
        Your Facebook profile has one or more of your co-workers as friends, or more likely, has them as "uncertain connections" like friends of friends, etc.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Here's how it works and why Facebook thinks she's connected to them, even if none of your co-workers are friends with you on Facebook:
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't see your uncertain connections, it's more of a percentage thing, but they are tracked in the background. Facebook won't recommend complete strangers. Since it is not sure if you know your co-workers, it won't recommend them. It doesn't have recent location data, and even if it did, maybe you're at a gas station and these are just your regular customers, not friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Facebook then noticed that your girlfriend went to an "event" (i.e. went somewhere she doesn't usually go) based on location data and time spent in that location. It then cross-referenced other "attendees" and became more sure it was an "event". She still could be going to some event where she doesn't know anyone, so these are still uncertain connections for her and wouldn't be recommended. Maybe she's the caterer at a hotel where a conference is going on and has zero connection to these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, Facebook then checked your profile and found you had all these uncertain connections. By cross-referencing these with your uncertain connections it boosted the certainty of these potential connections given that she attended events with a specific set of people--i.e. your uncertain connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are quite a few other things you don't have any control over that will boost the certainty. Like, this specific set of people might already be well-connected and so it decided this was a "group" increasing the certainty.

       I know they can because they do it to me all day everyday. I was a TI for a long time but once they ruined my life basically the stalkers backed off. Now I deal with mind reading, "voice to skull", and then making me feel sick and gross and laughing about it. So you don't have to wonder if its real anymore. I can tell you 100% that it is.

       You sound like a believer from your other comment you know greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. I am not suggesting your not close in your walk but some scripture study might help with fighting some of the things your referencing off. The “web” or “net” are both talked about in the scripture and we are fast approaching what people consider the Tribulation.

       </p>
