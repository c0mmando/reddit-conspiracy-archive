<p>For those new to the “Nuclear Bombs do not exist” conspiracy, brief intro:</p>

<p>Nuclear power exists, creating the cloud of steam seen above cooling towers. </p>

<p>Nuclear-powered pacemakers, exist, etc.</p>

<p>Uranium is one of many very heavy metals used in weapons as penetrating radioactive shrapnel.
Radioactive particles have been disseminated by atmospheric explosions; analogous to infusing traceable substances into your bloodstream.
And excessive radiation is dangerous.</p>

<p>What is shocking is the lack of evidence for explosive nuclear weapons. The whole thing stinks as a grand- propaganda ploy. 
And what a grrreat ploy is has been!</p>

<p>• Piles of explosives take time (and an ocean liner) to deliver, but if everybody thinks <em>total devastation</em> can come in the form of a few rapidly dropped missiles…?
• USA gets an invasive government to protect citizens from this exotic threat from the sky and thereby… 
• Extort protection money! Billions and billions of dollars needed to &quot;fight&quot; a Cold War. How is a Cold War fought? By investing in a “mutually assured destruction”, of course.
• They get an excuse to meddle in sovereign nation&#39;s affairs while unnerving people worldwide.</p>

<p>Before I hit you with the dirt, common retort to this absurd idea is “Hiroshima-Nagasaki”. (other comebacks include “the secret is too big” and “why would countries claim to have one? (or why don’t they challenge the pretense by defying the claim…)</p>

<p>Quickly: August 6 Hiroshima &#39;happened&#39;. August 9th, the Soviets declared war on Japan.</p>

<p>So, agree to USA&#39;s boast that they have an Atomic Bomb, or get invaded by the Soviet Union? Other things were &quot;mutually&quot; agreed upon; Japan was to be occupied, after all.
A defeated nation acquiescing to the victor&#39;s version of events, not surprising at all. History is written by the Victors. </p>

<p>&quot;200,000 people reduced to shadows&quot; sure sounds like propaganda, doesn&#39;t it? </p>

<p>&quot;Hiroshima looked exactly like all the other burned-out cities in Japan.&quot;<br/>
- Major de Seversky. Sounds a lot more reasonable, doesn’t it? </p>

<p>(The official explanation for the lack of a blast crater/bald spot in Hiroshima is the supposed height of the detonation. So, the effects of the nuclear bomb are “spread out”, setting the city on fire. Might as well have been a fire-bombing.)</p>

<p>S.S. To be clear, all of the images and videos I link herein are Fake Hollywood miniature special effects. The featured photograph and accompanying videos are all miniature explosions. </p>

<p>As you watch the proof I have provided, realize that total infrastructure-destruction can be delivered in the form of bombing campaigns, bioweapons, etc. The ferocity of war is not diminished by the revelation that there is no nuclear doomsday weapon. Just the popular image of nuclear annihilation is not correct. </p>

<p>The conspiracy is the false claim that such explosive destruction can be delivered in a small, rapidly deployed container. Perhaps you have already figured-out that the awesome claims for nuclear weapons <em>is probably exaggerated</em>. And if the declassified footage is fake…</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your position: big booms aren&#39;t real cuz little booms look the same?</p>

<p>Many large things in nature have exact miniature counterparts. Take this microscopic wasp.</p>

<p>Does it&#39;s existence make big wasps not real? I&#39;m not trying to be difficult. As someone who&#39;s only seen pics &amp; vids of underwater bombs, nuclear bombs &amp; micro-wasps, I can&#39;t tell you if any are real.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen mt. rushmore, &amp; postcards &amp; miniature. Can confirm: real. Despite the souvenirs.</p>

<p>From there, I spot the same explosion in the &quot;archival footage&quot;. The MGM fake would be the first footage seen by the World representing &quot;nuclear explosion&quot;. This footage &quot;was considered so convincing&quot; it was used in Air Corp Training Films...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comparing pictures of Hiroshima with Dresden or any other firebombed city in WW2 it becomes clear that it was bombed using conventional firebombs. Some pictures show some flattened parts of the city also show that anything made of stone survived the bombs just fine, suggesting these neighborhoods were likely mostly wood buildings which burned to ashes from a firestorm of incendiary bombs, not from a shockwave from a single nuclear bomb. </p>

<p>Then the great nuclear psyop started which lasts to this day, controlling the world with fear and scamming trillions of dollars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is why a nuke wont make more then a mess if it is blown up by a chunk of C4, dropped in a vulcano, or if the explodives go off unexpectedly. A nuclear explosive device requires several things to happen in a very precise order for it to go boom with the flash of light and mushroom cloud we all know and love. </p>

<p>Several seconds before dentonation... A fuse like &quot;irrevocable arming switch&quot; fires closing the weapons arming system charging circuit. Next a series of high voltage capacitors charge up and ready the firing set and neutron pulse generator. Once charged, a pyrotechnic valve fires and tritium gas fills the center of the pit assembly, if you chose less than max yield a second squib charge pinches the gas fill tube shut with a smaller amount of this gas allowed to fill the pit. Next the weapon awaits the initiation comand signal, it comes from a countdown timer if selected, a proximity radar, or a impact accelerometer similar to the kind that triggers an airbag in a car. </p>

<p>Once this signal comes, a pulse coded light signal goes from the firing signal processing/PAL electronics module down a fiber optic cable to the receiver in the firing set switch array trigger module. Immediately  afterwards the array of fast switching tubes calls sprytrons fire. These are small glass vacuum tubes a bit bigger than neon indicator lamps, but hold off a few thousands of volts, with 6 pins. The trigger pulse is applied to two pins on each of these tubes causing them to all fire at once. </p>

<p>The capacitors discharge into the EFI slapper initiation assemblies of the pit assembly. The explosives detonate. When the pulse was applied to the sprytrons, a timer was also triggered that triggers another sprytron to fire just before the pit is fully compressed. When it does a small but powerful neutron pulse generation electron tube fires as the pit is at maximum compression. </p>

<p>If all goes as planned the chain reaction starts and the pit generates lots of energy in the form of gamma rays, neutrons, light, heat, and eventually physical blast pressure. If your weapon is a two stage device the radiation energy from the pit compresses a secondary assembly. A material made of a beryllium carbide loaded foam converts the the strong gamma ray energy from the pit to soft x ray light and delays the neutrons. </p>

<p>The soft x ray light is so powerful it actually compresses the secondary with pressures similar to that found inside the sun. Imagine that, now that is BRIGHT... A consumable snowflake like neutron amplifier made of either plutonium or highly enriched uranium gets hit by the delayed neutrons, undergoes prompt fission, and generates a pulse of neutrons at the right time that ignite the fissile starter assembly of the secondary. This starter acts to convert the lithium 6 in the fusion fuel to tritium. Shortly after this the deuterium and newly created tritium fusion begins releasing lots of neutrons. A neutron spallation wrap on the inner part of the weapon casing reflects the neutrons back at the depleted uranium pusher and tamper causing even more fission. What happens after this is a really big boom... </p>

<p>So yes nuclear bombs are real, and from a nuclear detonation stand point are intrinsically safe, you could make a nasty mess by using extra explosives to blow one up or partially triggering the core explosives,  but it will never go nuclear by mistake.  I hope they never get used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Explanation&quot; is nice, thanks for that.</p>

<p>So, if &quot;explanation&quot; works, why are they faking explosion footage? Also convenient that the replication of &quot;explanation&quot; is impossible.</p>

<p>Thanks, though!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not faked, in fact I had a spare part, MO crystal shutter mechanism, to the camera that made that picture. That picture is the very early stages of detonation just after the photonic pulse.  The reason it looks like an under water explosion is that the air is compressed so severely by the photonic pulse it is similar to the density of molten aluminum.  The image was taken through a narrow tube telescope and filtered through several kinds of glass before being fed to the cameras. What is being shown is mostly the metal casing in the form of superheated plasma.</p>
