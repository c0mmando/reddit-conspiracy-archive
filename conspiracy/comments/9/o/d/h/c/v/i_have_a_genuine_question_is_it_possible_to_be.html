       at the end of the 19th century people began to realize the importance of the homeland. because jews are jews and required a goyim to do their bidding, jews got fucked. they had been so busy fucking over every country they went to they had not preserved a homeland. now hitler comes along, wants his own german blood, so he expels the jews to palestine. the jews are now pissed cuz they have to do their own work, the germans got accused of holocausting jews, so now germany is fucked, and the only people that get to maintain a homeland (I don't know how a racemixed nomad tribe has a homeland but w.e.) are exactly the people who do not deserve one/cannot maintain that on their own. To make it worse, the very holocaust the jews bitch about is now actively being committed against palestinians. and on top of that, the jews subverted the US government, and use it for their own personal gain, hence wars in the middle east.

       they are the heart of all issues in the U.S. If you do not include ZOG, you will be spinning in lala land like the reptilian dude. Modern propaganda is based on the holohoax myth (more recently 9/11), and they are the front of the modern economic war machine. without knowledge of the jewish menace, they perpetuate a collective delusion that people are something other than semi-evolved animals, disconnecting people from nature, and ultimately using them for their own nefarious purposes. the jewish philosophy is the single most destructive force with regards to civilizations.

I just guess that if you're pro-israel you're also pro-conspiracies and would want to help them along instead of stopping/exposing them.

That doesn’t mean that I’m willing to turn a blind eye to wrong doing. It’s like I love ‘em so much that I can’t turn a blind eye to bad because I want them to succeed ya know?

       I am a deep conspiracy theorist but I do not believe that the Jewish people or the state of Israel amount to any conspiracy other than the ordinary conspiracies that always happen when ethno-groups or national states define themselves as such. I will agree only that this ethnic group and nation state are demonstrably powerful for their population and landmass. Why that is is a matter for study, not suspicion.

       Israel is a nation founded on the illegal occupation of Palestine.  They are fundamentally racist to the point where racism is enshrined in their laws.  They have one of the worst human rights record of any country.  They regularly murder innocents, and are currently enacting a program of genocide against the Palestinians.

       If you support Israel you're a moral incompetent.

       You can but you have to understand that a lot of the WORLD dislikes Israel not just the people on this forum. America supports their military by the billions every year to cause havoc in the middle east for us. No one in the middle east is truly a fan of the state of Israel and their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are afraid of America being this right wing, racist, zealot nationalist - when that is LITERALLY what Israel is. America at least has the mixing of other people and religions, Israel has proved it hates others and that they view themselves as better than all the lessers all around them.

       It's the tunnel vision effect. People are told "this is the enemy and the cause of all the problems" thus they put their blinders on and don't see the full picture.

      <p>
       Some here make very convincing arguments that it is really the Jesuits/vatican. I think the reality is that many different groups play a part. It is a very complex matrix of players and focusing on one group alone will only give you part of the story.

       It's not just possible. It is a certainty. Israel is pretty much an international haven for criminals who just so happen to be Jewish. Said criminals engaging in conspiracies would all view and portray their crime hub favorably. Of course I know that's not what you meant by "conspiratorially inclined" but I think the comment stands. Take a look at Rebel Media if you want pro-Israel propaganda. Some of their coverage is conspiratorial in nature. Most of it is hating on Islam. Pretty much Canadas outwardly zionist version of infowars.
      </p>

       As for "why single out this one country?" Because they are the lowest hanging fruit. "They" single themselves out all the time in so many different contradictory ways that it's hard to keep track. They are the imperial west's subversive little toe hold in the middle east, prepping the stage for further conflict. My major beef with Israel and its supporters is that they always make the claim to the moral high ground. As if it's theirs by default or something, even when they act like total snakes. Truly a nation that has grown artificially fat from trying have its cake and eat too.

       You can be very informed on a deep politics level and also see much nuance in the Israeli-Palestinian situation, yes. That's where I'm at. And "The Jews" are always the big historical scapegoat; it's lazy thinking. They have nowhere near the power of the U.S. That said, Israel /Mossad works together with the U.S. fighting all sorts of dirty wars, and Israel is very technologically advanced. They're certainly part of what you could call the new world order. But Israel itself is a torn country- in some respects, such as marijuana research and gay rights, it's very progressive, but its military is excessive, Palestinians are often treated terribly, and a new overtly racist movement is growing in Israel. All is not black and white.

       Well Israel is pretty much just a terrorist state with a superiority complex. So much more bad than good

       I 100% think that every one should be held accountable for their actions. Like I’m extremely pro-America. Love my country and all. That doesn’t mean that I’m willing to turn a blind eye to wrong doing. It’s like I love ‘em so much that I can’t turn a blind eye to bad because I want them to succeed ya know?
