       Does our own media actually think "Well, if we don't cover it, it's not happening."?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just more proof that our media are more than willing to collude with whoever they have to in order to quash their competition in order to control the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we going to be surprised when they actively take part in implementing even more draconian measures down the road?

       Multiple sources clearly covered the story - whether or not they too had a roundtable discussion about it, I don't know. But you suggested the following:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Does our own media actually think "Well, if we don't cover it, it's not happening."?
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They clearly did nothing to quash the narrative...they just didn't treat it with as much importance as you think they should have.

       Of course they do. But last I checked that was a bad thing.

       Never thought I’d see the day where a user in conspiracy was bemoaning the lack of journalists injecting their own beliefs into a news story. But, again, provided it’s an opinion you support, it’s not a bad thing, right?

       You guys are biased retards. Opinion is quite common in the news, in fact it's an integral part of it. When there is a sudden vacuum in opinion from usually opinionated newspeople that may be indicative of something, and news for this sub. It's also evident that you are feebleminded people that just buy into the russiascare and don't like the source. One of the most important ways to question sources is to use others to compare, and use of RT is definitely an acceptable means of so doing. Quit your mainstream gatekeeping, it has nothing to do on this sub.

       Not in the proper context, of course not. But OP is bemoaning bias in MSM ("They didn't cover the story - it's because they don't want to talk about it!") while simultaneously

       So, basically, you want the MSM to editorialize on a topic you find acceptable, but not editorialize on topics you don't find acceptable. Got it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Face it - you made a claim that was demonstrably false. It happens. But to turn around and suddenly claim you actually want opinion-based reporting (but again,
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       on the topics you find deserving of editorializing) is a new low.

       You said the evil MSM didn't cover it. They clearly did. There's really not much room to wiggle on that fact. You just don't like that they didn't devote round the clock coverage - besides, I thought the whole argument against the MSM was that they spent too much time with round table discussions and entertainment-news. Now, within the context of a story you care about, it's suddenly expected of them?
      </p>
      <p>
       And they must be pretty terrible at censoring and suppressing this story because as of 3:25 PM, those stories I linked to are still active.

       That model worked for them for quite awhile.

       This thing called "reality" is not "real", at lest not in any objective sense...
      </p>
      <p>
       "Reality" is whatever we
       <em>
        (as individuals, or more importantly, en masse)
       </em>
       PERCEIVE it to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Effectively, this translates to
       <strong>
        <em>
         "He who controls perception controls reality"
        </em>
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So then, one could argue that ability to gain monopolistic control of
       <em>
        mass perception
       </em>
       is perhaps the greatest power of all, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       So then, if the above premise is sound, what would be the greatest THREAT to those seeking a monopoly on
       <em>
        "perception"
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would think that it would be any person or group that is able to expose, on a large scale,  the deceptions and misdirections proffered by those that seek to monopolize
       <em>
        "Perception &gt; Reality"
       </em>
       , no?
      </p>

       There is a battle for our minds -- and it seems that our minds are not faring well.

       I watch people like Chris Hedges, Max Keiser and Jesse Ventura on RT because they say things that American media would not let them.  Also Mike Pap, America's Lawyer, is a personal injury lawyer who talks about harmful products and big dollar lawsuits that are going on now.
