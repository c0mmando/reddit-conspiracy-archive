       How so? The business of empires is of concern to their unwilling subjects. The series of non stop fuckieries imposed on the world by the cabal who’ve hijacked the America state apparatus, makes its conduct the affairs of the global community. Pretty sad state of affairs for a country that was founded to be a city on the hill, that all others would look to as an example of righteousness and progress. As a patriot and humanist, You’d do well to add your voice to the chorus condemning the actions of these fuckwits, rather than calling out grammar errors in 2nd language speakers.

       What I've learned by spending time overseas is that non-americans opinions of American politics is completely meaningless because so few of them actually know what's going on. In third world countries, people generally have third world educations and only have access to highly censored, state-run news networks. Expecting them to have fully informed opinions is moronic.

       Insight or incite? Seems he can't decide. The commentary following the headline is inconsistent. Does the op want a discussion of what the Saudis might or might not do with replacement energy or are we supposed to emote and hate them because of a kill order? Shall we talk about their kill orders in Yemen? Oops we're aiding and abetting, and advising in their killing of poor brown people the world over. Seems we can't decide whose we like better, Bibi's kill orders of the Crown prince's kill orders. Why do we take orders from either? It certainly isn't consistent with the sage advice, "Avoid foreign entanglements."

       We should have gotten rid of the banks years ago and we should have never signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia regarding the Petro dollar. Every middle eastern country we have invaded has all been tied to oil and the manipulation between purchasing oil with the dollar. It is not by accident. It is quite evident. We have Israel holding us hostage with the banks and Saudi Arabia holding us hostage with oil. Crazy.

       Im not even mad at bankers until someone brought it up. Yes, current society heavily restricts my evolved human instincts, like territory. I would have blamed something in 1850 with my easy 50$ like and white male special treatment, but I would have known it's not such a long grind to get a decent bank savings or own property, unlike now.

       Armchair  Psychologist People in 2200 on Mars with full oppressive dictatorship will tell stressed and struggling pessimists that they are just blaming others for their failures. We can't stay awake 40 hours to do 30 hour shifts, I'm not blaming shit that isn't easily fixable, if we had a government that didn't tollerate the poor and middle class being pressured financially 5% more every year since 1990 that would fix most problems for the average person. Buying power being reasonable.

       My man... the English setup the Saudis to rule the Arabian peninsula. They’re also the reason why Israel exists today. Without the British meddling in the Middle East, Israel wouldn’t exist today.

      <p>
       The USA just took up the torch and protected Israel after the British got tired of dealing with the Jews in Palestine, since they had started attacking the British, for reducing the amount of Jewish immigrants into Palestine.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In book VIII of The Republic, Plato begins to describe several stages of government that are intolerable, yet unavoidable. Plato predicts a society with an enormous socioeconomic gap, where the poor remain poor and the rich become richer off the blood and sweat of others. In this instance, the people will long for freedom and liberty. They will use it as a battle cry against their oppressors, sparking a revolution.
       </p>
       <p>
        From this revolution, blood will be spilled and many will die. During this time of violent transition, the people will rally behind one man, or a few men, whom they believe to be their savior. The people will lift this champion to great heights and anoint him with sacred responsibilities to bring liberty to the land. When the smoke clears the old regime will be gone and a democracy will be supplanted. And while this is reminiscent of several historical revolutions, including the American revolution, Plato warns that the trouble only intensifies from here.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the course of his writings Plato differentiates between necessary desires and unnecessary desires. Necessary desires are desires we can not over come, such as our desire for shelter and sustenance. Unnecessary desires are desires that we are able to overcome, yet refuse to. These desires include luxuries and lavish possessions. These types of desires are a result of a rapid influx of liberty into the population. Once we have tasted freedom we become drunk off it. Plato predicts that the people will demand freedom at every turn, fighting any form of authority and demanding more liberty. We become obsessed with our freedom and become willing to sacrifice necessary things like social order and structure to attain it.
       </p>
       <p>
        At this point, the newly appointed leaders become very nervous. It was so easy to depose their predecessors, so why not them? These democratic leaders will realize that they are only easily supported when there is a war that the people can rally behind. And so the democratic leaders will unnecessarily become involved in violent affairs, creating wars to distract the people. To ensure their power, the leaders will create laws to bolster their position. The rulers will impose heavy taxes against the commoners to ensure they are unable or unwilling to fight back against this. And any who do oppose the leaders will be labeled as an enemy and persecuted as a spy. It is for this reason that there must always be some enemy combatant that the leader can cast blame upon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Plato continues in his discussion by explaining that the these leaders will eventually become unpopular, an unavoidable result. Those who once supported this ruling class begin to rebel against the would be tyrant. At this point the citizens will try to get rid of whatever man is currently in office, either by exile or impeachment. If this is not possible, the ruler will inevitable strike down any political opposition he may have.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hated by the people, these leaders will request the presence of a body guard. And now he is a tyrant, the leader has no choice if he wishes to rule. Elected by the people, yet now he is protected from them. Plato predicts that this tyrant will appeal to the lowest form of citizen. He will make soldiers of the slaves and the degenerates. The tyrant will pay them to protect him from the ordinary citizens. And now the leader is a tyrant, born from democracy and propped up by the demand for liberty. And in our quest for liberty, we instead created a monster.
       </p>
       <p>
        Plato’s description of a democracy is rather thought provoking. It gives us pause and forces us to examine our own government. Could it be true that our leaders are the bullies and the political tyrants that Plato describes? Does democracy lead to entangling wars for the benefit of the ruling class? And are the people so subjugated by senseless laws and stiff taxes, that they are unable to resist in any meaningful way? Perhaps. History has shown a consistent pattern of subjugation, revolution and subjugation once again.

       Is it just me, or does it seem unlikely that a Saudi national who “fled” to the USA, would walk into a Saudi embassy for documents he could have just have easily obtain in the us? I think he had previously reported on previous examples of Saudi bait-and-switch operations out of embassies. The whole MSM narrative seems... fubar, and the rest of the narratives also seem fixated on the idea that he
       <em>
        didn’t
       </em>
       want to “die”. A lot of effort seems to be going towards proving he is dead, as the result of mounting evidence, fluff journalism (15 man wet team? srsly), etc. That may all be valid, but i doubt he was oblivious to the big picture.

       Not really. He was of the opinion that he was in Turkey, and safe. Anyway, there's some news that Saudi Arabia is going to admit they "accidentally" killed him during interrogation. We'll see then

       They think he was staying in the hotel that was at the top of mandalay (4 seasons I think had like 10 floors towards the top) —&gt; think a hit squad was sent for him but he escaped from the roof in a heli —&gt; buying guns from paddock but he escaped so they had to have a cover which was shooting the people and framing paddock (who was a spook)

       So then why shoot a whole bunch of people? That seems pretty unnecessary in the context of this theory, and would draw a fuckload of attention to an operation that's supposed to be clandestine.

       Not a whole lot of point in massacring a bunch of random civilians because your clandestine spy operation went wrong. The connection between "they were there to kill the prince who was buying weapons, but he escaped" and "so they murdered a bunch of people" makes ZERO sense.

       It makes zero sense because you haven't even got the story right. The prince wasn't buying weapons the hitmen were buying them. The prince escaped and obviously he would have alerted people so shooting the people creates chaos in which the hitmen could easily escape. It's really not hard to put together and follow

       So the clandestine government-sponsored hit squad that already has weapons directly from the US government to the Saudi government was going to buy weapons from a spook as if that’s how the US government needs to sell guns to the Saudi’s. But they were also there to assassinate the prince. And he caught wind of that and escaped and they haven’t caught up with him again. So to avoid catching heat they murdered a bunch of people, escaping in the ensuing chaos. Is that your claim?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t you think that would draw more heat in the long term? And in the short term since every cop within a hundred miles was brought down on them? Wouldn’t a bunch of trained assassins be able to escape without slaughtering dozens of civilians?
      </p>
      <p>
       That still makes zero sense. Slaughtering civilians will draw a lot of heat and state-sponsored revenge.

       I absolutely did, and I’m not ruling out that it was the Saudis or that they wouldn’t kill civilians, but what you are saying makes no sense. It would have the opposite effect. That’s what I’m taking issue with - they wouldn’t have done it because it didn’t make sense and wasn’t going to help with their objective.

       You said that Trump has done nothing yet to achieve oil independence. Just said he might after November.
      </p>
      <p>
       I pointed out he has told people for 2 years that the wall was already being built, and that any day now he was repealing obamacare and overhauling healthcare. Which has not done at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       You used him saying something he might do soon as a fact of something he already did, I pointed out he has claimed he has done things, or are happening "any minute now", that havent happened despite years passing.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump will have done things about energy independence when he has ACTUALLY DONE THEM, not when he says he might. He has proven that things he promised would be done and done very soon do not get done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if he has the best of intentions, after November elections he might not be in position to ram through whatever he wants. He couldn't get other things done with a majority, and its quite possible he won't even have that.

       We don't usually sell quite top grade to anybody.   Sometimes we'll hold back a whole class of weapons, much to a contractor's chagrin, e.g. the F 22 Raptor.   The F 35 is sold in multiple variants and there's even one for just one country, the F 35 I.  I is for Israel.  They're smart with defense dollars.  They think the airframe could be good for more than a generation, but that since computer software/hardware/sensors evolves so quickly they insisted on an easier to upgrade plane and got their way ultimately.   One thing to consider when selling your own top shelp to others, will you end up fighting it?   Will it fall into the wrong hands one way or the other?

       Take the situation with Israel.   If they use this jet enough against Russian air defenses in the region around Syria Russia will know a great deal about the plane's real world capabilities and radar signature, maybe they'll even see about shooting some down accidentally.  If they shoot down F 35s they can sell their air defenses to all kinds of rogue regimes.  If they fail to shoot down it's a big boost to U.S. confidence.   But it's all a tiny test.  In a real engagement you'd probably have a barrage of missiles/artillery other options destroying surface to air sites and then waves of jets pounding targets.

       This whole thing with the Saudi/American journalist, anyone want to fathom a guess as to how many Yemeni have been killed by the U.S. backed Saudi war against the Houthi????   And now we're all incensed and news that a critic has been killed.   Don't get me wrong, horrific if that's how they handled a critic, dismembered him in their consulate in Turkey.   I guess the feigned outrage and shock just seems off given who the Saudis are.

       In a real engagement would involve cruise missiles and shitty Marines that can't aim shipped in , like the last 10 middle East wars. The USA hates sitting back and using our superior long range weapons, and being patient. They always send in a hunk of shit regiment of Marines and a tiny bit of air support.

       Had to downvote you when in your first sentence you claimed that Marines are shitty and can't aim.   Can't aim?  Come on, that's for sure something every U.S. Marine becomes proficient at or they don't make the grade.  Do you actually have much experience as a rifleman?   I only know target and outdoor shooting, but have done it with military and SWAT and nobody trashes the Marines.   U.S. Marines are comparable or better than the spec ops of most countries.

       And as for patience, you're right that we don't quite lay siege much any longer, but as horrible as all of these wars have been since 9/11, in terms of U.S. casualties all of it combines to maybe a few days of the Civil War.  Think about that a little bit and let it sink in when acting like the U.S. just wastes its own people.   There are so many legitimate complaints, but that one's a stretch in my mind.  Close air support is great, but if your Army and Marines are well equipped, have overwhelming superiority, ok intelligence of what's facing them, each guy doesn't need an A-10 buzzing overhead.   Plus we have armor and we have amazing sniper overwatch and drones of various capabilities.   Just because you don't see air support of days gone by doesn't mean there isn't support.

       Down voted as well. Mate the Marines are a fine fighting force. Standards, methods and techniques have been honed over the past 17 years and the Marines are one fighting force Id rather not be on the opposing side of.

       He won’t.   It’s too close to midterms.   SA has already threatened to raise oil prices.   That would increase price of gas, and trump can’t risk the midterms.   Plus it would help Russia since their economy is based on oil sales.

       Well the engine will need lubrication, not sure if it was diesel or petrol engine he converted but some small amount of oil would need to be injected with the hydrogen/oxygen mix probably. But thats an easy fix, does not make it a scam.

       You can make any car 'run on water' but it takes more energy to split water than the energy you get back from burning the hydrogen and oxygen.
      </p>
      <p>
       This entire theory was based on some idea that one guy had a 'special method' which he used a 'special vibration frequency' that made his hydrolosys process take less energy that it produced. Which would break thermodynamic laws. And nobody's ever been able to reproduce it. Probably because it's malarky bullcrap.

       I'm thinking that is the plan. Sell them a bunch of weapons then go blow them all up. We've kicked the shit out of every one so bad we have to arm people before we can have a proper war with them. Defense contractors get to double dip. They did the same thing with ISIS.

       This. Maybe an unpopular opinion here, but I don't think that they are poisoning us with vaccines. I think the elite have better vaccines and cures they keep from us. If you were heartless and craved power, you would do the same. They make us fight over if coal is dirty or clean and scare us from nuclear power.

       Nice retort. At any rate I’m reminding you that billionaires are just like you and I in the eyes of the TPTB. Is there is a panacea for cancer? No. Cancer has many forms and requires many different treatments. It also sometimes cannot be cured and it will kill you.

       There is a cure for cancer being hidden from humanity lol. It’s the fact our society is causing it with our chemicals and lifestyle. The people in charge are aware of it but aren’t giving up their status to help humanity.

       No I didn’t. I agreed with your initial point that there is no grand cover up for a panacea of cancer. There isn’t. It’s a tough one to combat. If there was a grand cure there would be a vaccine for cancer lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a virus completely kills their population to control, who are they then? They only have their positions due to the structure of society. If all of society just dies out, they no longer have control of anything besides the earth and themselves. I dunno if you believe in aliens; not the lizard people stuff or they’re running our world from another dimension, but if we’re really the only things in this universe. They would not let a virus kill us all out, they would be left with themselves and have no one to step on.

       You got a source for any of that or are you just making things up as you go along.

       The curing of smallpox and spanish flu tends to through a wrench into the whole "cancer cure is being hidden by the government theory", but not many people bring it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cancer is an umbrella term for over 200+ diseases so yes there would need to be a lot of reasons for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why cancer specifically? Why has the government hidden the cure for cancer? Why not cardio vascular diseases (which is the biggest killer on the planet).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again you admit there is no one cure for cancer and its tough to combat..............so what exactly is this conspiracy? There doesn't seem to be one.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they want to kill us with diseases, but at the same time they don't want to kill us?

       It's pathetic how Trump voters have zero lines in the sand where they won't accept his behavior. They're all submissive bitches. All Republicans no matter how tough they act are submissive bitches once they meet a political alpha. They fall in line faster and more submissively than real animals do.

       What do you mean sent?  Dude openly criticized the government and went onto their controlled territory in a foreign land.  He thought he was safe, clearly he wasn’t.  With a human rights record like the Saudi’s did he really need that marriage certificate?  None of this is to say it was right, just c’mon use some common sense.

       Because he hasn't invented shit, energy production wise. If the Saudis wanted to save real money they would kill the cheap Chinese solar panel makers. Oh wait they don't have to Trump fucking banned import of cheap china solar panels, so nobody in USA gets into solar without paying 20k for western made panels instead of like 500 dollars for Chinese.

       Well tbh id rather take more expensive panels if they're better made over cheaply made chinese ones shipped over seas. Guess that's just me. Guess you probably have some Chinese yeezy's and everything else since you're so fond of their craftmanship over western made items. Good luck with that,  who knows, you might get lucky and get something made with lead based paint.

       This is not Trump. It's the mere continuation of a historic trend of friendship with SA that US administrations have held for decades now. That said, I would have applauded Trump if he had actually broken that trend. There is no need to associate with such a regime.

       Not just the Saudis, I'm pretty sure the US goverment and well, the people in the elites actively conspire to stop people from getting rid of the oil dependance with other energy sources. That's why oil will still be the king of fuel for quite a while. But I still think it will eventually be replaced.

       How did such a nonsense post get so many up-votes. Of course pushing main stream talking points like a TMoR or Rpolitics brigade. Being an obviously non-organic, vote-botted post, are we propagandizing the presumption of guilt for the Saudis? Is that really such a tough sell that propagandizing it needs done?

       I mean...... they're one of the co-conspirators of 9/11 (the lowest ranking conspirator which is why they're slowly becoming the US and Israel's fall guy if you have been noticing the slow media shift over the last few years) of course they have this much power. You should always consider Saudi Arabia as powerful, in terms of military/political/black ops strength to be up there with US, Israel, and Russia. They have the power to do anything and get away with it. They're literally in charge of the ideology that fuels ISIS, the entire world has known it the whole time and casually talks about it, and doesn't ever hold them accountable. It's a joke. I'm glad people are finally getting up and arms about how evil these fuckers are, but it feels useless considering they've already gotten away with so much. Everone's talking about this journalist nobody is taking about the stories he got killed for: the US backed genocide in Yemen by the Saudis. They blew up a school bus filled with children and nobody gave a fuck. Of course they can lure a dude into their consulate and chop him to pieces and not even hide their identities. They're on that top "Illuminati-esque" level, for lack of a better word

       You can make any car 'run on water' but it takes more energy to split water than the energy you get back from burning the hydrogen and oxygen.
      </p>
      <p>
       This entire theory was based on some idea that one guy had a 'special method' which he used a 'special vibration frequency' that made his hydrolosys process take less energy that it produced. Which would break thermodynamic laws. And nobody's ever been able to reproduce it. Probably because it's malarky bullcrap.
