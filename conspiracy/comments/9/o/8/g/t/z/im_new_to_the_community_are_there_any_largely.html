Gulf of Tonken - Turns out the event the US used to justify entering the Vietnam war never happened <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident">source</a>;</p>

<p>Iran-Contra - CIA sold drugs to support a rebels in Iran because the US government would not fund it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">source</a></p>

<p>MK Ultra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">(Source)</a>, project stargate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project">(source)</a>, project paperclip <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">(source)</a> - all covert government programs the government later admitted to.  </p>

<p>USS Liberty Incident - Israel forces tried to sink a US vessel and blame it on Egypt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident">source</a>   </p>

<p>there&#39;s also the US spraying cities with radioactive material <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_LAC">(Source)</a>, infecting people with syphilis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment">(source)</a> and telling them specifically they did not have it </p>

<p>It should be remembered once conspiracies are admitted it is common for people to say &quot;well of course it was happening&quot; before a conspiracy is admitted though the average person will think you&#39;re a crackpot. Some of these seem like non-conspiracies but for a longtime they were not public knowledge and you would be thought of as crazy for stating the real story.</p>

<p>There&#39;s far more but this is a good start for reading material.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">Project MKUltra</a> laid the groundwork for a number of spinoff projects which continue to this day.</p>

<p>Dupont pushed a disinformation campaign against hemp/cannabis in the 1910s-30s for economic purposes. It continues to this day with other corporate agents at the helm, but the motivation remains the same: keep known, safe, cheap hemp and cannabis products off the market in favor of companies that make more expensive, less effective alternatives.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot">Tulsa Race Riot</a>, 1921, was nearly scrubbed from history books, down played by the establishment for many decades after it happened. The event came to prominence again in the 1990s. Now it doesn&#39;t even register as a &quot;conspiracy,&quot; however, at the time, it was treated as an open secret by the entire white community of Tulsa--until the death of nearly everyone involved. Despite the fact that US army planes were dispatched, several law enforcement agents were shooting unarmed black people from planes and dropping bombs and incendiaries from the sky. An account from the time <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/long-lost-manuscript-contains-searing-eyewitness-account-tulsa-race-massacre-1921-180959251/">was found in 2015</a> written by a prominent local lawyer.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Jeane_Palfrey">The DC Madame</a>: Debra Jean Palfrey. She ran a sex service for the DC elite. She had the dirt on all those pedophile mfs. Shortly after her existence became public knowledge, and it looked a lot like she was heading for a public hearing, she simply couldn&#39;t take the pressure and committed suicide. Yeah, right.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hastings_(journalist">Michael Hastings</a>):  Made a name for himself as a balls-out journalist, willing to risk his life for the real story. He was also suicided after his account of being embedded with the US Army in Afghanistan, alongside Gen. Stanley McChrystal. </p>

<p><a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/michael-hastings-2013-11/">From a 2013, NYT Magazine article</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mark Leibovich, in this summer’s inside-the-­Beltway big read, This Town, describes Hastings’s McChrystal piece as “the most consequential” journalism of 2010 and possibly Obama’s entire first term. But despite going after big game, Hastings tended to be nonchalant about possible repercussions. “Whenever I’d been reporting around groups of dudes whose job it was to kill people,” he said once, “one of them would usually mention that they were going to kill me.” Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zakBULPETo">the crash.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many more. They happen every day. A conspiracy happens any time two businessmen talk behind closed doors.</p>

The attack, carried out on the ground and by air, destroyed more than 35 blocks of the district, at the time the wealthiest black community in the nation. More than 800 people were admitted to hospitals and more than 6,000 black residents were arrested and detained, many for several days. The Oklahoma Bureau of Vital Statistics officially recorded 39 dead, but the American Red Cross estimated 300, a number supported by historians since then.</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#Experiments_involving_other_radioactive_materials">Immediately after World War II, researchers at Vanderbilt University gave 829 pregnant mothers in Tennessee what they were told were &quot;vitamin drinks&quot; that would improve the health of their babies.

<li>&quot;Reproducibility in science is not very sexy. Because our scientific culture generally rewards innovation over cautiousness, replicating a study conducted by others will not get a researcher a publication in a high-end journal, a splashy headline in a newspaper, or a large funding grant from the government. Only an estimated [0.15% of all published results are direct replications of previous studies.](<a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/reproduce-or-bust-bringing-reproducibility-back-">http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/reproduce-or-bust-bringing-reproducibility-back-</a></li>
