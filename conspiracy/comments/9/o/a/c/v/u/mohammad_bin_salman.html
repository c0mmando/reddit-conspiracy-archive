       Ok. That name said. Look him up. Draw your own conclusions. I'll preface this by saying I don't like Trump. That's out of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now back to Bin Salman. Saudis crown prince. A guy that rose to power with the help of Jared Kushner spilling state secrets.

       This bullshit has now turned on us. Saudis have now made a threat to the greatest negotiator. You don't sanction us for the missing journalist. If you do oil goes to $200 a barrel and we make peace with Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's fucked up right? They threatened us with peace.

       This link. Is John Oliver. He talks shit in this link about I believe the 7 presidents and Saudi Arabia. I know people around here don't like him but I promise you. He's didn't talk shit about Trump until the end and he lays out a shit load about Mohammad Bin Salman.

       There's no tds in this post. There only thing I said is I don't like Trump. I didn't ramble on negative Trump things. I said the last 7 presidents sucked them off as well. I did show how Kushner told him our top secret shit and then he purged his rivals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you love cats and shit and that's great. I put in warnings when you'd hear negative things about Trump. You don't find it odd that you get upset about anything negative about Trump? TDS? Derangement seems to come mainly from his supporters to busy slobbering his knob than to see anything wrong with him.

       Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did this happen? Who's to blame?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.

       Supposedly the Las Vegas shooting was an assassination attempt on MBS who was spending time there.  The theory is that Trump tipped him off at the last minute, thereby saving his life.  A couple weeks later, he was named by his father as the future king, and then all of the princes were rounded up and held at the Ritz.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few others died in helicopter crashes, presumably, trying to escape.  Those who were released had to give up a large % of their holdings, and I'm sure had to re affirm their allegiance to the throne.

       Shortly after, they started letting women drive, etc.  Saudi Arabia has lots of $$$ and a lot of the evil money of the world flowed through there, but with this "coup", a lot of those rat lines have dried up, which has real world implications, for instance they were funneling a lot of money to their tech holdings such as Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, etc.  Supposedly these strings being cut is what's causing a lot of today's headlines because the bad players are exposed and/or don't have the same resources.

       I'm not 100% sure if that's what the guy was referring to, but I might be able to dig up more info somewhere if you're interested.

       Funny how TDS is just Bush Derangement Syndrome, repackaged with the Trump brand. Has this jackass actually come up with

       original ideas?

       First sign this article is bullshit and opinion:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Kushner, who had been tasked with bringing about a deal between Israel and Palestine, was particularly engaged by information about the Middle East, according to a former White House official and a former U.S. intelligence professional.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Who is this person they are sourcing?  This isn't exactly career ending, whistle blowing information here.  Why not just tell us who it was?
      </p>
      <p>
       2ndly, the "journalist" I'm sure wrote some articles and I'm sure he was a great guy.  He was also family with some of the top power players in the KSA.   A mere journalist, he is not.  Whatever happened with him, was some real deep heavy shit that probably goes back years.
       <br/>
       Trump doesn't care because he doesn't have to.  The guy was a citizen of the KSA, and therefore, it's their prerogative how to deal with situations.
       <br/>
       It's sad the guy died, but I can't presume to impose a call for justice on a guy who's neither a U.S. citizen, nor was killed on U.S. soil, on a sovereign nation, an individual whom obviously had very deep connections to the whole power structure in that country.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we're supposed to go to war over this guy?  I really don't think so.  I could be wrong.
