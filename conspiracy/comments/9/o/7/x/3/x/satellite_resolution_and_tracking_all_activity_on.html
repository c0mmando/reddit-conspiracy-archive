       Okay, I just learned that they have satellites in space that not only have pixel resolution we could never imagine, but they also can take snapshots of a large band of the electromagnetic spectrum, not just visible light. We're talking infrared, ultraviolet, etc snapshots of the entire planet :O. I'm not sure what the time resolutions are, but if they all take video then that's 24-30 fps. And they have high bit depth, so they can distinguish objects very well in all bands throughout the video. We're talking high resolution, multiple band, gps video of the earth 24/7! Nothing could happen on Earth without it being picked up! And they can also see underground! As much as a mile so far. They're constantly developing better ones too, like seeing under water and stuff :O. With our internet activity, texts, phone calls, monetary transactions, etc already tracked couldn't this become the biggest nightmare of big brother ever imaginable?? Could there be any good for this, or do you think this kind of surveillance of the planet can only lead down the wrong path? After learning so much about how each human is being monitored already, this stuff about satellites couldn't help but make me uncomfortable
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR- The government has satellites that take live, high resolution video of the entire planet through a large band of the electromagnetic spectrum as far as 1 mile under the earth! Paired with the monitoring of all humans internet, phone, etc history, do you think this can be a blessing in disguise or only the worst nightmare of a government surveillance program that could ever be manifested?

       Both. They would be able to detect things happening in other countries that could lead to war or the prevention of such, and they could also monitor anyone or thing they deem "a problem". We are living in a time where anything you do is seen basically no matter what.

       But seeing through the ground to a depth of 1 mile? How about you bring us some sources.

       No it's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, you don't just look at Wikipedia and end your research. You go to the sources cited within Wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the sources cited within Wikipedia state
       <a href="https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-09-26-civilian-spying_x.htm">
        <em>
         "It can help weapons proliferation experts look for ground disturbances that can indicate new underground bunkers."
        </em>
       </a>
       So this source doesn't actually look through the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/15/AR2007081502430_pf.html">
        <em>
         "Other nonvisual capabilities can be provided by aircraft-based sensors, which include ground-penetrating radar and highly sensitive detectors that can sense electromagnetic activity, radioactivity or traces of chemicals, military experts said. Such radar can be used to find objects hidden in buildings or bunkers."
        </em>
       </a>
       And this one uses radar mounted on planes. Not satellites. Also makes no reference to depth capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118714764716998275">
        <em>
         "MASINT uses radar, lasers, infrared, electromagnetic data and other technologies to see through cloud cover, forest canopies and even concrete to create images or gather data."
        </em>
       </a>
       At least this one mentions satellites. But again no reference to depth capabilities, only mentions concrete penetration, no reference to ground? Likely referring to seeing into buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compared to your OP's claims, detecting radioactivity, electromagnetic or chemical traces from underground sources are a bit of a buzzkill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting me all excited for 1 mile deep penetration. Shame on you.

       Great, your only source is a forum which references dead links. Whilst that may be a conspiracy in itself - The suppression of information, it likewise can be an indication there's nothing to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although if it's mean to be a secret from the get go, how did abovetopsecret get their hands on it? If you scroll down you'll find the replies to abovetopsecret are skeptical, noting that the company 'Failure Analysis' doesn't appear to be real (Unless that's another suppression of information?!)

       1.8 gigapixel ARGUS-IS. World's highest resolution video surveillance platform by DARPA.

      <p>
       The Argus system can film a whole city and zoom down to a candy wrapper on the ground and this was 5 years ago. Boeing has patents for solar powered drones  that when paired with Argus could be used in a similar way as what you describe.

       I'm not going to call this one a hoax, but I will label it as a"flight of fancy" that got misreported. 
The key to this is the line in the article that says...
      </p>
      <p>
       Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) gave the ok to Failure Analysis to build the Defense Underground Mapping Satellite Tracking and Ranging (DUMSTR) system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont think that ever happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesnt take too long to see that Failure Analysis is not a company that has ever built satellites, let alone 100 of them at a cost of $100,000,000.00. 
Because Failure Analysis only appears to have 1 employee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Len Losik appears to be Failure Analysis. It appears that its a company name he uses, as a consultant about predicting failure of components, in various industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS HERE is the website of Future Analysis. Quite apart from being a not very professional website, it talks about him and him alone. His credentials, his education, his papers, his conferences, his books, his youtube videos. 
If you check out the address of this place in google maps, its just a one or two room office.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... is this the face of a company building 100 satellites with millions of dollars? I dont think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest in fact that all of this story started with a fanciful bit of writing that Dr. Losik wrote back in 2008, the text of which you can see HERE. 
Written as a postulative piece of "what if" speculation, this is written at exactly the time that satnews said the contract for building these satellites had been awarded to him. 
I suggest instead that a reporter merely wrote that a contract HAD been awarded, when it in fact had not. 
And thats why Dr. Losik is still stuck in that little one room office in the suburbs.

       Ok, so let's talk the physics of this. There is something called the Rayleigh Criterion which specifies the minimum separation between two light sources that may be resolved into distinct objects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, sin(theta)=1.22(Electromagnetic Wavelength of source light)/(Diameter of the Aperture of your telescope/camera).
      </p>
      <p>
       By way of small angle approximation we can essentially rewrite this as (minimum discernible distance between two objects) = 1.22(distance from object)(Electromagnetic Wavelength of source light)/(Diameter of the Aperture of your telescope/camera).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, hypothetically for the sake of shear overkill let's use the Hubble Telescope which has an aperture diameter of 2.4 meters. It's normal orbit is at 569 kilometers, this however is an incredibly low orbit if you want clear imaging of Earth's surface as that means it's orbital velocity is about 7.6 km/s. Coupled with atmospheric interference and the difference in velocity, it would be fairly hard to pull off accurate imaging.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to reduce the difference in velocity that would create a more blurry image, let's put Hubble in a Geosynchronous Orbit with a mean elevation of 35,786 km.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take visible electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths from 390 to 700 nm as the light we want to discern.
      </p>
      <p>
       Converting the diameter of aperture to nano meters and plugging in all our numbers we get minimum discernible distances of 7.09457 meters to 12.73385 meters. Visibility would be further influenced by cloud cover or general atmospheric interference.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ultimately, using satellites to visibly track individual human activity is not only impractical but essentially impossible. Keep in mind in my calculations I used Hubble which is a really beefy telescope the size of a bus, by no means is it your standard satellite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even programs like the U-2 and the SR-71 didn't have the optical capabilities to locate and track an individual and they all operated at significantly lower altitudes. spy sats and planes are more so used to determine more macro scale activity like the construction of Site 110 (the launch pad of the N1), or the R-7 launch pad.
      </p>

       For the sake of monitoring individuals, I would assume traditional bugging methods would be far more effective.

       However, all my numbers should be taken with a grain of salt as I haven't taken Optics in awhile.

       The satellite pictures are so high resolution and great-looking because they are really being taken from airplanes not much higher than regular commercial airliners. There is nothing a satellite can do that can't be done by an airplane, tower, or undersea cables, and immensely cheaper and easier. Satellites are a hoax and a trillions dollar scam.

       Satellites were first ever mentioned in a science fiction story by Arthur C Clark. This fact isnt talked about much because it would expose the blurring of the lines between science and science fiction which is now one in the same thanks to cgi, outright lies and people’s inability to think for themselves.

       No mention of using satellites to see through the ground.
