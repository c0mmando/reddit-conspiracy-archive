    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The world has cooled since DJT has become President</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would you like to back this up with facts?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t actually have to, because it makes a fun thought experiment anyway:  Trump has been president for about two years now.  If what you say is true, and a maintainable, effective amount of defense against climate collapse has been mounted over the last two years this raises some interesting questions:</p>

<p>1) What did Trump do to immediately reverse the course of centuries worth of global damage to the climate?  What has been put in place by the administration to which we can attribute the saving of the world?  One must assume they didn&#39;t take effect on day one, so any cooling between his inauguration and these...  I want to say weather control devices? probably isn&#39;t his work.</p>

<p>2) If Trump is this good for the climate, why doesn&#39;t he take credit for this?  Contrary to doing so, he has repeatedly declared that climate change is not happening, and scientists have called his policies incredibly dangerous to the climate both locally and globally.  Why doesn&#39;t he hit back with these new facts about how great he is?</p>

<p>3) If it&#39;s this easy—Trump has spent a lot of time golfing, and his cabinet and advisors have spent most of their time embroiled in scandal—why haven&#39;t countries with more stable, climate conscious governments also had this measurable effect on reversing climate change?</p>

<p>Or perhaps, and here&#39;s a startling possibility, there is a fluctuation in the Earth&#39;s temperature on a year-to-year basis so looking at the last few years ignores a century of startling temperature rise.  Perhaps, if you want to get apocalyptic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_gun_hypothesis">it wouldn&#39;t take a huge rise in temperature to set off a chain of events which lead to our extinction</a>.</p>

<p>Also, they are mostly relying on man-made climate models, full of assumptions.

    <div class="md"><p>You have no idea how science works, do you? </p>

<p>Scientist don&#39;t just get together and decide how things work. They do it by designing experiments and then publishing there results, which every other scientist in that profession, then try to show that first scientist is wrong. They do this by doing exactly what the first scientist did it. If they all get the same observation, then it is confirmed, until someone else comes along and sees something different.</p>

<p>That is how Noble prizes are won.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like my grandma trying to explain why doctors know best when they were smoking in their offices as scientific reports and medical evidence was piling up on the smoking cancer risks.</p>

<p>The World churns on money and dark politics. Scientists ific method today is pretty much dead. The Scientific method works, but its integrity and success depends on how much independence researchers have in conducting experiments that are not tainted and controlled by industry and money interests. </p>

<p>Look at the collapse of the Peer Review process, those boards are stacked with industry paid researchers who have invested interest to protect Monsanto, Merck or whoever the research may be revealing data on. 
The pharmaceutical industry is perfect example of toxic marriage of Science and profiteers. The scientific process is nullified in vaccines peer review and trials for example. The whole clinical trials process is not science driven, it&#39;s just bullshit! </p>

<p>For example, Peter Doshi had to sue Health Canada just to see the clinical trial data from 10 years ago for vaccines being pushed for children and public health.
 The scientific process is in crisis. Researchers are ruined if they don&#39;t comply with industry now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re explaining how the scientific method works on paper. We all learned it in grade school. But what about how it is applied in reality? how is the Peer Review process working? Is it fair and accessible? Does support researchers who are not aligned with industry?</p>

<p>If the answer is no, Houston, we have a problem with Science!</p>

<p>Case: Seralini et Al 2012, media and industry forced the Jou rnal of Food and chemical toxicology to retract a paper on roundup toxicity.</p>

<p>The Journal of Food and chemical toxicity is probably exhibit A for How Monsanto controls the heart of Scientific review process. Again Journal of Nature, we see the same problem. Researchers being denied publishing if data reflects badly on Monsanto even though Peer review has no evidence to suggest experiments were wrong.

I think people like yourself who make blanket statements like &quot;every scientist in the world&quot; either aren&#39;t aware of or fully understand the state modern academia is in nowadays where every discipline is highly compartmentalized and isolated. The interactions between various fields when conducting research is absurdly small compared to the amount of research being conducted.

    <div class="md"><p>As far as Trump goes, there&#39;s a possibility he just doesn&#39;t believe in it, as well as the possibility that he&#39;s part of a conspiracy along with TPTB to do nothing to address it, however, I think the more likely reason behind it is that he&#39;s representing his base&#39;s beliefs.</p>

<p>If there is a conspiracy, it&#39;s in the way that corporations and evangelical dominionists have used propaganda in order to turn people away from science in service of their own ends.  Trump&#39;s climate change denialism is more a symptom of that than the cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are coming out of a mini ice age and the world is warming naturally. Earth got colder at the height of industrial revolution and they claimed we were going into another ice age and called it the big freeze in the 70s. We are at some of the lowest carbon dioxide ratios in the atmosphere in the history of the world. And carbon dioxide makes up a whopping 0.4% by volume (CO2 is about 400 parts per million (ppm)) of the atmosphere.  From 2000 to 2010, it increased by 10ppm per year. Volcanos put out more than all humanity in one eruption.   </p>

<p>They don&#39;t talk about the only thing that has a direct correlation to temperature of the Earth throughout history - that big glowing thing in the sky we call the Sun.  The solar cycles match up perfectly with past warming periods, like during the Roman Empire, and cooling periods, like the Dark Ages.  Solar activity affects the planet. Shocking, I know. And we just had one of the lowest sunspot activity years in decades, literally going hundreds of days without a single sunspot. Many are predicting a solar minimum approaching and temperatures ARE dropping on average and likely to get worse. Expect some &quot;climate change&quot; 180s talking about cooling effects in the coming years (mid 2020s should see the full impact of solar minimum).  Not ice age or anything, but similar to 1970s.   </p>

<p>Most climate data is flawed and intentionally lies, too. They use monitor stations near runways at airports that are routinely hit with jetwash from planes, are placed on concrete or asphalt, which absorb and release heat and cause higher readings, and don&#39;t adjust for urban heat island effect yet ignore colder spots as outliers.  No climate change model has been accurate even 5 years after publishing, let alone predicting decades in advance. The solar cycle, however, is near perfect sync with temperature.  </p>

<p>Other factors not accounted for include our weakening magnetic field of the Earth, which should be a huge source of concern, the drastic slowing of our oceans currents, the healing of the ozone layer in original &#39;holes&#39; (and knowledge that the ozone has seasons that contract and expand naturally) and the opening of the massive hole over China from their excess pollution.  In regards to coral reefs and other ocean issues, heat has nothing to do with it. The average ocean temperature change in the past 100 years has been 0.1 degree Celsius. Not annually. In 100 years. 0.1 degree. Maybe massive pollution from India and China, who are responsible for roughly 90% of all plastics dumped into the ocean and supertankers that put out more pollution than the entire auto industry and only number a dozen or so while working only 250 days a year might be an issue. Maybe temperature or 1st world CO2 emissions aren&#39;t to blame for these problems.  </p>

<p>Weather has not changed either. There aren&#39;t more hurricanes or floods or wildfires. Damages and destruction are higher because the population of hurricane alley has grown by over 50% and they built up massive infrastructure in an area known for hurricanes. The costs can be higher, but that doesn&#39;t mean the hurricanes are more frequent or stronger or abnormal.  <a href="https://imgur.com/5INeqcW">Wild fires in California are at historic lows</a>. Climate change didn&#39;t cause a forest fire, despite their attempts at blaming it on it. <a href="https://imgur.com/Unq9b8d">US total acres burned</a> in case you might think California was an exception.  </p>

<p>Paris Climate Change pact is a joke, too. <a href="https://imgur.com/CLH7w42">Here&#39;s some math for costs for Australia to meet its goals</a>. Also, what does <a href="https://imgur.com/UHH6fOK">gender equality, indigenous rights, disabled rights, migrants and other nonsense have to do with climate</a>?  </p>

<p>Some historical data for you. <a href="https://imgur.com/9POTx1Y">Annotated temperature through ages</a>. Note that Britain used to grow grapes and had a warm climate - many of the buildings and signs remain showing these old vineyards and grape growing history. They only show you a very, very, very, tiny subset of temperature data that fits their narrative.   </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/yulHrGb">1910 Glaciers receding</a> - strange, no human CO2 should be affecting the climate at this point. Industry was starting up. It&#39;s not until post ww2 that everyone has cars, fridges, stoves, burn coal for heat, massive pollution, etc (where temperatures dropped leading into the &#39;big freeze in the 70s, another thing they don&#39;t tell you - temps are going up now despite our reducing our co2 levels).<br/>
<a href="https://imgur.com/VXK4fFH">Time Magazines for Big Freeze in 70s</a>  </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/7G7ocgH">1922 global warming</a> - weird. still not really major co2 footprint. post-ww1 time, leading to depression. few cars or other amenities for majority of world. many have outhouses, farms, etc.  impossible for us to be responsible at this time for arctic opening up.   </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/vpm0t6X">1907 artic heatwave</a> - strange. I wonder what happened? All those steam locomotives and people wlaking everywhere I guess.   </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/KnOKoOY">1970 vs 2000 time magazine</a> - guess they just made a mistake. Polar bears survived without ice when caps melted previously. They are thriving in the arctic right now, despite the huge hysteria about one polar bear found dead (they claim drowned, but it didn&#39;t) and how global warming was causing them to be wiped out.   </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/1mZ9nVu">1989 we&#39;ll be underwater</a> - seems realistic and settled science. Ocean levels have been rising at a set level for hundred+ years. Predictable and unchanging and unaffected by humans. No one is flooded or underwater. Ocean floor is actually compressing as more weight of water is distributed. Crazy science.<br/>
<a href="https://imgur.com/qbqdi3O">Co2 levels through ages</a> - weird. They are so low, yet the planet is going to be destroyed and all life wiped out. This must have killed the dinosaurs.<br/>
<a href="https://imgur.com/Jmvjxg6">We must sacrifice democracy for climate change</a> - Wow, this is a pretty strange take on solution to climate change. Almost like they want you to give up your rights and freedoms for something they contrived out of thin air and use for doomsday prophecies to pray on emotions.  </p>

<p>The Sun is what affects the planet. We are coming out of a mini Ice Age, so temperatures were rising. CO2 is lowest in Earth history. Climate scientists are always wrong. They get grants and government funding and its a multibillion dollar industry now. Tens of thousands of people will be out of jobs if they backtrack or turn against this. Its used as a political weapon to attack anyone that &quot;denies&quot; it. They rebranded global warming to climate change because they know it will be cooling very soon and so they could package any weather phenomenon as climate change - everything is now climate change, so they are never wrong. Funny how advertising works.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As with other points in time, there has been significant changes in the earth&#39;s previous ocean currents and wind currents.  How these effect the global climate cannot be anticipated based on historical trends.  What we know is the following:  CO2 trends seem to precede temperature trends, and the current CO2 growth is far outside of the norm since the industrial revolution (and yes, temperatures have seemed to mirror this).  Since we can&#39;t historically measure the effects of this type of change, we can only HOPE for a rebound, but we can&#39;t be sure.</p>

<p>Part of the problem has also been that we experienced a mini Ice Age in &quot;recent&quot; history so the data can be skewed if the entire history has not taken into account.</p>

<p>Is this conclusive?  Depends on your mindset, but using a practical version of Pascal&#39;s Wager (or game theory if you would rather have a mathematical basis):  if the world will be find, we then both choices will put us at the same point at the end (no gain or loss).  Therefore it only matters if the world CAN be changed:  in that case we are risking everything to stay the same.  The only logical solution is to adapt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can historically measure them because of core samples, tree rings, written record of famines - some lasting years - harsh winters and so on. Human markers exist, such as the Hunger Stones, that tell us droughts and water levels.  If you look at the Australia data for Paris Accord I posted, it shows the absolutely ridiculous costs imposed to meet those numbers. America would have been spending hundreds of millions to support China and India - the two biggest polluters in the world that use slave labour and have caste systems and communist practices and other human rights violations. Corporations are responsible for over 70% of all CO2 emissions, yet only the average person has to pay carbon taxes on gasoline and only 1st world countries are blamed and forced to pay for it. Industry and jobs move to the 3rd world, who get subsidies from these types of climate accords, pocket the money and use cheap labour to make things that used to enrich the 1st world.  On top of this, the corporations and oligarchs get tax breaks for &#39;green energy&#39; initiatives and government funding to &#39;go green&#39;. We pay for them to go greener. We pay for them to move our jobs and money to the 3rd world. AND we pay for them to get more money in hand outs in those 3rd world countries that don&#39;t have to meet climate accord targets - China is not bound by anything in the Paris Accord and its just an economic dependent getting help.   </p>

<p>There is no wager or game theory - it&#39;s pure corruption. They are not acting in good faith and are manipulating data that is proven wrong every single time. Not one predicitive model has been close or even remotely accurate and they&#39;ve been proven to cheat the data. Even talk of fires, hurricanes, and other weather were admitted in court as not changing because of CO2 emissions or man made climate change.   </p>

<p>There&#39;s making changes, like reducing CFC emissions, cleaning oil spills/better techniques to clean up, filters on stacks, and so on and then tehres spending billions upon billions to send jobs overseas and not policing the true polluters. Fractions of percentages in reduction for this cost while China is producing more than anyone else. America is one of only 1st world countries to meet targets and reduce emissions, yet are being crucified in media to reduce. If they actually cared, <a href="https://imgur.com/MTIT8Ye">theyd do something about China</a>, India and their ilk - not actively steal from us and give to them while pocketing our taxes. There&#39;s nothing to indicate they actually give two fucks about the environment in their political dogma and complete media smear campaign against anyone to question it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You assume you&#39;re comparing apples to apples by taking historical data, and while that&#39;s tempting, the rise of central America would have greatly altered the natural flow of currents on the Earth rendering all previous climate trends as moot.  The only thing that would remain a valid assumption is the ability of the earth to self regulate (assuming that all other measurements remain consistent).</p>

<p>As you states, we are coming out of an ice age.  What you failed to point out is that we should already be in the tropic period and this should not still be warming as much.</p>

<p>So yes, it is a wager.  Do we trust the historical data that may be altering and throw caution to the wind?  Or do we bank on dependable measurements that have remained consistent?  Anyone that argues as you are is simply justifying laziness in spite of humanity&#39;s legacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is the climate is changing, people can see it and it&#39;s being reported on. The problem I see is the claim that co2 is the only problem in climate change. For one, the amount of co2 humans put out is still miniscule compared to what the Earth can unleash and has done in the past. Plants feed on carbon and we are seeing plant life actually increasing! </p>

<p>So many things affect the Earth&#39;s climate; especially the Sun which is changing itself, no way humans are causing that! It has been hotter than this in the past and from my understanding, we are still coming out of an Ice Age. When I was younger I was told the oceans would have risen and flooded thousands of major cities by now, but people are still buying houses at the beach. </p>

<p>I think the real conspiracy is how much humans are having an effect and the focus on carbon as a new way to tax people. It also convinces the individual it&#39;s their fault when most of the pollution is from the Military and Industry round the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have to look at what each stands to lose if the other is right. Scientists, worst case scenario, would lose their jobs (maybe) and need to be retrained to deal with the true way of the world. Politicians would 1. Lose their jobs 2. Have the economy drastically overhauled 3. Have to rethink the entire military industrial complex 4. Decimate the livestock industry. One of these two is greater than the other.
Without evidence to the contrary, I also tend to agree with the group that is an expert in their said field, politicians aren’t exactly up to speed on the comings and goings of every field.
 I’m also concerned that many politicians don’t understand the scientific process of laying down your hypothesis, showing your evidence to prove the hypothesis and then having these findings published for critique from others.  There can be problems with the execution of the scientific process but I have not heard them brought up with regards to climate science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure there is a proper name for this kind of thinking, but I see it as two options: </p>

<p>1) We deny climate change and continue on doing things the same way. If we are correct, great, carry on. If we are incorrect, the world basically ends in 50-100 years. </p>

<p>2) We accept climate change is real and begin to make changes to renewable energy to reduce our carbon output. If we are correct, we stop or slow global warming and we all survive. If we are incorrect, nothing of consequence happens. We live in a world with less smog, pollution, and cleaner air. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Option 2 requires the rest of the world to participate, the options being given to address Climate change in no way address the issue. We have been given an option a carbon tax, or in my state it would be a carbon fee. Yet I fail to see how this address, India and china some of the heaviest producers. It already appears that the USA is already headed towards a more green future. A carbon tax is more of a wealth drain then anything else.</p>

<p>it doesn&#39;t address the issue at hand at all. IT is an attempt to make it look like someone is doing something, while lining their pockets. It will prevent growth and cull the remaining smaller companies that wouldn&#39;t be able to maintain operations if introduced. It will penalize people that have been making an honest effort to reduce emissions. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>What would be a better approach is if we tried to create an electrical grid that was powered by the community, meaning each home acting as an individual node in the system, connecting them to power the Government buildings and what not, taxes could be used to slowly roll out such a grid. I think some smaller cities could take on the task to see how fitting it would work. If the communities became independent in their energy means, we would save money in the long run. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a 3):</p>

<p>We accept climate change is real, acknowledge that renewables, while great, are not good at creating a baseload on the powergrid, which means we will have to use gas plants to supply said baseload and thus will keep a huge part of the CO2 emissions if we go renewables (barring some countries, like iceland, that can actually use geothermal really well). This means that nuclear becomes our only option. And yeah, that&#39;s actually from the IPCC report: their best case scenario is a year-by-year reduction of CO2 emissions with 0,3% when we use nuclear plants. Their best non-nuclear scenario is a 0,2% increase.</p>
