<p>Nope. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Jerusalem">A spaniard owns the rights to that land.</a>. I see far more Fasces and Obelisks in the West than stars of David. Not that David even owns that Star. Babylon and Sumer is calling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not being Christian, i&#39;ve always found this kind of funny.</p>

<p>Jewish people historically run the entertainment industry and Christians have been accusing them of subversion since the beginning.</p>

<p>The funny part is that it is kind of true but it&#39;s more about the marketability than an actual agenda.</p>

<p>Teenagers don&#39;t like being told what to do, how to think, what to look at, what to listen to. Christians tend to dictate all that stuff. Not as much now but in the past, they had total say over media.</p>

<p>Teenagers have a natural rebellious streak and tend to question authority. As a result, they like stuff that could get them in trouble.</p>

<p>The entertainment industry merely supplies them with that content.</p>

<p>The industry not being Christian, they don&#39;t follow the same values and it comes off as corruptible. Read up on McCarthy and the Hollywood Blacklist where the Christian dominant US government went after the industry by accusing them of being Communists and trying to corrupt the moral fiber of American youth. That led to a bunch of people getting fired due to their commie witch hunt.</p>

<p>It kind of seems like after that, there was an increase in media deemed not just non Christian but increasingly anti-Christian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, there&#39;s lots of different Jewish divinities. Orthodox are a lot more rigid than Reformed, etc..</p>

<p>It being a different religion, they have different values and rules so stuff like Satanism and such isn&#39;t really seen as a bad thing to them. That stufff is controversial to Christians though. Controversy is marketable. Any time you hear about a new controversial movie coming out, it&#39;s generally PR hype to sell the movie by making it seem like someone is upset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but I strongly disagree. </p>

<p>Hollywood, music and fashion/infotainment-hipster industry (try to) <em>define</em> trends with their prime studios/products. That&#39;s one of their functions. Obviously it doesn&#39;t always work and something &quot;strange&quot; happens. The short prime of Punk/Grunge has probably been a surprise. </p>

<p>We know that Gangster-Rap was engineered for instance and stupid teenagers bought it hook, line and sinker.</p>

<p>The mass of teenagers/adults have no personal taste and are followers of the mainstream, they &quot;like&quot; what their circle of friends &quot;like&quot; and they &quot;like&quot; what&#39;s pushed as hip. The group of teenagers who don&#39;t conform are by definition a minority, mostly to make them feel special vs. the rest.</p>

<p>Though legally registered in Luxembourg, it operates mainly from Canada[8][9] with headquarters in Montreal and additional offices in Dublin, London, Hamburg, Bucharest, Nicosia, Miami, San Diego and Los Angeles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>canada is run by scottish rite masons (templars): <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/2786680">https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/2786680</a></p>

<p>history background:<br/>
after the crusades ended the crusaders and associated mercenaries and bandits founded switzerland in 1291 and started attacking europeans from their alpine stronghold. they killed 20 million germans in south germany and alsace and they reached luxembourgh. they repopulated those territories with their own seed by raping all the women and maintainng the &#39;right of the first night&#39;.</p>

<p>dublin, ireland is catholic.</p>

<p>miami is run by knights of columbus and knights of malta. jeb bush is one of them.</p>

<p>nicosia, cyprus is also a traditional templar base, its where the russian oligarch (some research says they are teutonic knights) keep their stolen money.  remember, the templars introduced international banking to the west and are still controlling it.</p>

<p>london city (the square mile) is a major templar financial hub.  compare the coat of arms of the city of london with the coat of arms of the rothschilds and you will see they are kinda the same.  the rothschilds are templars, and even the founder of their dinasty, amschel, was already a knight of malta at the time of the founding of the bavarian order of the illumimnati and the fench revolution.</p>
