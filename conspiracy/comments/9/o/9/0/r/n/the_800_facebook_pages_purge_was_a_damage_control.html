        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Facebook is trying to avoid the coverage of the massive amount of user data lost  last month, and that will risk the financial, virtual and personal sphere of the victims.  </p>

<p>They are downplaying both the numbers and the scale of the the attack, which at the worst case scenario had compromised ALL the platform gathered data from over 30 Million users (a number that was given by FB, we don´t know how much they are, it could be 40, 60, or 200M if not much more accounts) which includes all the data generated from the creation of the affected accounts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Private Information (addresses, telephone numbers, private accounts in other sites)</li>
<li>User contact networks, including family, work, peer related</li>
<li>Likes </li>
<li>All messaging content including images and audio</li>
<li>Geolocation data</li>
<li>Tagged photos and messages</li>
<li>Shared content</li>
<li>And more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today it was already confirmed that <strong>at least</strong> half of the named number was completely compromised and is already being offered in the dark markets. </p>

<p>This means that at least over 15M people (as the minimal number) has ALL their data  being openly sold in the dark markets. Which puts them in a very precarious situation and  under a gigantic threat:</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>All their website accounts</strong>, thatre quire secret questions about their private lives for password recovery <strong>are compromised</strong> (this includes email, bank website among others) (e.g. &quot;What was my first job?[&quot;, &quot;whats my mother name?&quot;, etC)</li>
<li>Their <strong>data could be sold</strong> to governments, opponents, enemies, just criminals for use against them. Any shared sensitive information can be now accessed FOREVER by anyone for future use against them. stuff like: Extortion, blackmail, public shaming, criminal activity, etc.  If they ever sent a dickpick or a nude in their FB inbox, they are now at the mercy of <strong>anyone.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>And the problem is that not only the person with the hacked account is  at certain risk, but also their family members with can be contacted or lured with a fake account or call number assuring being the real person, and  telling private info as proof to mislead the victim !</p>

<p>I will repeat that the <strong><em>potential future repercussions of this hack are exponentially dangerous</em></strong> to everyone involved. </p>

<p><strong>Not only  their identity is at risk, their career (be it political, corporate or social) can be harmed by data stolen 10 years ago!</strong>   </p>

<p>And this can go a lot further for people as journalists, activists and dissidents from oppressive regimes. If FB itself didn´t offered info to government for a good chunk of money, now anyone with the accounts can categorize them and find suitable clients that would be VERY interested in knowing private details about their enemies.  From now, to eternity, because that data will be never recovered. EVER. </p>

<p>I SUGGEST EVERYONE TO SHARE THE INFO AND AT LEAST TRY TO MINIMIZE THE RISKS BY TAKING ACTION IN THEIR RELATED ACCOUNTS, ACTIVATING 2FA AND OTHER SECURITY MEASURES. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Facebook will try to minimize the importance of this leak, however their investors and other inner circle people had started selling the stock around the same time the attack happened.  Their future depends on how will this info be delivered to the general public. And not only that, being FB an important asset for the government, they will not let it sink without fight. Thats why they took such an aggressive stance towards activist websites that would had started to spread this like fire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotta think bigger picture.</p>

<p>Even if your data (since deleting) isn’t an issue, as their is none, should it be a case of ‘well it’s your own fault!’.  Or should Facebook have to answer for it and things be put in place to prevent future occurrences like it?  Should Facebook be made an example of, or should we just drop it because the users should have known better.</p>

<p>I’m trying to figure out the benefit to your comment as it just seems naive and details conversation in an almost braggadocios way, while mocking anyone that complains.</p>

<p>You’re essentially defending companies that hold confidential personal data.</p>

<p>Where do we draw the line? If a bank did this, would you cover for the banks, bragging that you don’t have a bank account?  Some of the information shared across Facebook, especially in the business space, is just as sensitive, with card details, important logins, communications and info stored across Facebook business pages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure most of the info in the leak was already sold several times over to... whoever the fuck wanted it.  The leak is irrelevant in my mind... the data on your cell phone is compromised by design.  It is a way to track human activity.  The ban of discussion groups across the &quot;major&quot; platforms is an issue on a whole nother level.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>We now exist in a society where, should things continue at this pace, you will be forbidden from discussing a huge amount of topics - MOSTLY THOSE WHICH CRITICIZE AUTHORITY IN ANY MANNER.  These groups never stopped anything... the anti war group never stopped war, the ones criticizing the police never stopped the brutality... .but at least we could WITNESS reality and discuss it.. if we felt the need.   Some may have gone into la-la land with some theories, or chased evidence that later proved to be B.S. - but the so called mainstream media never even bothered acknowledging the existence of these things....  and if we&#39;re going to be real... the MSM has pushed disinformation and profited off of it which was FAR more damaging than these discussion groups...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facebook was to be the establishment&#39;s mind control system.  To have real news on Facebook defeats it purpose. Facebook was supposed to be a double effort of Intel gathering on ordinary people, and a constant stream of propaganda.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right-leaning sites dislike FB the most. And FB dislikes them too so it was probably a &quot;two-fer&quot; as they say.</p>

<p>I think since FB is structured to leak data by design, it&#39;s perfectly feasible that 3rd parties have long since worked out how to access its systems and Suckerborg has lost control of that. Witness how bad Windows is for getting hacked without anti-virus protection. I doubt FB&#39;s coders and designers have half the experience of the MS people.</p>

<p>Who can be sure if FB knows and is hiding the extent of the flaws (as MS often did) or whether they are clueless or even if they&#39;re helping certain agencies they&#39;re ideologically aligned with? Whichever way. I wouldn&#39;t use it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the above is also an acceptable answer.  From what I can gather a lot of news pages built around stuff like reporting police brutality, war-reporting, and corruption exposing were also shut down.   Facebook&#39;s masters really want everything but the TV nightly news suppressed. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve dubbed it the &quot;Freedom curtain&quot; in honor of the old soviet Iron Curtain of censorship.  Its fast becoming a near all pervasive limiting of information available to the public.  The Freedom Curtain is nearly complete, and its almost hit the ground at this point, ready to black out the truth in favor of propaganda.  </p>
