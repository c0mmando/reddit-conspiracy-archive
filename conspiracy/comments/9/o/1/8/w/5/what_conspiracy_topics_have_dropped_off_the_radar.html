       With Trump, you have a lot of the right-leaning conspiracy theorists hailing him as a savior, and a rising legion of left-leaning conspiracy theorists who finally seem to be getting a whiff of the rot in the state of Denmark (yet in a very focused way, as if Trump and his cronies are the only one with the stench on them.)
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is about what "conspiracy" related topics no longer get as much play since Trump has been elected. Politics and even conspiracy theory circles are becoming increasingly polarized, and with that polarization comes a highlighting of some topics and a back-burnering of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       One that appears somewhat glaring at this point would be monetary policy. Personally, I hear far less discussion of the Fed, central banking, IMF, etc. than I did three years ago. This might be due to the channels of information I subscribe to, but I expect unless you actively follow this type of information, you aren't seeing it either.

       Trump had claimed the 2016 election was going to be rigged HRC when asked if he would accept an election loss. Rigged, but only if he lost.

       This just makes me laugh. It was so clear Trump didn't expect to win when he was making these excuses in the run up to polling day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice he never said how it was rigged or who was doing the rigging. Clearly they didn't do a very good job of it since he managed to win an election rigged against him.

       He did though. Funny thing was he specifically said the left are colluding with Russia and he left called those claims outlandish and impossible and he was ridiculed for saying it and literally overnight the left went from "impossible for Russians to be involved" to "OMG IT WAS THE RUSSIANS" and the whole world noticed except for the American left. I can't trust Trump but I have been a supporter but the idiocy of the left is what gave Trump his popularity worldwide. You might think people forget but we don't, we remember every little lie and every bullshit story that was told during the elections. Both sides were at it but it's the left that have this playground tactic of "I know you are but what am I?" Style arguments and it's always the left that turn what they are being accused of into their own accusation. Also the left absolutely love to take obvious satire and take it seriously in an attempt to discredit Trump supporters. These actions to anyone on the fence are pushing people away from the left because it's transparent as fuck. Maybe if the left spent more time working on policies and less time one smear campaigns you'd have a leftist president right now but they were too busy throwing insults and accusations that they lost the war. I think that's what hurts the left the most, the fact they did this to themselves and it's why they are hysterical now.

       No, he never thought he was going to win. I mean he did specify who the left were colluding with to rig the elections and he always said Russia then the left went from "russian collusion is impossible" to "it's definitely the Russians".

       Oh right, I see what you mean now. So how is "colluding with Russia" the same thing as rigging the elections?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose what I'm asking in a single sentence is: in what sense were these elections rigged according to Trump before the polling day?
      </p>
      <p>
       A vague "colluding with Russia" doesn't mean much. They were colluding with Russia to try to win the election? Maybe with bots commenting online or what have you? Not the same as rigging it. Rigging an election means fixing the outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, since Trump claimed the election was rigged against him, and then went on to win, clearly the election was
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       rigged. Or any attempt to rig it failed to work.

       Well being as the left claim Trump is in power due to colluding with Russia we should ask them how they achieved this.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you say, rigging an election means fixing the outcome which can be achieved a number of ways (see brexit where the public were manipulated by the media into voting out) the largest smear campaign ever launched against any man would probably help with that, the problem was everyone saw the lie and voted accordingly.

       I'm not sure what you mean, political campaigning, no matter how dishonest, is not election rigging.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno how it relates to these vague claims Russia was involved somehow somewhere "they leaked the emails" or whatever. None of that is election fixing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would go as far to say the election wasn't fixed and Trump was getting a pre-emptive "I lost because the powers that be wouldn't let me win and fixed it" because he expected to lose. Trump had no evidence the election was fixed, because it wasn't, he was making shit up. That is why it is so funny going back to my original comment, because then he went and won!

       I'm saying, very simply:

      <p>
       Trump started talking about voter fraud and saying he thinks the election is rigged, in the run up to election day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he actually won the election, meaning it wasn't rigged and everything he'd been saying was clearly not true.

       But what you are saying is grossly oversimplified. "Trump won and this proves it wasn't rigged" is straight up silly and I won't be dragged down by this low energy thinking. If you continue down that path I'll just stop responding because it's typical Reddit fodder crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the left constantly barking russian collusion which is apparently ok, but once trump throws it back it's suddenly ridiculous? That makes no sense. Just because it didn't work doesn't mean there wasn't an attempt but I shouldn't need to say that because that in itself is obvious to anyone who actually matters.

       Well, it certainly proves that the outcome wasn't fixed. Could there have been some electoral fraud, against Trump, and Trump won anyway because that electoral fraud wasn't enough to tip it in HRCs favour? Yeah, I'd concede that point as something that is at least possible. Shame I had to make the point for you though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of fixed elections and Russia, Russia actually do have fixed elections. The latest presedential election in Russia went like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Main real opponent: Alexei Navalny, convicted of a crime and not allowed to run.
Other opponents: Selected by the Kremlin to give the appearance of opposition, fakes.
Russian media: Under the control of the Kremlin, they fabricate the narrative that a democratic election is taking place.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's funny too, because Putin is really popular in Russia and would win the election anyway!

       Actually there is quite a bit of evidence that the election was fixed in Hillary's favor, but she still managed to lose because she was that un-electable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some 8 million votes harvested from the voting registry using online 3rd party records and other government identification data were cast in Hillary's favor. Look into "Catalist" and "deadwood" accounts. They had the will and the means to do it.

       He had no idea the TPTB would chose him? I think HRC was never the choice of the Hidden handlers. Trump  was their man. This was the conspiracy we forgot about.

       Talking out of both sides of your mouth doesn't discount what has been previously said.  Trump talked 'rigged election' during rallies and only said he would accept it during a national debate.  He's been preaching to a choir of people who will deny reality for 'the truth.'

       Which is funny because it seems even more blatant under Trump and the hysterical reaction toward Trump. However, I'd say calling it theater does a bit of disservice to the theater. It's much more a soap opera: poor writing, melodramatic acting, completely implausible events that we're just supposed to accept, and weekly narratives that barely seem to tie into each other.

       Nah, he’s just a convenient conspiracy theorist. He makes them up (birtherism) when they suit him, but he has no real interest in finding out the truth. He doesn’t believe in truth and is the king of mis/disinformation.

       Your post could have just asked the question: What conspiracies have fallen off the radar after the 2016 election.

       Polarization stuff has always been going on. I don't mean to bash OP, but this post has no meat on it at all, other than a veiled attack at the president using language they'll just refute as otherwise, while throwing the readers a bone: what conspiracies get more attention now?? I'll grab my coat since it's a mod were talking about.

       This. Not saying Clinton is an angel, but just like Kavanaugh, if you can’t produce evidence or sufficient eye witness testimony that someone was sexually assaulted, it’s hard to jump to that conclusion.

       Obama didn't really appear more anti-Christ than any other president. Probably closer to Christ on the spectrum because of the whole trying to heal the sick thing than the current guy.

       For sure, and across the board really. We saw this to a certain extent after Obama was elected. Those who were against the Bush Wars just let the issue of militarism and foreign intervention drop from their consciousness for the most part. Similarly, many who were against the Obama administration's drone strikes and involvement in Libya and Syria don't seem to care what Trump does because he's Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most hypocritical seem to be the congressional Democrats, who talk at length about Trump being unfit to serve, yet happily vote to expand the DoD budget by the billions for him.

       Qanon really unsettles me, I'm not sure weather to believe or not but it's still impacting how people will vote in the years to come. It needs to be debunked hard rather than just discredited and ignored.

       I followed Q for a while and I'll preface this by saying I'm no expert but it looks to me as if Q really does know his shit, as in he is someone close to Trump. This to the GA community was evidence of what Q was saying is right, to me the opposite was true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Q is Trump or at least someone with direct access to Trump and what is dangerous about this is Q and Trump are the polar opposite of this sub and any conspiracy theorist for that matter and if you don't know why that is then welcome because you are new here. It can't be debunked because Q is legit, as in Q is someone close to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone close to Trump. If you have any sense whatsoever alarm bells are ringing right now, what could the American government (whose reputation is nothing but nepotism and greed) stand to gain from "leaking" classified information to the public? Can you find any reason other then manipulation because if you can you are way less cynical then I am and I commend you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am absolutely certain Q is 100% real and that terrifies me. Looks like they learned fast, faster then we give them credit for.

       We have the tools to change the world
      </p>
      <p>
       When electric motors came along and allowed factories to be built with infinite axis, as opposed to a single main axis (water wheel, prime mover), it took industrial engineers about 60 years to start building factories with infinite axis design
      </p>
      <p>
       When Europeans first came to New World, they used wood as primary fuel source, butchering forests
      </p>
      <p>
       When coal became available, it still took about 60 years for Americans to abandon wood fuel for coal fuel
      </p>
      <p>
       When Natural Gas became available, it took about 60 years for Americans to abandon coal for Natural Gas
      </p>
      <p>
       Your cook stove and forced air furnace are probably natural gas
      </p>
      <p>
       So you prolly notice the pattern of it taking 60 years after an idea is available, until people start to adopt it en mass
      </p>
      <p>
       The mobile phone might be an example of this too. When did cordless phones come out?
      </p>
      <p>
       So now we have had the internet since about 1993 ???
      </p>
      <p>
       So, 25 years of internet, not even half way until we realize it's full potential en mass
      </p>
      <p>
       But what happens when we finally realize it's potential?

       Well peace with North Korea is a big one that tends to get ignored. Also the fact that ISIS is pretty much defeated. Trump has definitely been luckier than obama with those two issues. It looks like Syria will remain intact and not have to go through the turbulence experienced in Iraq after America decided to liberate it, which means US troops and US money won’t continue to get sucked into void. On top of that trump has managed to renegotiate some fairly lopsided trade deals that were awful for America, and he’s standing firm against China and their IP theft. 
So if you look closely heaps of things are changing

       T R U E. It's hard to keep perspective, most of our memories aren't that great, but it seems this shook folk up and reminded folk of the untruth that "anyone can get elected" in a 'democratic' country like America. Meantime those who don't like Trump's non-political background are busy getting triggered over the latest Twitter message he sent out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a great president (wait don't tune me out yet). He's distracting everyone from the real issues with his zesty speeches and intrigues.

       I don't think Black Sites (which is what Guantanamo serves as distraction for and the much more prevalent human rights abuse) nor the Patriot Act have been discussed much since Bush presidency.

       That the US government was plotting to keep Obama in power. Jade Helm and secret detention camps in Walmarts are bad... Despite the fact that it's come to light that there ARE detention camps being crafted out of abandoned walmarts, children are being kidnapped and placed in them and many of them are "disappearing" and/or being trafficked/raped. And many people who are LEGAL residents and US CITIZENS are being netted in this growing government law enforcement entity ... WITH the federal government's blessing.

       .... It's called kidnapping. Just because the government does it doesn't make it ok. If you're going to argue that they were separated as a result of detention, then they should have been returned once that detention ended.

       Until we have on the spot DNA tests, children will need to be separated from the accompanying adult while the border police work out which kids are being trafficked. 
The separations happen when people are caught attempting to cross illegally rather than presenting themselves at a checkpoint, from what I remember. If a person takes 4 kids across the border illegally there is no record whatsoever of these kids being in America and they can disappear at the drop of hat and no one will come looking. Separating the kids sounds awful, but sadly I suspect a huge number are trafficking victims and every precaution should be taken.

        You need me to cite the fact that children are being taken from their parents, that abandoned Walmarts are being turned into immigration detention centers due to the need for more cells and that many children have gone "dark" (unaccounted for, missing, dead, abused)?

       Somehow I doubt you have any interest in explaining how you would handle this situation were it your actual responsibilty.

       You have "mostly" unaccompanied children being sent to the border (per your source), which of course you helpfully glossed over to try and make a political point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those that are accompanied have an extremely good chance of being part of human trafficking. Those
       <em>
        illegal
       </em>
       immigrants that are separated and somehow "disappear" into this country. It's either because they are being trafficked (which if you believe the people in the border patrol aren't trying to stop then your world view is too twisted to correct), or those that most desire to have the children their custody (the family).

       I'm not sure dog whistle is the right term here. I usually think of dog whistling in terms of a politician uses a euphemism or round about way of talking to a certain audience about something they actually believe in. A standard example is a politician appealing to white voters by talking about welfare, being a dog whistle for blacks.

       With Trump, it seems more like conspiracy theorists (among other groups) along with rhetoric he doesn't even believe, or at least doesn't have strong convictions about.

       When you say "He did though." do you mean he expected to win?  I respectfully disagree.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Chris Wallace: I spoke to President-elect Trump in an interview I did with him in December, a month later, and he said that going into election night, and after his people had read the exit polls, they thought he was going to lose, too. He thought he was going to lose. That was just the accepted wisdom.
