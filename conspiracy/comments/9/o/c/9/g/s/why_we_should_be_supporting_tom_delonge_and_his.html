       I worry about responses like this. Why so angry?
Why so dismissive?
We are meant to be able to discuss things amicably?
This is public forum, if more rational discussion of facts happened here it would serve as a much more powerful force than it currently is.

       But these will never be brought to light through the likes of a controlled mouthpiece such as Tom Delonge in this case, the whole thing is basically asking money to bankroll the half-assed disclosure

       Okay I understand that this is a conscious effort to control the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no one else of any relevance is even attempting this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely you understand the legitimacy of Jacques Vallee, he and someone like Wilcox or Icke are a world apart in terms of legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that he fucks with what Delonge is saying and even lends his name to a book is enough for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to realise that the infrastructure of how the general public receives information aka News, media, magazines, films ect isn’t going anywhere. 
I assume it’s every ufologists dream for trump to walk out the White House one hand around a Nordic and the other around a Reptilian and he just winks at the camera and says “aliens are real folks”
      </p>
      <p>
       That would be so detrimental to the human race. There’s be uproar.
Probably the downfall of humanity.
It has to be controlled in some way shape or form and I believe Delonge has done the research to earn that title.

       And its not just Delonge doing it. So many people out there claim to have secret knowledge and are always just about to release it or tell us or have the facts etc.
      </p>

       If people actually cared about disclosure we would have mountains of evidence instead of half exposed blurbs and allusions

       Name one other person who has a credible. Rand I. He eyes of the public, Bob Bigelow has moren money but I’d argue Tom is more we’ll known.

      <p>
       Robbie Williams is relatively famous of here in the UK but again Tom’s name spreads wider than Robbies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your talking about Cosmic Disclosure and all that bullshit then you need to start over. No one of any relevance gives those guys any credence. Linda Moulton Howe, Richard Dolan fuck any one who is anybody in UFOlogy fucks with Delonge. It’s fact.

       I think Tompkins has some truth to what he was saying, prove to me Maria Orsic existed. She is part of his story and I hit a dead end every time at her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Herman Oberth certainly existed.
The Thule Society certainly existed.
Hell I can even find solid evidence of a group called the Vril Group, but Maria Orsic is my Moby Dick.

      </p>

       But seriously why withhold information that you believe is so important to humanity?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an old trope too. Everyone who claims to have hidden knowledge and withholds it turns out to have nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to admit this has happened time and time again, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I really really want this to be true but Im skeptical. I think Tom means well and believes what he says but until I see more Ill remain wary of being spoon fed teeny tiny bits of info that arent large enough to frame the whole thing.

       Okay let’s say hypothetically the universe is bulging with life. Planets with other humans, planets with Greys, planets with small bacterial life, planets with being squid like beams of light that fly through Space. All of these beings can telepathic communicate, some of them have been acting as gods to this planet and some are unrecognisable to the human eye as something with life in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe it’s the best course of action to let everyone know this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of the people you have encountered in your life, do most of them seem capable of handling this information.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how long do you think we as a civilisation have been aware of this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Earliest I’d say is the 1880’s and I’d say it wasn’t till the 50’s that we 100% knew and even then all we understood is that we had no understanding and of what we had discovered or how to fight it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d say it’s taken 50 years or so to develop some idea of how to have this knowledge in the open without it causing mass hysteria.

       Aaaaaand you lost me with that jump.

      <p>
       How do you know everything is telepathic? Did that arise organically does every path lead to telepathy? How do you know this?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the reason no one presents information is because there is almost none and the info that is available is 2nd or 3rd hand from less than reliable people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the point about disclosure but that is awfully convenient, wouldnt you say?
      </p>
      <p>
       People like Delonge (Again whom I like and want to believe) should know that people need to see this. Why do they get to decide who gets to know?
      </p>

       Again that just seems like a cop out to me.

       We are wired to see a specific band of the electromagnetic spectrum and we have all these phenomena’s that we don’t quite understand like ball lighting and the hessdalen effect. 
Have you seen episode 8 of Twin Peaks series 3? 
That’s the best Disclosure out there right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Tom 100% knows what people want to see, the questions is do they need to see that.

       Why do you think that? Have you ever had a sober telepathic event with these creatures? Again how awfully convenient that any evidence is telepathic and only able to be proved to the person experiencing it. And nothing of value is ever handed over during these events, no inside knowledge, nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your link just shows we can encode and decode the alphabet by reading the brain.
      </p>

       I dont doubt telepathy does exist, I just doubt whether aliens are using it to communicate with us. What do you think would happen if you were a telepath and tried to talk to an ant? Or a fish? It probably wouldnt work because your system of communication(Especially the one you linked to) is for your brain because your brain is the one making and decoding the message.

       I mean I’d be pretty depressed if I time travelled 100 years into the future and we still hadn’t gone past low earth orbit and we hadn’t worked out at least how to talk with each other telepathically be it with he help of technology or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway I understand that all I have done is done a lot of reading. But have a look at some things we can 100% prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       Operation BlueBird
      </p>
      <p>
       “CIA documents suggest that they investigated "chemical, biological, and radiological" methods of mind control as part of MKUltra.[36] They spent an estimated $10 million or more, roughly $87.5 million adjusted for inflation.[37]”
      </p>
      <p>
       At the invitation of Stanford psychology graduate student Vik Lovell, an acquaintance of Richard Alpert and Allen Ginsberg, Ken Kesey volunteered to take part in what turned out to be a CIA-financed study under the aegis of MKULTRA,[43] at the Menlo Park Veterans' Hospital[44][45] where he worked as a night aide.[46] The project studied the effects of psychoactive drugs, particularly LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, cocaine, aMT, and DMT on people.[47]
      </p>
      <p>
       The implication of the American government understanding what DMT and using it to see if they can break down a persons brain to the point where they are disobedient to their own free will is wild. 
Absolutely fucking wild.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the CIA’s evaluation of Robert Monroe’s Hemi-Sync system?
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider Shamans using DMT to explore the spiritual world losses by angels and demons?
      </p>
      <p>
       What are demons?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did we go from having folklore about demons to having a modern day UFO obsession?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve never felt like I’ve been communicated with or anything like that but jut the fact that a man like Alesiter Crowley existed and wrote the amount of material he did on such topics and the way he has been taken by new age creatives in popular culture is staggering imo.

       Ive done DMT I have a pretty good idea of how it makes you feel
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea what is going but I have a personal feeling that what you experience on a strong DMT trip has more to do with the internal universe than it does with the external.

       Im just saying that alot of these peoples livelihoods depend on non disclosure as they strive for disclosure.

       I will agree that this topic has some awfully convenient things happen within it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Richard Doty, Paul Benewitz, Men in Black ect it’s a lot of smoke and mirrors I guess because I’ve been with Delonges story from day one I at least know is original intentions were pure as he was just one of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has happened post 2011 I cannot be so sure although something that keeps me going is the fact that it was confirmed in the wiki leaks emails that Tom had a series commissioned with Vice.
Like imagine the credibility that would have given all of this.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It came out in the wiki leaks emails that Tom was in contact with William Neil McCasland. Both of those facts are fairly staggering.

       Everyone in fucking Hollywood has handlers. It’s basic confirmation that the industry is an unstable place to be.

       All Tom has said in the Podesta email is that the aim of Sekret Machines is to change the youths cynical views about government and I’d say this sub is a great example of where change needs to happen.

       Couple of things
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        I’m not a investor of shill for TSSA, just a dude that was into punk rock and was paying attention.
       </li>
       <li>
        My main point here is that Tom is sincere and not purposefully scamming people.
       </li>
       <li>
        I could be wrong.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Circa 1999 I was young and getting into punk rock. Offspring, Sum 41, Green Day ect
      </p>
      <p>
       Blink and Green Day were always my shit, bought the Cd’s, learnt the songs on guitar ect
      </p>
      <p>
       After a while and about 50 tracks at the end of Blinks love CD of them talking shit I started to get an idea of the personalities in some of my favourite bands.
      </p>
      <p>
       In blink you’ve got:
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark Hoppus : Down to earth silly guy, bit of a mommas boy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Travis Barker: Quiet dude, animal behind a drum
kit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tom Delonge: Crude as fuck, believes in aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone knew Tom Delonge was into aliens, probably because of the song he wrote called Aliens Exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tom states in
       <a href="https://youtu.be/heUCtu_fq18">
        numerous interviews
       </a>
       ranging from last year all the way back to about 2000 that the first thing he did when Blink got big and he got his first paycheque he bought a PC to look at alien shit. He also details pre having the internet in your hand always having a book in his hand. Travelling from gig to gig there was a lot of down time on tour and he spent this time reading UFO books.
      </p>
      <p>
       2001 on the “Take off your pants and Jacket tour”
Delonge decides right I’ve read a few books, I’m aware of the key players in the UFOlogy field and I’ve got the money to facilitate let’s take this up a notch.
He hits up Steven Greer who hadn’t started offering retreats out in the desert to contact aliens and was actually doing some great work with the Disclosure Project.
      </p>
      <p>
       He hits Greer and Carol Rosin (Wherner Von Braun’s, the gentleman who one decade was a
       <a href="http://leonardotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/von-Braun.jpg">
        nazi
       </a>
       , next decade chilling with
       <a href="https://youtu.be/eXIDFx74aSY">
        Mickey Mouse
       </a>
       telling the American public how we will be landing on the moon soon, apprentice at Fairchild Industries) up and brings them out on stage and gets to know them.
Greer gives him a load of unedited footage from the Disclosure project in a move I’ve heard Greer describe as a attempt to bring the Disclosure Project to Hollywood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tom sits on the footage and starts to get paranoid his phones are being tapped so he goes quiet on the UFO front. He does take the time to go into the desert and try some of Greer’s CE-5 protocols to
       <a href="https://youtu.be/mDedHaeDynU">
        some effect
       </a>
       apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we hit 2003-2005 we enter what a Blink 182 fan would call their “Emo” phase. Obviously this stands for emotional and I’d argue with good reason yes the group got angstier. The traveled to the Middle East to play for the troops and brought back some new philosophies on life. Tom especially. Check 19:50 of this
       <a href="https://youtu.be/z2JKHMhvUew">
        link
       </a>
       for a bit of background on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Band keep touring Tom keeps getting more and more pissed of with the machine that Blink has turned into which causes him to loose his classic attitude the masses have come to love and know. He also slipped a disc in his back and has started taking pain killers.
      </p>
      <p>
       2005, Tom leaves blink says it was a mass media corporate machine. He goes quiet for 6 months or so then starts doing interviews claiming god wrote his new album and it is going to be a new era for music.
At the time I was 12 and thought he was on crack.
Now I can understand that he was referring to the ever more prevalent idea that the universe is god and therefore being part of the universe could constitute an album being written my god and the new era of music he was referring to were streaming services.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you know anything about the music business you will know the bubble done popped in 2006ish. The 80’s and 90’s has seen too many record labels giving bands millions of dollars and struggling to make returns, this is why you see so many artists from the early 2000’s re-recording their material (Reel Big Fish, Bowling for Soup to name a couple) it’s because they don’t own them and are now realising they have been fucked out of loads of money and are now trying to re-cooperate the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tom also seemed to be getting into sci-fi movies at this point especially Stanley Kubrick. This interview is
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Bno3Z2KRLJY">
        relevant
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know Blink 182 were one the first bands to have a deal with a clothing company?
      </p>
      <p>
       Billabong, Hurley and Quicksilver saw opportunities to capitalise on the new wave of punk that was happening In the early 2000’s. 
Blink initially signed deals with them which seems commonplace now but it was new back then. Eventually, in a move that starts the beginning of a trend, Tom wants to move from being a client to being a CEO. He sets up a few different companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loserkids
Macbeth
Atticus
      </p>
      <p>
       All 3 of them are skate-wear apparel brands. By 2005 Tom was talking about an experience where a fan could go online communicate with their favourite artists, receive free music early, buy merchandise and discuss with other fans (social media???? Streaming services this was half a decade before Spotify)
He called it Modlife.
It amalgamated his previous companies into one experience. This is model and software Delonge uses today.
I believe Nine Inch Nails still use the Modlife framework for their websites and I’ve heard Tom say Kanye used it at one point so people are paying attention even if you haven’t heard of it. (Trent Reznor is one of the most respected people in the game and their drummer Ilan now drums for Tom if any one was doubting that claim)
Tom keeps building this framework up until 2010 when he rejoins Blink 182 and tries to convert Blink to this framework he has designed. Long story short Blink play together from 2009-2015 with Tom obviously anxious and drunk at the prospect of starting the machine back up. He has gained an awareness of his past persona and the expectation of that return by millions of people although understands that mindless swearing is overall bad for the masses. They release two projects during this time. The album Neighbourhoods is pretty obviously recorded at separate locations and you can tell who wrote what with a little bit of Blink knowledge.
The EP Dogs Eating Dogs has an interesting release, it was live to pre-order though a Modlife based website also tied with a new fan club called “The Rabbit Hole”. 
Then all of that is taken down. It gets a standard iTunes release.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rabbit hole from California is literally Mark saying I won’t follow you Tom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark always summarised the sunny day, girlfriend troubles, silly side of Blink with songs like Online Songs, The Party Song, Don’t Leave Me ect
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe Mark is scared to move out of this bracket for fear of rejection from the fan base and therefore loosing the thing that makes him happy in life. I have alway believe that whilst attracting typical “pop-punk” All Time Low A Day to Remember kind of fans Blink also pulled a wider audience. I think this can be traced to Toms influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Some classic Tom songs: Anthem Pt2, Reckless Abandon, Not Now
      </p>
      <p>
       They deal with similar themes to marks songs but speak in a more philosophical sense about the wider implications of the actions spoken about in Marks songs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have come to the conclusion that Tom around 2004 realised the implications of playing to millions of
People and preaching the word of shit piss fuck, fuck a dog, when you fucked grandpa ect. He realised he was soiling the minds of the youth the resulting emotional reaction caused Blinks first break up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m gonna back this up by citing some lyrics from Toms recent solo album single New World
      </p>
      <p>
       “It violates and blinds the eye, but I’ve found a New World”

       Another year passes.
      </p>
      <p>
       February 2015 
Tom leaves/gets kicked out of blink.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blinks statement: “Tom’s disingenuous, he makes us feel uncomfortable in the studio”
      </p>
      <p>
       Tom’s statement: “I’ve been trying to take Blink independent for the past 5 years with a lot of resistance and think we should branch out into other mediums of art”
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where we start to see him taking his years of UFO research public but it wasn’t the first time. 
Back in 2011 Tom went on Coast to Coast FM with George Knapp. He spoke about the process I have just described, being on tour, lots of down time and reading books.
We get to see an idea of what books he has been reading and this is important because these are the names we see Tom working with today.
He talks about Peter Levenda, Joesph P Farrell, Skunkworks, Bob Lazar, Jeremy Corbell, Harold Putoff, Jacque Vallee.
If your in the UFO or conspiracy game then you know these are legit people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your not in the UFO game then look at the names above, find out what their most acclaimed work is, find out how the community responds to them, find out what people outside of the UFO world think of these people. These are legit people.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn’t some Corey Goode David Wilcox’s bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post Blink, which could have been used as a vessel for this project that would have reach to a much larger audience and must be a massive bummer for Tom, all of the names above have worked with Tom or at least met him. 
Discredit Tom and you are discrediting some of the best names in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have any of you actually read Sekret Machines: Gods? If your gonna try and tell me you have read that book and fully comprehended the scope of what it’s talking about, who wrote it, who wrote the foreword and how that affects the human race in a massive way then go ahead because that’s what we should all be talking about.

       Couple of things
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        I’m not a investor of shill for TSSA, just a dude that was into punk rock and was paying attention.
       </li>
       <li>
        My main point here is that Tom is sincere and not purposefully scamming people.
       </li>
       <li>
        I could be wrong.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Circa 1999 I was young and getting into punk rock. Offspring, Sum 41, Green Day ect
      </p>
      <p>
       Blink and Green Day were always my shit, bought the Cd’s, learnt the songs on guitar ect
      </p>
      <p>
       After a while and about 50 tracks at the end of Blinks love CD of them talking shit I started to get an idea of the personalities in some of my favourite bands.
      </p>
      <p>
       In blink you’ve got:
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark Hoppus : Down to earth silly guy, bit of a mommas boy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Travis Barker: Quiet dude, animal behind a drum
kit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tom Delonge: Crude as fuck, believes in aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone knew Tom Delonge was into aliens, probably because of the song he wrote called Aliens Exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tom states in
       <a href="https://youtu.be/heUCtu_fq18">
        numerous interviews
       </a>
       ranging from last year all the way back to about 2000 that the first thing he did when Blink got big and he got his first paycheque he bought a PC to look at alien shit. He also details pre having the internet in your hand always having a book in his hand. Travelling from gig to gig there was a lot of down time on tour and he spent this time reading UFO books.
      </p>
      <p>
       2001 on the “Take off your pants and Jacket tour”
Delonge decides right I’ve read a few books, I’m aware of the key players in the UFOlogy field and I’ve got the money to facilitate let’s take this up a notch.
He hits up Steven Greer who hadn’t started offering retreats out in the desert to contact aliens and was actually doing some great work with the Disclosure Project.
      </p>
      <p>
       He hits Greer and Carol Rosin (Wherner Von Braun’s, the gentleman who one decade was a
       <a href="http://leonardotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/von-Braun.jpg">
        nazi
       </a>
       , next decade chilling with
       <a href="https://youtu.be/eXIDFx74aSY">
        Mickey Mouse
       </a>
       telling the American public how we will be landing on the moon soon, apprentice at Fairchild Industries) up and brings them out on stage and gets to know them.
Greer gives him a load of unedited footage from the Disclosure project in a move I’ve heard Greer describe as a attempt to bring the Disclosure Project to Hollywood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tom sits on the footage and starts to get paranoid his phones are being tapped so he goes quiet on the UFO front. He does take the time to go into the desert and try some of Greer’s CE-5 protocols to
       <a href="https://youtu.be/mDedHaeDynU">
        some effect
       </a>
       apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we hit 2003-2005 we enter what a Blink 182 fan would call their “Emo” phase. Obviously this stands for emotional and I’d argue with good reason yes the group got angstier. The traveled to the Middle East to play for the troops and brought back some new philosophies on life. Tom especially. Check 19:50 of this
       <a href="https://youtu.be/z2JKHMhvUew">
        link
       </a>
       for a bit of background on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Band keep touring Tom keeps getting more and more pissed of with the machine that Blink has turned into which causes him to loose his classic attitude the masses have come to love and know. He also slipped a disc in his back and has started taking pain killers.
      </p>
      <p>
       2005, Tom leaves blink says it was a mass media corporate machine. He goes quiet for 6 months or so then starts doing interviews claiming god wrote his new album and it is going to be a new era for music.
At the time I was 12 and thought he was on crack.
Now I can understand that he was referring to the ever more prevalent idea that the universe is god and therefore being part of the universe could constitute an album being written my god and the new era of music he was referring to were streaming services.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you know anything about the music business you will know the bubble done popped in 2006ish. The 80’s and 90’s has seen too many record labels giving bands millions of dollars and struggling to make returns, this is why you see so many artists from the early 2000’s re-recording their material (Reel Big Fish, Bowling for Soup to name a couple) it’s because they don’t own them and are now realising they have been fucked out of loads of money and are now trying to re-cooperate the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tom also seemed to be getting into sci-fi movies at this point especially Stanley Kubrick. This interview is
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Bno3Z2KRLJY">
        relevant
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know Blink 182 were one the first bands to have a deal with a clothing company?
      </p>
      <p>
       Billabong, Hurley and Quicksilver saw opportunities to capitalise on the new wave of punk that was happening In the early 2000’s. 
Blink initially signed deals with them which seems commonplace now but it was new back then. Eventually, in a move that starts the beginning of a trend, Tom wants to move from being a client to being a CEO. He sets up a few different companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loserkids
Macbeth
Atticus
      </p>
      <p>
       All 3 of them are skate-wear apparel brands. By 2005 Tom was talking about an experience where a fan could go online communicate with their favourite artists, receive free music early, buy merchandise and discuss with other fans (social media???? Streaming services this was half a decade before Spotify)
He called it Modlife.
It amalgamated his previous companies into one experience. This is model and software Delonge uses today.
I believe Nine Inch Nails still use the Modlife framework for their websites and I’ve heard Tom say Kanye used it at one point so people are paying attention even if you haven’t heard of it. (Trent Reznor is one of the most respected people in the game and their drummer Ilan now drums for Tom if any one was doubting that claim)
Tom keeps building this framework up until 2010 when he rejoins Blink 182 and tries to convert Blink to this framework he has designed. Long story short Blink play together from 2009-2015 with Tom obviously anxious and drunk at the prospect of starting the machine back up. He has gained an awareness of his past persona and the expectation of that return by millions of people although understands that mindless swearing is overall bad for the masses. They release two projects during this time. The album Neighbourhoods is pretty obviously recorded at separate locations and you can tell who wrote what with a little bit of Blink knowledge.
The EP Dogs Eating Dogs has an interesting release, it was live to pre-order though a Modlife based website also tied with a new fan club called “The Rabbit Hole”. 
Then all of that is taken down. It gets a standard iTunes release.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rabbit hole from California is literally Mark saying I won’t follow you Tom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark always summarised the sunny day, girlfriend troubles, silly side of Blink with songs like Online Songs, The Party Song, Don’t Leave Me ect
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe Mark is scared to move out of this bracket for fear of rejection from the fan base and therefore loosing the thing that makes him happy in life. I have alway believe that whilst attracting typical “pop-punk” All Time Low A Day to Remember kind of fans Blink also pulled a wider audience. I think this can be traced to Toms influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Some classic Tom songs: Anthem Pt2, Reckless Abandon, Not Now
      </p>
      <p>
       They deal with similar themes to marks songs but speak in a more philosophical sense about the wider implications of the actions spoken about in Marks songs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have come to the conclusion that Tom around 2004 realised the implications of playing to millions of
People and preaching the word of shit piss fuck, fuck a dog, when you fucked grandpa ect. He realised he was soiling the minds of the youth the resulting emotional reaction caused Blinks first break up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m gonna back this up by citing some lyrics from Toms recent solo album single New World
      </p>
      <p>
       “It violates and blinds the eye, but I’ve found a New World”
      </p>
      <p>
       He is saying that Blinks overall message is not overall constructive to the betterment of the human race and he cannot live with something he created being a negative vibe.
      </p>

       Here's a email to JP from Bill Ivey.  Absolutely nothing illegal here.  This is institutionalized misconduct.

       And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

       I listened to DeLonge on JRE.  I got the impression that he was genuine.  Couldn't shake the feeling he was someone's puppet.

       That email was very interesting, I’d never seen this one before. But it just seems to be talking about how Clinton was gonna combat Trumps mastery of the media perception of himself that Clinton could not compete with hence the president we have now.

      <p>
       Hell even if it came out tomorrow that John Podesta ate babies that still doesn’t throw everything Delonge has ever done under the bus.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off Podesta and Delonge exchanges a few emails and met once for an interview. That is the known scope of their communication. That’s nothing in the grand scheme of things
Secondly if we instantly wrote off anyone that has worked with a paedophile in the past then the UK entertainment industry would be empty. Everyone worked with Jimmy Saville from the Beatles to the Queen.

       You gotta watch what labels your throwing around.

       Link me the video
Fuck it don’t I know which bullshit video you are referring to
The one where someone is shouting “say my name!” And you hear a child screaming.
What the fuck even is that video
Is it 100% him
Could you prove that
If so why has nothing been done
It all just crumbles as soon as you do the slightest bit of research 
People in the public spotlight are uneasy to even say the word peadophile let alone discuss wether or not someone they are working is a murder, rapist and occultist.

       Everyone in fucking Hollywood has handlers. It’s basic confirmation that the industry is an unstable place to be.

       All Tom has said in the Podesta email is that the aim of Sekret Machines is to change the youths cynical views about government and I’d say this sub is a great example of where change needs to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government is not 100% bad and isn’t going anywhere, learn to work within the established parameters instead of just being angry and misdirecting it everywhere.
