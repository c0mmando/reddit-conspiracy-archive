        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have noticed in the last three seasons, television broadcasts of NFL games do not show replays of controversial calls or blatant missed calls from officials, even when the announcers make a note of it. In several instances, I have seen controversial penalties called with no replay at all, leaving the viewer with no idea of why. It&#39;s not until later in the week when the league releases All-22 video that viewers are able to see it was a terrible call.</p>

<p>This may have been going on for a while, but it seems really acute in the last three seasons or so, just after the embarrassment with replacement referees. I believe the NFL has told broadcasters that they are not allowed to show replays of bad calls in an effort to protect the league&#39;s reputation. </p>

<p>Have any other football fans noticed this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That ref was fired, and somebody sued the league after that blatantly rigged playoff. I&#39;m paraphrasing here, but the court ruled in favor of the league, since the NBA claims to be entertainment, not a sports competition. The NBA is held to the same competitive standards as the professional wrestling... but at least people KNOW that&#39;s scripted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think nba/nfl is staged/rigged to a large extent. In the NFL, it&#39;s not so much the bad calls but more so the no-calls. The team they want to win, they let get away with a lot more. Usually it&#39;s more so with holding calls or no-calls on the offensive line since that&#39;s what the viewers notice the least.</p>

<p>The players find out quick which way the referees are calling the game and take advantage of it if they can. In both the NBA/NFL the players, coaches and owners are not allowed to publicly criticize the referees so it&#39;s all swept under the rug like it doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>One referee in the NBA even went to prison for fixing games..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post OP! I&#39;ve noticed that as well. There was one play in particular a couple of MNF&#39;s ago. A punt return that was returned for a TD was called back for holding, and they sped into a commercial break rather than showing the hold- very fishy especially for a &quot;foul&quot; that straight up reversed the outcome of a play. </p>

<p>The thing is, there&#39;s &quot;holding&quot;, or &quot;illegal hands to the face&quot;, or a slight tug or pull for &quot;interference&quot; on every fucking play. The refs can greatly enact control over a game by continuing or impeding a drive.</p>

<p>A couple more I&#39;ve noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They really try to avoid showing the crowds, especially the higher levels of the stands, and especially in smaller markets that may be hurting for attendance. There was a game last year, I want to say the Bucs and another small market team, where they wouldn&#39;t show the standard behind-the-kicker view of field goals due to laughably empty stands.</p></li>
<li><p>The stadium noise sounds fake on broadcasts. Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I find it extremely odd how there&#39;s generic crowd sounds going non-stop even before commercial breaks. There are never any chances, or music, or stadium announcer&#39;s voices getting picked up, just the non-stop &quot;buzz&quot; of being at a game. The score, setting, teams, none of that seems to effect the ever-enthusiastic crowd!</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>By God you&#39;re right. I used to have season tickets to an NFL team. I can confirm that the stadium noise can vary from a load roar to virtually quiet depending on what&#39;s going on on the field,  or more precisely,  what isn&#39;t. They play advertising on the jumbotron screens, field announcers do their thing, and airplanes fly over and emergency vehicles go past with sirens. </p>

<p>Yet, there is absolutely and ONLY a continuous &quot;dull roar&quot; at all times on a TV broadcast. Someone should sample it and see if it&#39;s a repeated loop for every game. </p>

<p>That would be interesting! How could one go about that? Record a broadcast&#39;s audio, use a vocal removal tool and then check for loops? Is there something like a dif checker for audio clips?</p>

<p>The thing is, the argument could be made the sounds are faked for ease of production. Either to avoid picking up chants/words broadcasters don&#39;t want, or to make the audio engineering of it cheaper/easier to control. But if something that inconsequential to the game is faked, where would they stop?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve mentioned it to buddies watching the games, and their response was &quot;the commentators keep mentioning how loud it is at the game, so that makes sense.&quot; But it&#39;s not the volume that&#39;s fishy! It&#39;s the lack of eb and flows, of variation, of atmosphere that I know the games have in person. Glad you noticed that too.</p>

<p>The audio mixer will adjust source levels based on the actual volume of the crowd noise to keep it more-or-less steady for the broadcast mix. If it gets really loud, they&#39;ll turn it down so you can hear the announcers (and so it doesn&#39;t sound terrible, as very loud noises sometimes do when amplified), and if it gets very quiet they&#39;ll turn it up to create atmosphere. Their mics are situated on or near the field, which is why they don&#39;t pick up a lot of airplane or emergency vehicle noise. The jumbotron ads tend to coincide with TV ad breaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can explain some of this...</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a general policy against showing controversial replays on the stadium bigscreen, but not on television broadcasts. The specific instance you describe -- when they sped to a commercial break -- might have another explanation. This year they&#39;re no longer doing a commercial break after every kickoff (because that was slowing down the pace of the game in broadcasts), so they have to find other opportunities during the game to cut away and fulfill their obligations to their advertisers. This is especially a likely explanation if the play you saw was close to the end of a half (or maybe a quarter -- I&#39;m not sure how specific NFL&#39;s advertisers get to be about where their spots play). As the end of a major segment approaches, if they didn&#39;t get a chance to play all the spots they were supposed to yet, the need to find time for those ads becomes critical -- every now and then you even see them miss a bit of a play because they came back too late. (The broadcasters have a legal obligation to play those ads, so it really is the top priority.)</li>
<li>You&#39;re probably right about not wanting to show empty seats.</li>
<li>The stadium noise is real! The next time you watch a game, pay closer attention to the audio. Crowd noise is a constant dull roar between plays, but you can hear them cheering good home team plays and getting angry at officials&#39; calls that benefit the visiting team. You don&#39;t hear a lot of chants because that&#39;s more of a college thing. (Chants at NFL stadiums tend to be very localized, whereas college games organize chants for the whole stadium, which is why you hear them on TV broadcasts.) The stadium announcer is usually pretty quiet between commercial breaks, but if you listen closely you can hear them shortly after the end of most plays -- of course, the TV announcers are talking at the same time, and the audio mixer has their microphones turned up and the crowd noise turned down. As for music, I was watching a game just yesterday -- Seahaws vs. Raiders in London -- and I distinctly remember hearing &#39;Welcome to the Jungle&#39; play on the stadium speakers, so I can say with authority that you do sometimes hear music.</li>
</ul>

<p>You&#39;re probably correct, but when the broadcast is packed with filler and reaction shots of players for most of the broadcast, and then a huge game-changing play occurs and they refuse to show a replay of, that doesn&#39;t sound like a sufficient explanation - even if it is for the sake of the advertisers. It&#39;s a shittier end product.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There are times I can hear stadium noise - you aren&#39;t wrong there. There are some games where it&#39;s just a constant buzz, though, and I suspect it&#39;s on MNF now that I think about it. The ESPN MNF production is obviously a lower-budget production than the Sunday games, or even college games for that matter.</p>

<p>I agree, but there&#39;s probably not a lot they can do to improve it. NFL games are basically packed with awkwardly-spaced dead time. I can&#39;t find a stat for average play duration but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s something in the 5-10 seconds range, and then you&#39;re generally waiting almost a full 40 seconds before the next play starts -- not enough time to run a block of ads, but long enough that you need those reaction shots and cutaways to keep it interesting. Any time they get an opportunity to take a 2 minute break they&#39;re likely to take it, even if something interesting just happened.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7us3Cu3b7zI">This is the play you watched</a>, right? This clip shows both the live play before they cut to commercial, and in the second half it shows that they actually did eventually show the hold. There&#39;s something interesting about that hold clip though -- do you see that it has a digital effect? The camera seems to suddenly change the direction of its motion (at about 1:08 in the video). That&#39;s because when the play initially happened, the camera operator didn&#39;t realize that the hold was going to be the important part of the clip, and instead probably focused on the kicker, with the hold happening at the edge of the screen. This clip of the hold is digitally zoomed and panned to make the hold the center of the action.</p>

<p>So in other words, there&#39;s another reason they didn&#39;t show the hold: they didn&#39;t have good unedited footage of it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s definitely true. A lot of people don&#39;t realize that there&#39;s a big technical quality difference between the various networks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Seahawks team was found to artificially augment crowd noise via speakers years ago at their peak. </p>

<p>The Clay Mathews harassment by officials is fucking bullshit. Every single time it has happened, national broadcasters/sports talk show hosts agree it is a complete joke and the roughing penalties are wrong even accounting for the new rules. That shill ref who came out and said he picked the QB up and drove him into the ground, and that the penalty falls under the old rules and didnt even invoke the new penalty, is still wrong because last year Aaron Rodgers was body slammed after throwing the ball but no penalty was called. So either the Rodgers broken collar bone play should have been called roughing, or the Mathews tackle of Cousins, which was far less rough and occurred in a manner in which Clay could not have possibly known the ball was being thrown, should not have been called since the Rodgers tackle was not. </p>

It’s why no one will be able to sue the NFL if they’re found to have a hand in influencing the outcome of games—it’s basically WWE but everyone has convinced themselves that for some reason the league is more concerned with the integrity of the game than they would be with the insane amount of money that stands to be made fixing games.</p>

<p>It would be hilariously easy to do now too, because the rules are so fckin convoluted they only need one ref on each crew to be aware of the fix...no one can even interpret the rules with 100% certainty as is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few years back (around 2010) all NFL stadiums were required to install HD slow mo cameras that cover every single angle on the field. You may remember the NBCit or CBS when they started showing replays in super slow mo with amazing clarity and you could literally see the blade of grass move when the toe came down in or out of bounds. Funny that anytime there is a close call these angles are nowhere to be found. </p>

<p>Each end zone pylon has 3 cameras in it. Yet they still show the angle from the 10 yard line on contested TDs. Even yesterday in the PIT game james Conner broke a huge run for a TD, they said he was down at the one. They then proceeded to show 4-5 replays but not one from the goalline camera literally 4 feet from where it was. And to boot PIT doesn&#39;t challenge(suspect) and then get stuffed and kick a field goal. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the over under and what is the spread? Ask yourself that anytime you see a funky call. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so i was watching the Eagles-Vikings game with my friend and we were pretty baked. </p>

<p>but at one point they had the “guys in the studio” doing a recap of the game and others, and the final guy was reporting just outside of this huge soundstage with like a big garage-door type thing, and after he was done reporting, it closed on him and he was like “hey guys, let me in, guys? Guys? Let me in!” And then it panned out on him trying to knock on the huge door, and had the “fox sports” logo animated on the 20 ft. door, then it went back to the game. </p>

<p>Sure, it could have been a gag, and I’m sure that’s what they were trying to make it look like, but the way the guys tone was it sounded desperate. </p>

<p>and then not 2 minutes later the most controversial call of the game happened and the entire stadium was booing for like 15 minutes, which seems just so engineered. I get 5 minutes, and I get that it’s eagles fans, but it just seemed so drawn out and fake. Idk I might’ve been too high but the whole thing just rubbed me the wrong way. </p>

<p>Further, roughing is not reviewable, so showing it or not is meaningless.  Roughing is also a judgement call and the fan base has been mocking the NFL for it&#39;s pansy treatment of QBs.  Maybe that ref felt the contact was not egregious enough to warrant a flag.</p>

<p>If you have no knowledge of NFL fixing I have a video for you to watch as an intro. Dan moldea is a fantastic investigative journalist. It&#39;s a little dated(1988 I think) but just assume that it has only gotten worse and easier to fix matches. 
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=utO9jtDpsmQ">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=utO9jtDpsmQ</a></p>

<p>The big thing imo is creating new rules that allow the ref to make whatever call they feel, while still having deniability to say &quot;oh they made an error&quot;. And for some reason the NFL won&#39;t let the refs fix calls through replay. </p>

<p>Modern example. Week 3 GB vs MIN. Gb is winning late in the fourth quarter. Min is driving. Cousins drops back and throws a pick. Games over GB wins. But wait out comes a terrible flag (roughing the passer). Min gets the ball back, drives the field, ties the game, and then it goes to overtime. </p>

<p>Now the NFL wins cause that&#39;s more commercials and Vegas wins cause the game ends in a tie. So anyone who bet either side straight up is now out all the money. Vegas probably wins 99% of straight up bets on just one game. </p>

<p>That happens every game every week. Vegas is making billions on dirty money. </p>

<p>Football is rigged and it runs so deep. Please watch the video I linked to open the rabbit hole. What&#39;s very important is the relationship with the NFL, homeland security, and the FBI. Any time I player or coach is investigated by local police they(investigating officer) are forced to drop the case(by their superiors) and hand over all information to NFL security so they can &quot;investigate&quot;. As in any match fixing bust Interpol is the only body that can blow the whistle because they are global and difficult to control from the top. Hence why the NFL will never leave the USA. The second they do they open themselves up to Interpol and might not be able to contain the many fixes happening daily. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can also see a big difference in how the league shows big hits now. You used to get multiple replays while the announcers gushed about the bone jarring hit. Now the announcers rarely even mention when a big hit happens unless someone gets injured and there is a timeout on the field.  There also used to be a segment before Monday night football called &quot;YOU GOT JACKED UP!!!&quot; where they showed a highlight reel of the weekends hardest hits and after each hit the group of announcers would all say in unison &quot;He got JACKED UP!!!&quot;. You don&#39;t see that no more lol. Obviously the NFL is very image conscious about head injuries and CTE, whether they actually care about player safety for any reason besides $$$ is a different story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a shit post given the TV coverage is mocked and the game is changing due to excruciatingly exact slo-mo replays.  Frame-by-frame reviews of plays, 3-minute delays, in-game ex-refs (Parera, Blandino) offering views... the replay system does not lack for coverage.</p>

<p>They may have protected the replacements, but this year it seems business as usual.  Most announcers are fairly blatant with their questioning of the refs and bad calls.  </p>

<p>The amount of calls or replays I feel I do not see are in the single digit percentages.  Like maybe 5% of calls where I&#39;m talking at the TV for a replay offer none.  Usually they take the opportunity to go to commercial break cuz no more breaks for every kickoff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree with this. I don&#39;t watch football but I have suspected for a while that this happens in baseball as well.  I didn&#39;t read all the comments in this thread so it may have been mentioned but it&#39;s often been theorized that the refs in the NBA are instructed to influence the outcome of games in such ways that result in the biggest market teams reaching the finals as well as dragging out the series to as many games as possible.  This ensures maximum revenue from advertisers and continued engagement from the largest fanbases.</p>

<p>Well I believe this happens in baseball too. Now, I may just be salty that the Braves lost their division series, but I feel like close calls went overwhelmingly in the Dodger&#39;s favor.  In baseball they can review certain plays at the request of the manager, but there has to be &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; to overturn the call made on the field by the umpire. Well if the umpires&#39; initial call is always in favor of a certain team (which appears to be the case when the Braves play certain big market teams: Yankees, Dodgers, Cardinals, and Nationals to be specific), then that&#39;s automatically giving an advantage to that team because it&#39;s less likely that the review team is going to go against the call on the field unless the replay is overwhelmingly convincing.</p>

<p>Going back to what you were saying, I totally noticed the lack of replays on controversial calls.  The ball and strike calling during the division series was so horrendous that the Braves&#39; subreddit is currently making t-shirts of a particular instance where an obvious ball was called a strike on one of the Braves&#39; hitters who then proceeded to hit a grand slam on the next pitch. But it wasn&#39;t just bad calls on balls and strikes and biased initial calls.  There was also a suspicious lack of reviewing check swings of the Dodger&#39;s hitters. But what really made me think something was up was the lack of the commentators even mentioning these inconsistencies by the umpiring crew when it was blatantly obvious to everyone watching at home.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me that all the controversial calls go to the team that is losing and then there&#39;s somehow a close game where it looked like it was going to be a blowout. Like.. If a team is about to go up 21 - 3 before halftime, that last touchdown will be taken away because holding somewhere. Same with passing interference.. Team losing by 21 with 8 minutes left in the game on 3rd down? It&#39;s defensive passing interference because they bumped each other.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the players contribute to any of the shenanigans.. I just think the NFL does everything it can to create close games every time - which includes controversial game-changing calls and announcers just going along and explaining why the referees&#39; perspectives were right.</p>

Then Packers quickly go 3-n-out but last second there is a crazy BS call against richard sherman. A replay is barely shown and commentators say nothing. The revived drive leads to a score. THE BS CALL IS NOT EVEN IN THE YOUTUBE HIGHLIGHTS. </p>

<p>Someone wanted Mr Rodgers to win tonight!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha that shit just redpilled one of my buddies watching the game. Aren’t all plays reviewed in the last 2 minutes? Wtf was that one armed interception hitting the ground? 49ers didn’t want to use one of their 3 remaining time outs to make sure that game ending play was called correctly? Fucking ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude... Sherman held Adams. That is LITERALLY the illegal contact rule. That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re coming from. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about BS officiating. This year, more often than not, I&#39;ve witnessed some HORRENDOUS flags thrown and not thrown. </p>

<p>Roughing the passer was big weeks 1-3 and now they don&#39;t even call it. I saw Blake Bortles GET HIT HELMET TO HELMET week 5 and the picture of that hit was the YouTube highlight thumbnail and that wasn&#39;t roughing the passer. But if that was Brady, instant flag. </p>

<p>I also saw the Browns vs Ravens penalties at one point we&#39;re 9/115 for the Browns 0 for the Ravens. The NFL really needs to be fair and consistent. </p>

<p>I constantly see offensive linemen tackle and hold defense linemen and they never call holding. That may be attributed to the fact they want to &quot;protect the quarterback&quot; but we all know thats bullshit. </p>

<p>The point is, you&#39;re right. They call the flag when it&#39;s convenient. And the NFL really needs to fix officiating. It&#39;s killing the game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He held his pads and arm after 5 yards. But I may be wrong. When I saw the replay I was like oh okay that makes sense. </p>

<p>But overall I think you have a point. I wouldn&#39;t have thrown the flag. NFL games are being decided over penalties like this week after week and it&#39;s ridiculous </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the whole &#39;you can call holding on pretty much any play&#39; trope that is repeated often during broadcasts is basically them admitting that they can (and i believe they do) completely manipulate the game using the officials, not very many players need to be in on it. </p>

<p>My own points have been there, ever since I responded to OP hours ago.</p>

<p>Those are odd and awfully wrong assumptions.</p>
