<p>their women are sluts. this is why the IDF spends like 16 mil/year on abortions. this is literally part of the problem, stupid people usually breed more than smart. look at Africa.  </p>

<p>go look up medical stats on mixed race children. there are millions of genes, obviously there are circumstances where natural mixing doesn&#39;t work, especially early on in a species. you see more serious issues across haplo groups, like you would expect with people in hykos, who mixed across the sahara a major geo bound. But I am not surprised you have no idea how that works and why you would try to opt out with some jewish psychology bullshit.  </p>

<p>If the Khazars Jews theory&#39;s are true we don&#39;t have to go as far back as you say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the khazar theory has been genetically proven. ashkenazi are definitely more aggravating to deal with, they are prone to severe behavioral and physical diseases. you expect this when a population is bottled to 400 individuals and then expands to over 5 million. as for khazar control, we would have to learn about share holders in dutch VOC. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you can tell by my comments or not, but I don&#39;t care. I post for the next person. The ones who matter will see the light, the rest will be killed. Good luck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Central banks are partnerships created between bankers and politicians. The political side gets spendable money (created from nothing) without having to raise taxes, while bankers get interest payments in perpetuity. </p>

<p>The Fed will not be abolished because politicians need a mechanism for creating a ton of spending power without having to raise taxes. Bankers need a lot more, especially less competition. Basically they need a monopoly to create and control the nation&#39;s money at the highest of levels.</p>

<p>Of course, they also need the taxpayer to bail them out when there are inevitable losses.</p>
