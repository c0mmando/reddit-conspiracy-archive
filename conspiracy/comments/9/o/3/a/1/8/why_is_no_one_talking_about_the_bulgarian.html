       True, but that type of behavior is expected from the "enemy" while unacceptable from an ally
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what I was trying to express.

       I, personally, want to know what this is part of in terms of the bigger picture. The failed coup in the Saudi royal family last year and ongoing war with Iran can't be going all too well

       I guess we're on opposite sides since I'm not American so the Saudi's aren't my ally.

       You probably don't realize the significance of the Khashoggi family.  They were some of Trump's earliest business partners, worked with the bin Laden family, handled weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, notorious money launderers and arms traffickers, involved in businesses at the center of the JFK hit all the way to 9/11 like Barrick Gold, and are even larger financiers of fringe leaders in the US from scientology to infowars.

       Man didn’t back any of those claims up with citations. Easy now. As much as I believe this is probably true, you can’t just make accusations like that and believe them without at least offering one source. Everything is propaganda

       Well, it's hard to tell anymore. Sorry about the assumption that you were American by the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone calls everything controlled opposition, and assume it to be blatant propaganda because it doesn't fit their 'narrative' which is the common phrase. It's frustrating to discuss issues with conspiracy theorist these days because.
      </p>
      <p>
       People assume a difference of opinion equals supporting their enemy and it's reached a critical mass on this sub, which is indicative reading any top comments, such as the one over the anomaly in Las Vegas. The top comment brings some discrepancies which are worth noting, but every other upvoted comments is flaming the idea and anyone who is interested in looking into it themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe she is controlled opposition, and I enjoyed a lot of her stuff before the election. She didn't mince words when it came to our arming of rebels, which always leads to massive destruction in the land we send them to.

       I have a massive problem with this line of thinking. It could very well be true that the media covered both stories equally or close to equally, but we don't know. I think the point being made is that there was a huge amount of coverage of one thing and the other thing seemed to slip under the radar. Just because you can find some articles does not mean that the information got out.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what OP is actually saying: We see all kinds of stories all over the place about the Saudi journalist, but this other death was not covered nearly to the same degree. Put another way, maybe 95 percent of people are aware of the Saudi journalist story, and only 1 percent are aware of the other story. The media covered both stories, sure, but there is clearly a difference.

       Of course it did not get the same coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Saudi journalist was allegedly murdered and killed in a consulate by direct order of the Saudi king. Turkey is claiming they have audio and video recordings.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a suspect in the case of the Bulgarian journalist and no state has officially accused any state actors or any other country to have ordered the murder. There is only some unsubstantiated allegations.

      <p>
       The cases are vastly different.

       This is what always happens when somebody points this out. The person starts off with something like "There has been plenty of talk about her, why do you claim otherwise?" Then somebody points out that the argument is that there's a vast difference in coverage, not that zero coverage exists. Then the user switches the argument to trying to explain
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       there is a vast difference in the amount and placement of coverage. That's why the original argument seems so deliberately misleading because you could have just originally agreed that there is a difference in coverage and tried to provide your theory about why that difference exists.

       Not at all. OP claimed literally that "no one" was talking ablut the Bulgarian journalist. That is flat out wrong.

       I think you just have to look at the claim and realize that this is not what OP meant. How could OP have known about it if literally nobody talked about it? It would be very unreasonable to pretend that you think OP meant that there was literally nothing out there about this death. This is just how people speak, and to take words literally even though you know it's unreasonable to do so is pretty weird.

       "Why is nobody talking about this?"
      </p>
      <p>
       This phrase in English means that there isn't enough discussion of a thing. It does not literally mean nobody is talking about it. For one, the OP is talking about it, and two, the OP must have heard about it somewhere unless he is a psychic remote viewer or something. It's therefore unreasonable, and a strawman argument, to assume the phrase is to be taken literally.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were at a party and only 3 people showed up, and a person asks "damn, why is nobody here," would you take that literally and correct the person?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your response probably: "Actually, there are 3 people here, so that's false."

       The first site I checked:
      </p>
      <p>
       Front page of new York Times on the day they wrote the story about the Bulgarian journalist. There is nothing on the front page about her, but there a story there about the Saudi journalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       October 8, 2018:
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181008085118/https://www.nytimes.com">
        https://web.archive.org/web/20181008085118/https://www.nytimes.com
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       October 9. The day after they wrote that article they have nothing on the Bulgarian, but they do have a story about the Saudi journalist again:
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181009070746/https://www.nytimes.com">
        https://web.archive.org/web/20181009070746/https://www.nytimes.com
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully you understand the nuance involved in discussions and comparisons of news coverage. 95 percent of the public may be aware of one story and may have read 5 articles on it, and only 1 percent of the public may be aware of the other story. This can be caused in a number of ways, including the news outlets deciding which stories to put on their front page.

       I know I said "no one" because from my stance I wasn't hearing anything about it except from what I already heard, I know that it can't be 100% no one talking about it and it wasn't ment to be taken literally so I think your looking to much into the wording and trying to make something of nothing

       The Khashoggi murder stands out for two reasons. Firstly because it is definitely a State assassination by the Saudis, and at this point we don't know if that's true of the murders of Viktoria Marinova in Bulgaria, or Colonel Yevhenia Shishkina in Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, the Khashoggi murder has an international relations dimension, and that has affected the level of coverage. An extra-judicial assassination by a government
       <strong>
        carried out in a foreign country
       </strong>
       is a big news story, particularly since Turkey and Saudi Arabia already have a fractious relationship.

       Im from Bulgaria and here all the media is owned by people close to the politicians. So this rape and murder of the Journalist (mother of a 7 year old btw) was almost not covered in the Bulgarian media and it should 've been top news like everywhere in the world. There are still people here who are not sure what's this all about .. some of them only heard about a journalist being killed and they're not aware about the real reason - she was investigating corruption and stealing from EU funds - huge amounts - more than 10 million euro. The sad thing is people here are not outraged, they're not even surprised .. and there's nothing you can do to fight the mafia. Its just everyone accepted the country is owned by the mafia and there's nothing you can do about it.. these things happen all the time, so people barely react any more.

       I'm from northern Greece so hi 👋🏻. But wow that really sucks although I'm not surprised, whenever I hear or read about corruption in the Balkans it sucks and is so sad how it feels like corruption has plagued the Balkans and I can't see a way it can fix itself without the citizens doing something, cause whenever outside powers try and mediate or help I feel it never seems to work

       You don't get my post I am talking about how North American media has portrayed and presented these deaths, and I think the death of the Bulgarian journalist was actually more important she found information on the government for corruption but the Saudi guy was just critiquing the Saudis it's just how he got killed that's adds a crazy factor

       "was just critiquing the Saudis" mumbled the fool. this has to be the most NOT thought-out argument on this sub. Jamal Khashoggi had been an avid supporter of The Arab Spring, as one of his friends mentioned in an interview post-disappearance. And this was not the first attempt meant to impede his work. Now please, go do your research.

       All day Friday they called Jamal Khashoggi an American citizen. I'm just telling you how I heard it. And of course trying to put Trump in bed with the Saudis, selling arms and then mentioning how Jamal's dad was an evil, rich arms dealer.

       Stop bitchin' from your poor selection of news sources. The gravity of Kashoggi's death due to his affiliations and meddling investigations deems this a news piece of greater caliber. Second, i watched Al Jazeera last week cover both stories (Bulgarian journalist) back to back. Lastly, there is no bias but simply that eastern-europe scandals are concealed better... while the media is used to deceive you that Western powers are actually probing into the "disappearance" of Kashoggi by covering it more. You Sir are an idiot, as your inability to deduce this has proved, good day.

       I couldn't care less if you do. First of all, you've repeated that a million times in this thread. Second of all you put in your title "why is no one talking about" to your Post ON REDDIT. You repeating that you don't use reddit for news does not make your title any less bullshit

       I think all of the coverage is pretty closely tied to geopolitical relationships. Even though the news is covering the Saudi journalist, the headlines are still pretty tepid, saying things like this
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       <em>
        begin
       </em>
       to sour U.S./Saudi relations, not to mention Trump's benign and oddly worded response: "We are not, not, taking this seriously." It's most likely that weapon's contracts and oil outweigh a single dead journalist, no matter how brazen it was, so they are treating it more like a whodunnit murder mystery than a potentially pivotal issue between nation states. For example, the journalist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Turkey, who just last year had

        bodyguards beating Americans on U.S. soil:
       </a>
       But that got barely any press, probably because they are a close U.S. ally in the Syrian conflict right now, fairly similar situation as far as being deliberately ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory about why they cover Russia so much is because Russia is a really easy go-to bad guy that benefits a lot of people to demonize. It benefits the Democrats, because of their election meddling theory and takes attention off of their own crookedness and worthlessness. It benefits the government in general to renew cold war tensions; having a big, scary, looming boogeyman, for the general public to fear is a way to unify the "befuddled herd," as the members of the
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Public_Information">
        Creel committee
       </a>
       mockingly referred to the U.S public when they were trying to get the population to support U.S. involvement in WW1. It benefits the DoD because Russian tension provides an excuse to allocate a budget for expensive programs like nukes and cutting-edge fighter aircraft that the default "terrorist" enemy does not possess. And it benefits the media, because people like Rachel Maddow can blather on for hours about a thus-far virtually baseless conspiracy theory (look up synonyms for
       <a href="https://www.freethesaurus.com/collusion">
        "collusion"
       </a>
       , their favorite word to use regarding Russia. Also, Pentagon officials have publicly stated that a determination was made to target Russia as the number one threat to U.S. interests, because the alternative is China; we have too many economic ties with them to seriously antagonize them militarily.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, there's probably also some truth to Russia being a potentally hostile state power, I'm sure they want the same parts of the middle east for oil pipelines, and they probably do at least attempt to meddle with our elections, just like every country does to everyone else.

       Interesting, makes sense. I guess they half to always have someone to blame. Also watched the vid of the Turkish president; I can't believe trump didn't bring up all the journalists being detained in their meeting. But I guess since their allies in the Syria endeavour he didn't want to ruffle any feathers.

       There are very real and politically important differences.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the former cases there were murders related to political or criminal corruption where there are several possible culprits and the matter is being investigated. Whether or not people have strong suspicions about who was responsible (either directly or as the ring-leader), the matters are being investigated by the authorities and if the investigation is side-lined it becomes more an issue of corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Just to point out in the Russia case there is no clear idea of who might have done it. Russian investigators generally have a long list of possible enemies, including politicians, business owners and gangsters).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of Saudi Arabia it is the use of diplomatic territory to commit a crime against a resident of another state. This makes the matter immediately international (involving Saudi, USA and Turkey). It is also a deep violation of the rules of diplomatic protocol that states extend to one another granting embassies extra-territoriality. Luring someone from one state onto diplomatic turf (technically the land of another) in order to carry put an execution, is not something that I can recall having happened before. Also, there is (allegedly) hard-evidence of the crime available, meaning that there is no issue of identifying the guilty parties. Finally, Saudia Arabia is threatening to punish anyone who penalizes them for their gross violation of human and diplomatic rights, with an oil embargo, adding terroristic threats to the mix. It is a very unusual and unique case fully deserving all the coverage and analysis than it has gotten.

       They are all covered, but Kashoggi gets more in the US because
a) he worked for a US publication (Washington Post)
b) the weak response by Trump underscores how compromised US foreign policy has become
c) given Saudi backing of Kushner, the conflict of interests are now painfully obvious
d) this pokes a hole in the myth of American exceptionalism

       The reason for the difference in coverage is that the ME events are of concern to Israel and that the Jews in the US are very powerful and have some control over what gets reported, and what does not.
