        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This conspiracy theory has so many layers that it&#39;s almost too much to fathom.</p>

<p>A few days ago, pewdiepie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PLgOaVXmGU">posted this video</a> about his concerns over the questionable &quot;Better Help&quot; online therapy service.</p>

<p>Some of the major red flags concerning this service are the fact that despite claiming &quot;HIPAA&quot; certification and that their therapists are &quot;vetted&quot; thoroughly, if you <em>actually</em> read the terms of service, they offer <em>zero</em> guarantee regarding the credentials of these &quot;therapists&quot; and that the HIPAA &quot;certification&quot; is fraudulent and literally made up.</p>

<p>In addition, many major youtubers happened to experience &quot;psychological problems&quot; at around the same time...and then <em>just happened</em> to stumble upon Better Help and start promoting the service aggressively.</p>

<p>Another aspect of this fraud is that people with <em>genuine</em> mental health and depression problems are routinely turned away from the service, strongly suggesting that they are focusing their predatory sights on those who are only somewhat, or even &quot;superficially&quot;, depressed.</p>

<p>While pewdiepie&#39;s video is a good place to start, and credit to him for using his platform in a positive way like this, <em>another</em> youtuber named Memology 101 has been doing the lion&#39;s share of work in exposing this incredibly deceptive and pernicious conspiracy.</p>

<p>His documentary series is called &quot;Why YouTubers Are Depressed&quot; and is worth watching in its entirety, so here are all the parts so far:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since about 3-4 years ago, maybe more, youtubers really don&#39;t make a whole lot of money off of subscribers/views. Gus Johnson made a pretty good video on it. </p>

<p>Like you&#39;re looking at like $100 max off of a couple million hits. </p>

<p>Unless your pewdiepie, you <em>have to</em> sell something else. Some channels sell their own merchandise, some channels just put up a patreon, and some sell ad space. </p>

<p>This leads a lot of young youtubers to being easily exploited by ad companies. I&#39;m by no means, trying to say &quot;it&#39;s  business as usual&quot;. I think it&#39;s mainly to do with this age of making a living off of being a social media star. Which can mess up a lot of kids and young adults. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, I&#39;m thinking about partnerships. The dollars:views ratio I cited is that of a channel that has been signed to a one of the many hostile partnerships on youtube. The biggest offender is machinima. </p>

<p>With your numbers accounted for you would have to get at least 1.6 million views a month to start to get minimum wage in California. For the &quot;hip&quot; tubers right now, (iDubz or h3h3, all the way to uber popular tubers like Jake Paul or pewdiepie), that&#39;s not too difficult. But for tubers like Ian Kung, Gus Johnson, ProZD, who are hitting millions, but averaging around the &lt;500k mark, it&#39;s a bit hard to make enough to live off of. Especially when these tubers convince themselves that moving to LA will help their career. </p>

<p>I guess my post, more than anything, was about how there&#39;s this kind of struggle they face with. To gain popularity, to live, to see big internet stars like ninja, pewdiepie, jake paul, make &quot;millions&quot; a year and try to live up to that. There&#39;s also the thousands of smaller accounts struggling to get noticed. All based on this notion that doing stuff on the internet can be a career. That there&#39;s a lot of young kids in this world chasing that dream. Making more people pay attention to what&#39;s going on in the internet. Which also opens up this particular conspiracy of hostile ad companies. </p>

<p>Thanks for the correction! I got to learn more about how monetization works on YouTube. I think it&#39;s important for people to know how much money these channels make, especially compared to the Huge ones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IF you can stay monetized. And if your content is claimed (which usually happens very close to the upload date), the claimant gets all the ad revenue for that video until you appeal it (and win the appeal), by which time the views have dropped off because it&#39;s not a fresh video anymore.</p>

<p>And who gets to review the appeal? The claimant of course. Seems fair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And again, a number of the Youtubers involved in this scheme, made videos supporting the banning of Alex Jones. After watching this, I now believe their handlers instructed them to do so. Interestingly H3H3 (which I loved) also had a little weird, out of place moment, where they talked about &quot;hero&quot; John McCain. I wonder if BetterHelp is connected to groups like Bilderberg/Atlantic Council?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They had a massive legal battle, they&#39;re just trying to keep their money tight, why wouldn&#39;t they when all their eggs were literally in one basket. I don&#39;t even get why they&#39;ve been brought up here, he only had a single video sponsored by better-help and even he said, he didn&#39;t read the EULA, his ad agency was supposed to have done that. He talked about John McCain because he just had the facts that he was a POW he definitely didn&#39;t do research on other aspects - why? Because he&#39;s a youtube comedian and every took everything he said over the last 3 months as canon when it never was supposed to be that way. IF you go to h3h3 for solid news facts, you&#39;re frankly an idiot. I don&#39;t care if I get down-voted into oblivion for this, I&#39;m just so sick of everyone getting butt hurt over what Ethan does, or does not do. He doesn&#39;t give a shit about politics, he just ran out of content and now it seems with the pregnancy, he is back to making youtube videos. His fanbase basically held him at gunpoint to start making (production) videos again, so he did. Now if you listen closely when he talks, after he says anything at all that sounds divisive, political, or religious, he immediately says &quot;but don&#39;t listen to me, I don&#39;t know shit, this is just an opinion, it&#39;s probably false&quot; - those are obviously directed at people who keep dragging him down.</p>

<p>I linked 11 different memeology videos that are part of the same series.</p>

<p>You definitely should invest in the whole thing before passing judgment.</p>

<p>Also, even though the pacing is a bit slow, it&#39;s unfair to compare a channel with 14k subscribers and one with over 60 million.</p>

<p>pewdiepie&#39;s video is a great overview, but it really only scratches the surface of just how sinister this is.</p>

<p>“You definitely should invest in the whole thing before passing judgement” </p>

<p>Who would actually do something so dumb? If I told you to go research the pleasures involved with sticking ur dick in a power outlet you wouldn’t wait until you’ve seen it all to decide it’s dumb. The memology video is just some kid who’s insecure about his high pitched voice so he has to talk through a pitch shifted filter restating the obvious while using irrelevant clips out of context to try and make a “series” to fill a void of creativity. That other guy has all the right to make an early judgement and move on. </p>

It seems like one of my regular go to YTers Philly D seems to be at the center of this which sucks because I like him and his content usually. I do find what these other creators are saying to be credible however. They are literally making money off depresed fans. They could have just asked for money from their devoted fans but it wouldnt have been to the tune of 100 or 200 PER FAN like they got with this grift. I wish that they would come clean like Boogie seemed to but thu far he has not which makes me kind of sad.</p>

Its just a way to get a quick 10 minute heads up on the world for me. I am kind of let down by his lack of accountability on this topic though.

<p>You do have a point in that perspective plays a big part of these feelings early on. If your whole world revolves around what happens inside of a building you&#39;re required to go to and things aren&#39;t going well there it probably starts to look pretty bleak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just Youtubers that are depressed, tons of people are depressed. The problem with youtube is that people are chasing numbers, more likes, subscribers, more money per videos - these numbers are infinite. As soon as you hit a goal, your expectations shift. This isn&#39;t a normal way for humans to live, and it never was - this is new to our psyche. That&#39;s why people are depressed - we spend hours and hours on our laptops and phones, most of us don&#39;t get enough sleep or even eat properly, there&#39;s been a massive spiritual decline (yes be an edgy atheist I don&#39;t care) you can still be spiritual - ie walk in the woods, soak up the energy, whatever.   </p>

<p>Betterhelp is just another shitty company trying to make money by owning no actual things themselves much like uber, lyft, air b n b, and every drop-shipping site like wish, etc. Youtubers aren&#39;t wasting their time reading eulas and they need to make money somehow. Betterhelp just picked people and reached out, its no different than if MVMT reached out to tons of youtubers and then we found out some shady shit about them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used BetterHelp for a few months, I just cancelled the other day actually because it’s so expensive ($260/mo) for what it is, and my counselor didn’t always answer questions I had or gave me guidance on something I specifically asked about.</p>

<p>What I will give them though- I forgot to cancel before they charged me for another month. I had an anxiety attack and panicked because I didn’t think I would use their service anyways so I emailed them and they refunded me the next day. </p>

<p>My counselor did seem to genuinely care, he would check up on me when I didn’t respond back in a few days. </p>

<p>This is the first I’ve heard of this YouTube/BetterHelp “conspiracy”. </p>

<p>Who would actually do something so dumb? If I told you to go research the pleasures involved with sticking ur dick in a power outlet you wouldn’t wait until you’ve seen it all to decide it’s dumb. The memology video is just some kid who’s insecure about his high pitched voice so he has to talk through a pitch shifted filter restating the obvious while using irrelevant clips out of context to try and make a “series” to fill a void of creativity. That other guy has all the right to make an early judgement and move on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They had a massive legal battle, they&#39;re just trying to keep their money tight, why wouldn&#39;t they when all their eggs were literally in one basket. I don&#39;t even get why they&#39;ve been brought up here, he only had a single video sponsored by better-help and even he said, he didn&#39;t read the EULA, his ad agency was supposed to have done that. He talked about John McCain because he just had the facts that he was a POW he definitely didn&#39;t do research on other aspects - why? Because he&#39;s a youtube comedian and every took everything he said over the last 3 months as canon when it never was supposed to be that way. IF you go to h3h3 for solid news facts, you&#39;re frankly an idiot. I don&#39;t care if I get down-voted into oblivion for this, I&#39;m just so sick of everyone getting butt hurt over what Ethan does, or does not do. He doesn&#39;t give a shit about politics, he just ran out of content and now it seems with the pregnancy, he is back to making youtube videos. His fanbase basically held him at gunpoint to start making (production) videos again, so he did. Now if you listen closely when he talks, after he says anything at all that sounds divisive, political, or religious, he immediately says &quot;but don&#39;t listen to me, I don&#39;t know shit, this is just an opinion, it&#39;s probably false&quot; - those are obviously directed at people who keep dragging him down.</p>
