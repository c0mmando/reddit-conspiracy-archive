<li>His grandfather was the personal doctor of King Al Saud, founder of Saudi Arabia</li>
<li>His uncle was billionaire arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, who was close to Nixon, Thatcher and sold his yacht to Donald Trump</li>
<li>His cousin was Dodi Al Fayed, who was Diana&#39;s lover and was killed with her when their car crashed</li>
<li>He spent SEVEN YEARS with Bin Laden and the Taliban</li>
</ul>

<p>And yet, he is described merely as a &quot;journalist&quot;.
Why the coverup?</p>

<p>Now Saudi Arabia is issuing threats about the price of oil - breaking a 45-year old taboo since the 1973 oil crisis.
Meanwhile Softbank, Japan&#39;s second largest corporation after Toyota and a key partner of Saudi oil money, is tumbling in the stock markets.
All this over a &quot;journalist&quot;? There&#39;s way more going on here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is an interesting case to be sure. I don&#39;t know how it is in the other five eye countries but Canada had a recent spat with Saudi Arabia (in the last few months) over human rights abuses that led to a rift in diplomatic ties. That case at face value seemed ridiculous - as if Canadian politicians all just picked up a newspaper for the first time and got the vapors. And for the US political class to care about a &quot;journalist&quot; is quite strange considering how they treat Juluan Assange. And for Saudi Arabia to press hard on people for spreading this story is also bizzare. Do all of these countries need to severe ties for a diplomatic reset? Do they need to get away from the Petrodollar? Strike up new trade deals? Inflate the price of oil? So many questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and it was just as strange if not moreso. Canadian officials were upset over some human rights abuses surrounding someone in prison. I mean that&#39;s great and all but Saudi Arabia doesn&#39;t exactly have the best track record otherwise so it seemed fishy to me right away. Now with this murdered journalist we might see a pattern of distancing from the kingdom and eventually the price of oil begins to creep up and everybody wins. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think SA needed to send a message to its citizens that no one is untouchable.   I don’t know who this guy was, but people in the “know” who would be a threat to SA prob know.  SA is also playing the US midterm elections, they know raising oil prices would look bad for trump.   That’s why they can, and are, so brazen.   Walking cleaners in while the media is watching.   There’s also a Russia angle here since raising oil prices would help Russia and further hurt trump in the media.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People need to remember that last year two warring Royal factions were literally killing each other. The current crowned Prince bin-Salman, and al-Waleed were not getting along. Salman is being sold as a more liberal leader for Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile al-Waleed, was Obama&#39;s sugar daddy, and is knee deep on the Deep State, owning Citibank, Twitter, Fox, etc.   </p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna call either of them the good guy, but this could have something to do with that feud. Just by looking at their history, its clear that al-Waleed makes bin-Salman look like an angel though. Also consider that bin-Salam is preferred by Trump, while al-Waleed isn&#39;t (he was imprisoned in a hotel, after Kushner flew there last year). So who would benefit from this the most?</p>

<p>Taliban was never the mujahedeen. Mujahedeen was CIA funded and trained guerillas, AKA Al Qaeda. They fought against the occupying Russian forces in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>The Taliban was the children of Afghan refugees. They grew up during the 1980s in refugee camps in neighboring Pakistan. They considered the Mujahedeen to be criminals and fought to remove them from Afghanistan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the most expensive covert operation the CIA ever carried out, over 3 billion dollars was funnelled to the Pakistani ISI to recruit radical fundamentalists from as far away as Malaysia, bring them to Taliban indoctrination and guerilla warfare training centers on the Pakistani border and even have Pak ISI officers lead them into battle against the Soviet forces in Afghanistan. All while denying any involvement at the UN over the Soviet&#39;s complaints about it.</p>

<p>Now the main bone of contention in Afghanistan was primarily a pipeline through the country and who would get to own and use it. Those who claimed to be in power in Afghanistan and who were in favour of a pipeline and the ongoing payments to them for allowing one didn&#39;t care whether it was the Soviets or the US that built one. They were only interested the hefty revenues it would bring in. The country itself and multiple factions within it were far from being agreeable about either proposition without some assurances about what those revenues would be and how they would be shared and used and failing to get an acceptable answer took matters into their own hands to violently resist the central government and Soviet efforts to get the line they wanted built.</p>

<p>When the Soviets were forced to give up and leave the US stepped in only to find that the Taliban were just as opposed to them as they were to the Soviets and leaving them no choice but to side with the very same people that were in favour of the line that the Soviets had been working with. </p>

<p>And so the US stepped into straight into the quagmire that it had created for the Soviets and that played such a major role in it&#39;s final downfall and is just as intractably caught-up in it and still spending a veritable fortune in that fight without being able to successfully resolve it in all that time. </p>
