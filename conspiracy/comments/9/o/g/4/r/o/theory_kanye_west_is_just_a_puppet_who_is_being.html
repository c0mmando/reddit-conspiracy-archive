       I believe there was a time where Kanye West actually was an outspoken critic of the system and a bit of a "wild card". Does anybody recall during the Hurricane Katrina relief advertisement, when he said on live tv, "George Bush doesn't care about black people, and the media is portraying us negatively on purpose"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or when he dropped a mention to Pizzagate awhile back?
      </p>
      <p>
       After that, he was placed into a mental health facility and hospitalized, perhaps against his will in an effort to "rehabilitate" him. Celebrities with influence who try to wake the masses and criticize the establishment are often given a talking to or threatened into complying and playing ball again.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, after being a volatile thorn in the side of TPTB, standing up for African Americans and bringing attention to the scandals of the elites, perhaps part of the "deal" they offered him to keep his career and his wealth, was that he would be required to cheerlead for the president, in hopes of herding his supporters and followers into supporting the current administration. Trump and the Republicans are not very popular with the African American demographic, and it all just reeks of a pre-midterm election stunt (let me reiterate that I reject the two party system entirely and am just elaborating on some potential manipulation).
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps this was the penance he owed them. If you're a celebrity who is volatile and willing to call out TPTB on live TV and during your concerts, you are going to be dealt with, and they are creative at coming up with ways to make it look organic and inconspicuous. Then, if you wish to keep your career, they are going to keep you on a tight leash, create some blackmail, or force you to do a favor for them.

       With the African American demographic? Yes, in my opinion. Right before midterm elections. Taylor swift was the puppet for dems, he's the puppet for repubs. According to the theory at least.

       Ok let me get this as straight as I can then based on your theory.

       Kanye goes on rants and is bashed by the MSM and entertainment industry for being "crazy" and "there there" with "voices in his head".
       <br/>
       So then the (R) party decides that he would be a great pickup to help with the black vote. The (D)'s are furious to lose such a trusted black man of their cause that they then go and get Taylor Swift to help side with them?

       What liberties? The assumption that blacks would only vote for (R) if some "Crazy" black guy supported the (R) party or that more blacks would then swing back to the (D)'s because some skinny white girl said so?

       How many times must this be said--you need to hire these people. Claiming otherwise is ridiculous and naive. You are going to hire the best at that position and the best tend to work on Wall Street, the MIC, big business, etc.

       Who did you think he was going to hire? A bank manager from a small town? Alex Jones for Attorney General? Some random nobody to be Secretary of State? Had he hired someone like this you would have complained anyway for hiring cronies and inept nobodies.

       You must really be gobbling up the “Trump is taking down the deep state” narrative. No, you don’t need to place globalists and bankers into cabinet positions. It’s what the last 8+ administrations have done, and I’ll bet you criticized them too. You seem to have a partisan bias to me.

       Who are you going to hire then? The most talented people are drawn to those things, no different than the best actors go to Hollywood or the best basketball players go to the NBA.

       Ultimately, policy boils down to what Trump wants and what Trump wants doesn't coincide with the globalists. Sometimes he does but that is inevitable. If we did what  the conspiracy community always wanted, the US would be a second rate power and a banana republic.

       Donald Trump continues the PNAC agenda, "rebuilding" the military, promoting war against Iran, and the Space Force. All straight out of PNAC.

       Donald Trump continues the 'government out of the way agenda,' more Ronald Reagan tax cuts, deregulation, internal agency sabotage.

       Like I said, I can't change your mind. It's already made. All I can say is I'm on the side of progress being made. I voted for a guy who promised change for 8 years and got nothing. A guy I didn't vote for is already changing the US for good in 2 years. Say what you want but he is actually doing good for the people. That is something I haven't seen in my 31 years alive.

       In 2008, I read dozens of good quality articles critical of Obama. I listened to Obama say things that I didn't like. Then, I watched the messianic Obama inauguration, recognizing that the contrast between that day and the coming days would cause people like you to become disappointed and backlash against him.

       So, you're right. You can't change my mind. I predicted you ten years ago.

       Yes, celebrities are part of the elite power structure. You can't read much more into it than that, it is not really all under their control either.  The media uses them, they don't always get to control how they are portrayed.  In some ways that was part of what Kanye is complaining about too though.

       He tries to speak his own mind and say what he really wants to say and the media elite fight back even harder.

       Could be. Lots of celebs pay for PR advice to help craft their message... and those firms just do their best based on what the client wants the message/opinion to be.... but he does *not* sound scripted to me.  He's all over the place, just streaming consciousness and jumping from one thing to the next.

       Sort of suspected this to be the truth as well. Donald Trump has a massive PR team among conspiracy forums and conservative based discussion platforms online. Kanye is just a little puppet they trotted out there to drum up support.

       On contrary, in today's super sensitive environment, it is in the best interest of any public figure or celebrity to voluntarily enter rehab or seek some form of official psychiatric help. Plus, that shit really helps people, so how is this a bad thing?

       Perhaps, in this time of hatred among the people, he just chose love. Perhaps he just chose progress. Perhaps he chose to actually make a difference instead of bicker with the other side. Perhaps he saw an opening to actually make a HUGE difference for the black community outside of his music, instead of just talking about it.

       Plus having Kanye working with the president is only going to help Trump truly see the other sides views. When Kanye brought the "Make America Great" hat for Trump and simply said "because it hasn't always been great for some folks" you could tell that honestly Trump may not have seen it that way before.

       Instead of fighting with each other on who did/said what, take time to appreciate the progress being made right in front of you.

      <p>
       -41% approval rate and rising
-Better economy (even though you don't want to believe it was him but Obama)
-Winning the trade war
-Lower unemployment rate
-Highest black employment rate in the last 15 years
-Working towards bringing more jobs to America (more than he has already brought)
-Working towards amending the 13th amendment
      </p>
      <p>
       Man I waited 8 years for change from a man I voted for, and got it in 2 with a guy I didn't vote for. I'm not saying you have to like Trump, I truly believe in personal freedoms and your freedom to not like the US president. What I'm trying to say is instead of fighting with your fellow American try love and understanding. Instead of fighting progress, help progress along.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer the question, supporting the current administration is showing love for this country and individuals living in it. Currently more is being done for citizens than I have ever seen in my lifetime.

       Now to turn this back to you, how is you hating and demonizing everything the right does helping your cause? I'm all ears, and would genuinely like to hear your side.

       I don't put much sway on what celebrities have to say. But they have every right to support whom every they choose. If Kanye is being used, to what end? To address prison reform? Is this a bad thing? Is it a bad thing because it was a public gesture?

       In 2008, I read dozens of good quality articles critical of Obama. I listened to Obama say things that I didn't like. Then, I watched the messianic Obama inauguration, recognizing that the contrast between that day and the coming days would cause people like you to become disappointed and backlash against him.

       So, you're right. You can't change my mind. I predicted you ten years ago.
