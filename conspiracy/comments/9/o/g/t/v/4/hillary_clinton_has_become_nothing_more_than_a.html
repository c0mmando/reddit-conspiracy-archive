       Why is she still constantly being brought up? Yes, the Clinton Foundation should be investigated and her husband is a war criminal and could potentially be a rapist.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anytime somebody here criticizes the current administration when they do something authoritarian like bomb Syria, authorize arms deals with terrorist countries like Saudi Arabia, or sign massive military spending bills, HRC is the convenient diversion brought up to distract us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are people still so obsessed with the other candidate who lost the presidency?

       You have to admit... She makes it pretty easy to scapegoat her. The DNC laid everything on the altar of The Witch and now they're paying the price. Shit, the crazy cunt is going on a multi-country tour while the Dems know she is absolute poison to aby sort of campaign.

       I think the pendulum is going to swing the other way in 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dems may run an “obama 2.0” character, Tulsi Gabbard who is a member of the globalist think tank group, Council on Foreign Relations. She has a perfect resume, and having her win in 2020 would be a great way to create more division and partisan tension among the American public, which is a big part of how they remain in control.

       I personally got confused at the part where you say her “crimes” are irrelevant. She is responsible for the deaths of thousands of people around the world through her policies as Secretary of State. She is also responsible for the destruction of our planet through her support of fracking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get your point, the current administration is bad too, but that doesn’t all of a sudden undo all the horrific things other politicians have done. Wake up and smell your brainwashing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can try to convince people to focus their attention/hate on the president, but what good has that done us in the past? Absolute none whatsoever. The majority of Americans don’t even know what the hell is going on in our world and how it became the way it is. Let me tell you, it has NOTHING to do with Democrats or Republicans.

       Bombings in Syria and deals with Saudi are business as usual; essentially independent of who is in office. They are not unique to the current administration, and would have been an integral part to whichever group happened to be elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one should be above reproach, especially POTUS, regardless of who that POTUS may be. I believe a more directed criticism would be something like, "Trump has stated that Saudi Arabia was involved in 9/11 yet still makes deals with them;" or "Trump appears to be setting the stage to attempt to wrongfully convince the world that rogue factions of MBS's family killed Khashoggi in an attempt to weaken MBS's power while it was actually MBS himself who ordered the killing."
      </p>
      <p>
       The examples you give would likely occur regardless of who was in office; I believe that to be the most appropriate criticism of those two criticisms, and a major contributor to why you may catch flack when opining about the current president. Specificity is key.
      </p>
      <p>
       "What is the current administration doing that would likely not be happening under another administration?" should be the driving question.
      </p>
      <p>
       The back and forth blaming serves to create greater political divisions between left and right, discouraging rational discourse and allowing for the consolidation of power vis a vis the consolidation of the scope of allowable opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing Trump still has going for him, in my eyes, is how upset he seems to make many of the factions that have held power for so long. Maybe it's all an act, or maybe it isn't. No sense in me getting mad at my fellow citizen for something being done by a small group of privileged elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigate everyone, question everything. We're discussing a topic that bleeds through the line between politics and intelligence, two field full of more lies than most others. To rest so comfortably on held opinions or accepted "facts" is a disservice to the practice of attempting an understanding of conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       If she is a scapegoat, she isn't
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       a scapegoat. No one is politics is ALL any one thing or another, and it's precisely because of that that they're able to conduct their business so successfully.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't the type of field in which one should have heroes.

       I’m inclined to believe this is the case. The media essentially gave him 90% of the publicity among the other R candidates.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems as if they pre-scripted this “underdog hero” narrative, contrasting with the “establishment selected villain” that is HRC. His cabinet consists of members of the Bilderberg committee, Goldman Sachs firm bankers/members, even Rothschild assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the social engineers did in fact stage a phony election (as they usually do), couldn’t they have scripted it so a populist underdog who appeared to be against the system wins? Having republican presidents win is a very effective way to quell rebellion and resistance to TPTB. A large part of why people still support Trump is because he is “attacked” by the media, but to me it reeks of reverse psychology to maintain his fake anti establishment appeal among his supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump supporters have been convinced they are “winning”, yet their lives are virtually the same as they were before his presidency.

       I truly don't know which scenario to believe but operate every day with as open a mind as I can. Biggest putsch to claim the opposite would be GA being banned as the Atlantic Council member comes on board Reddit. Uncanny timing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's hints in either direction; could be a war between info/disinfo, or it could be someone is setting the whole stage and anticipating our reactions. I'm inclined to believe there are more than 2 groups at play regardless, and that the majority of them benefit by us arguing amongst ourselves rather than calling out bits of political theater.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would do my name a disservice if I didn't hope for the best in the face of all this shit. I truly believe we're approaching a precipice when it comes to public knowledge of the misdeeds in government that extend beyond the, at times illusory, boundaries between left and right.
