       During the Panthers VS Redskins halftime show, FOX ran an advertisement for "The Scientology Network" and their new show "Inside Scientology".

       Am I crazy for being shocked about this? Since when was FOX or even MSM in general in bed with cults?

       Made me think the same too, but Scientology has plenty of money to throw around and I'm thinking they paid a pretty penny regardless. I'm wondering if they are showing it during all of this weeks games.

       I'm sure they paid plenty, too, but I can't imagine that the NFL wouldn't have preferred to sell the slot to a conventional company. I've also noticed how many slots have been filled by pushing their own shows - that is often a tell that they had slots that didn't sell.

       Why are you assuming when I started caring? I don't watch Superbowl commercials, so I missed that one. This is the first Scientology commercial I've seen (don't have cable and only watch sports but generally channel flip during commercials).
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, no matter how long they've been doing it, and no matter when people first notice, it's still something people should be concerned about.

       Ah, I probably shouldn't assume.

      <p>
       But the Superbowl commercial was early 2010's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should they be concerned? There is enough information online about Scientology to sway an opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get you're concerned for people, but let's be honest with ourselves. This is nothing out of the ordinary, hell even the lowest priced package for Directtv features the Scientology channel. Should be be concerned for any person with DirectTV?

      <p>
       If that's directed towards me, I didn't downvote you. My concern has nothing to do with DirecTV consumers as a whole, but moreso tied in with how a knowingly corrupt "religious" organization can control the airwaves like this. How is this concern trolling? I just wanted to bring it to peoples attention that may not know about it.

       This is fucking hilarious. No surprise coming from Fox News either. To answer your question, yes, the media has advertised for Scientology before, and yes, it was just as hilarious as this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when The Atlantic published an advertisement for Scientology that looked like an article, then their marketing team deleted all of the comments critical of the "article?" After the backlash, they deleted the piece and said "We screwed up."

       In the comments, they clearly censored a lot of negative stuff, and then tried to claim the negative comments were from "fake accounts" as a justification.

        The first thing we try to ascertain quickly is if the posting account is real or not, and I can tell you that in roughly 90% of the negative posts, and roughly 30% of neutral or positive posts, are from what appear to be fake accounts, therefore we don't share them.

       My point is a blatantly obvious cult is running ad spots to millions of people and FOX/NFL/DirecTV and others are enabling it. Specifically FOX, being a conservative network, surprised me. Replying with "Lets google how ad spots work" is adding nothing to the conversation, you're just being insulting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many companies steer clear of making deals with controversial companies, surely you know this right? Companies have pulled ads for much less offenses than running cults.

       Scientology is a registered religion. Fox is not in the business of religious discrimination. You not knowing this doesn't make the topic interesting or controversial. You say it's a cult. It's not universally regarded as such. What is hard to understand about this?

       Scientology being a registered religion is not a valid argument given their legal battle with the IRS and the what let to them being declared as such. Just because the feds bent the knee doesn't make it right or appropriate. The "church" has a history of criminal infiltration into the Federal government. This is a fact.

       I guess Scientology paid for the air time to advertise. I don't think that necessarily means Fox supports them.

       I grew up in the 1970s. Every 5 minutes the Dianetics commercial with the Volcano came on TV. Everyone I knew just ignored it. Nobody I know bought the book or joined Scientology because of it.

       Just want to point out Fox Sports is not Fox News. Parent Company is 21st Century Fox and there is some common ownership and control, but it is an entertainment conglomerate, not a conservative agenda conglomerate. Fox News is just one of their many entertainment arms. Also a buyout by Disney was approved a few months ago, not sure what the status of that merger and acquisition is currently. 21st century also owns major stake in Hulu, Sky TV (UK), the whole 21st century Fox film and television behemoth, etc. Just, in a nutshell, don't confuse the views of entertainment channel Fox News with the actual views of Disney / 21st Century Fox etc. Not the same thing. It's all just business. Scientology pays, they get to show their propaganda, just like politicians, special interest groups, and big pharm. If you disapprove, stop watching.

       It's still all owned by Rupert Murdoch. My OP wasn't about a conservative conglomerate but more about the global reach of FOX in general. I do understand FOX News itself is the leading conservative network.

       Yeah, I completely get that. I could boycott the network, but I love sports too much. I'm weak in that matter, but I do think it's important for people, if they agree or disagree with what they are presented in commercial breaks, to understand the business dealings.
