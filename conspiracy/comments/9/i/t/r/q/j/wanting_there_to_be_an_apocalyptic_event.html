    <div class="md"><p>Not unusual at all. Whatsoever.</p>

<p>If anything I&#39;d call it so common and widespread enough that it continually feeds a phenomena we see just about every year: droves of people falling for - invariably <em>easily</em> debunked - claims to impending disaster promising <strong>dramatic</strong> (as in, full consequences felt within hours/days) disaster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of people have these feelings.  It&#39;s probably why the zombie apocalypse television shows and movies are so popular still.  </p>

<p>The apocalyptic scenario stems from a desire to for change in the established systems and conventions.  And this isn&#39;t new or particular to the modern age.  I&#39;ll refer you to the book of Revelation in the Bible written by a person who belonged to a group under the rule and oppression of the Roman empire.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am an &quot;older&quot; and was certainly was knee-deep in 2012.  Though nothing apocalyptic happened and I was disappointed I now look back and see how we weren&#39;t ready - and it sure seems like we&#39;ve changed exponentially since then.  Things keep coming out of the woodwork and there&#39;s no sign of it stopping: faith in so many revered institutions, our political heroes are corrupt and our celebrity heroes are molesters and public masturbators, politicians show their stripes, religious institutions are garbage, educational systems are mind-control and selling a false bill of goods that can never be redeemed or paid off, the economy is a sham that hoovers wealth upwards and drives towards inequality always, healthcare makes us sick, &quot;healthy&quot; foods make us sicker, science has been co-opted by capitalism, courts are rigged and money driven, and governmental institutions are no longer seen as infallible paragons of justice and dignity - it&#39;s all falling away.  We are on the brink of UFO disclosure.  We are on the brink of NDEs, OBEs, and all of the &#39;weird stuff&#39; being proven correct.  The quantum world is destroying material realism.  Tom Campbell (My Big TOE) just kickstarted the money to do an actual scientific experiment to prove our reality is a virtual simulation.  It&#39;s getting really weird, man.  I&#39;ve got my popcorn at the ready.  Ready for anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I know what you are talking about. Like when you hear some ridiculous doomsday prophecy like &quot;an asteroid will hit earth tomorrow&quot; a part of you feels maybe a little excited. Maybe you think, &quot;cool...I won&#39;t have to go to work&quot; or as others have mentioned it&#39;s a sense of freedom from all the things that might be bogging us down.  Like for me I&#39;m really happy with my life, but when I think about doing this same job or any related job for thirty more years, that doesn&#39;t really sound so appealing. Honestly, I don&#39;t think it should sound appealing to anyone who has worked 40 hours a week for more than say, five or six years.  At some point it&#39;s really fucking hard avoid admitting the harsh truth that this shit just isn&#39;t rewarding. But then again, I have worked with a ton of people who say that they couldn&#39;t handle a life without work. I think they lack imagination. I can think of hundreds of things I would rather be doing. Literally hundreds.  But maybe part of the allure of a doomsday event is that some event might change the way we live on a daily basis where we can pursue things that are more meaningful.  I think Ted Kaczynski&#39;s manifesto, &quot;Industrial Society and its Future&quot; offers some insights into your feelings and what I&#39;m talking about. He talks a lot about how modern life isn&#39;t like anything humans are supposed to experience. All of the &#39;real&#39; trials and tribulations have been removed making it impossible for us to find meaning. His insights on &quot;over socialization&quot; are damn near spot on when you apply them to the left of today and the SJW culture in America. His insights on surrogate activities, the power process, sources of social problems are very interesting to say the least.  I guess his thoughts aren&#39;t too different from Henry David Thoreau&#39;s...But I think &quot;Industrial Society and its Future&quot; talks specifically about what you are talking about when you say &quot;complete freedom&quot;. You would be faced with the real challenges of survival instead of these &#39;surrogate activities&#39; that take the place of our instinctual drives that evolved over millennia.</p>

&quot;For a million years, we’ve watched the sky, and huddled in fear. But somehow you still find yourself quietly rooting for the storm. As if a part of you is tired of waiting, wondering when the world will fall apart—by lot, by fate, by the will of the gods—almost daring them to grant your wish&quot;  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not weird at all.. just look at the amount of disaster, apocalyptic, end of the world movies, tv shows and games.  I think about it because it&#39;s an inevitability that something wipes us out or we do it to ourselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The apocalypse would bring misery and eventual death to you and everyone/everything you care about.  It won&#39;t be romanticized, it won&#39;t be a survival story.  It will be suffering until an eventual end.  If you think you want that... you could probably do with getting some sort of help.</p>
