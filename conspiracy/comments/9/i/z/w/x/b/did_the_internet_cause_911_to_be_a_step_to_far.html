<p>It was likely put together by a bunch of boomers who didn’t think twice about ‘that new fangled internet’ crap.</p>

<p>Little did they know 10 years later there would be hundreds of videos for anyone to see of the attacks and the towers falling. Zoomed in, slo-mo, super analysed, enhanced quality, enhanced audio, interviews from the day being pulled back out into the light.</p>

<p>I bet they thought it would be like all the rest, total control via mainstream media over how often the clips are played, which clips are played and what interviews they show. </p>

<p>Imagine the jfk incident with the same amount of camera angles and footage instead of just one guy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The internet was used by the elite to spread filth like pornography and all kinds of snuff across the globe.  It literally gives children and most people access to material to further demoralize the general population and also acts as a further attack on religion and the typical religious family. </p>

<p>Even though parents try to control the access their kids have to these material it is impossible as there will always be a friend with &#39;cool&#39; parents that don&#39;t care if their kids have access to it.</p>

<p>Then it kind of bit them in the ass as if you look at the general consensus of comments on political stories now compared to 5 years ago...it is flooded with central banks being evil, conspiracies etc.  The internet has really been beneficial by making people question what they see and hear on tv.  </p>

<p>It is no coincidence that some of the Rockefellers have called for censorship of the internet years back and more recently we can see it in full force.</p>

<p>Think about it, why censor everything related to shadow governments and conspiracies but leave really twisted porn...hell porn in general just there for everyone to find.  Now which is more destructive for a young mind? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t there a clip of one of the Rothschilds saying &quot;maybe the Internet wasn&#39;t a good idea&quot;? </p>

<p>I had no &quot;view&quot; at he time, although I though Dubya&#39;s exhortation for people to &quot;get behind their President - don&#39;t want to hear any conspiracy theories&quot; phrase weird (but fairly normal for him, I suppose).</p>

<p>After a few months, I went on the Internet because I wanted to find any info on why the buildings had come down like that - I naively imagined that there had to be a design fault, which would have serious implications worldwide.</p>

<p>My world changed quite a bit when it turned out that the only source af <em>any</em> info on the subject was whatreallyhappened.com</p>

<p>In normal times, there would have been an immediate inquiry by the relevant authorities and, by the time I looked, an interim statement available on the Internet. Nada. That, in itself, was enough for me to realise how badly wrong it all was. </p>

<p>The Internet showed the topography of the whole issue in one evening&#39;s browsing. The clamour of conspiracy theory, the silence of officialdom. Bam!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 2002, it was asking questions rather than telling us a new story. There was a <em>lot</em> of input from external sources and, when it came to trying to find some info rather than no info, that was pretty much all there was. You see the problem? I couldn&#39;t say when Sorcha Faal got involved, but given the earnest &quot;WTF?&quot; atmosphere of the site back then, I presume later.</p>
