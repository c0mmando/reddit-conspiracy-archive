        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok so I keep seeing posts that typically would&#39;ve been ridiculed, dOwNvOtEd, or simply ignored reaching to the top of this sub. All these shit posts are getting a large amount of upvotes. Now I post here infrequently, and have had maybe 2 posts gather any real upvotes. I&#39;ll find them later and link them.</p>

<p>My reason for saying this is I believe the same people who banned r/Q, r/Anon, etc. are trying to AstroTurf this sub into looking like an alt-right hub for the people who were kicked out of the banned subs. I think it&#39;s a strategy for them to use to justify banning this sub by falsely smearing complete crap over us to set up all the ducks in the row for the mighty banhammer.</p>

<p>I know people have said that this sub has gone downhill for awhile now in terms of conspiracy content (too much politics, repeated theories, etc.) I&#39;m not talking about that. I&#39;m talking about posts that link to sites we know for sure someone real here wouldn&#39;t link to. Just my thoughts.</p>

<p>Solidarity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just have a strong feeling that since the round of bans that happened previously, and with this sub being in that &quot;third wave&quot; that possibly they couldn&#39;t outright ban us without having some form of &quot;proof&quot;.

<p>Most people are seeing comments like &quot;this sub is crap, I&#39;m leaving&quot; and are under the suspicion that they&#39;re trying to kill off the organic members in place of these bots. Once enough are replaced and bots can upvote literal shit, boom, ban hammer.</p>

<p>You couldn&#39;t easily dismiss that in many ways this president is very different from others, and is helping make conspiracy theories mainstream. That he&#39;s showing the hand of supposedly neutral public servants, information relayers, and institutions which aren&#39;t <em>merely</em> conspiring against him now, but that have conspired against millions of others, far before he ever decided to run for office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a strategy out of /pol/. The timeline is a little fuzzy but a certain element latched onto Trump when he insisted on being the face of the birther movement - and his distrust of 9/11 was viewed as a signal that he was at least a little bit woke.</p>

<p>You do a few simple conspiracies later, added with the exact circumstances of 2015/16, and boom, you now have conspiracy theorists that should know that the president is obviously just another establishment shill, that he couldn&#39;t have got elected without being one, completely in cognitive dissonance about it.</p>

<p>Alex Jones, I think, is the absolute perfect example of this. Alex Jones was about as anti-right/anti-left as you could possibly get. There were very few men quite as anti-W Bush as him, back in the day. But he latched onto Trump&#39;s audience and went full establishment - bringing a not-insignificant portion of both his normie and more enlightened users with him down the rabbit hole of the political distraction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why, then, does truth generate hatred, and why does thy servant who preaches the truth come to be an enemy to them who also love the happy life, which is nothing else than joy in the truth—unless it be that truth is loved in such a way that those who love something else besides her wish that to be the truth which they do love. Since they are unwilling to be deceived, they are unwilling to be convinced that they have been deceived. Therefore, they hate the truth for the sake of whatever it is that they love in place of the truth. They love truth when she shines on them; and hate her when she rebukes them.</p>

<p>We&#39;re just dicussing the election results. You said the vote was 46% to Clinton&#39;s 48% which is true. I said she won by a slim margin but got decimated county by county (2,626 to 478). That&#39;s also true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russiagate is considered a right-wing conspiracy. The DNC leak is considered a right-wing conspiracy. 2 years ago, these both were popular conspiracies on the left, and you saw this content non-stop on Reddit. Breitbart made the front page of /all a few times, from the /politics sub. The same people who just witnessed the most rigged primary and election in their lifetime, flipped the switch on their opinions on these issues almost overnight. Since that dreaded day in 2016, they have been infesting all subs that are not mainstream center politics. They are trying to attach everything that disagrees with them to Russia or Trump, ideally both. They already control the content of /all. You will not see a pro-Trump, pro-Russia, or  critical peices of the DNC(Even if it&#39;s from the most popular Senator in the country). Reddit is compromised to the point where they can make any illusion they desire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s pretty obviously a pretty awful website. I haven&#39;t looked into its past content but it doesn&#39;t interest me much except as a counterpoint.

<p>Are all the comments and upvotes also a cynical attempt? To do what? It just seems lowest common denominator. I don&#39;t mean that as an insult. It&#39;s just that it&#39;s an easy place to start. Not the site itself but it&#39;s link here on Reddit.</p>

<p>Personally i lean a little more to ancient aliens gods warfare in the heavens and the subtle extra dimensionsal subterfuge to keep us in a spiral of reincarnation to mine gold for the restoration of a distant planets atmosphere, whilst placeholder political figureheads are put up to mislead us into competitive negative consequences so disncarnate entities can suck away our energies. Etc. It&#39;s a little too weird for me to care much what nonsense trump or the alphabets are up to.
It&#39;s a bit hard to drop that stuff into casual conversation or passing Reddit threads. </p>

<p>I think maybe r/conspiracy is a victim of its own success. I&#39;ve not been here long enough to know the past here. General acceptance of mainstream conspiracy theories is growing, it&#39;s popularity makes it more of a target sure.</p>

<p>Tldr: I have difficulty to  differentiate dumb or cynical posts from normal or outlandish anymore. I have to spread out my sources and read between the lines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are at least two groups of people who LARP alt-right/antisemitic stuff to make us look bad. There are fake posts from anti-conspiracy trolls who want something to make fun of us for. Then there are the regular trolls who have no connection to the anti-conspiracy subs. They post here for fun. Two have already been caught red handed. This means there are likely many others who haven&#39;t been caught yet and probably never will get caught. </p>

<p>That isn&#39;t to say that there is no real antisemitism here, but it&#39;s significantly exaggerated and deliberately stupid. They want to prevent other people from taking some of our ideas seriously, and they&#39;re probably just bored at times and have nothing better to do than LARP. </p>

<p>Joshua Ryne Goldberg is an interesting character. He was a Jewish American who wrote neo-nazi articles, posted anti-semitic stuff to Reddit, and a whole bunch of other things. He wrote an article for the Daily Stormer, a neo nazi website, that claimed &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a fertile ground for recruitment.&quot; His alias was Michael Slay. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On online forums Reddit and 4chan, under the name European88, he uploaded thousands of anti-semitic and racist posts as a neo-Nazi, and on the specialty neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer, he his alter-ego Michael Slay did the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the article he wrote for Daily Stormer, which was used by so many people as &quot;proof&quot; this sub is targeted by white supremacists and nazis for recruitment:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/5EBcB">https://archive.is/5EBcB</a></p>

<p>There is another example I am aware of. See <a href="/u/interrogatorybunny">/u/interrogatorybunny</a>. He posted a bunch of obviously racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. But his second post had proof he was actually a former <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> mod &quot;Bipolarbear0.&quot; This is one of his submissions: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/</a></p>

<p>If you see the image he posted, it says right on there &quot;bipolarbear0.&quot; Under his moderator account, he was very anti-conspiracy, but then he posts racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>We as the r/conspiracy users need to stop calling out either as crossposts.

It was her CALLING it a conspiracy... So I don&#39;t know about right wingers making up conspiracies or it is just them claiming it is.   Also if you think any negative thing posted about them are conspiracies  you have never even looked into it.  I&#39;m guessing paula Jones is conspiracy, her 700k settlement , also conspiracy.

I&#39;m saying Clinton was the 1st Pres. to get openly attacked for it(that is the Rs decided that was no longer off the table as a tactic)--dragged into depositions/impeached etc. The Kennedy&#39;s weren&#39;t being attacked like that publicly afaik(born 71 so I wasn&#39;t alive) but it seemed like most of that stuff came out later on--as the press tended to stay away from that stuff back then--until Clinton.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was generally off the table prior to that mostly as a gentleman&#39;s agreement between politicians/press etc. It&#39;s not as if both sides didn&#39;t know it went on--but particularly wrt Presidents it was just something that got a pass(this was covered in the press in the time as well). After the Whitewater stuff they tried turned up a goose egg(mind you this was after years of investigating) they said fk it and went for the sex angle--and opened the door to a bunch of their own going down right after that lol. Things haven&#39;t been the same since(what are we at like 5 this week alone??). Another interesting point as far as draining the swamp goes is how many of the cruddy people involved are still around today working for dt--Something to think about as a lot of people roll their eyes on that one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, lying under oath can get you in jail. </p>

<p>I love how your trying to make it bad repubs being mean to nice ol Bill..</p>

<p>Tell me, if trump said under oath he never banged stormy, would the left go nuts and impeach? And toss money into an (another) investigation and you would support it hands down. </p>

<p>Oh but wait, the door was opened for it so it&#39;s ok now</p>

<p>Take a hint. It&#39;s not ok to break laws, it is ok to have an affair (that&#39;s between him and hildawg)  and she was fine with it. And fine with the others. It&#39;s simple to look into these things but you choose not to. </p>

<p>Before you get into yes I read the trump news that bad too. I also look at the Looney conspiracies posted here. Do you realize he has been looked into more than any other president? I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a bad thing (wish less tax money was used) but they can&#39;t find shit that sticks...  To a 70 something Playboy.   I&#39;m honestly amazed. </p>

<p>Either way guy, this conversation has developed into bill was only in trouble bc the repubs witch hunted. But that&#39;s ok to do now.   This came from my comment about the vast right wing conspiracy about him banging an intern. It was true. It was not a conspiracy against him. The conspiracy was to cover it up.  Do you know what would have happened had he been honest? They wouldn&#39;t be able to do shit and he would have still been pres and everyone would have still known about it as they do, and that lady would have not been paraded in courts and hearings (and a lot of money would have been saved. )</p>

<p>And to counter the point of alt right affiliations, I see toxic people earn a large amount of downvotes and reports/deletions.

The only time I see their ideas gain traction is in obviously brigaded posts/comments and there is a growing sentiment that those are created with the express purpose of trying to undermine this community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely disagree with that first part. </p>

<p>I absolutely agree with the last part. And they’re linked, and the only way to understand the link is to also understand that the democrats are “neo-liberals”. </p>

<p>Guess who benefits from those “big government” (which is kind of an outdated term btw) policies? 9/10 times it’s corporations and banks. See- the 2008 bailout by Obama and the democrats and many republicans. </p>

<p>In fact, the republicans are extremely corporate too. The way I understand American politics is that big money has long hijacked government. Ever heard of Smedly butler? That’s a good starting point for understanding how the government serves corporations. </p>

<p>Both sides fuel the globalist idea of capitalism, which  I detest. Not on the whole “capitalism is baaaad “ kind of way, but because the current idea of business, banks, and the federal reserve is NOT democratic, and has thus been raping the 3rd world, the oceans, and generally the world. I mean, climate change and sea level rising will create billions of refugees across the 1st and 3rd worlds due to coastal cities becoming uninhabitable.</p>

<p>And honestly if the “liberals” were leftists, they’d be fighting for democracy. Instead they fuel CNN, the propaganda outlet, banks, and the military. </p>

<p>Neither of these topics appear much different than the plethora of other conspiracies found here on this sub and elsewhere. Honestly, if you believe 9/11 is a conspiracy (me included) then Q and pizzagate are drops in the ocean. Why would either be so unbelievable that they need to be ridiculed and silenced?</p>

<p>But, here we are. This sub can’t mention Q or pizzagate now because of r/TheBanOut2018 and fear that the entire community will be scrubbed from the internet. </p>

<p>would certainly like to make up their own mind before the topic is censored from view by a very powerful social media platform.</p>

<p>It is <strong>entirely possible</strong> that Q and pizzagate are both true AND false. They could, and likely do, have doses of truth alongside doses of misdirection.</p>

<p>Hypothetically, if pizzagate was proven 100% true but the details of it were <strong>not</strong> that the Clinton foundation was involved, or Podesta, or anything political...would it make it any less of a conspiracy? Would that somehow make potential child abuse OK? No, not really, the truths would come out as true and the lies/misdirection would come out as false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve discussed them. Q was debunked back in august. One of the people behind Q is literally just a livestreamer that wants to be the next Alex Jones. There&#39;s not a whole lot left to discuss - especially when the tactics used for Q are the same used by John Edwards to talk to dead people. Conspiracy theorists were just the dead people in this case.</p>

<p>As far as pizzagate, the entire point is that evidence is outright ignored and focus is shifted to a random pizza shop instead of anywhere productive. The takeaway from pizzagate should have been &#39;oh, look, DC insiders are part of a pedophile ring that includes even the rich and powerful that appear to be unrelated to DC!&#39; Instead it&#39;s &#39;Satanic Democrats are using secret symbols in plain site to traffic kids through a glorified Dave &amp; Busters!&#39;</p>

<p>If any discussion of the pizzagate theory goes off of that last understanding, it is shut down. When pizzagate was up as a subreddit it was exactly as censor heavy as t_d. Anything that wasn&#39;t bashing podesta or the democrats, or pointed out the obvious logistical flaws therein was removed by the mods. The community is still exactly like that over on Voat.</p>

<p>This is disappointing to many people, who have tried to now rebrand the viable pieces of the puzzle as pedogate and include it in larger, more well established lists of evidence - however pizzagaters still want to go on and try to take down those magic democrats while ignoring all evidence it isn&#39;t a partisan conspiracy.</p>

<p>This is the problem. We have had these discussions. We have brought them up. I don&#39;t care, flat out, that the Q subreddits were banned or pizzagate was banned. There is Voat, arguably where the discussion should have been in the first place given the rules of Reddit. I&#39;m not really sad that those conspiracies are mercilessly downvoted here in favor of more interesting ones or ones that are actually productive for a discussion.</p>

<p>Does it seem like censorship from a malicious group of insiders? Yes, but so does everything about every conspiracy community that gets a little bit too cultish.</p>

<p>You need detractors in a conspiracy, otherwise your conspiracy will simply stop being talked about by anyone that recognizes you&#39;re trying to make evidence fit an agenda.</p>

<p>Getting a few thousand people on an internet forum to believe something won&#39;t amount to much more than personal enlightenment (or something).

<p>Conspiracies that have a basis of &#39;look these guys are bad, and it proves our team isn&#39;t&#39; will always be poison for any conspiracy community. There are no teams on conspiracies, only those that know about it and are doing it, those that know about it that shouldn&#39;t, and sheep. Creating new categories or teams only serves to weaken all but the actual people behind the conspiracy. </p>

<p>The whole Bush did 9/11 thing wasn&#39;t &#39;Republicans bad&#39; it was, &#39;Oh hey look, the president is a part of a massive conspiracy network wanting to bring about total control of the American populace.&#39; While surface level people associated &#39;neocons are bad,&#39; like those in power wanted, conspiracy theorists held themselves to a higher standard and looked the entire play as it was presented to us, not just the villain.</p>

<p>Creating a conspiracy about Democrats being bad is like focusing on Draco Malfoy while ignoring Voldemort. Yes it could be an interesting idea, and it should be a topic of discussion for a time, but it should never be the main focus as you lose the meaning of the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that means if a conspiracy is to be easily discredited, by anyone, all they have to do is politicize it. I&#39;d guess that sooner or later if you uncovered the truth of any big conspiracy you would eventually hit an elected democrat or republican figure, even just by probability. If pizzagate uncovered democrats, for whatever reason, then maybe something-else-gate would uncover republicans.</p>

<p>If 9/11 happened in 2018, and a team of democrats investigated the issue because they had reason to suspect that the republican party had something to do with it, and they yelled <em>republicans are bad and here is why!</em> would that warrant banning the topic as politically-charged hate speech from social media platforms?</p>

<p>How would that play be read? I just don&#39;t think we&#39;d be saying &#39;thank you&#39; to Reddit for censoring information, like we are today. I guess that&#39;s my point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While that&#39;s a fine point, it&#39;s moot to pizzagate. We know multiple Republicans are pedophiles - most that have been arrested in the last couple of years (or have had viable claims against them, like the recent republican whose daughter claimed he molested her for ten years.) have been to Comet Ping Pong. There are other leaked emails from multiple GOP sources that show similar code to Podesta.</p>

<p>In short: evidence was directly ignored by the pizzagate community to keep blame on certain individuals they do not like. This isn&#39;t &#39;oh well we only found stuff from this particular party we just happen to have already hated&#39; it&#39;s &#39;there is <strong>only</strong> evidence that this party that we already hated is responsible and guilty, all other evidence is a distraction, a lie, fake news distracting us.&#39; Despite multiple arrests so far showing that both parties clearly have their pedophilia issues.</p>

<p>Trust me when I say, I supported pizzagate, until the community made it clear to anyone on the fence that they were only to go after democrats - no matter what.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a theory about pedophiles anymore, the pedophilia is a backseat, an easy draw to hate a certain political party. That, I think, would be enough to distrust even the apparently legitimate evidence, as it is clear they simply do not care about the truth.</p>

<p>If pizzagate had kept its wings and was able to blow Comet Ping Pong wide open, and everything associated with it, that would be revolutionary. Even if every person who was involved in wrongdoing was democrat it would still be a ginormous and worthy event.</p>

<p>The aftermath, I think, is what we disagree on. Any “win” for the republicans would be short lived as this information would now be widespread and known to the masses. Right now it would take another pizzagate-esque event to reach that possibility again, and it’s taboo to discuss now so we will almost certainly never find out. </p>

<p>I never understood the hate toward Q just as I never understood the hate toward pizzagate, both had their points, counter-points, followers, dissenters, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll give you my point of view just so you know where some people here are coming from. FWIW </p>

<p>There has been a propaganda campaign targeting Americans online for a long time now. The goal is to divide Americans and instill distrust in American institutions in order to destabilize the country and weaken it from within. </p>

<p>Whenever I see Q, pizzagate and the like it&#39;s painfully obvious propaganda in my eyes. That doesn&#39;t mean elite pedophilia doesn&#39;t happen, or there isn&#39;t an area of deep politics that controls the inner workings of America. Or that the CIA and FBI don&#39;t have factions within that are up to nefarious shit. </p>

<p>The red flag with all of those conspiracies is the slant toward the far right. All of them favor the hard right leaning American politicians and never call that side out on anything. As if there aren&#39;t elite GOP donors or even members that fancy underage boys or girls. Or when Q pretends that the GOP is saving the day and righting the ship while both parties are still bending over and taking it in the seat for their corporate masters. </p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s where I think the hate for those topics comes from.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt there is a pattern of politicalization that has been happening since, at least, 2016. I would not argue that.</p>

<p>However, does that mean that a topic of conversation should be removed entirely?
Pizzagate had and still has a following. It is clear that the potential wrongdoers in that narrative were democrats...</p>

<p>Does that mean that we should stop looking into it? If evidence starts to accumulate, but it seems to have some political affiliations, are we to simply turn our heads and forget what we know?</p>

<p>What if the details of pizzagate were 100% true, do you think it likely that the conspiracy community would stop there and say &quot;looks like I&#39;m voting republican!&quot; or is it more likely that the search would continue and that right-wing politicians and establishments would be scrutinized next?</p>

<p>We are not gatekeepers. I have enough faith in my fellow theorist to allow them to form their own opinions, to make those opinions known, and to debate them. If the argument falls apart under scrutiny then it was a weak argument, but if it holds together <em>and is then censored from the internet</em> what are we to believe?</p>

<p>Hell, if not for those very same theorists (who we are seeking to silence) we may not be here, conversing in this sub, today.</p>

<p>Because accusing people of child molestation/rape/sacrifice/whatever the fuck they believe is a very heavy, serious charge.   One that you should never, ever make unless you have direct evidence.  Oddly worded phrases from leaked emails and the faux-cryptic ramblings of a 4chan troll do not count.  Being falsely labeled as someone who harms children can ruin someone&#39;s life.  That&#39;s why there is push back from people who can clearly see how these &quot;conspiracies&quot; are nothing more than a politically motivated witchhunt to demonize the President&#39;s enemies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are my thoughts.</p>

<p>Many conspiracies inevitably converge into the cabal of conspirators is using <a href="/r/neoliberal">/r/neoliberal</a> esque tactics to bring about a &#39;NWO&#39;. Those <em>certainly</em> aren&#39;t the only tactics, but they do seem to be their favorite to utilize ATM.</p>

<p>Conservatives wish to conserve, while progressives wish to change. In the west, the right have vestigial appendage of traditional christian honor and morality. The degree to which someone is right-wing, (yes even left-wingers are) they posses remenants of that in some capacity. </p>

<p>I suspect that the left-wingers <em>without</em> these remnants of traditional morality are more prone to conspiring to enact the chaotic goals they&#39;re predisposed towards, and that that may be in part what you&#39;re seeing.</p>

<p>There&#39;s obviously a negative flip-side though, and that is the danger of people reacting too strongly to the evil neoliberal cabal. That they blindly side with anything propped up to oppose it... that they succumb to weaponized dialectic of problem, reaction, solution.</p>

<p>It is as important to them to control the alternative narrative as it is to control the main stream one. Polluting the waters of places like this can serve them better than just outright eliminating it. </p>

<p>It may not largely impact the ones who have already reached the conclusion that the world is a mess and are able to identify some of the reasons for it (including the manipulation of public perception), but for those first exploring these thoughts, corrupting a starting point place like this could stem a lot of future free thinkers from ever exploring thoughts passed the mainstream narrative. </p>

<p>I think banning this place would be too costly for them. It would be a huge public admittance that Reddit is not the free thought experiment that it once was (it isn’t). When that facade finally fades this place will be entirely abandoned. Until that happens, keep posting! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is nothing BUT moderate views. This sub has been a place for refugees since all the left wing I&#39;s were forced out of /politics in 2016. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Correct the Record’s “Barrier Breakers” project boasts in a press release that it has already “addressed more than 5,000 people that have personally attacked Hillary Clinton on Twitter.” The PAC released this on Thursday.</p>

<p>The PAC was created in May of last year when it was spun off from the American Bridge SuperPAC, which is run by longtime Hillary and Bill Clinton supporter David Brock. Brock also founded the left-wing media watchdog website Media Matters for America.</p>

<p>Some Bernie Sanders-supporting users on Reddit already started to notice the changes on Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>“This explains why my inbox turned to cancer on Tuesday,” wrote user OKarizee. “Been a member of reddit for almost 4 years and never experienced anything like it. In fact, in all my years on the internet I’ve never experienced anything like it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This never changed, people were forced out, many came here, and now about a year after politics content I am seeing the exact repeat of the scenario. &quot;Correct the Record&quot; never ended, it just got rebranded into one of the many media relations/PR firms available for hire and anonymously. 
Conspiracy has been a melting pot of ideas. It was at one point in time the few places I could talk to folks who leaned right and actually find common goals and passions. These moderate comments you&#39;re referring to are massively overrepresented on Reddit. Millennials are the least likely demographic to have moderate views, yet they&#39;re the supermajority representation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, no one was forced out.
r/conspiracy isnt supposed to be a safe space for the alt-right.  </p>

<p>its a sub dedicated to discussing conspiracies, its supposed to be non partisan.  </p>

<p>moderate views are the norm, opinions of people on the far left and far right are in the minority...and their presence online reflects that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Millennials are the least likely demographic to have moderate views</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol</p>

<p>millennials typically have moderate views, do you know what moderate means?  center left or center right.</p>

<p>and if you want to talk about millennials, the majority of them are half retarded, you look at any survey of their political ideology they hold conflicting opinions, some are flat out nonsensical.  they want healthcare, education, social programs, but they want small government, low taxes, ect.  you look at any large sampling of the group and they dont understand basic economics or the very basic functions of government.</p>

<p>they are a generation that wasnt taught critical thinking in school, they didnt learn fundamental principles of logic.  they just barf up whatever the last person they thought sounded smart told them.</p>

<p>if you want a safe space, there are conservative subs for you to hang out in, there are other social media sites for you to spend your time on.  im sorry you think that r/politics shouldnt be a place where your ideology is put into question and picked apart.  because thats what people do there.  r/conspiracy is a conspiracy sub for people to discuss conspiracies, it wasnt supposed to be an echo chamber or safe space for the right.  its not your refuge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this whole “you’re either a corporate democrat or a neo-Nazi” dichotomy is killing me.</p>

<p>Maybe if we cut the shit with all the name calling, and actually starting rewarding thoughtful posts and (hold on to your horses) CONSPIRACY talking posts, we’d get somewhere.</p>

<p>But reddit isn’t the best platform, no Internet forum is. So what I’m saying is none of this is a big deal, it’s just the idiots who are always louder. Best you can do is sift through the shit, and set the example you want to see.</p>

<p>You’re transparent and visible to everyone that is worth something here and will survive past the brigading from companies like media matter inflict here to try and control the narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>by alt-right content i mean articles that make the rounds on alt-right and hate group websites, then get posted to r/conspiracy to push a narrative.  </p>

<p>like the article about the 70 year old woman who made was charged with a crime for making a facebook post that said immigrants shit in the street and burn cars.  the website that was linked to r/conspiracy is a known far-right site that pushes racist, anti-immigrant and sexist content.</p>

<p>there was no conspiracy, she violated a hate crime law, so she was charged with a hate crime law.</p>

<p>or the many posts about a specific immigrant or minority committing a violent act.  theres no conspiracy, but the articles all make the rounds on the white nationalist sites, hate sites, racist subs of voat, alt-right media before ending up here.</p>

<p>it gets posted here to push a political narrative.  one that is most of the time racist and bigoted.</p>

<p>i am being transparent, its you who are being deceptive.  im not brigading anything.  you want this sub to be another racist hate filled forum for the alt-right.</p>

<p>whats hilarious about this is, the more you push for that, the more likely the sub will be banned.  not because there are people plotting against you, but because reddit is a company whos primary goal is profit.  allowing a popular sub to become a conduit for racism and hate doesnt translate to money, advertisers shy away from being associated with content people find objectionable.</p>
