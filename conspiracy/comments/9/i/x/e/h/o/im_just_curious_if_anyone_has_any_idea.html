    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I am afraid to say almost nobody cares. We can’t explain 99% of our existence but nobody cares. So clearly we behave without perceiving anything that’s bigger than us.</p>

<p>The good thing is that our generation has a lot of science compared to, say, 500 years ago. I respect a lot scientists who show us the universe and so on. I am glad we know what universe means or looks like (sort of...).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m actually quite the opposite. I cant division nothingness and until anyone can kind of articulate what nothingness is to me ,I don’t really believe in it. Because even consciousness floating in a black void is still something or even no consciousness. There is still an empty void of space which to me is still something. I think this entire universe is just a playground. One of many. When you die you go back to source or what I like to call “spectator mode“. I like to use a lot of video game analogies to explain my understanding of the universe. I feel we just create any reality we want and then shoot through into a body and experience it. It just seems like forever because were in the simulation but really it’s just a blink of an eye. You just live an infinite amount of lives forever. Might be on another each dimension or whatever but you’re still doing something. Maybe a constant pattern of learning and forgetting is what keeps it all interesting. We’re souls with temporary amnesia. But sometimes a little bit of your past existence or something can break through. Kind of explains why some people can take severe blows to the head and then be a completely different person. Some get good at sculpting or art or are really smart at math out of nowhere. Really weird shit. I don’t know the answer to all of this but this is really really weird, whatever this is. </p>

<p>Perhaps that&#39;s because we never fully share our mothers&#39; blood supply while in the womb? The fertilized eggs of every other mammal fully embeds itself within the endometrium, but our don&#39;t. Probably because our hyperactive ovaries cranking out fresh eggs constantly don&#39;t really have time to recover in between cycles. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve evolved in the light of the moon, but we belong in the sun. That&#39;s why the ancient Indian practices are undertaken with the goal of &quot;removing your soul from the reincarnation cycle&quot;. The idea is to be reborn in paradise, which means anywhere but here - someplace with no moon. Then life would be perfect, as it should be, yet we have no idea what that really means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to feel this way too, but there is something about a singular source and all of us being of that same source that I find insanely conforting.</p>

<p>I will never have kids. This used to upset me, not just because expected to be a mom someday but because once I die, that&#39;s it. I leave no children in my wake. I will be quickly forgotten.</p>

<p>Then I stumbled into the consciousness sub and read some posts about singularity that not only clicked but made me feel really happy and safe. It doesn&#39;t matter that I will be quickly forgotten. It doesn&#39;t matter that my genes end right here with me. I am still and will always be a part of everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you mean... but I don’t value comfort too much. Sure, it may be comforting to think that way but I think knowledge and an actual understanding of our situation is more important.... IMO. However, we clearly don’t know wtf we are here for... or what “here” even is. I don’t think its for us to know if i’m completely honest. We all share one common thing, this situation, and by being sympathetic to this deep seated incertainty a lot of problems could be solved.</p>

<p>In a sense we all are a singular entity. Our molecules are never really destroyed they just change into other things. The things we consume become something else when they leave us.</p>

<p>I will probably never have kids either, only because I don’t know what life even is. Who am I to bring a life into a world I do not understand. Being forgotten is meh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I consider myself a Christian although a lot of Christians would not. I had a dream once or twice where I encountered God and got to ask him everything. He basically told me there are things the living are allowed to know and somethings I wouldn&#39;t be allowed to remember. I asked him to give me as much as I was allowed to bring back.</p>

<p>Long story short God created a companion being, he is what the Hindu people call Braman. Somehow Braman did something very minor that was a sin or a shame but was ultimately forgivable. Instead of owning up to it Braman fractured himself into a billion trillion million peices each peice blaming others for the sin.</p>

<p>This fracture was the big bang, the creation of the multiverse. The history of the world since then is God asking each peice of Braman to accept forgiveness and join him. It&#39;s very hard to do, both pride and shame alienate us from perfection.</p>

<p>The darkest parts of Braman became what we call demons, they move throughout the multiverse trying to drag us down like crabs in a bucket drag each other down. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter really, time is a bubble, it didn&#39;t exist before this, it won&#39;t exist after this. To God it has already ended. The souls that would accept forgiveness have already done so and joined God in Heaven, those who just refused forgiveness unconditionally are lost and gone. We only perceive time because we separated ourselves from eternity but over many lifetimes most of us will rejoin it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve shared this a few times. I&#39;ve got some praise, some criticism, been called crazy a few times. I just know what I dreamed. Anyway, the day after this dream I had a friend send me a link to r/holofractal </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is substantial evidence that this world derives energy from fear based emotions. The governmental hierarchies and constructed systems of enslavement and control are not in the best interest of either the human species or the planet, therefore they must be serving an intelligence that values only physical human existence but not life itself. What is allowed to occur and the excuses combined with selective reasoning makes it very likely that this planet is a matrix like energy extraction device for some kind of extraterrestrial or exradimensional lifeform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s often enticing to get caught up in the metaphysics instead of deeply probing into the very real journey and the people we encounter in it. This constant search for a meaningful way to understand everything, some overarching worldview that perfectly ties together every mystery and answers every question. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent a not-insignificant amount of time on that search for meaning, and I would say it&#39;s been worth it, all things considered, yet it can become an exercise in over-intellectualizing. </p>
