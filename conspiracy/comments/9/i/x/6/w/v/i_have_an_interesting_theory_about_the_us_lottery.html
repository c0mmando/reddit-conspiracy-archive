       whenever you see lottery you might be tempted to get tickets and try you luck at winning millions. What if these lottery companies(Mega Millions,PowerBall) purposely have no winning ticket. what I mean by that is when you pick your own numbers you go up to the counter they have to put the numbers into the machine and print out the ticket. similarly to when picking random numbers. once they have the number of tickets they pick a number combination that no one will have so more people would buy more tickets. That would explain why in recent years the top prize will surpass 300 million often. the higher the Jackpot is the more tickets that they would sell.

Two winners.
One was a rich cunt already.

       It’s all faked. Only occasionally they will let an actual normal person will win. You know, to give the others a bit of false hope.

       Typically people with wealth, and wealth management know it’s a poor investment, even at $2 a ticket.  They laugh at people that buy lottery tickets, they don’t fucking buy them.

       a rich person knows $2 to win $100+ million is a fantastic "investment" and if you dont win its only $2. Rich people also know that spending $100+ twice weekly doesnt increase your odds any and dont do that unlike some of the poor that you hear about being dumbasses and going broke on the lottery. Its in no way rigged just because a rich person happens to win it, nor is is a sign of it being rigged because a rich person refuses to spend pocket change on it.

       I actually have a pretty good run of them.  I only buy one if I happen to get gas in a state which sells them and maybe have bought 50 $1 scratch offs in the last ten years.  I have won the $20 “jackpot” probably 1 in 5 times by sheer chance.  So I guess that my method is a sound one.

       I owed a guy $2000 for helping me on a job and only had $200 because I had not been paid for the job yet and had invested all of my money on materials to do the job. He needed to get paid asap so I went to the casino and played  roulette for the first time in my life. In an hour I had $5,000 then lost $300 in 10 minutes, I cashed out with $4,700 and have never been back. Saved my reputation and probably my business because I did not get paid for that job for another 3 weeks.

       Lottery tickets sells themselves. The odds are naturally low enough for them to occasionally reach absurd prize values.

       That said, there have been people who have cheated the system.

       tickets are sold up to an hour before the drawing, youre suggesting that they collate EVERY possible number combination sold, determine which number combos will be losers across the country, rig up the air machine/selector, in under an hours time?
      </p>
      <p>
       Theoretically it could be POSSIBLE I guess but Id believe with the lottery going on for 35 years now, the truth would have came out by now

       In all seriousness though it can be rigged and we do have examples of it being so.

       Granted that example was in Serbia.

       I honestly think the lotto is just another tax on the poor and working class. It's voluntary but still a "tax" nonetheless. Best bet it to go with scratch offs but don't get too carried away. Realistically, the majority of people would blow their winnings if they ever won it big anyways. Talk about a double kick in the nuts to win millions and end up poor again.

       I seem to remember being told it was an hour the last time I tried to buy a ticket to late, but if that is the case then it makes it even far more improbable because there is simply no way to gather all info and rig the machines before live tv airs the picks in 5 minutes

       jackpots have gotten bigger because the price of tickets have gone up as well as the chance of winning numbers being picked going down.
      </p>
      <p>
       powerball increased their ticket price to $2 per ticket a while back but also added 10 more numbers to the drawing.
      </p>
      <p>
       more losers paying more per ticket = larger jackpots rolling over to the next drawing.

       I always thought this too. The Powerball and all that shit is just a huge waste of money. It’s one thing to buy a ticket every once in a great while. But if you’re buying tickets every weekend or whenever there’s a Powerball, yeah you’re being fooled. Same thing goes for a lot of charities. Just more money going into the powers that be’s pockets.

       You are being fooled worse to buy the tickets when the jackpot is high.  When it's high everyone is buying a ticket meaning you are more likely to split the prize several ways.  When it's not crazy high you still have the same small chances to winning but you are more likely to walk away with it all rather than splitting.

       My theory on the scratch offs has been, they put the big jackpot winners in the middle of nowhere. They put the little winners in the cities where the population is higher.

        The trick is to buy them at Hindu stores on the outskirts of largely populated areas and only buy the first 3 tickets or the last 3 tickets. Only play when the scratch games have just been released within the first 3 days of the new games. these are pics from one year alone. I've won up to $2,500 using this method. 
good luck.

       I think the lotto is an off gassing system for a terribly unequal distribution of weath.  Plop 500mil on some random dude and it will pose no threat to power brokers because they will have no idea what to do with it.

       I would guess that the desperation/wish-fulfillment economics are a very big part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And quite often the people who win big jackpots wind up dead broke.  You never hear about someone winning $500 million and using it as seed money to start a political movement or advocate for changing some law.

       In theory they could be rigged since all numbers are  put in a computer be fire the draw. The purchase cutoff time also helps this theory since the main one can poll the other computers and they can then select the winning numbers at will. Once the que is full it will pick a jackpot winning number at random. This us extremely possible with the Powerball machine which could have an array of balls released by solenoids hidden in the ball path as the numbers in the bowl move too fast to accurately identify both the numbers left or the count present. Plausable.

       That's why they call it a poor mans tax. People have no business wasting money on the lotto, but, they have that thought if I win ill be okay.
