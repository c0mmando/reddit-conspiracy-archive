<p>I&#39;m not Trump supporter, but peace talk is better than ongoing missile threat like some months ago.</p>

<p>Also it&#39;s better than WWIII.</p>

<p>It&#39;s true that Trump seems to be clinging to peace talk with NK because he is politically threatened, but maybe it&#39;s other way round.</p>

<p>I started to get this feeling that elites don&#39;t want peace in North Korea. As much as they don&#39;t want peace in middle-east.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not idiot to believe Kim would give up the nukes, but still what&#39;s the point of eliminating Trump in the middle of long term peace talk?</p>

They’ll manipulate it however they need to, there is no accountability system where we The American people make sure that it’s a fair process. Trump isn’t fighting the 1%, he’s a part of them just like Hillary and they’re laughing over the fact that we’re all so divided by them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t attack anyone who says different opinions, I&#39;m just afraid that nowadays anyone who says any good thing about Trump instantly becomes the public enemy. </p>

<p>In my opinion Obama didn&#39;t do ANYTHING about NK and world peace. They are all same coin with different side, but Trump looks more uncontrollable than previous presidents.</p>

<p>It looks like Trump is too focused on his own urge for fame and money, maybe he is avoiding elites now. (purely just my speculation)</p>

<p>Again it&#39;s my personal speculation, but elites might have thought they could manipulate Trump but he went for his own fame and fun, now elites seems like planning to eliminate him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Trumps a shitty person but that doesn’t mean that I think the same of his followers. There are shitty people in both parties. </p>

<p>That’s what’s wrong with politics nowadays, everyone attacks each other and can’t have a civilized conversation. I think it’s all part of the ploy, the two party system plays us all and creates hate.</p>

<p>Obama did nothing with NK, it was a very big problem. However I think Trump is getting much more praise for NK than he should be, President Moon and other countries have put much more weight on them as of recent and the media seems to ignore that fact. I believe Trump has done right for America in some ways but can’t help but feel the country is more divided than ever and that he is helping with that plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Likewise, it&#39;s rare that I hear civilized reply if I ever point out that Obama didn&#39;t do anything much in his presidency and Trump did some good thing to give credit......then I get attacked to no end. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad we can have civilized conversation.</p>

<p>And yes it&#39;s true that Trump is getting all the credit, it&#39;s unfair. He is definitely doing this for his own political gains and fame, he wanna receive Nobel prize. We can agree that Trump is not ideal president, just much better than we dreaded, but still selfish and egoistic.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t understand why everyone wanna eliminate him while he is having peace talk first time in decade. </p>

<p>Bill Clinton got attacked non-stop since before he was even inaugurated.  NBC wasn&#39;t liberal in the 1990s, they were owned by GE and were considered the &quot;right-wing network&quot; before there was a Fox News.  Then Clinton got impeached amid demands for his resignation &amp; years of endless &quot;Special Prosecutor&quot; investigations.  Trump is not the first to get this treatment.</p>

So what if Trump&#39;s getting treated exactly like Bill Clinton got treated in the 1990s, somehow one&#39;s a victim and the less wealthy one is &quot;Elite.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Likewise, it&#39;s rare that I hear civilized reply if I ever point out that Obama didn&#39;t do anything much in his presidency and Trump did some good thing to give credit......then I get attacked to no end. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad we can have civilized conversation.</p>

<p>And yes it&#39;s true that Trump is getting all the credit, it&#39;s unfair. He is definitely doing this for his own political gains and fame, he wanna receive Nobel prize. We can agree that Trump is not ideal president, just much better than we dreaded, but still selfish and egoistic.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t understand why everyone wanna eliminate him while he is having peace talk first time in decade. </p>
