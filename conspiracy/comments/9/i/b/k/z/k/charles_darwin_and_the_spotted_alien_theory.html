        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Imagine you&#39;re a space-faring scientist and you land on a planet that looks just like Earth. You cleverly conceal your ship after landing and begin your business of meeting the planet&#39;s inhabitants and helping them in any way that you possibly can. Before long, you run into someone that looks just like us, except they have spots. If we were on Earth, you might say they have full-blown psoriasis, but we&#39;re not, so you don&#39;t. You just record in the ship&#39;s log what they look like, and since you can&#39;t communicate with them, you assume you are looking at normal, healthy alien skin.</p>

<p>Since you&#39;re a scientist and all, you set about learning as much as you can about the biology of these beings because well, that&#39;s just what you do. Plus, you’re already here. How long would it take you to discover the subject you were studying is not healthy? You have no idea what their skin temperature should be, and you can only see shades of grey, so as far as you&#39;re concerned, the being simply has spots.</p>

<p>But what if the entire population of the planet had spots? Once your machine deciphers their languages, it begins talking to different people on your behalf and you discover that yes, it&#39;s perfectly normal for people to have skin like that in this part of the solar system. They blame the sun and that&#39;s all anybody will say about it.</p>

<p>You decide to look deeper, since you&#39;re a scientist and all, plus you&#39;re already here. You start by researching other species of animals on this planet, by observing how the sun affects them, and before long you realize that those spots on all your new friends can&#39;t possibly be considered healthy, no matter how you look at it. </p>

<p>You present your scientific findings to the imaginary-planet-equivalent of the UN, and they thank you profusely, then on the way back to your spaceship after the meeting, a hellfire missile destroys your taxi and the surrounding six city blocks.</p>

<p>Back on your home world, they erect a monument in your honor, before launching the tactical response teams.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Would alien visitors to Earth be able to tell whether or not humanity was being manipulated by an outside force? Of course they would, but how would they respond to such a discovery? They would either try to help us escape it, or they would take advantage of the situation. Let’s face it – we’re not expecting go-go dancers from Venus or little green men from Mars anymore – we’re on the look-out for super-intelligent, interstellar travelers. If there actually are beings out there who can collapse the space between stars, they won’t have any more trouble recognizing the difference between sickness and health than the difference between right and wrong. Between day and night. Between good and evil, or between the sun and moon.</p>

<p>Since we don’t have anything to compare it to, all we can say about the moon is that “it is what it is” – which isn’t saying very much at all. It’s not alive like the Earth, and it’s not on fire like the sun – it’s something else altogether, and that makes it really hard to see. It is The Shadow, it is The Darkness, and it appears to be exactly the same size as the sun when viewed from Earth, which gives it the appearance an exact copy, and copies are something the ancient Gnostics clearly warned us about.</p>

<p>It’s important to limit our consideration of celestial objects to the ones that matter most. The sun literally creates matter when it grows a seed weighing only a few milligrams into a thousand-ton-tree. There may be stars and planets out there that have a physical influence on the Earth and its inhabitants, but none of them contribute to real-world matters as forcefully as the sun and moon.</p>

<p>Earth travels around the sun because that’s where all our energy comes from. All life requires energy, and Earth is definitely alive. We could say the sun is alive too, or we could say it’s the source of life which are both pretty much saying the same thing. If we’re going to really try to understand the world around us, we need to begin by considering its most fundamental parts. The relationship between the Earth and sun is a natural starting point. Plato thought so, too. He clearly equated the sun with goodness.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Good">https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Good</a></p>

<p>Sure, it can burn you to death if you’re not careful, but that’s only because too much of a good thing negates its objective goodness. Our skin doesn’t burn because the sun changes, it burns because our activity changes. The sun remains good no matter what we do. All plant and animal life depends on it, even those who live in the dark, for they consume other life which relies on the light of the sun.</p>

<p>Space-travelling aliens would know this. But, what could we expect them to know about the moon? </p>

<p>We’ve been taught that moons are very common and that they always face the host planet perpetually because of tidal forces on planets that don’t even have any oceans - never mind any fucking tides. We believe that Mars’ ‘moons’ are pretty much the same thing as Earth’s moon even though Mars’ ‘moons’ are only 12 miles across on average while ours is over 2,000 miles across. (I can’t even make an effective graphic to scale with all five objects because although Mars isn’t much smaller than Earth, Phobos and Deimos are so tiny that they’re invisible.) </p>

<p>Failure to distinguish the difference between the ‘moons of Mars’ and the scourge of Earth is just like ignoring the difference between a kayak so far away that we can barely see it, and a battleship anchored right fucking here. </p>

<p>Astronomers have been selling Mars&#39;Mini-Moons ever since the late nineteenth century, and greater men than us have gobbled them up thinking they were getting a legitimate moon for the money. Charles Darwin was one of these purposely misguided souls. He wrote something along the lines of “Well now. Since astronomers have discovered moons orbiting Mars, just like ours, it’s safe to assume that having a moon or moons is well, just another part of nature&#39;s grand scheme. Metaphorically speaking, our moon is clearly the third part of ‘the holy trinity’, and therefore they must be common to all live (and formerly living) planets, regardless of where they are found.&quot;</p>

<p>I’m here to tell you it’s not safe to assume that. It’s not safe at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The chicken analogy pretty much fits, but it&#39;s not a natural process, so I&#39;m very careful with that &quot;as above so below&quot; mantra.

The sky is messed up, so Earth is messed up, but that doesn&#39;t mean the mess is nature&#39;s design. Humanity can do some serious damage at this point in time.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are a bit misguided, understandably. </p>

<p>In my opinion Life or in a better word is concioussness/experience is like the universe viewing itself through a microscope. When you attempt to focus a microscope with the &quot;wrong&quot; level of magnification things turn out very blurry but when you are perfectly in tune things become very clear. 
What is blurry and chaotic on one level becomes completely clear and beautiful once focused properly. </p>

<p>This is the property of the universe. Think about just inside of your own body there a thousands if not millions of different wars going on keeping yourself healthy and on the whole your body is something completely beautiful and perfect in a sense.</p>

<p>In the same way every war or violence or &quot;damage&quot; that occurs is part of the natural process that occurs and that is chaotic or &quot;death&quot; on one level is actually beautiful and giving life on another level. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make war desirable. I didn&#39;t agree to fight off biological enemies, they attacked me and I&#39;m defending myself. Where is the beauty in that?</p>

<p>Just because we kill and eat other animals, doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re supposed to, according to nature&#39;s plan. We&#39;re so far gone from nature that we can&#39;t even imagine it, so we embrace our circumstances. We select for this exact quality when domesticating wild animals.</p>

<p>Paradise lost appears in ancient mythologies from all over the world. It&#39;s not unreasonable to believe there was a time before the period. There must have been a time before the moon. How could the primitive ancestors of man possibly have evaded predators like two-foot mosquitoes and saber-toothed tigers long enough to evolve into what we are now if half of us were bleeding one-forth of the time?</p>

<p>You seem to have enough clarity of thought to explain the pathology of perspective - why can&#39;t you accept truth for what it is? Because it&#39;s easier to believe we&#39;re supposed to suffer, than to accept the fact that we&#39;re under attack?</p>

<p>Call me crazy if you like, but not misguided. The whole world is misguided - I&#39;m trying to get it back track. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The moon is an artificial parasite upon our living Earth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and no. Mostly yes though. Actually, you nailed it. Except</p>

<p>The word artificial implies that an entity separate from the moon created it for a purpose, and we have no way of knowing if that&#39;s the case. I prefer to use the word unnatural because we can easily equate nature with Earth, which automatically equates nature with the sun. The moon is something else, so I would just say it&#39;s not part of nature, and I&#39;d say it with confidence after studying the effects it has on Earth&#39;s flora and fauna and people. It may have come into being through what we might call natural causes, but since the nature of the moon is directly at odds with the nature of Earth, I believe this distinction is important.</p>

<p>Parasites are defined by their behavior, not by their structure. Whether it&#39;s just an inert collection of rock, dust and metal or it&#39;s some kind of freaky fucking life form that we can&#39;t possibly understand is irrelevant. The moon behaves like a parasite, so it&#39;s reasonable to treat it like a parasite.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t we?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just gave me a thought:</p>

<p>What if humanity existed on Earth at the same time that we existed on Mars? Earth had a moon, but Mars didn&#39;t. The people of Earth would have been complete bad-asses compared to the people of Mars. That&#39;s exactly what the moon does - it causes a stressful condition that requires each of us to fight if we want to survive. If the people of Mars never had to deal with such stress, they would have been living in conditions similar to those in the metaphorical garden of Eden, which would have allowed them to remain soft - the way humans are supposed to be. </p>

<p>I wonder if ancient earthlings are responsible for the destruction of Mars?</p>

<p>Regardless what country we live in, we are ovulating constantly, and wasting a shit-ton of life energy in the process.

    <div class="md"><p>There is no link that explains the effect of celestial light on human reproductive hormones. Most official descriptions of human ovulation begin with menstruation, which is silly because that&#39;s the end of the process. It begins with celestial light and there should be only one significant source.   Time before the moon would have been the source of the garden of eden stories

It just &#39;happens&#39; to occur every 28 days, which is synchronous with the moon. Anyone who thinks that&#39;s just a coincidence is deluding themselves. </p>

<p>smoke and mirrors</p>

<p>That phrase actually relates to the moon, whether it&#39;s creators knew it or not. Earth&#39;s atmosphere is the smoke, and the moon itself is the mirror. The result is the illusion of change.</p>

<p>The moon never changes as far as we&#39;re concerned, and that alone should freak us out. The PTB invented the idea of phases and super-moons and blood moons just to create the illusion of change where it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
