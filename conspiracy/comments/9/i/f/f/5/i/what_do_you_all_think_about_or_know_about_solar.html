    <div class="md"><p>Hey ! When you create a debate / question about something, it&#39;s always important to explain a bit about a topic :   </p>

<p>- What is solar Warden<br/>
- few sources about it</p>

<p>- Your opinion</p>

<p>- A quick conclusion leaving opening questions for us to participate.  </p>

<p>Just Writing &quot;Solar Warden&quot; doesn&#39;t help and a &quot;Well look on your search engine&quot; Is definitely not a constructive answer.  </p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This demands government competency over a great period of time - and an absurdly vast stretch of space (think a fly - or swarm of flies - patrolling the state of New York) - with little-to-no monetary gain: for what, &quot;the good of Humanity and the protection of Home&quot;`?</p>

<p>Any organization capable of pulling a Solar Warden would be rich/powerful enough to simply drop the charade. The notion strikes me as absurd when we live in a world where the government fudged intelligence so it could invade and profiteer off of <em>Iraq..</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that things like these go far beyond government. There&#39;s an idea that there&#39;s a breakaway civilization for the super elite. These elite got their hands on some next gen tech (namely Tesla&#39;s schematics and papers and have been working on ufo (disc) shaped craft for awhile now. I just posted in conspiracies about this but a guy was working on the idea of &#39;electrogravitics&#39; since the 20&#39;s. He used high voltage high frequency electricity on disc shaped objects and was able to produce lift. 
So basically super elite families got together because they hate poor people and don&#39;t want to live around them. They started a secret society where they don&#39;t have to deal with crack heads, rapists, and just overall dirty people which part of me is on their side on that.. Under top secret compartmentalized projects where the workers are told their entire family tree will be slaughtered I think it wouldn&#39;t be that difficult to keep secret. Also if they do leak it they&#39;ll just make the whistle blower look insane or stupid and just make fun of the situation  hiding shit right in the open.
Fun fact: Donald Trump&#39;s father led the group that came in and confiscated all of Tesla&#39;s documents when he died. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The claims in Solar Warden goes FAR beyond next gen. This - the manufacturing and running of a space fleet capable of quite literally patrolling and controlling <strong>an entire solar system</strong> - is high-tier science fiction levels of ability. I seriously have to reiterate to the utmost:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any organization capable of pulling a Solar Warden would be rich/powerful enough to simply drop the charade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the &quot;theory&quot; is half a century old and considering where we are technologically today - AI, automation, gene therapy - I&#39;d say that, unless we argue some arbitrary cultural stagnation, the conspiracy would have progressed technologically to where they have no need whatsoever for workers: much less ones  you need to threaten. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They started a...society where they don&#39;t have to deal with crack heads, rapists, and just overall dirty people </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rich largely already have this. Ignoring that, we go by that angle on the theory as true: why would such an overwhelmingly powerful organization not <strong><em>simply cleanse Earth of the &quot;filth&quot; and rule it in elite bliss</em></strong> rather than <strong>abandon the planet to junk around on cramped space ships/stations</strong>?</p>

<p>Even under those terms you will have someone that will talk.</p>

<p>The secret space program is either more advanced satelites for spying or covert weapons in the sky. Surveillance is more likely.</p>

<p>If people were in space a whole new medical school  would have to be taught treating symptons steming from radiation not seen by those effected in same way on Earth. Artificial gravity doesn&#39;t even exist on the Intl&#39; space station.</p>

<p>Just like the NSA, the gov&#39;t can and will build and operate a program unbeknownst to the general world populous. It is entirely plausible that the Space Force has been in operation for decades ,maybe even under the code name, Solar Warden. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need raw materials and a place to launch it into space. A space program hidden for decades. Yeah right.
Im skeptical about the value of Tesla&#39;s research. It is just ideas on paper. </p>

<p>Documents gave been leaked before about advanced propulsion systems in the past that were from tbe 60s. </p>

<p>After reading them it just appeared to be bold ideas, things to look into and begging for DOD money grants to keep a job and no committment to find actionable technology. Get paid well only to fail at getting results. If successful then great but failure rewarded too. Just scientists making shit up on paper and getting funds to test the idea. Rinse and Repeat.</p>

<p>Alex Jones talks about break away civilization among elites and hoarding technology. 
The elites are still on Earth. So clearly whatever tech they have hoarded isnt getting them to be interstellar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I give it a 15% probability of existing. It&#39;s that low because I need more proof that UFOs--which of course exist--aren&#39;t just advanced tech military crafts of various countries here on earth.

<p>The other negating factors are that we know the govt has openly (or at least, declassifyingly) stated their intentions to use aliens as a psyop--Project Bluebeam, etc.</p>
