       There highly advanced civilizations in pre history practicing world wide forms of religion/technology/etc. When the floods/cataclysm hit, few survived and the remaining knowledge keepers spread out all over the world with their "bags" of knowledge aka Viracocha in South America to spread to the reemerging cultures of the world.

       All of them. The guy does no fieldwork or laboratory work himself. He takes other people's data and misrepresents it to support his narratives. He preys upon those who don't think criticality and want to believe in cover-ups, conspiracy, and suppression of knowledge.

       That's not what I said. I said you have to follow the scientific method. There is no "common narrative". We don't all meet up at conferences or send out newsletters to hash out what we should believe or what we should tell the public. In fact, the opposite is true. There are disagreements all the time in archaeology, but those disagreements are based on available evidence. New evidence either fits existing theoretical models or it breaks those models. If the model is broken then a new theoretical model needs to be put forth to explain both the new and old evidence. These models are rooted in reality. They are drawn from ethnographic works, history, sociology, and psychology. There is room to develop models, but there are also constraints. While this renders most models as mundane leaving out the fantastical (i.e. pre-Ice Age civilizations), these models are, however, testable in that an archaeologist can excavate a different site, gather different data, and have the same model explain that data than any other model or explanation.

       That's archaeology.

       no. i am not. i am insisting that there is a schism within the scientific community, itself. i am defending the idea that having a panel of people deciding what the timeline is may be corrupted. i am saying outright that there are naturally occuring phenomenon that can corrupt carbon dating which ISNT being factored into our timeline. this is not about you. or him. this is about the scientific foundation,itself, being cracked and most "scientists" glossing over this fact.

       Do you know the difference between a narrative and a method? It seems like you don't. And you also don't seem to know the history of change in archaeology. If you did, you would know we are no longer rooted in the culture-history model of the 19th century (where we would be if people "followed the narrative or were labeled unscientific")

       That is largely a perception bias based on unfamiliarity with the field. I don't disagree with you that there are always older archaeologists who hold on to outdated models and ideas. Unfortunately, sometimes they are in positions of power. However, I would disagree with you in your suggestion that other archaeologists are seeking new answers to ancient questions. They are simply seeking answers to questions. Sometimes it is to confirm existing models (forts were built in a place to see both another fort and a resource of importance). Sometimes they seek answers to questions not previously asked. All of them are guided by theoritical models, old and new, and all of them are judged by their funding bodies, institutions, and peers.

       This is such bull. Archaeology isn't going to overhaul established narratives. Too much time and resources have been put to have it go away. And too many professors would become obsolete overnight as well as museums and businesses (textbooks and other periphery interest groups).

       It isn't? What about 18th and 19th century ideas that Native Americans were from a lost tribe of Israel? Or more recently, that people didn't populate the Americas prior to 12,000 years ago? Both of those ideas were overturned because of archaeology.

       Why would this happen? Archaeologists would simply chance their theoritical approach. Ian Hodder did so after excavating Çatalhöyük. Hodder didn't lose his job.

       No, that's not how evidence and data is treated in archaeology which shows your unfamiliarity with the field and its methods. Data is collected with a theoretical model in mind. Bad archaeologists will pick supporting data and disregard dissenting data. They get called out by their peers for their poor work. Bad conclusions based on evidence are pushed aside because those conclusions have fundamental flaws in their logic and cannot be easily supported by the evidence they draw from (i.e. Hancock).

       Now I know you're trolling. This was thrown out because it is silly. Nothing about the morphology of hominids supports an aquatic starting point in our recent evolution (in a round about way, all vertebrae did come from the ocean hundreds of millions of years ago).

       That's not a bad thing. In fact, it is often a good thing. What we learn about the past can help inform us about the present and change the future. Understanding systematic inequality in urban places going back to the 1700s could explain the development of modern sub-cultures in places like Boston and why some people are socially forced into roles because of poverty and lack of upward social mobility.

       The Tarascans did not worship serpents. Sometimes the Maya sacrificed people by throwing them into a cenote (literally the lowest places in the Yucatan).

       Here is a Tarascan deity:

      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xipe_Totec">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xipe_Totec
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It mentions shedding of the skin like a snake, and human sacrifice. Here is an image of Xipe Totec and a dragon:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, that doesn't suggest direct serpent worship, but the symbolism was there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is some Mayan art:
      </p>

        https://www.aauwpetaluma.org/2007MayanArt/Creation-Heaven/creation1.jpeg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right about the Mayans, they did sacrifices from lower places like the base of a pyramid or masonic structure instead of the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       While we can't say that ALL cultures worship the serpent, it was definitely a theme throughout all the cultures I've looked into. And sacrifice from a high place is not 100% shared, but it is quite common.

       Xipe Totec is not a Tarascan deity, however. It is a Central Mexican deity.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the image you posted of Xipe Totec makes sense from an Aztec point of view. The Aztecs did revere serpents and Quetzalcoatl, in one of his many forms, is a feathered serpent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Maya" art looks contemporary, I'm afraid. Even if it were not, the Maya are even further removed from the Tarascan than the Aztecs.

      <p>
       My point is that we cannot make such generalities because there are contradictions. I named two Mesoamerican examples that I am most familiar with. But we decided to explore more cultures we will find cultures that not only not worship serpents and only sacrifice in low places. Or cultures that don't sacrifice at all. Or cultures that sacrifice in high places, but have no serpents. Or cultures that worship serpents and don't sacrifice. The variability is out there, but I am not knowledgeable enough to be able to name them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       At what percentage of cultures that don't follow this pattern is this generality no longer accepted as holding true for most cultures? Does it have to go to 51%? Is 15% of cultures that don't follow this pattern sufficient enough?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying there might not be something interesting to explore in the association between serpents and sacrifice. However we would have to be rigorous in our analysis. Do serpents need to be involved someway in the sacrifice? Such as sacrifice to a serpent deity? Or is simply having serpent iconography somewhere in the context of the  culture sufficient enough to say there's significance? How far back in time do we explore this association? Only as far back as a shared date across all cultures that have this association? Or do we go further back in time than others? How do we connect them all together through time and place?
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't an easy argument to make.

       The elite knows about the reality of the existence of jinns. You don't find that in cultures in general because"those" (jinn) rulers don't want to be know by the masses because knowing their existence is real is knowing at least one part of truth in this world

       Common structures of human brains overcome the differences created by cultures. Monkeys retreat to trees for safety, high places are safe, sacred, in the back of our monkey minds. Snakes are quiet, can slip through the grass unnoticed, can climb the highest tree, the tallest mountain.

       You may benefit from looking into Jung's ideas about archetypes and the collective unconscious. The basic idea is that certain symbols and imagery are more or less hard coded into us as a legacy of our ancient pre-historic and these images and motifs act on our subconscious in such a way that you see recurrent patterns across the various ages and different societies because the root is basically the same.

       about carl jung and his theories.. one has to consider the source.
      </p>
      <p>
       his upbringing...
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Emilie Jung's (his mother) continuing bouts of absence and depression deeply troubled her son and caused him to associate women with "innate unreliability", whereas "father" meant for him reliability but also powerlessness.[8] In his memoir, Jung would remark that this parental influence was the "handicap I started off with. Later, these early impressions were revised: I have trusted men friends and been disappointed by them, and I have mistrusted women and was not disappointed."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Although she was normal during the day, Jung recalled that at night his mother became strange and mysterious. He reported that one night he saw a faintly luminous and indefinite figure coming from her room with a head detached from the neck and floating in the air in front of the body. Jung had a better relationship with his father.[7]"
      </p>
      <p>
       "As a boy, he carved a tiny mannequin into the end of the wooden ruler from his pencil case and placed it inside the case. He added a stone, which he had painted into upper and lower halves, and hid the case in the attic. Periodically, he would return to the mannequin, often bringing tiny sheets of paper with messages inscribed on them in his own secret language.[15] He later reflected that this ceremonial act brought him a feeling of inner peace and security. Years later, he discovered similarities between his personal experience and the practices associated with totems in indigenous cultures, such as the collection of soul-stones near Arlesheim or the tjurungas of Australia. He concluded that his intuitive ceremonial act was an unconscious ritual, which he had practiced in a way that was strikingly similar to those in distant locations which he, as a young boy, knew nothing about.[1"
      </p>
      <p>
       knew nothing about traditons, or symbology did he? funny his father was a pastor, and his maternal grandfather was a basal...he would have retained those memories in his subconcious, if his own theories are put in place. .
      </p>
      <p>
       moreover, there is this... "Jung de-emphasized the importance of sexual development and focused on the collective unconscious: the part of the unconscious that contains memories and ideas that Jung believed were inherited from ancestors."
      </p>
      <p>
       then there's the life of jung himself...
      </p>
      <p>

        https://www.hgi.org.uk/resources/delve-our-extensive-library/interviews/mysterious-jung-his-cult-lies-he-told-and-occult
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Noll: Well. I use that term ‘cult’ to describe the social organisation that Jung gathered around himself after his break with Freud. He was living at the time in Küsnacht, Zurich, in Switzerland. Essentially, at first, he gathered primarily German-speaking Swiss around him, and a few Germans, then people from Britain and the United States. His biggest catch was the daughter of John D. Rockefeller who, in 1916, poured more than a million dollars (in 1997 US dollars) into his enterprises."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Noll: Well, Jung certainly believed Mithraism was Christianity's great rival religion but, in fact, some of the other cults like Dionysus were more widespread at the time. But anyway, during 1913 and 1914 Jung withdrew from his former bourgeois life-style and lived out a wild, intense, mad fantasy life during which he believed he was initiated. He descended into a cave and had all sorts of strange dreams and fantasies, which he described in his book Memories, Dreams, Reflections, in the chapter ‘Confrontation with the Unconscious’. But that book has in it only the watered-down version of what happened."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Noll: Well, yes, that's always it. They say that I don't understand what Jung was talking about - that his cosmology was just a metaphor for psychological reality and not that he's actually talking about gods. But if you really read Jung, he is. He certainly did believe in gods communicating with humans, spirits and the spirit world, reincarnation and all of that stuff. Of course, it is primarily those Jungian analysts who are trying to present the ideas as respectable and scientific who get upset when you point this out. Everyday Jungians – they know what he is talking about – and it's the cultish beliefs that they are attracted to. For them he was talking about some other reality."
      </p>

       "Jung said of his initiation into Mithraism: One gets a peculiar feeling from being put through such an initiation. The important part that led up to the deification was the snake’s encoiling of me. Salome’s performance was deification. The animal face which I felt mine transformed into was the famous Leontocephalus of the Mithraic Mysteries. It is the figure which is represented with a snake coiled around the man, the snake’s head resting on the man’s head, and the face of the man that of the lion. This statue has only been found in mystery grottoes (the under-churches, the last remnants of the catacombs). The catacombs were not originally places of concealment, but were chosen as symbolical of a descent into the underworld."
      </p>
      <p>
       he had his own reasons for convinicing us that is is all residue from more archaic times.. for someone who didnt believe in the power of symbols.. he spent a lot of time partaking in rituals that cater to them.

       wtf do you mean Jung didn't believe in the power of symbols. It's obvious you've never actually read his work and you're just sitting garrotting a lot of smart sounding bullshit written by people with an agenda and an axe to grind. Bo idea why you'd want to write a hit piece about fucking carl jung of all people, but whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, seriously, you cite a website called 'pedophiles down under' as some sort of serious source while making bullshit claims made by people who are either idiots or actively and maliciously twisting his actual on the record beliefs, observations and experiences about how his mind and the minds of people observed appeared to work.

       If I had to guess it would be because snakes are everywhere, and if you're into human sacrifice rituals to keep the tribe in line you'd probably want them to all look up at you while you're doing it.  Same reason thrones/judges' benches/winner's platforms are raised.

       I like these kinds of questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a reference:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_worship">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_worship
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A few theories, and these are all somewhat related to one another:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) People migrate and spread their culture around, blending it with other cultures. You can find the merging of Zoroastrian with Christianity in the Bible, as the cultures of Rome and Persia began to meet and merge through military expeditions abroad. The Biblical Magi (three wise men) were Zoroastrians. The Roman soldiers brought the Persian culture back to Rome when they returned.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Like the other guy said, kundalini rising is that euphoric feeling described in Hindu culture, which may have been an early form of understanding human biology and limbic system - adrenaline, hormones, orgasm and all that. These things relate to instinct and mood. We are said to have a more ancient "reptilian brain" that runs on instinct and keeps us ticking regardless of our consciousness and will. There are things that can "talk" to and stimulate our reptilian brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) When a snake dies and leaves behind its skeleton, the ancients could recognize that it looks like a human spine. They probably couldn't help but compare the two, and this may have laid the foundation for understanding biology and evolution. The caduceus, a symbol for medicine, is the staff with snakes around it. What they must have recognized was that people appear to be composed of different parts from different animals. Take that a little further and you might have humans who express more of one animal than another, so then the myths are borne with deities who have the head of a lion/serpent or wings of a bird.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) At some point they discovered snake charming, which was the act of playing a musical instrument to a snake. They started to discover what effect sound and music had on animals and humans. Music was something that could control the mood, or make your spine (snake) tingle. They discovered the universe has a sort of harmony. And that communication could take place through many different means, some which seem like telepathy. For example, pheromones.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Egypt also had cats. Cats have a natural instinct to jump and flee at the sight of a snake. It's a certain type of programming they didn't have to learn because its like a signal built into the genetic code. They can go from kitten to adult cat without ever seeing a snake, and one day they see the snake and act like it's their number one predator, which was likely the case. Cats are even afraid of cucumbers because they look like snakes. The ancients must have pondered on this instinctual side of nature, why it exists, and how to harness it. And so they did. Look at the Egyptian deities who are depicted as human animal hybrids. This talks to our reptilian brain, it's a sort of subliminal messenger. We can see this stuff still in effect today, people call it the "Illuminati" but basically it's that type of symbolism and triggers your psyche in a certain way that's not readily apparent. So I see the ancient Egyptian deities like modern Hollywood actors. They trigger all the right things to create the illusion of reality, even though they are just acting out a role.

       People see them under DMT. Generally there are 2 snakes moving in unison with each other, sorta wrapping around each other but not touching. Some have noticed that they resemble a DNA double helix. See Caduceus.

       Snakes are a good symbol of death and rebirth, because (a) they coil up in a circle and (b) they shed their skin very conspicuously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, they are seldom seen and frequently venomous. Which is a winning combo if you're after some kind of symbol of mysterious power.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for sacrificing on high places, I'm not sure that this was as widespread as we like to imagine. There's a couple of instances in the Bible, and the Aztecs, that spring to mind. Drawing a blank on any others, and can think of lots of cultures that sacrifice/d at ground level.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the "sacrifice in high places" category, the clear answer is that the higher you get, the nearer to the gods you are. The sky is where it's all happening, in magical thinking.

       My "religious belief" is that all the gods of every religion were/are just aliens. Our ancestors didnt know what aliens were so they just became gods. That's why a lot of ancient cultures are similar but different too. This could account for sacrifice too, but I wouldn't know for what purpose or reason.

       Maybe they all experienced visitation by schadenfreude loving bullies of the reptilian persuasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bullies feed on emotional energy. As their target gets emotionally low, they get high. If their target doesn't get low, they don't get high. We can know this in hindsight from human children on the playground in our memories of our development. We remember the viable strategy to not feel negative emotions in reaction to bullies in order to deprive them of satisfaction. It only works
       <strong>
        <em>
         BECAUSE
        </em>
       </strong>
       bullies are emotional energy thieves.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the reptilian gluttons of emotional energy have a reputation for sacrifices, sarcasm, sadism and violence. How much more harmful can you be to a consciousness to cause it to enter negative emotional states than a sacrifice ritual? You can even get high off of the observers and the perpetrators fear and anguish. This is the essence of demonic behavior and why the reptilians are associated with demons.
      </p>
      <p>
       They never left and neither did many other groups. They stay to feed on our emotional energy from problems we create for ourselves, problems they foment for us to create for ourselves and problems they actually do create for us. It doesn't matter really. They get high all the same. That's their short to medium term agenda for humanity, emotional energy for their useless eater souls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their long term goal is to corrupt us into perceiving the world as a place full of beings and intentions such as theirs, so that we perceive, think, feel and act more like they do over time. It requires that we do not discern that they are corrupting our environment of experience to become that way. If we knew, we'd resist it much better. They want us to become the damned as they are, eternally hungry spirits that refuse to create emotional value and only steal it for satisfaction in existence. Then they can use us as tools to be basically what they are, tools for greater parasitic minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are a subset of the disease in the cosmos and they want to feed on us to grow and spread through consuming us just like a disease. It's our duty as cells in the body of our collective existence to root them out and destroy them lest we suffer them and be destroyed or converted into them, just like our own cells vs diseases that infect us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let the dark in drag convince you tolerance of these beings is acceptable, desirable or even workable to protect the cells. They are special infected corrupted in a way that is a placeholder for divine benevolence and protection without actual protection, but rather endless lip service to preserve the clear causers of abuses they never want to experience personally.

       The snake is the glyph representing water. The serpent Gods would be who rain comes from-ie, that both feeds the crops and quenches thirst. You left out the Persian culture-the Persian empire was huge at one point. Zoroastrians also have snake symbolism.

       You have mainstream archeologists that hold on to the old information like hyenas over a carcass.  Hawass comes to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have people in the field with similar qualifications who are seeking new answers to ancient questions.

       I know where you would fit.

       This is such bull. Archaeology isn't going to overhaul established narratives. Too much time and resources have been put to have it go away. And too many professors would become obsolete overnight as well as museums and businesses (textbooks and other periphery interest groups).

      <p>
       Evidence that shifts paradigms is pushed to the fringe for this reason. One of the reason Aquatic Ape Theory is thrown out is because of this. It would turn our historical established knowledge upside down.
