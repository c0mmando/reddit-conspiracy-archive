        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>I&#39;m not saying that this IS the TRUTH. But I felt it is worth for all to read - &amp; trust yourself!</h1>

<p>According to veteran investigative reporter and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Killing-Deep-State-Fight-President-ebook/dp/B07981FQ35/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1523557514&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=killing+the+deep+state">best selling author</a>,  Dr. Jerome Corsi, he was approached three years ago by a group of  generals and told that Donald Trump had been recruited by U.S. military  intelligence to run in the 2016 Presidential elections, and subsequently  help remove corrupt Deep State officials from positions of power. Corsi  claims that QAnon represents the same group of senior military  intelligence officials who are exposing the Deep State corruption and  officials involved in a history of treasonous actions against the U.S.  Republic.</p>

<p>This is what <a href="https://youtu.be/9O8VPOd3Dsw?t=6m30s">Corsi said</a> at a meeting on April 11, </p>

<p>About  three years ago a group of Generals came to me, and it was explained to me that they were ready to conduct a coup d’etat. They were ready to  move Barack Obama from office with military force. And then a few weeks  later I got another call and said they were reconsidering.</p>

<p>You  know why they were reconsidering? [audience calls out answers] Because  they talked to Donald Trump, and Trump had agreed he would run, and they  agreed that if he would run, they would conduct their coup d’etat as a  legitimate process, rooting out the traitors within government.  And  that pact between the military and Donald Trump has held, as we have  been interpreting and watching, and <em>[many people]</em> has been following <strong><em>Q.</em></strong></p>

<p> QAnon  is military intelligence and close to Trump, and the intelligence we’ve  getting, that we’ve explained on Infowars, really is a lot of the  inside script. While Corsi  didn’t name the generals or provide hard evidence for his startling  claim, an examination of public comments by President Trump, QAnon and  related political events do make Corsi’s extraordinary claim very  plausible. It’s  important to note that Corsi’s speech happened only a day after a tweet  by President Trump featuring him with 20 senior U.S. military officials  who dined with him the previous night:</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><em>Processing img 2h9h2w3tv2o11...</em></p>

<p>Only hours after Trump’s tweet, Q posted a message commenting about the photo’s significance:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/7lsldtczv2o11.jpg">https://i.redd.it/7lsldtczv2o11.jpg</a></p>

<p>In the photo,  the man next to Vice President Pence and Trump is Admiral Michael Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency. It was Rogers who  travelled to Trump Tower on November 17, 2016, a week after the  Presidential election, without the knowledge of his superiors in the  Obama administration.</p>

<p>The next day, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-and-intelligence-community-chiefs-have-urged-obama-to-remove-the-head-of-the-nsa/2016/11/19/44de6ea6-adff-11e6-977a-1030f822fc35_story.html?utm_term=.b82f16d866de"><em>Washington Post ran a story</em></a> saying that senior Defense and Intelligence officials in the Obama administration were aghast at Roger’s action:</p>

<p>In a move apparently unprecedented for a military officer, Rogers, without  notifying superiors, traveled to New York to meet with Trump on  Thursday at Trump Tower. That caused consternation at senior levels of  the administration, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel matters.</p>

<p>The <em>Washington Post</em>  went on to report that a recommendation had been previously made to  President Obama to remove Rogers in October 2016 by James Clapper  (Director of National Intelligence) and Ashton Carter (Secretary of  Defense). This coincided with a FISA court approving a request made by  President Obama for his administration to spy on Trump’s campaign.</p>

<p>Given recent disclosures about FISA court orders approving the Obama administration  spying on Trump, the timing suggests that Rogers had travelled to New  York to warn Trump that the intelligence community were spying on him  under the authority of a FISA court order. This is how <a href="http://anamericancomment.blogspot.com/2017/03/did-nsa-admiral-mike-rogers-warn-trump.html">one analyst explained</a> the sequence of events:</p>

<p>NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers didn’t want to participate in the spying  scheme (Clapper, Brennan, Etc.), which was the baseline for President Obama’s post presidency efforts to undermine Donald Trump and keep Trump from digging into the Obama labyrinth underlying his remaining  loyalists.  After the October spying operation went into effect, Rogers  unknown loyalty was a risk to the Obama objective. 10 Days after the  election Rogers travels to President-Elect Trump without notifying those who were involved in the intel scheme.   </p>

<p>It would be  fair to conclude that QAnon is acting with the approval or support of  Admiral Rogers, and that intelligence data is being anonymously leaked  to expose the extent of Deep State corruption.</p>

<p>Another interesting aspect of the photo tweeted by Trump showing him, Pence and  Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, flanked by 20 uniformed military  officers, is that 9 were on his right, and 11 on his left. Was this  symbolism for the 911 event that is regarded by Corsi, Jones and many in  the US Patriot community as a false flag event, orchestrated by corrupt Deep State officials that had manipulated both the Bush (43) and Obama  administrations?</p>

<p>It’s worth  examining Corsi’s claim that a group of generals were prepared to launch  a military coup given the level of Deep State corruption and control  prior to Trump choosing to run. Could this have been possible?</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://qanonposts.com/?q=military%20intelligence">November 2, 2017 post by Q</a>, if Hillary Clinton had won the election or results were overturned in her favor, a military coup would indeed have occurred given her level of  corruption: </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/hvvpsktnw2o11.jpg">https://i.redd.it/hvvpsktnw2o11.jpg</a></p>

<p>As mentioned in a <a href="https://www.exopolitics.org/bombshell-qanon-posts-link-clintons-cia-to-jfk-jr-plane-crash/">previous article</a>, the Clintons’ corruption began with Bill’s term as Governor of the State of Arkansas, where he supported CIA drug running operations out of  Mena, Arkansas. As investigative reporter Roger Morris discovered, there were many documents showing how the Clintons financially benefited, and even photos showing Bill using cocaine. This made it easy  for the Deep State to manipulate Bill Clinton throughout his  Presidency.</p>

<p>As Bill’s Presidency was coming to an end, Hillary’s rise to high political office was made possible, <a href="https://www.exopolitics.org/bombshell-qanon-posts-link-clintons-cia-to-jfk-jr-plane-crash/">according to Q</a>, by the CIA assassinating John F. Kennedy’s Jr., who was a threat to her plan to run for New York’s open US Senate seat in the November 2000  election. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/bzl2jk7zw2o11.jpg">https://i.redd.it/bzl2jk7zw2o11.jpg</a></p>

<p>If Clinton had indeed been helped in this sinister way by the Deep State, it is easy to understand how important she was to their future plans, and how deeply compromised she was.</p>

<p>These are only some of the “corrupt and dirty” events mentioned by Q, which the Clintons were deeply involved in, all of which facilitated Deep  State power. As to Corsi’s claim that military intelligence had recruited Trump to run and thereby  prevent a Clinton victory through a rigged election, here is what Q had to say on the topic back on October 31, 2017:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/oclxusgex2o11.jpg">https://i.redd.it/oclxusgex2o11.jpg</a></p>

<p>Corsi did not elaborate on the three generals that approached him in 2015, but it would be a fair to guess that Lt. General Michael Flynn was involved. As a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn would have been aware of the deep corruption underscoring the Clintons and the dirty tricks played by the CIA in support of the Deep State.</p>

<p>Flynn famously led chants of “lock her up” at the 2016 Republican convention when discussing Hillary Clinton. <a href="https://youtu.be/tx94428MYcc">https://youtu.be/tx94428MYcc</a></p>

<p>Flynn’s appointment as Trump’s National Security Advisor, and quick departure less than a month later, appears to have been a major setback for the Military Intelligence community secretly backing the Trump administration. On October 28, 2017, Q first began releasing information on message boards. Presumably, this was done to enlist public support in exposing and taking action against corrupt public officials impeding Trump’s policies and the Military Intelligence community’s plans.</p>

<p>The level of information on Deep State control and corruption released by Q in over <a href="https://qmap.pub/">2273 posts to date</a> is astounding in its scope and impact. A number of false flag events  have been revealed, the most significant being a January 13, 2018 <a href="https://www.exopolitics.org/qanon-corroborates-hawaii-missile-attack-hunt-for-rogue-cia-submarine/">nuclear ballistic missile attack</a> against Hawaii, which was intended to start a major regional war.</p>

<p>The knowledge  that these revelations are coming from senior military intelligence officials working closely with the Trump Administration to overcome the corrupting power and influence of the Deep State is highly significant.</p>

<p>Exposing and removing corrupt Deep State officials will open the door to many life changing technologies that have been suppressed for decades, to finally be released to the public. It appears that this is what Trump was referring to during his <a href="https://www.exopolitics.org/trump-inauguration-speech-hints-at-official-disclosure-of-secret-space-programs/">Inauguration speech</a> on January 20, 2017:</p>

<p>We  stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries  of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness  the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.</p>

<p>These technologies are so advanced that a Star Trek-like future is well within the reach of all of us. This merits keeping, at the very least, an open mind about the Trump administration, what Corsi was told about a possible coup d’etat and the 2016 election, and what Q is revealing  to us.  <em>© Michael E.

    <div class="md"><p>while Donald Trump&#39;s <em>ending of the Iran peace deal</em> is causing many to be anxious about the increased likelihood over a looming nuclear confrontation, it may be that we will witness something similar occurring to what recently happened with North Korea.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, ending a flawed peace deal facilitated by the Deep State secretly planning to use the deal to orchestrate a nuclear false flag attack that would implicate Syria, Iran and Russia, may well create the opportunity for a genuine international peace deal with Iran.</p>

<p>More importantly, Trumps action will <strong>free</strong> <strong>Iran of Deep State influence</strong> through its covert funding of <em>rogue Iranian operations</em> in Syria and elsewhere.</p>

<p>so that they don&#39;t cause domestic disturbances at home and instead channel their anger on message boards online. They also think that the good guys are taking care of business behind the scenes, so they are becoming pacified.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fake narrative you&#39;re being lead down. Q &quot;predicts things&quot; because Q is IC and knows what&#39;s going to happen before it happens.</p>

<p>ICs know Trump&#39;s speaking pattern. He has been recorded on TV as saying &quot;Tippy Top&quot; multiple times in the past and there is no doubt that ICs would not be aware of the POTUS speaking pattern, incase they ever needed to impersonate him for example.</p>

<p>Q is an IC pied piper playing on peoples anger and confirmation bias. It has become a cult.</p>

<p>I worry what will happen to the cult when the Q psy op ends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Playing devil&#39;s advocate: if eventually there are mass arrests or something alike, it would be beneficial to have garnered support/trust in advance. </p>

<p>Also, it would be helpful to have a record of drops that outline the plan and document this as having been a long term goal so it doesn&#39;t look like a coup by the trump admin to remove dissenters or political opponents.</p>

<p>Msm would likely spin any arrests as unfounded or trump being reactionary to protect himself like a dictator.</p>

<p>Not a horrible idea to be able to announce that Q documented the entire thing and someone within the admin steps forward as Q and proves access to the account with the proper tripcode.</p>
