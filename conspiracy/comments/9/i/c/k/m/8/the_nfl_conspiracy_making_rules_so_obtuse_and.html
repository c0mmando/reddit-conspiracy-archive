    <div class="md"><p>Remember the Ravens-49&#39;ers Superbowl? The Ravens were running away with the game into the third quarter when the power suddenly went out for over 30 minutes. When the game finally resumed, the 49&#39;ers made a huge comeback and it ended up being a close game. Was someone worried about poor ratings? Or maybe keeping the points spread in check? That one always seemed super fishy to me.</p>

<p>Officials allowed the Broncos to beat the shit out of Cam. They were hitting him helmet to helmet, late hits, taking him out at the knees, everything. Refs didn&#39;t call anything. That was it for me. I was disgusted. Cam is a QB. Refs are supposed to protect the QB. They allowed illegal hit after illegal hit because they didn&#39;t like the way Cam mocked them in press conferences. </p>

<p>Hmm according to this article there isn&#39;t much evidence that moutguards help with concussions. However it also says it hasn&#39;t really been studied much. From personal experience, playing years of Football, I think it absolutely helps but I guess that is just my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you are saying is not true. Do you know where your brain is located? What about your mouth? Do you know what a concussion is? Do you know understand movement and inertia? So a mouth guard will stop your brain from ramming into your skull after a violent collision? </p>

Spread to player manipulation (there is some downright stange play, especially when it counts, like in the playoffs), and now I&#39;m beginning to think the league has its hand in forcing teams to make trades in order to position teams as they prefer (I presume this part has to do with T.V. ratings).

A bad call against the Ducks and suddenly the center can’t figure out how to snap the ball, but only for two plays.

    <div class="md"><p>On a related note:</p>

<p>“A pertinent fact the NFL blatantly overlooks as part of its historical development is that several of its early team owners were well-known gamblers. The New York Giant’s original owner Tim Mara (whose family still owns the team) had a history as a bookmaker before and even during his ownership of the team. He wasn’t alone.</p>

<p>Another original owner whose family still has control of its franchise, Charles Bidwell bought the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals) after relinquishing his share in George Halas’ Chicago Bears. Bidwell was not just a gambler and a racetrack owner; he was a known associate of Al Capone (they shared the same lawyer, Ed O’Hare) and a bootlegger.</p>

<p>Beloved Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney, Sr. was another big time gambler who reportedly won over $250,000 over a two-day span at the racetrack. Rooney would also own pieces in several horse and dog racing tracks and reportedly hired head coach Joe Bach to work off a gambling debt he couldn’t immediately pay off.</p>

<p>George “Dick” Richards was known to be a heavy gambler outside of his car dealership when he purchased and NFL team, moving them to Detroit to become the Lions. In letters he had foolishly written, Richards detailed how he bet on his own team’s games, including upwards of $50,000 on a single content prior to selling the Lions in 1948.”</p>

With pro-wrestling, and especially WWE, it becomes even more absurd though, as the outcome of matches is decided by a single insane old man.

    <div class="md"><p>I really kinda buy into this. Same idea as the NBA in that almost every call is contextual and completely at the refs discretion. The question is, really, who benefits? Who is betting and winning on crazy long shots? That&#39;s really the only reason you&#39;d fix a game, is to make money. Sure, the owners could conspire to create a more compelling story line but that doesn&#39;t seem to be working out so well as overall, viewership is down.</p>

<p>anyway, I&#39;m trying to look at it like wrestling but far more brutal. It&#39;s entertainment and I&#39;m not lying to myself about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Overall engagement is a tough one to collate. Every provider is likely to exaggerate their own viewership. I&#39;m not necessarily disagreeing with you just that it&#39;s a little tough to pin down.</p>

<p>Vegas functioned as a balance in college and pro basketball in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s as well, while refs were being bought and they only had to shave a few points. If this proposition is accurate, it&#39;s a much bigger conspiracy to alter the outcome of games because the rules commission or whatever of the NFL is involved and owners also have to sign off on those rules.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just saying that I think I&#39;m missing something. There&#39;s no way Bob Kraft is advocating for ambiguous rules and then making huge bets in Vegas on games where he knows the outcome. You know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s kinda what I&#39;m getting at. That said, it&#39;s hugely important to keep the appearance of pure athletic competition with no favorites, no given outcomes. If I knew the 49ers were going to go 5-11 again this season, what are the odds that I would buy a Bruckner or Garappolo jersey? If I thought they had no chance of winning, would I go all the way to Santa Clara (different rant entirely) to watch a San Francisco 49ers game? They desperately need to keep the mask on but it&#39;s certainly slipping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing that has changed in the NFL is your awareness and technology.  </p>

<p>Awareness:  The Raiders have been the &quot;picked-on&quot; team since the 70s.  Penalties galore, every year.  Everybody knew, nobody cared (relative to the intensity of this thread).  Cowboys have always been the glory team, somewhat supplanted lately by Patriots.</p>

<p>For an example of Raider and Patriot unevenness, see Tuck Rule Game 2001.  This thread acts like this is new.</p>

<p>Technology:  replay and the fracturing of screens.  People watch on tablets, phones, etc, and in myriad ways and times.  Stop, rewind, replay, slo-mo, cut/copy/paste, memes, all this stuff makes the nitty-gritty of football So Much More Accessible.  </p>

<p>Did the Immaculate Reception hit the ground?  We literally don&#39;t know.  Could you imagine that happening today?</p>

<p>Replay gives us split second action and the ability to analyze frame by frame action.  Then discuss, ad nauseum.</p>

<p>I&#39;m among the oldest folks on r/conspiracy and the only difference  in reffing is the QB protection.  Take away currently overdone QB protection (Clay Mathews x2) and the reffing is about the same.  Yes, I know there have been rule changes, we talking refs and fixing.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re stuck on &quot;fixing&quot; do you really think that just started?  c&#39;mon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the same thing as statistical analysis. And that&#39;s often times the route of legal arguments - you assume what the claimant is saying is true to see if they have standing. It&#39;s not an admission of anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, it&#39;s a legal argument. When debating whether or not someone has standing, the common procedure is to assume that what the claimant is saying is true, and then see if there are any legal issues. The NFL (as is typical) assumed that they&#39;re rigged for the purpose of a legal argument in order to demonstrate that there is no standing. </p>

<p>They are in no way admitting that they are fixing games, but simply that they are not legally obligated to go to trial over accusations of fixing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Seahawks vs Patriots superbowl sealed the deal for me. 2nd and goal and you throw the ball? No coach would risk the superbowl, by throwing the ball. If they had, the QB would completely disregard and run the ball anyway. Not to mention who throws the ball with only a couple yards to run with a 2nd down?  </p>

<p>Then the insane comeback Patriots made in the 2017 superbowl was pretty sketchy.  </p>

<p>Their formula is very strategic for fixing these games. But it is in my opinion mostly skill before the playoffs, purely fixed in the playoffs and the superbowl. To much money in these sports which influences the game. The players aren&#39;t in on it, I&#39;m sure some know. The coaches are either in on it, or are fully aware of it at the very least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, its pretty insane how many people still believe those two superbowls (and the NFL in general) were genuine, especially the Seahawks vs patriots one. Coach has the best running back in the NFL (at the time) and willingly chooses to pass it? Bullshit. Someone gave him that order. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they just did a terrible job in hiding it. Because if my memory serves, Seahawks made an amazing catch all the way to the end of the field that I believe wasn&#39;t meant to happen and completely fucked up their plans in making it look legit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lynch had one of his best years that season, but he has never been the best RB in the NFL.  Anyways, the decision to throw the ball in that situation is easily justified and way overblown. Lynch has never been as good in that situation as people believe.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They tried to pass the ball on 2nd down because on a play that close to the goal line the defense was likely expecting a running play. </p>

<p>It&#39;s 4 down territory so if the pass on 2nd down is incomplete you still have 2 downs to run it in from the 2 yard line since it&#39;s 4 down territory. Not saying I agree with the play call, Pete Carroll obviously got too cute with his play calling but that&#39;s the logic.</p>

<p>And also you mean to tell me Wilson threw a pick on purpose? Butler cut into the route at the last minute. A TD catch or incomplete pass is much more likely to happen than an interception. And one ends the game as a Seahawks win, and another still gives the Seahawks 2 chances to score from the 2 yard line.</p>

<p>The game wasn&#39;t fixed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have 4 runs actually because they aren&#39;t going to kick it on the 4th down. Again it&#39;s the superbowl. It&#39;s 2nd down. You have arguably the best running back that season. You aren&#39;t going to throw the ball. But yea keep believing the superbowls aren&#39;t fixed. People get very rich off these games.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok and you&#39;re not taking into account that hubris has been the downfall of many men. </p>

<p>If it was fixed then who fixed it? Pete Carroll for calling the pass play and Russell Wilson for throwing it? You&#39;re ignoring that 2 plays earlier Russell threw a crazy pass to Jermaine Kearse that brought the ball inside the 10 yard line. If the game&#39;s outcome was decided before the game then why not just throw the interception when the Seahawks had the ball on the 40 instead of the 2 yard line? Why risk it with that much money on the line?</p>

<p>If the game was rigged after that catch then it still has to rely on Marshawn Lynch being stopped on the 2 yard line on a run where if he gets hit half a second later he would have been able to reach out for the TD. And then after that run by Lynch on 1st down, Russell Wilson still has to purposely throw a pick where Butler cut in front of this receiver at the last second and the Seahawks receiver still only missed it by a foot. And what if the defender missed the pick? Then there&#39;s a big likelihood the Seahawks score on the next play or the play after. </p>

<p>Saying that people get very rich off of these games isn&#39;t an argument. People get very rich off of blowouts as well. </p>

<p>How exactly would the game have been rigged?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally today this happened. I was at the Jaguars vs Titans game. The Jaguars got a sack, forced a fumble and the Jaguars recovered. Then the ref pulls out the flag, says it&#39;s roughing the passer, Titans were in field goal range and they score. Final score? 9-6. That lone field goal was the deciding factor. </p>

<p>Being a Jaguars fan my whole life, the refs always call penalties against the Jaguars. No matter how much the other team breaks the rules  Today: Jaguars had about 7 penalties IN THEIR OWN STADIUM while the Titans had 2. </p>

<p>It also seems like Clay Matthews is being called weekly for roughing the passer. It&#39;s cost them a game and it nearly cost them the first game. </p>

<p>I guess the fix isn&#39;t always going to work but my God.. the officiating this season is just asinine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to the discussion, the rules have been changed to inflate offensive performance for fantasy football purposes. Fantasy football is a billion dollar industry and keeps fans engaged and watching. Theres no better way to make sure the trend continues than to put defending at a ridiculous disadvantage and allow refs to throw a flag literally whenever they want with no repercussion. Games themselves may or may not be fixed (they probably are), but the rules have definitely changed to give offenses a severe  advantage and that&#39;s because of the money involved in fantasy football. </p>

It’s literally the first line of defense against concussions which is the biggest hot button topic right now and he simply isn’t penalized for the lack of using one. It’s all bullshit and it’s really fucked up the sport. </p>

<p>Hmm according to this article there isn&#39;t much evidence that moutguards help with concussions. However it also says it hasn&#39;t really been studied much. From personal experience, playing years of Football, I think it absolutely helps but I guess that is just my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok and you&#39;re not taking into account that hubris has been the downfall of many men. </p>

<p>If it was fixed then who fixed it? Pete Carroll for calling the pass play and Russell Wilson for throwing it? You&#39;re ignoring that 2 plays earlier Russell threw a crazy pass to Jermaine Kearse that brought the ball inside the 10 yard line. If the game&#39;s outcome was decided before the game then why not just throw the interception when the Seahawks had the ball on the 40 instead of the 2 yard line? Why risk it with that much money on the line?</p>

<p>If the game was rigged after that catch then it still has to rely on Marshawn Lynch being stopped on the 2 yard line on a run where if he gets hit half a second later he would have been able to reach out for the TD. And then after that run by Lynch on 1st down, Russell Wilson still has to purposely throw a pick where Butler cut in front of this receiver at the last second and the Seahawks receiver still only missed it by a foot. And what if the defender missed the pick? Then there&#39;s a big likelihood the Seahawks score on the next play or the play after. </p>

<p>Saying that people get very rich off of these games isn&#39;t an argument. People get very rich off of blowouts as well. </p>

<p>How exactly would the game have been rigged?</p>
