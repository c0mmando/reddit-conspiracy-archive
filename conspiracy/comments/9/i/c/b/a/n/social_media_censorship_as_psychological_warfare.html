        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>“There is  no free speech in [the] real  world and you will be suppressed  for     telling the truth that is not supported by the system.” — Nasim   Aghdam</strong></p>

<p>After  another round of Twitter purges by the techno-Stasi, I felt a very   real  sense of loss   that I could not quite articulate.  Several of my   closest  Twitter   friends – two of whom had more than ten  thousand   followers –  were   gone in an instant. Ever-changing and exceedingly   nebulous “<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6070323/Twitter-continues-cull-users-bid-clean-platform.html?ito=social-twitter_mailonline">rules</a>”    are enforced by Twitter to get rid of what they deem to be   “low-quality” users – so low-quality that I know for a fact many of them  had been seeing well over a hundred thousand monthly profile visits     and  ten million monthly impressions.</p>

<p><strong>By      “low-quality,” what Twitter and other social media platforms mean    is    anything that runs contrary to the mainstream narrative and to   their    political machinations.</strong></p>

<h1>Low-quality is clearly a euphemism for what the  Soviets might have deemed “counter-revolutionary”</h1>

<p>-Under      Article 58: those refusing to toe the Party line, the dissidents      dealing information on the black market throughout the Eastern bloc,  the     brave souls  risking everything to speak truth to power.</p>

<p><strong>What      social media platforms are doing when they delete accounts is far    more   wicked than merely controlling the flow of information and     viewpoints   in the new</strong> <strong><em>de facto</em></strong> <strong>public square. They are dealing  devastating psychological blows to those who are silenced, as well as  their followers.</strong>      Many of the men and women on social media –  particularly those      sympathetic to our metapolitical convictions – have  nowhere else to go      where they can be with like-minded people, and no other place to to    run   where they can escape the nihilism, despair, and  insanity of  our     political hegemony (to paraphrase Kipling, those who  hear the  same     things they hear and see the same things they see).<a href="https://www.counter-currents.com/2018/09/social-media-censorship-as-psychological-warfare/#_ftn1">[1]</a> For      many, their online friends and the ability to speak their minds and      share observations on social media are the only reprieve they have   from    this postmodern nightmare from which we cannot seem to wake,  and  it    provides a very real support network for those who often have   nobody in    their day-to-day lives with whom they can speak freely   about the   current  cultural malaise.</p>

<p>Deleting     accounts and  thus severing these support networks can – and often   does –   forcibly  isolate the censored individual from the only people   they   know who truly  understand them.  All of these relationships   (many built   over years),  all of the ingenious intellectual material,   all of the   private  conversations that are left unfinished, are all   suddenly  gone   “like  tears in rain.” All of the posts that gave hope   when there  was   none,  all of those confidants, all of those random   memes that  granted   the  only smirk that was had all week – all vanish   without a  trace  into  the  digital ether.</p>

<h1>Ostracism has long been used as a form of social control and punishment.</h1>

<p>The      ancient Greeks would cast out those members of society who were    deemed  a  threat to the city for ten years, cutting them off from their     families,  friends, and familiar surroundings. <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2011/110510WilliamsOstracism.html">Contemporary social psychological research</a> on ostracism proves that <strong>even      slight exclusion, including by strangers, lowers a person’s      self-esteem, mood, and their sense of self-worth, control, and      belonging. Upon being excluded from a group, the same part of the brain      that registers physical pain is activated</strong> – although    studies    also show that the pain of social exclusion lasts even longer    than    physical pain, leading to increased levels of aggression,   lower     productivity and mood, feelings of despair and helplessness,   and even    suicidal ideation.<a href="https://www.counter-currents.com/2018/09/social-media-censorship-as-psychological-warfare/#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>

<p>There      is also the psychological warfare being carried out against those     users  whose accounts are not outright deleted, but rather     “shadowbanned.”  Twitter has claimed in a company <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/Setting-the-record-straight-on-shadow-banning.html">blog post</a>that   they do not shadowban – although a few lines later, they admit  to     ranking content from “bad-faith actors” lower than others. And of       course, a “bad-faith actor” is merely whoever Twitter, Facebook,       YouTube, or the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/adl-anti-defamation-league-facebook-twitter-google-hate-speech/">Anti-Defamation League</a>  deem them to be.</p>

<p>This      is nothing short of gaslighting – given that they are not notified,     all  they can see is the drop in their interactions, giving the     impression  that your messages are no longer being well-received and     that you are  essentially alone, talking to  yourself, causing some to     eventually tire  of trying altogether.</p>

<h1>Social media has a history of psychologically manipulating its users.</h1>

<p>In January 2012, Facebook conducted what has been widely regarded as a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-facebooks-user-20140630-column.html">highly unethical experiment</a>involving   nearly seven hundred thousand unknowing Facebook users. The       experiment divided participants (who were not informed that they  were    in  one) into control and experimental groups. Those subjected to  the      experiment had either positive or negative emotive posts removed   from     their news feeds. Results show that when negative posts were    withheld   from users/participants, they themselves used fewer    emotionally negative   words and began using more positive ones.    Conversely, when positive    posts were withheld from users, they then    used fewer positive emotional    words and began using more negative    ones. <strong>By   manipulating what a person    sees on their social media account,  Facebook  was able to alter the    content the users themselves then  produced</strong>.<a href="https://www.counter-currents.com/2018/09/social-media-censorship-as-psychological-warfare/#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>

<p>The      results were remarkable, researchers found emotional suggestion can      very much happen via online social networks, and social media   companies    can and will intentionally manipulate the mood of their   users. The    connection between mood and emotional well-being to   psychological and    physical health and well-being are   well-established. This knowledge    could be used for everything from   lowering consumers’ moods in order to    encourage impulse buying    (anxiety and depression are known causes of    it) to being used to push    people who are already unstable over the    edge. I would not put   anything  past these people.</p>

<p>There is also those remaining on social media, being gaslit by the absence of those who share their sentiments, to consider. <strong>When      all they  see on their newsfeeds are those sanitized views that     remain,  they begin to think that they are the only “crazy” ones who     have such  ideas</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Twitter,      the Anti-Defamation League, and others are indeed influencing the      political discourse, unilaterally deciding what ideas can be be      discussed and which can’t. Even more insidiously, they are waging a      total war on the hearts and minds of their users. They are separating      people – often vulnerable ones – from their support networks,  with      devastating consequences for some.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>And just like socialism, social media platforms exists outside of market economy i.e. they don’t have to make profit from customers. Wealthy parties, in part governments e.g. Saudis, fund platforms at a loss to eliminate competition. </p>

<p>Which is only possible due to the US dollar, again in part because of governments e.g. Saudis, attaining the status of ‘fiat money’ i.e. a distortion of how ‘credit money’ works, which is more akin to medieval ‘coinage’.</p>

<p>And now these platforms are host to socialist movements, with feminism being the dominant socialist ideology, who’s main grievance with capitalism is wealth inequality.  Which is in large part due to inflation caused by ‘fiat money’ expansion into technology linked to the security state apparatus.</p>

<p>If only socialists would learn something about capitalism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism is the ideology that says those who control manufactured wealth should own the fruits of everyone elses labor and that ideology is implanted by the forced monetization of nation state assets and resources so those who control fiat currency can use it as a means to legitimize global economic robbery by claiming they &quot;paid&quot; for the stock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Socialism is the ideology that says that extraction of economic surplus is theft, whilst simultaneously advocating for government to be the sole extractor of economic surplus, in order to distribute wealth equally.</p>

<p>Fiat money is a necessity of socialism because without it i.e. if credit money is used, it isn&#39;t possible to eradicate independant economic activity, which is necessary to allow government to be the sole administrator of economic life. </p>

<p>Therefore socialism, or rather state capitalism, because socialism is inherently contradictory and unachievable, suffers from the same problem as capitalism in its imperial form. The expansion of fiat money must be inline with the acquisition of new physical assets. And if the expansion of fiat money ceases, inflation redistributes wealth towards the source of money creation i.e. the government, which in turn necessitates the need for government to mislead the population as to why the system isn&#39;t distributing wealth equally.</p>

<p>In practise state capitalism without imperial expansion leads to zero economic surplus being extracted, which leads to stagflation, which leads social instability. And once government has monopolised economic activity, which includes all forms of media, and has adopted a policy of misleading the population due to stagflation, there are zero routes available for people to correct the situation. </p>

<p>Socialism is the road to serfdom, literally. </p>

<p>Which is exactly the same as saying only the government can extract economic surplus.</p>

<p>Under socialism the corporate elite are the government officials. Same problem, different label, and more power concentrated into fewer hands. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Socialism is the ideology that creates a future and a dream for the working people </p>

<p>Here I agree. But like I explained, the dream dies when stagflation sets in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism is the ideology that enslaves them to a hand to mouth existence. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, nature enslaves people to a hand to mouth existence. Capitalism provides a route to something more by allowing economic self interest to dominate - to literally allow people to escape a hand to mouth existence.</p>

<p>Capitalism thrives on slavery. </p>

<p>All socialist economies thus far have used slaves. </p>

<p>Consider that you have no awareness of the public face of capitalism, how likely do you think it is that you understand its private, true face?</p>

<p>All that said, I hope you achieve your goal of living under socialism, you deserve it, LOL.</p>

<p>The Socialist Government does not have to be the psudo royalty pedophile culture that is the American political system. For example in Britain where I grew up, the leader of the opposition&#39;s kids went to the same state highschool I did, they lived in the same town as me. My local member of parliament, the British version of your congressman, sometimes came to the same pub I drank in, he would sit down at the bar and bullshit with the guys ask us if there was anything he needed to know about etc while he had a beer with us. That is government the way it was supposed to be, representatives of the people. If you have not travelled and lived in other countries most of what you think you know, you don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I’m from the UK too. </p>

<p>Post war, the UK was bankrupt due to losing its empire, nationalised industries where paid for in large part from loans from the US which where derived from economic surplus from capitalist industries there.</p>

<p>Eventually the tight grip the government had over the economy had to be wrestled away because UK industries were outdated and unable to compete with foreign counterparts. </p>

<p>Socialism in the UK had failed for exactly the reasons I explained. But please continue to bury your head in the sand, ignoring history because you don’t like successful people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The death of socialism in the UK was economic sabotage. The supposed requirement that British industries compete with foreign industries on price is false narrative to begin with but the most significant evidence of 1970s economic sabotage was the theft of N.Sea oil that should have been Nationalised Industry that would have supported the socialist economy of Britain so to ensure that did not happen N.Sea oil was privatized the truth of what I said is self evident so you can accuse me of not liking success but the fact is, you are a just plain and simply a liar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few years ago I would have agreed with you. But then I realised that my understanding of these things excluded the perspective of neo-liberals.</p>

<p>The fact is, that the post-war consensus relied on borrowing from the US, which in turn depended on the US economy producing an economic surplus, and control over foreign assets such as the Anglo-Iranian oil company, which was eventually lost.</p>

<p>There was also a very significant change in global power dynamics in the 1970s when the Saudi’s realised they could influence inflation via oil production levels. Plus the US economy was no longer producing an economic surplus.</p>

<p>When Thatcher said there was no other alternative to neo-liberal reforms she was right. The old British socialism wasn’t working, it produced stagflation and neo-liberals were the only group offering an alternative.</p>

<p>Privatising state assets, although usually a very corrupt process, removes the financial burden from government, which is needed when revenue from nationalised industries and tax isn’t sufficient to cover operations, let alone modernisation.</p>

<p>Here’s something that significantly changed my perspective on these things (and is also very Milton Friedman-ish):</p>

<p>Money isn’t wealth, it’s a intermediary of exchange. Wealth is real stuff like goods and services. Money is universal IOU, you receive it when exchanging something real, like goods and services, because you haven’t yet received your side of the exchange, which you do when spending the money. </p>

<p>Creating more money doesn’t create more wealth, it only distributes wealth towards those who receive the new money first. Which in the days of British socialism was the government, and since the Clinton, Blair years is hedge funds.</p>

<p>The post-war Breton Woods system relied on government control over money creation. And the failure of this system was the result of money creation continuing despite reductions in new essential assets like oil.</p>

<p>The centralised system was replaced by a distributed system, which then produced a new centralised system of monopoly businesses aided by government trade deals.</p>

<p>So the only solution today is to treat the new monopolised system as the same as the old socialist system and turn it into a distributed system once again.</p>

<p>The only problems with doing that are wrestling control away from the monopoly businesses and persuading socialist to stop aiding the people they’re against.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>See, right there is one of the biggest lies but I am not going to attack you for reciting the capitalist propaganda message the Thatcher regime spewed at every opportunity because if you have not really gone into this you might have no reason to disbelieve it but I will explain why you should.</p>

<p>State assets a financial burden? State assets provided millions of secure well paid jobs for the British people. So what they did? They privatised. Shed millions of  jobs, cut the payroll and siphoned off the money that was previously been payed to working class Britain as their wages and benefits and diverted it to the pockets of the wealthy stock owning corporate elite.</p>

<p>It was absolute robbery. The result of that, millions of well paid jobs no longer there for the British people who are now instead making crappy low incomes working as corporate wage slaves. Low incomes means less tax revenue, less tax revenue means austerity.</p>

<p>I already mentioned N.Sea oil which should have been a bonanza for socialist Britain but by then the economic sabotage was already under way. Remember this was the Vietnam war era where the wealthy were rabidly attacking anything that threatened their &quot;wealth takes all&quot;, system. There was absolutely no way they were ever going to allow Socialist Britain to continue to divert the profits of the means of production, nation state industry into the hands of working class Britain</p>

<p>I already mentioned N.Sea Oil so lets take the Post Office as another example, an industry known to burden state resources because the cost of sending mail is usually subsidized. The British Post Office was not just about mail, if you remember, the Post Office was also the highly profitable Telecoms which was not only more than capable of carrying burden of supporting the cheap mail service but was also an excellent employer providing well paid good secure jobs with training programs, good overtime, shift bonuses. British working people built their future on those jobs, bought houses, brought up families. </p>

<p>Now look, Thatcher took office in 1979. They separated the Telecoms from the Post Office the following year. In 1980 British Telecom was born. That waa obviously pre planned in preparation for privatization some years later in 1985. You see now? The entire purpose was to get their hands on the profits of the British people&#39;s national assets while crushing the working classes. That was Thatchers primary purpose and the separation of the highly profitable Telecoms section from the Post office is undeniable proof of that intention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By quoting me and then making your argument you’ve left me in a strange position - my quote explains the reasoning behind what you’ve explained.</p>

<p>Also you seem to mixing up timelines. Vietnam war ended 1975, neo-liberal reforms were 1980s.</p>

<p>If you want to argue that Vietnam War spending contributed to the problems of the 197Os, that’s fair. You could also argue that if the war didn’t happen, the problems would’ve appeared 10 years later, leading to reforms in the 90s.</p>

<p>Anyway:</p>

<p>STAGFLATION ! - inflation + stagnation.</p>

<p>The profitable nationalised industries, as you see it, weren’t profitable. They were operating at a loss. Money creation was being used to cover the losses. Which also meant there was no surplus available for modernisation.</p>

<p>Now, privatisations post 1980, (early 1990s for Ex Soviet sphere), that’s a different matter. By then the largest contributing to the IMF was also the largest deficit country, which Britain was in the 1970s, and also still a contributor. </p>

<p>The other thing that doesn’t get mentioned, because it offends lefties - hatred of rich people was considered the norm in Socialist Britain, even though it still had many rich land owners, newspaper owners etc. So you can understand the the reaction when Socialists were proven wrong about the economy, and as Socialists claim they are for the poor, this naturally got interpreted as rich people hate the poor.</p>

<p>But we’re not in a neo-liberal, socialist or keynesian world anymore, where in all these together world. </p>

<p>Socialism is now media interference. Keynesianism deals with financial crisis fine, broadcast neo-liberalism (or is it now Feminism Inc) is military propaganda, neo-liberalism is still good for internal economy (socialised spending level adjustable based on debt + tax). What’s needed is a new global intermediary of exchange, adjustable through... this is the problem. </p>

<p>Any nice talking.</p>

<p>How the fuck you think Wall Street investors are going to buy stock in the sell of of loss making industry?? The reason they bought it was, it was highly profitable industry.</p>

<p>Those profits had been used to provide millions of good jobs and paid for government services. Then people just like you said, fuck the British peoples jobs, fuck the British people&#39;s incomes, fuck the British people&#39;s Government services we, the leeches, the liars, the deceitful sneaky little snakes of society, we are going to conspire and deceive, we are going to run for office with the deliberate intention of sabotaging Britain from the inside to create a climate where the people will accept the theft of their national assets by the 1%.</p>
