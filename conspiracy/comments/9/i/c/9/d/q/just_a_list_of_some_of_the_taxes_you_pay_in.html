       The only tax that doesn't hurt the taxpayer at all. He's dead.

       Seriously though, I'm all for taxing beyond a certain level. Otherwise the super wealthy accrue money and this power over a few generations and before you know it, we are back to feudalism.

      <p>
       The estate tax was created to end feudalism, abolishing it could bring it back.

       The thing is, the rich found clever ways around it. They put it in trusts and non-profits. They've been doing this for years even with the estate tax. Taxes only hurt the rest of us just like most if not all taxes.

       It's not just the US federal estate tax. It's all the taxes that come with the death and inheritances of an individuals "estate". Whether federal or state. Also, estate valuation of 5.4 million is not that much money. Two married lawyers or doctors could easily have an estate valued at that. Hell, even small businesses owners could. Then there is the trickle down effect of it.

       For example: Small business owner with multiple business chains, dies and the family gets hit with a heavy tax. They have to pay the tax and in order to make it work, they have to close down one or two chains which makes their employees now unemployed.

       In otherwords they are a failing business or a part of the 1% and are lying about the reason to close down the other businesses.

       It's one of those arguments that's similar to not raising minimum wage. If you as a business owner cannot handle paying people a living wage, or cannot handle expected taxes - you are not a successful business owner.

       Recognizing that capitalism leads to feudalism without checks is a pretty basic step pretty much everyone goes through in 6th or 7th grade when they learn about civics. Unbridled capitalism leads to the situation we're in now where .1% own a majority of the wealth and we're essentially serfs.

       I get it, I actually love the idea of Libertarianism - the problem is like communism it does not work in real life. It can't. Humans are terrible at being people, libertarianism causes slavery and death, the same as communism.

       Having reasonable taxes that the average person will
       <strong>
        never
       </strong>
       encounter in order to add one more step in preventing an entirely unequal system I think isn't too unreasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although we could simply skip that and have a tax grade like we did during America's Golden age. Top 5% pay 90% income taxes from all sources. Damn good republican plan that was, and I'm amazed it isn't coming up for debate anymore.

       If I can chime in, I’d love it if farm land could be exempt from the estate tax. We’re looking at losing a sizeable portion of our farm when my grandma passes. Farmers are land rich and cash poor (not really, we make enough to get by but the amount doesn’t reflect the value of our estates). And to say we should just be running our farm better to be able to afford it is laughable.

       All this comment says is you have no idea what happens when running a business. 5m isnt that much money. its not even enough to not have to work again if you want to live decently. yanno why? BECAUSE FUCKING HALF OF IT GETS TAKEN AWAY

       Because most people won't be taxed when they day. The average person will never deal with the estate tax, especially since it was raised. Simply put the estate tax is
       <strong>
        over
       </strong>
       the average amount an American will be worth if all their assets and earnings over their entire lifetime were combined.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you just work a 9-5 and you just buy one property, you will not hit an estate tax.

      <p>
       5m just straight cash? Assuming taxes were already paid on that wealth accumulation that is more than enough for any American to live a lavish lifestyle from age 20 to age 80. That's 83k a year, that's more than you make. I can say that statistically as that's far above what the average American makes.

       You inherently misunderstand criticism of capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not 'oh well you must not work hard enough if you're not successful hurr' it's usually 'oh hey those that did get successful while enjoying the things taxes buy like security, infrastructure, and a secure consumer base then outcompetes you forever if you try to be competition to them, as there is no effective way to limit their wealth and they do not pay back into the society that created them in any meaningful way.'
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wealthy need to be taxed more, the majority of billionaires did nothing for their money except fight their way out of a vagina at one point. Familial wealth holding is inherently an oppressive system of the masses and is inevitable without other controls on wealth transfer or accumulation. To remove this is to say 'You know 1984? What if it was just privatized?' and be happy with your Victory Gin.

       It's a tax to encourage the extremely wealthy to not hoard their wealth in the family for generations and 99% of people outspoken about it well never even come close to paying it.  It will benefit them by encouraging wealthy family's to donate to charity or invest back in the business and community's or idk... spend it.

       Technically speaking income tax is constitutional because of the16th amendment. However, I don't see how that amendment could have possibly been ratified by the citizenry.

       Just a list of some of the tax-like fees you pay when you buy something from a large conglomerate:
      </p>
      <p>
       The campaign funding surcharge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "independent" electioneering surcharge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The move-it-across-the-ocean expense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 270:1 upper management salary tax fee.
      </p>
      <p>
       The billions per year advertising expense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cost of financing the debt created by the hedge fund takeover.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bought-the-competition anti-competitive surcharge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The TOS law department expense because they need large teams of expensive lawyers to make sure you sign away your rights.

       Now consider that though you may only directly pay 8% on any given sale - pretty much every time the ingredients/parts changed hands - from the time it was raw resources - it was also taxed. And that tax - and all that tax is passed on to the consumer. Makes ya wonder what stuff would actually cost without it...

       Normaly the costs for this tax is transfered in each step of production and sales. So the tax only aplies once for the consumer. Not sure if this is true in the US though.

       Incorrect.
Anytime I purchase something as long as it's not the final step in the sale process I don't have to pay taxes on the item. I do jewelry in the garage as a side hustle. When I buy stones or gold/silver I pay zero tax on it. I just provide my tax ID to the vendor. If I buy a new tool I have to pay a tax on it.

       Exactly. Taxes are not the problem. It's what is being done with those taxes. Taxes in other countries go to fund universal healthcare, education/higher education, investment in infrastructure and innovation. Go look at places like the Nordic nations, the highest taxed nations in the world, who while having much higher tax rates also rank far higher on global happiness/human development indexes than countries like USA.

       They also rate much higher on the rankings of economic freedom than the US does, with much fewer business regulations, no minimum wage, very small % business payroll contribution to the government, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Most politicians who hold up the Nordic nations as examples of what we should do for personal income taxation and welfare program spending have no intention of following what the Nordic nations do for economic freedom to drive their economies.

       Not here in calfornia, but I heard more taxes are on the way so we may turn a corner and see some of those benefits, and my children will see that tax utopia they will have established.

       You could tax us at 2-5% and cover any necessity. Today we're taxed over 30%, closer to 35% if I'm not mistaken. Dems want to drastically raise it, as usual.

       I agree, taxes are a necessity. How we are taxed is disgusting. We  are taxed by all of the above. Where does the money come from to pay taxes? You the consumer, who pays for products and services, government, etc. Who pays you to have a job. They pay you with already taxed money from which you get taxed. It’s a never ending loop of taxes. 
End income taxes. Increase sales tax on everything but essential items. You make more, you spend more, you pay more taxes. You make little, you spend little, you pay little to no taxes.

       You've been trained to think that, because your entire life has been spent under the vampiric private central banking scheme.  Why would you think any different?  It's not like a less corrupted government could finance an economy directly, through agriculture, infrastructure, and other needs first, instead of handing it to private banks, to profit as much as they like, and control the entire economy of the nation/world.

       Some taxes are necessary.  Some are immoral.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel income tax is immoral as taxing a human being's labor is nearly akin to communism.  What a man earns by his sweat and blood should, obviously, be his to keep.  100%.  The taxes will come later, when he spends his keep.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Canada and U.S. ,  Income tax perception was introduced as temporary measures to help in the respective countries war efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the wars passed and peace returned,  Governments never felt the need to remove the initially "temporary" measures that were put in place to tax the people.  Why kill the cash cow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some claim, that both sides were manipulated and financed by the same organisation .  This  view hints that the "pre-planned" wars provide an occasion that government can use tax the citizens.  The citizens terrified by war violence and mass propaganda willingly accept being taxed for the noble cause of fighting evil and preventing a national war loss.

       Here's some of the "stupid tax" people pay:
      </p>
      <p>
       Car payment, phone finance and service payment, credit cardS paymentS, cigarettes, bars, take out food. Student loans if you have a useless degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm debt-free, pay $35 for phone service, and cook most of my meals. And my college degree paid for itself. My excessive disposable income lets me take nice vacations AND plan to retire early. And no, I didn't start on 3rd base; my parents were poor immigrants and I grew up in the inner city. And since I'm so familiar with Europe, I'm actually pretty happy with my taxes.

       Absolutely no taxes are involuntary, you control exactly what you are taxed on in a democratic society. As practically all taxes are controlled exclusively by congress, you easily have the power to run and cut taxes.

       I also don't hunt, I don't fish, don't travel, my state supports common law marriages without need for a license, and I don't have a business or a pet, and I've never needed an animal license for pets in the past.

       Income tax can be both federal and state (some states do not tax income) social security tax (which you may or may not get back, but can I not save for my retirement in my own way?) Medicare tax
      </p>
      <p>
       And one coming down the pipeline is a carbon tax apparently.

       I think representatives salaries should be no higher than the median income of their constituents (of course this would just lead to gerrymandering or some other form of gaming the system?

       This is great and all, but do you have some sort of alternative or a solution?
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise this post comes off a bit degenerate.
We know we pay absurd taxes, that’s deserved of an insult?
Because we live in a country that demands taxes?
      </p>
      <p>
       How is that any individual citizens fault, it’s not like there’s an “opt-out” of taxes, instead of just highlighting a problem, I think more people should propose a solution.

       The bulk of taxation is income, property and sales taxes which only loosely fund local services. Lots of graft and waste pilfer them down before I notice any benefits.

       Someone has to pay the taxes and the richest keep cutting theirs and increasing yours.

       Remember all those tariffs Trump has imposed on his, enemy nations.

       You and I pay them. Tariffs are on the imported products and paid by the importing nation.

       WalMart says it will increase  prices on, and just in time for Christmas shopping season but no one has a pay increase and everything else has already increased.  Housing, transportation, health care, gasoline and utilities, state and local taxes, groceries, all of the necessities.

       You dont think this will hurt china? I own a small business, SPECIFICALLY importing china goods. I can get through these TEMPORAry tarrifs way easier than Obamas fucking 300 regulations and suck my cock taxes, that only hurt the small guy. Corps already have the lawyers and capital to fight. These regulations make it so nobody else can reach their level. you’re an idiot if you think the candidates that want to tax 80% are helping the people. Great idea, make it 99% harder to start a business.

       Tariffs are needed to fill in the hole created by the tax cuts.  I don't object to the corporate tax cut, they were avoiding their taxes anyway, but someone h as to fill in the gaps for the tax cuts to the wealthiest.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Obama regulation hurt you, and what tax increase?  I think the only tax increase were the ones that came with the ACA, a tax on tanning booths, and some medical devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wage suppression and the increase in local and state taxes to compensate for the federal taxes are what is hurting  your business.

       Honestly a lot of taxes make sense to me. Things like hunting/fishing tax helps pay for forestry stuff, building taxes make sure the buildings are up to code and aren't going to collapse on people. It's just that I don't make a lot of money after paying electric, gas, water, rent, internet, food. These little taxes seem so shitty because everything that's privatized, like electricity and internet is so goddamn expensive. I wish I could just pay a $5 internet tax a paycheck instead of having to pay Comcast $100 a month.

       yup. in a sane world, insurance is a luxury, not a necessity.

       Here's one tax that pisses me off ... the REPEATED TAX that is charged EVERY time a used vehicle is sold
      </p>
      <p>
       When a new car, say $35,000 USD is sold, it's taxed at ~8% depending where you live
      </p>
      <p>
       That guy sells it 2-3 years later for $20,000 and the new owner is taxed again
      </p>
      <p>
       2-3 years later, it sells for $10k ... then 5k, then 2k a couple of times
      </p>
      <p>
       By the time that vehicle hits the junkyard, it's taxed at least triple the original purchase price tax was there to cover

       knowledge does not become pointless just because it is not being used. knowledge is applied when needed.

       it's not an action? what is it then? posts like these are created to provoke discussion, and to awaken the intellect in those who have any.

       No, you are wrong my friend. Post like yours don’t spark creative discussion on a topic. You just sound pretentious with your basic information. You haven’t provided anything new or challenged any systems. A better way to promote discussion would be to point to the origins of taxes in ancient Egypt and to try to uncover why they were invented, the proliferation of the idea, and what countries do it wrong and right in history and to today. Not just say “good luck paying taxes for everything slaves!”  You just come off like a high schooler thinking he’s cool with some edgy information.

       I find income tax and property tax to be the most egregious abuse.

       They are both unconstitutional. But I guess that doesn't matter anymore to the people in charge.

       Absolutely no taxes are involuntary, you control exactly what you are taxed on in a democratic society. As practically all taxes are controlled exclusively by congress, you easily have the power to run and cut taxes.

       Republicans have had a successful election promise of that for 80 years. People think they want it, why not be the one to actually do it?

       Now consider that though you may only directly pay 8% on any given sale - pretty much every time the ingredients/parts changed hands - from the time it was raw resources - it was also taxed. And that tax - and all that tax is passed on to the consumer. Makes ya wonder what stuff would actually cost without it...
