       He doesn’t directly communicate with me but through signs, conversations I have with other people and so forth.

       This is a fake world lol.

       I think he wants me to figure out why I got bullied when I was in high school and/or how 9 / 11 played out.

       It happened when I was 5-6. I don’t know how much of this is all fake. WW2 might even be fabricated.

       Well, everyone can claim God speaks to them or communicates somehow via signs and etc., I don't think you're alone in that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think God invented the smartphones, ACs and computers. We did. Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 was inside job. Not buying any of the explanations the government comes with. We've been lied to, and they will continue to do so until the civilization of today has woken up and sees through their lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       WW1/2 was just like all the other wars the past 4-5 decades, the rich manipulating the puppets into war so they could get richer. Stealing resources, controlling territories, controll the people by brainwashing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is fake? Nah, the people in it are fake. We're a materialistic civilization. Everyone wants more. They're never happy with what they. There's always something more. Money, cars, all the unnecessary sh*t we need to buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This planet is real. The world we live in is real. People just can't understand what's real, let alone how to describe it. It's just so difficult for people to understand and see how things work. All from micro- to macroscopic.

       Alright, tap the brakes for a second. So, essentially what you're saying is that I died on 9/11, in my 7th grade class? And ever since then, I was basically reincarnated by aliens or I am now currently an Alien?

       You already said that in previous comments... But, why would a "god" do such a thing?  When was it?Was it immediate reincarnation? How did the reincarnation take place? Did I physically die, and come back to life at   the age of 12? Why is it if I died, and were reincarnated... how have I retained a vast majority of my childhood Memories, as well as, my Consciousness?  How do you know that this "god" who can apparently reincarnate is in fact the supreme source? How do you know for sure that  "God" is real, and it is communicating with you and you're not just an undiagnosed skitzo?

       this tech is not new, it has been suppressed for almost a century. here is nikola tesla describing a cellphone in the early 20th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       "When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do his will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket."

       I dont believe posts like this. There is all of a sudden a rise in crazy posts within the last year. People thinking god is talking to them, people hearing voices, people beinh gang stallked. I don't believe you. And if this is real, then get help. God is not communicating with you.

       I once had something so strange happen to me that it left me in chills sitting in my office staring at my computer screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was at my friends place, and we were going over some old drives of his looking for a file, we came across some old pics of his and moved on still looking for a file.
      </p>
      <p>
       I later get home and plug my flash drive that was not only ever plugged into his computer, the photos we came across were on a separate drive in his office.
      </p>
      <p>
       I plugged the drive in, opened it up and there was a folder with his pics in it. I was like wtf is happening here, I better email him and let him know. I switched windows to start the email, then went back to my drive to look for the pictures, no trace of them ever being on there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not delete them, and there is no way they could have been there in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this may not sound so out there, but I work with computers every day, and I know what I experienced and I know there is NO WAY those photos could have been on that drive, which reality seems to have corrected.
