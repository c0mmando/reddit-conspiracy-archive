       White Pride has become illegal in the West. Even though racial tribalism and in group racial preferences are completely normal and natural phenomenons we see a systematic effort among many capitalist elites trying to suppress these innate desires in white people. We see the forced integration programs the government puts out to “diversify” white communities, white schools, and white businesses. We see the crackdown on pro-white groups from the SPLC, and the ADL, 2 Organizations that big social media companies trust to filter out “hate speech”. We see the egregiously unfair prison sentences of white nationalists involved with the Charlottesville riots. We see so-called “mainstream” media continuing to churn out articles daily about how whites need to give up their privileges and how we need to celebrate diversity. We see the FBI investigations of explicitly non-violent white nationalist groups. We see the banning of white student unions on college campuses when every other group is allowed to have their own meet up. We see the education system indoctrinating our youth on the subjects of slavery and the Holocaust when they are as young as 5 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is almost criminal to have pride in your race if you are a white person. These conditions have led us down a sad state of affairs. We have had to replace this missing community and missing identity with things as silly as College Football. We pay these African students to go to school for free just so they can play football. These kids don’t care about school. They skip class all the time. They walk around like they own the place. They are often involved in rape and domestic violence scandals. Not all, but many. And we cheer them on as if we are a part of their success when they would never be friends with us and we share very little in common at the end of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are of Europe. We are of Rome. We are of Athens. We are of Byzantium. All of this history is ingrained deep within our spirit and the establishment tells us we can’t tap into that. We are Warriors. Have an identity dammit.

       SS: White pride is unofficially illegal in the West. Every other group is allowed to be proud of their ancestors. Proud of their history. Proud of their race. But when it comes to whites we are expected to be atomized individuals that can’t organize based on race no matter how normal and natural that is. We are terrified to express our true desires. We want our communities to be white. We want our schools to be white. We want our country to be white. The data shows this to be true over and over again. But we are terrified to say it. Well dammit I will say it. It’s ok to love your race. It’s ok to want to live with other whites. It’s ok if you want to mate with whites. It’s ok if you want to send your children to white schools. It’s ok if you want to live in a white country. It’s ok to be white.

       That’s a disingenuous question. What race are you? What do you think about the phenomenon of “white flight” that occurs every time they try to  force integration on white communities? 
Would you leave your neighborhood if it became too ghetto?

       I honestly think that’s a cringe quote because I don’t want to preserve the white race in its current form. I want us to become something we can be proud of instead of football watching couch potato lazy video game players. When we do become great again that will be a beautiful quote

       It's the same for all races. It's human nature to prefer to be around people that look like you. Nothing wrong with that.

       Take California for example. Many neighborhoods that used to be mostly/all black are now hispanic.

       Ph.D in history here.  Part of the problem is you're swept up in outdated, disproven ideas of "race".  It's a classification no longer used by any scholar with a modern education.  "Race" -based science didn't add anything useful to the body of scientific, anthropological, or historical knowledge, so we moved on.  Literally hundreds of years worth of research has been done to deconstruct the idea and no one who's read a shit ton of books or looked at good data still clings to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing is that you're leaving out social dynamics, specifically the relationship between a majority and a minority.  It's one thing, as a minority, to celebrate the cultural aspects that bring your small group together in the face of a sea of different people that surround you.  It's completely another, as the majority, as the absolute definition of "mainstream" culture, to celebrate your dominance.  It's just a dick move.  Also, the majority ethnic culture is often lost in the mainstream.  Can you name an aspect of "white" culture that couldn't simply be described as "mainstream American culture?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, however, you can disprove yourself by simply travelling around a place like Europe or the US.  Everywhere you go, there are festivals, fairs, etc., each celebrating heritage. Europeans know how to celebrate their heritage--Scottish, English, Welsh, Swede, Norwegian, Danish, German, Italian, you name it.  They're all proud of their heritage and none of it revolves around some imaginary idea of a "white" race or even a "European" heritage.  It's food, music, fashion, language, games, etc., each things that have to do with geography and time, not ethnicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm not pretending that you could be convinced, but you've gotta consider the fact that hardly anyone with any experience analyzing what you're talking about from the perspective of good data, good history, and good science, agrees with your interpretation.  Education is a bitch.  Google Derek Black.  Must have stung to have lost him.

       The white race is in a sad state of affairs right now and literally the only way it can be saved is if we all come together and motivate each other to be better. Rome wasn’t built by individuals it was built by a collective of determined warriors United by race and history. We need to organize into a collective if we want to be great again and you have no right to stop us

       We are more than a check mark on a census form. We have a history. A story. Mexicans don’t share that same story as us and that’s ok. They should not be listed as “white” on the census but I don’t put much stock in what the census has to say. A 23 and me test is much more accurate on race than some arbitrary census

       The term "White" is just as arbitrary as any census form and has been redefined countless times. The human genome project proved there is virtually no genetic difference between 'folk' races.

       Race is real. The races of man are much different from each other too. You forget to mention that we have DNA that’s 98% similar to Chimpanzees.  The tiniest difference in the genetic code can bring about major differences

       Jews have played a major role in mass immigration to the west, suppression of white identity, and social engineering in popular culture weakening us as a people. It’s not about hating Jews, it’s about realizing how they are fundamentally different from us and how those differences are incompatible if you want a healthy, unified society.

       Ok and if he showed you evidence of Jewish people hating whites that would justify his hating them would that be considered ok or anti Semitic? Every time people post evidence of Jewish hatred of white people it becomes anti Semitic. Every time jewish people say they aren’t white that’s ok because they are not but it’s also ok when they say they are white too which makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jewish people are not white and that’s self proclaimed and proven by their own methods of genetic testing for Israeli citizenship.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people point out jewish people as not white while jewish people proclaim they are white to make some political or religious statement it’s considered anti-Semitic.
      </p>
      <p>
       When jewish run Hollywood is shown to be racist in hiring practices and predatory on women it’s somehow white males faults and they deserve less movie and tv roles or positions of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s like they use white people as a shield and hide behind whiteness when it suits them

       "White pride" isn't about being proud of who you are, it's about being proud of who you aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it's about being proud of who you are, you get heritage festivals for Italians, or Scottish, or Irish, or Germans, and you have food, and music, and art, and dancing.
      </p>
      <p>
       "White pride" is about "those dirty blacks" and "those rapist mexicans" and "those barbarian Muslims" etc.

       Yup, I look at skin color and also a set of key genetics as well. But for many others, they try to debate there is no such thing, yadda yadda, Jews will say they are white sometimes and then other times say they aren't when they are in debates with Minorities, so really it all depends on a number of factors

        I know how that works but how do you apply it? Do you just ask random strangers for a cheek swap so you can determine if they are white?

       Exactly. If they don't cooperate, you can usually swab their straw they're DRI Ming from or form is good too, but for the most part people are cool about it if you ever to send them the DNA results

       Haplogroup J split from IJ about 10k years or so ago. IJ and I are Scandinavian and Northern European. Everywhere you find I you find J in smaller amounts too. J is found all over Europe, just in larger (but still small relatively speaking) amounts in Southern Europe and of course it is the predominant haplogroup in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       R1a and R1b split off from and Mongoid Asiatic haplogroup in Siberia and are unrelated to G, H, I, and J. G and H are the only haplogroups found in Western Europe 5k years and more ago. What does that tell us about R? You know that modified merchant they use for Finns with Asiatic features? Yeah... R1b.... "White"
      </p>
      <p>
       So Nordic, British, Irish, Slavic, basically most of Europe before the entrance of 3rd world refugees. There's plenty of science and facts about this if you go and do your own research. It's really simple to do

       I am still asking because you are still failing to explain what "white race" means.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Basically most of Europe" is not a definition. That's a geographic area and not clearly defined.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that leaves genetics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, please explain how you can distinguish between a white person and a non-white person using genetics.

      <p>
       Which Haplogroup defines whiteness and are you claiming that each carrier of those "white" Haplogroups can be considered "white"?

       It's really simple, but for some reason you are really complicating it to yourself. There are also key sets of genetics associated with whites provided to you in the link I sent you.

        Edwards argued that while Lewontin's statements on variability are correct when examining the frequency of different alleles (variants of a particular gene) at an individual locus (the location of a particular gene) between individuals, it is nonetheless possible to classify individuals into different racial groups with an accuracy that approaches 100 percent when one takes into account the frequency of the alleles at several loci at the same time.

       I know right, I've arguing with people that LeBron James is white, but they just don't get it. Me and you seem to be alot alike. It's clear Kanye West and LeBron are white, but when people tell me that's not true,  And I ask them for proof, no one can provide the proper definition. I think k it's just most people are racist and hate whites so they do t want to admit LeBron is white

       St. Patrick’s Day when a bunch of drunken blokes get together and chug alcohol like a bunch of fat degenerates. I was thinking more along the lines of white collectivism that reaches for the stars not white collectivism that degenerates our bodies, minds, and souls

       Ok, arm chair lingustics professor. You realize it's specifically the  community that gives 'white pride' a bad name and not the fact they are proud right? And you understand that communities that celebrate 'gay' and 'black' pride are discremenated and victimized especailly when they are publically proud? Quit crying about being a victim, it's what you want.

       Nope.  It is definitely discriminatory against a group, but that doesn’t make it about race or inherently unethical.  His clearly stated ethical principle is that he hates racists for their active discrimination against others based on their physical appearance rather than their actions.  Doing so is unethical because there is no direct causation between these attributes and any substantive qualities of value.
      </p>
      <p>
       His discrimination is entirely ethical because it is has a direct causal relationship between a racists choice to discriminate unethically.

       It’s not that I don’t get the joke  “What do you mean ‘YOU people’?!?”  It is just that jokes are contextual.  Your joke doesn’t sound like a joke when it’s surrounded by racists arguing for thier racist ideas.

       I’ve never been accused of that before so I called that out - and regarding your other points I haven’t argued with anyone.  My first comment was “wtf is your problem arguing with everyone” my second comment to him was “it’s over the top” and my third was a sarcastic joke and everyone’s jumping on it.  I don’t see how any of those things are instigating hateful comments or arguments at all.  I don’t see any troll behaviour in there either so.  Believe what you want lol.

       If this isn't an argument, which it is (as you accused him of the same exact thing you're doing) then it's certianly an attempt to instigate. "holier than though or what". Come the fuck on dude you're like glass, so transparent with that shit.

       Never said anything about hate. Said either a troll OR an instigator, and you've definitely instigated....I didn't even comment to you originally and you responded to that.

       and you laughed and just made fun of him. Saying you were joking. You don't even have a point or a counter argument.

      <p>
       Saying you people in this context is the same as saying "you guys". I get you were joking, but you then backed it up with

      <p>
       The only reason to make that argument is if you're trying to discredit his opinion (this is what I believe) and regardless, the argument only stands a chance in a jester's court.

      <p>
       Yup, I have a specific set of cards in my wallet and I go up to people I'm unsure about and start comparing the cards. Have almost gotten into a lot of fights because of it so no I only check old people, smaller women, and liberals

       Theyre called cheek swabs and test kits, maybe you should get the vernacular correct before trying to have these sorts of technical scientific findings

       Oh I can. If you want a concrete answer, find the shittiest minority neighborhood you can find, move there, and live there for 1 year. Hands on school of hard knocks

       I am still asking because you are still failing to explain what "white race" means.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Basically most of Europe" is not a definition. That's a geographic area and not clearly defined.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that leaves genetics.
      </p>

       Again, please explain how you can distinguish between a white person and a non-white person using genetics.

       Which Haplogroup defines whiteness and are you claiming that each carrier of those "white" Haplogroups can be considered "white"?
