        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Macs death has hurt us all, and I keep thinking about it more and more. Nobody saw Mac after he went home after drinking and watching football with friends. He was discovered the next morning by his assistant who promptly called paramedics. I&#39;m not sure how long it took them to arrive on scene, but it couldn&#39;t have been more than 10 minutes considering its a celebrity neighborhood. Now, police say they found no paraphernalia or drugs in the house, other than a little bit of white powder somewhere in the house. Now I dont know about you, but I dont think 10 minutes is enough to wipe a literal mansion clean of all drugs and such. And even if someone did wipe it clean before authorities arrived, why would they leave the white powder out? No razor blade, no mirror, no straw or rolled up dollar found. I dont think the assistant cleaned before calling the paramedics, and I dont think they had enough time to clean the mansion before they arrived. And even if they did clean it before authorities got there, what happened to the paraphernalia? Was it taken with them, did they throw it in the trash?</p>

<p>The police say there were no signs of foul play, which they came to the conclusion rather quickly. Also, it takes 6 weeks or more for toxicology, but only days to test a substance. Why have we not heard what the powder is that they found? It doesnt add up to me. Maybe I&#39;m grasping at straws because he was so important to me, but this is just as fishy as Cobain&#39;s death. Mac was reportedly doing well according to his friends, much better mentally than the media portrayed him as being. And the newest album sounded very positive and uplifting, like he was coming to terms with life. I dont think he relapsed, I dont think he tried doing his old amount and overdosed. I think Mac Miller was murdered. If you look at police reports since August multiple celebrity homes have been robbed, including John Mayer, Post Malone (attempted, he didnt live there anymore), and now Chief Keef. If Mac Miller did overdose, I believe he was forced to do so against his will. It doesnt make sense for all paraphernalia to be cleaned up and gone, if someone did clean the house, but white powder to be left out in plain sight for authorities to find.</p>

<p>There are powers that be and a shadow society that keeps people in check when they step put of line. Some woman just took out a restraining order on beyonce for supposedly killing her kitten and doing some voodoo/occult stuff on her. Post Malone even said the last thing Mac said to him was &quot;be safe&quot;, which struck him as odd. Anyone have any thoughts or input? Dont downvote me to oblivion, I am grieving with the rest of us and trying to make sense of what happened.</p>

I couldn&#39;t even tell you a mac miller song so it has nothing to do with me being a fan because Im certainly not one.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m well aware. But the lack of evidence of a drug overdose is what is bothering me so much. The police said his house was completely clean of drugs and paraphernalia, except a little bit of white powder. If you&#39;re cleaning up a crime scene and manage to get everything used to abuse drugs, how do you overlook leaving a substance out? If he was snorting shit the mirror/blade/straw or whatever would be right next to the substance. The powder seems to me like a plant to throw authorities off the trail of something more sinister</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mac is known for using dollar bill&#39;s. Theres an interview where he admits he had an intern to clean the blood off his dollars for him. And ok, say he did scarface it. You really think there would only be 1 type of drug in that house if he was abusing again? He was a poly substanceabuse, there should have been more than just 1 drug in there if he was using again. Which makes the white powder being left in plain sight even more odd since everything else was wiped</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you listen to his album it seems he probably knew he was gonna die. Personally I think he purposely killed himself. Here&#39;s the lyrics throughout which lead me to believe that. </p>

<p>Come Back To Earth  </p>

<p>&quot;I just need a way out of my head. I&#39;d do anything for a way out of my head... All the things I&#39;d do to spend a little time in hell... Grey skies and I&#39;m drifting, not living forever. They told me it only gets better.&quot;</p>

<p>Perfecto</p>

<p>&quot;The cards is all on the table I&#39;m callin&#39; it. Don&#39;t say it I swallow it&quot;. I assume this lines meaning is &quot;calling it quits&quot; but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to say it. Obviously also refers to calling in poker (bars, son)</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m treading water I swear
That if I drown I don&#39;t care&quot;</p>

<p>Self Care</p>

<p>&quot;Like September I fall down below, now I know that the medicine be on call... I got all the time in the world so for now I&#39;m just chilling. Plus I know it&#39;s a beautiful feeling in oblivion&quot; (compare this to what he said in REMember, about a dead friend: &quot;heard he moved to a place where the time don&#39;t end, so you don&#39;t need money, all you got is time to spend&quot;</p>

<p>Wings</p>

<p>&quot;I ain&#39;t worried now &#39;til I leave
I&#39;m just tryna ride, feel the breeze
With something bad beside next to me... Trust is a problem, never know how, yeah
That&#39;s why I just keep to myself
Get what I need, then I&#39;ll be out..
 I&#39;d put some money on forever, but I
don&#39;t like to gamble on the weather, so I just watch while the sun is shinin&#39;, I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin&#39; wider, I just hope I never find em. These are my wings.&quot; </p>

<p>Small Worlds </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, nine times out of ten I get it wrong
That&#39;s why I wrote this song, told myself to hold on
I can feel my fingers slippin&#39;, in a motherfuckin&#39; instant I&#39;ll be gone
Do you want it all if it&#39;s all mediocre&quot;</p>

<p>Jet Fuel</p>

<p>&quot;Used to want to be a superhero, fly around with a cape catching bad guys. Now my heads underwater but I ain&#39;t in the shower and I ain&#39;t getting baptized. To the good and the bad times, all the cuts broken bones and the black eyes&quot;. I think this one is the most telling. It&#39;s the last time he mentions the swimming motif on the album, this time he says he&#39;s underwater, not swimming. He also gives a toast, as if to say &quot;thanks for the ups and downs, I&#39;m out&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just how I read these lyrics. They&#39;re obviously up for interpretation but I&#39;ve been a huge Mac fan since middle school so as soon as I heard the news I started putting these pieces together. It really seems like a suicide note in a way. </p>

<p>It also seems he called the end of So It Goes, the Last song on the album &quot;the Ascension into heaven&quot;. Seems to be one of the last things he listened to based on that tweet he deleted. </p>

It gets to the point where the average dosage does nothing for you and to the point where you’re no longer taking them for fun but because your body is needing them.

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think there’s anything fishy really at all. He was struggling with substance abuse which doesn’t necessarily mean he was being a full blown addict again. Maybe he actually clean for a bit then something triggered him to use again and he took a good sized dose. Happens all the time when people relapse a lot of people tend to od because you don’t realize your body can’t handle the amounts you used to be able to take no problem.  This would explain his house being clean as well. Imo he just made some bad choices that he ended up paying the ultimate price for, but it also seemed like that’s how he wanted it to be anyway.</p>

<p>The reason why no one takes conspiracy theorist is because they find conspiracies in literally everything. </p>

<p>Mac Miller wasn’t jay z or Drake. He was just a normal good young artist who liked drugs. Just like that peep dude. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mac Miller is a musician that had drug problems and personal issues. However, his latest album was uplifting and positive, an album signifying he is starting to love life on lifes terms and accept things he cannot change l. A music industry that thrives on drug addiction and negative subjects cannot afford to have someone step out of line and go against the current trend. The same shadow societies in Hollywood exist within the music industry, and they know a happy population without substance abuse issues is hard to control. I think he was offed  because he released something inspiring that would have negatively impacted the industry and their sales once people realized they dont have to drown their sorrows.</p>

Sometimes its easier to convince yourself using is ok when things are going well.  &quot;One night won&#39;t hurt&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll reward myself for doing so well. etc.. the white powder was probably fentanyl... mixed with alcohol and a lower tolerance from being clean,  it could easily lead to death... even if he just got a 20 bag and that&#39;s all that was in the house. </p>
