       I cant even get one upvote on a post I made. I always get at least 10 upvotes within a few minutes of anything i post. I feel like it's being shadow censored.  I wanted to talk about Corcept Therapuetics and Fords time with the company, but I guess Redditt doesnt want me talking about it.

       Christine Ford use to do work for Corcept Therapuetics, who make a profit off of RU-486.  They disguise 486 as Korlym and advertise it as a Cushing syndrome medication. Dont let them food you, it's an abortion pill.  Kavanaughs confirmation to SCOTUS could possibly threaten Roe V Wade, which in turn could make abortion illegal. If you make abortion illegal, Corcepts Korlym becomes illegal and unnecessary - and they in turn lose a profit.  By this measure, Christine Ford has financial conflict of interest with Kavanaugh. Add that to uncorroborated accusations and the whole story in there

       Same compound, different dosage and drastically more expensive. Korlym costs 7x as much as the variant taken for abortions and is not easy to get prescribed. It would be faster, easier and cheaper to hop state lines as needed than to try to get Korlym without Cushing's syndrome.

       But not in a sense to where an abortion ban would impact them. At least, not to near a degree that would justify the risk false allegations would carry. Undoubtedly not to a degree to where Ford would profit.

       If the allegations are "bullshit" why do the Republicans refuse to allow an FBI investigation into the matter? Making bullshit allegations to the FBI is a felony. That shuts up the whole thing if it's not valid.

       I miss boring politics, but all this is likely good in the long run because it will all eventually shake out if the Democrats keep up the fight and the news media keeps reporting it.

       What conspiracy? Republicans just want a conservative who will stand up for their values on the court, is that so hard to understand?

       If you want a conspiracy, it's the left making up these fake allegations to derail the nomination so critical it is for them to prevent having a new conservative on the court.

       That wasn't something that had happened 35 years prior and possibly there were witnesses (I don't know the details), and likely no incentive to delay. Here there are no witnesses so far (and friends of the time have expressed serious doubts about the allegations), no place, no date, ... I don't see how the FBI could wrap it up in 3 days, especially when one side will pull all their dirty maneuvers to stall and delay the investigation as much as they can.

       I thought the character was a bit overwritten in TNG, but it was a mary jane show anyway. For some reasons Republicans think the dude is a Trump whisperer. But this is the era of reboots.

       I've wondered if the overall mary jane aspect of the original Star Trek was included in TNG as a spoof or if it was serious. It's impossible for anyone who has sat through a writing class to watch the show without cringing at the horrible writing.

       Maybe I misremembered. You know how it is: one person reminds you of another person and your memory fills in the gaps. Placing deLancie retroactively into my earlier memories of A Team awesomeness. Kind of like how these ladies think it was Brett who did bad things to them.

       Yeah, Avenetti's lies are presumably only on the myriad talk shows he's been on.  Hopefully not any of the courtrooms he's been in.

       Also, I've heard the perjury claim on BK, and it's pretty inane.  It literally ignores the sentences he said before and after the one they claim is the perjury.

       That's a bunch of bullshit you are brainwashed. An outsider FINALLY broke into our elite and they are panicking. He is not illegitimate HE WON THE ELECTION FAIR AND SQUARE. There is still 0 evidence after 2 years that he colluded with Russia. The majority know it's a lie. Hillary and Obama colluded more with Russia and any other Country that would give them money.

       Jesus, I can't believe someone could say this as a defense for Trump and Republicans with any seriousness. I'd love to know how what the Rpublicans did to Obama was less severe or not to blame for kickstarting this hyper-partisanship. Fucking Trump himself built his political run off encouraging the idea that Obama wasn't an American.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans have had more control under Trump than Democrats had in a long time and still can't make a meaningful impact of even replace Obamacare for starters. It's also ridiculous that Trump shouldn't be blamed for all the divisive shit he says about his political opponents. Why would any of them sell out to help him after that?

       This is also a disingenuous attack if you support Trump. He is accused of the same shit (Ivana rape) with more sexual assault accusers, a similar level of evidence, and has never faced consequences of it. Democrats gave up Franken already for less and are still trying to be held to a different standard.

       Ruin his life? An investigation into Kavanaugh would result in either:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) Proof that he is unfit for Supreme Court appointment and he is withdrawn from consideration, or...
      </p>
      <p>
       B) He'll be cleared by the FBI and appointed, albeit with a delayed confirmation (rather than the rush-appointment the GOP is currently attempting).
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's A, then yes of course it's okay to "ruin his life," he would have already made that bed long ago by sexually assaulting others. If it's B and he's innocent, then he's fine. Also, the investigation would not need to present evidence of him being innocent, only evidence of guilt. That's how the justice system works.

       Here's the problem.  None of the allegations are backed up with any kind of proof.  The supposed witnesses claim to have no knowledge of anything like that ever happening.  There is no justification for an investigation.  The entire thing is just a desperate attempt by they Democrats to delay Kavanaugh's confirmation.  Feinstein, at the very least, knew about the allegations during the confirmation hearings, yet she never asked about him about it while he was under oath.  Why?  Because she knows it's a lie.  You all know it's a lie, but the ends justify the means, right?

       How are you so certain? I believe it is likely that the allegations are true, or at least that some of the accusers are telling the truth (notably, I don’t believe Avenatti would risk disbarment without having something to back his serious claims up), but I am in no way saying anything with absolute certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I support the idea of an investigation because I believe that’s the closest we’d get to the truth, and if nothing damning is found, then so be it. I don’t see how the investigation can possibly be construed as a bad thing for his supporters unless he is indeed guilty and they want to cover for him. He is already under intense scrutiny from the court of public opinion. Wouldn’t an investigation that concludes in his favor give him the best possible chance for vindication?

       Because Feinstein didn't try to perjury trap him under oath.  She had a chance to do it.  She could have completely blindsided him.  But she didn't.  She waited to mention it until the Republicans set a date for a vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the fact that the supposed witnesses do not back up the allegations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Ford's reluctance to testify in front of Congress.  She says she's going to testify now, but I'll bet she backs out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the fact that the latest accuser had to be coached for 6 days to "remember" what she is accusing Kavanaugh of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the leaked audio of a of democrats discussing a possible "strategy" to defeat Kavanaugh.

      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious that this is a strategy by the Democrats to delay the vote until after midterms, or force Kavanaugh to withdraw.

       This is what it all goes back to.  Flipping the presumption of innocence on it's head for political purposes.  Kavanaugh does not, and should not, need to prove his innocence.

       Does an attorney not get disbarred for leveling accusations of gang rape against a judge (that turn out to be false)? I was under the impression that’s what happens when they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, it’s pretty serious stuff and I expect Avenatti wouldn’t say this if he didn’t have proof. He already announced the proof was coming and gave a specific timeline... and if Avenatti has proved anything by this point, it’s that he and Donald Trump differ very, very greatly when it comes to delivering on promises.

       You might think that, but as long as Avenatti doesn't lie
       <em>
        in court
       </em>
       or get convicted of a crime, he's not going to get disbarred.  He can just claim that he believed what his client told him.  Nothing will happen to him.  Because there is a presumption of innocence, they would have to prove that he knowingly lied.

       Who determines if the FBI needs to investigate it ? What beyond the allegation qualifies an FBI investigation ? Seems to me we're setting a pretty dangerous precedent by launching a full on FBI investigation over a claim with such little evidence. Or are you not concerned that the FBI could literally tear your world apart over such an unsubstantiated case ?

       As long as rich white men are being investigated, Republicans always talk about "the rights of our citizens".
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, if those citizens are poor, non-white or undocumented, Republicans love their police state.

       Making a last minute allegation through left leaning media and the demanding a criminal investigation into someone is NOT AT ALL what the SC nomination and consent process entails.

       The democrats have known about both of these allegations before they leak to the media. Left leaning lawyers with connections to the Clinton's and even Andy McCabes lawyer is representing one of the women. And you mean to tell people this isn't a coordinated hit?

       What is the FBI supposed to do?  Who should they talk to?  There are already sworn statements from the everyone that has been named as being there except Ford.  There is no address given.  There is no date given.  What can the FBI do?  Interview BK again.   Who else are they supposed to talk to?  Next consider that the FBI rarely investigates sexual assault.  That's usually a state crime.  Where is the FBI supposed to look for evidence?  It's not like they can check for skin cells under Ford's finger nails or look for scratches on BK.  They don't have access to Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth.  What would an FBI investigation accomplish other that confirm that she said this happened long ago and he said it didn't.

       Care to explain what the FBI would investigate? A party that the alleged victim doesn't know when it was, or where it was? What about all 4 of the other people who attended the alleged party do not remember it? What would the FBI be able to do after that? Not prosecute a case that they don't have jurisdiction over and that occurred 35+ years ago and outside the statute of limitations? LOL.

       Well:
      </p>
      <p>
       For starters the statute of limitations has expired for both events about 20 years ago.
Second these are both misdemeanors allegations 
There have been ZERO recent allegations of misconduct.  Numerous subordinates, that have worked for him, have said how out of character these allegations are.
These allegations seemed to have "miraculously" appeared when it would cause the largest delay to the process.  VERY convenient.
Finally, it is NOT the FBI's job to investigate a misdemeanor crime.  That's local police.  They will investigate based upon the facts and information the alleged victims provide.  Meaning if nothing is provided then nothing can be investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we haven't concerned ourselves with the facts.  Why start now?

      <p>
       On the other hand did you see Kavanaugh and his wife on Fox? It sure seemed to me that his wife was shaken and unsure. When pressed over repressed memories and being afraid to come forward in context of the women making the claims she couldn’t even make a point. Then after more or less being completely unconvincing she reverted to the taking point about her family feelings.
      </p>

       It was weird at best and unconvincing imo.

       I don't have a horse in this race but its pretty easy to see whats going on.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Accusations at the last moment despite the 30hrs of testimony and questions, plus written questions
       </li>
       <li>
        Ford's name is "leaked" (which no one seems to be making a fuss about, including her)
       </li>
       <li>
        Kavanaugh and the witnesses Ford named herself have given testimony under oath that this never occured
       </li>
       <li>
        New accusations which he also denies, but this lets Feinstein say we need to delay his confirmation even further
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Its hard not to see this as anything but a political ploy to hold off his confirmation until after midterms while Dems hope they pick up a few seats and thus can delay any confirmation indefinitely.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is still some lingering questions though like the polygraph. Its hard to imagine they were planning something that far back. I'd like to see the questions of this test and whether Kavanaugh's name comes up specifically or not and what type of questions they asked. Simply going with "x took a polygraph" is pretty broad.
      </p>

       I expect a full blown circus on Thursday. I hope everyone has their popcorn ready.

       I think you're right. I'm trying to look up 'under oath' statements about it now and while I'm finding responses from each, I can't find anything that says it was under oath. So I'll edit that part of my post to reflect that. I thought I read it somewhere but until I can find something substantial, I'll change it to say they've responded and denied the accusations which are easy enough to find.

       I'd like to hear more about this penalty of perjury thing. That seems bonkers that you can be called within a week to give a statement because of a 36 year old accusation, simply for being named as a witness. How does that even work legally?

       Why do you he’s on a side? I’m on neither side (they are both too extreme for me, but I will say when it comes to social matters and women’s rights I am extremely liberal) but after today I am horrified by how illegitimate these allegations are and how they’re blatantly being used as a mere political maneuver. If you can’t see that you’ve merely been blinded by the democrat’s moral superiority trap as well as their ability to thoroughly tugging every heart string.

       Of course the truth would be great and most likely it would be on Kavanaugh side given what's already known. I'm just explaining to you, since you still don't get it, why the Republicans would rather not have this silly circus drag on for months.
