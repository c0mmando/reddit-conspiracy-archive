    <div class="md"><p>Well, this is a tough question. After I answered it and said the 80s, then I started thinking about it. I might change my mind on this. And all because of the internet and how it helped me with my son. My son has autism. Because of the internet, I was (and still am able) to research all kinds of things that help people with autism. I wouldn&#39;t have that living in the 80s.</p>

<p>Yeah, so due to the internet and how it has helped me, I think I will have to stay in the time period. If my son didn&#39;t have autism, then I would definitely go back to the 80s.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel sorry for any parents or children born during this era. Why? because people keep breeding in a uncontrollable fashion and decade after decade they say shit like &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have brought a life into this world&quot; but they still do. </p>

<p>Maybe this will be just one more bounce but it would be great (IMO) if everyone felt some serious suffering before they get all baby crazy and shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>High school in the late 1960s. Wouldnâ€™t go back. All the boys got draft cards. Drafted into army as soon as they graduated. Six weeks of boot camp then off to war in Vietnam.  Beginning of next school year we were going to their funerals.  Brothers, cousins, friends, sweethearts were killed or maimed. Drugs came back with them and thatâ€™s when it started. Getting high to cope with reality. Reporters brought the war  into our living room every night on the Nightly News. Broken bodies in muddy rice fields. Nostalgia for our generation was the time before Vietnam. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I miss when the internet was something you got made fun of in school for using. Mid 90s you were considered a &#39;nerd&#39; if you spent time on a computer. There were so many good communities, actual fan sites of things. Now everything is so collected into organized boxes and everything is so censored, its not the wild west that the internet once was. Social media in old terms was AIM, ICQ, IRC, chat rooms, message boards. It just seemed so much friendlier back then than it does now.</p>

<p>I dunno if I&#39;ve give up all the advances we&#39;ve seen though. I can at least choose not to be part of Facebook and stuff thats full of drama. Its sort of like opting to leave the room as an argument breaks out when you know neither the people yelling are going to get anywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...Yeah...I guess.  Me personally?  I would say that today&#39;s day and age sucks less because there is more information that can be disseminated via the internet - and that makes for better accruing of information and data, which ultimately is a good thing, a better thing, compared to.</p>

<p>The thing is, however (and as I&#39;ve said on other occasions before), the human species, collectively speaking, seems to pretty much be on the level of 7th graders evolutionarily speaking at this point.  That is to say we are old enough to have outgrown the toddler and childhood phase of simply being <em>directly</em> ignorant of many things - which means we <em>are</em> in fact beginning to know and understand certain ideas and deeper concepts more and more - but we are still VEEEERY much immature children who aren&#39;t even in high school yet, to say nothing about college, university, or post baccalaureate levels of deeper cosmic understanding.  This means that although today&#39;s day and age offers a bit more in the way of opportunities informationally-speaking that can help one understand certain socio-civilizational dynamics in a better, deeper, and more thorough manner, the <em>beings</em> that are accruing that information and understanding are still generally immature, ignorant 7th grade school children.  As such, the issues and problems persist - just with shinier gadgets and trinkets around than before.</p>

<p>To be sure, we <em>are</em> growing spiritually and emotionally - I can feel that and sense that more and more here and there in some members of the species (which is consequently elevating the civilization as a whole) - but the progress is <em>veeeery</em> slow...too slow, it feels, honestly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be sure, the <em>reason</em> weâ€™re still at the 7th grade level of development as a civilization is not because we don&#39;t have it in us to evolve and improve more.  Indeed, we in fact could and <em>should</em> be much, <em>muuuch</em> further along technologically, emotionally, and as a civilization than what is currently the case.  The reason is instead because there seem to be powers - deep, deep powers (hereâ€™s a <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">pdf of a book</a> detailing some of the exploits of some of the powers responsible) - greatly controlling the species and continuously working at preventing and retarding the further growth and development of Earth humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not much has really changed other than your perspective and perception as you&#39;ve matured. Well, housing cost and many other cost of living were more favorable, but aside from Air-Travel, not all that much has changed in the grand-scheme. We just changed the variables and shifted the blame, but it only seems shittier because we were young and naive then. Mid-thirties for reference. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>graduated high school in 1978.  No internet, no computers, no cell phones, people talked to each other,   We did not even have call waiting, you did not know who was calling when you answered the phone, which was attached to the wall by a cord.  Everyone smoked cigarettes, everywhere, even in the hospitals and doctors offices. if you wanted porn you had to ask for a magazine they kept behind the counter at drug stores.  If you needed a phone number you looked it up in the phone book. We had pay phones.  Things were very different.  We had one tv in the livingroom and watched shows together as a family. </p>
