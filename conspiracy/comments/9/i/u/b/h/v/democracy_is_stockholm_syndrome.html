        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We are led to believe though state indoctrination that we have a say in how the state functions. This is false. We are led by the Fabian Wolf. We are given a dialectic, two choices chosen by the same hand. Left and right, same body. Representative Democracy such as the one in the United States are instated to appease people into thinking they have a decision making power through discourse and democratic process. This is a facade used by all authoritarian beurocracies thoroughout history. We are the courtiers called to Versallies by Lois. Not so that we may govern more effectively. So that we can be controlled. </p>

<p>Voting for a leader is weak. It only shows that the person with the slimiest tongue can rise to the top. It ensures no true merit. A leader must not be chosen by the people. A leader must be chosen by their deeds. The only divine force that can be seen and easily explained in the material realm is that of victory. The concept of victory houses within it a Calvinist predetermination that echoes of primitivism and superstition. But is that truly the case? I would argue that victory in all forms is in fact divine. (Not to be mistaken with divinely influenced.) A person who is a victor in a competition, for instance arm wrestling, is the winner. In such a situation there is either a winner or a loser. The winner wins. This bestows them with the grace of the goddess Nike. From earliest times contest has determined kingship. We must return to what has always worked. &quot;Modern&quot; methods of selecting sovereigns have allowed money to seep into politics. This is the great fault of our time. What system elevates money from how a leader is chosen?</p>

<p>Victory.</p>

<p>In Frazier&#39;s mandatory reading, The Golden Bough, he describes the legend of the, Rex Nemorensis, or King of the Wood. This person was the high priest of Diana; from Wikipedia, which actually has a phenomenal small segment on this</p>

<p>&quot;The priesthood of Diana at Nemi was held by a person who obtained that honour by slaying the prior incumbent in a trial by combat, and who could remain at the post only so long as he successfully defended his position against all challengers. However, a successful candidate had first to test his mettle by plucking a golden bough from one of the trees in the sacred grove.</p>

<p>The human sacrifice conducted at Nemi was thought to be highly unusual by the ancients. Suetonius mentions it as an example of the moral failings of Caligula. Strabo calls it Scythian, implying that he found it barbaric. The violent character of this singular institution could barely be justified by reference to its great antiquity and mythological sanctity. The ancient sources also appear to concur that an escaped slave who seeks refuge in this uneasy office is likely to be a desperate man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Those trees in whose dim shadow</p>

<p>The ghastly priest doth reign</p>

<p>The priest who slew the slayer,</p>

<p>And shall himself be slain&quot;</p>

<p>In this legend any person may rise to the top of that particular priesthood through deed alone, plucking the bough, and slaying the sitting King. </p>

<p>We must transcend our slavery. Anarcho monarchist principals can produce a state in which any individual is equal, even to the king. Every individual has the opportunity to become king. Through the yearly round robin of arm wrestling and competitive slam poetry. We must free ourselves from the Stockholm syndrome of democracy. It is up to us to take control of the future.</p>

<p>Cool so we go from the person with the &quot;Slimiest&quot; tongue to the guy who is the best warrior. </p>

<p>Surely the guy who is the best warrior is also the best leader, right?</p>

<p>No way this could go terribly wrong... Nope... No further exposition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the problem is the concept of a representative democracy. The problem is in its implementation and how its gotten so far out of hand. </p>

<p>People have become lazy in ever aspect of life and ignorant of how their own government works (or doesn&#39;t). Most people I&#39;ve met that are interested in politics enough to even cast a vote are single issue voters or identity voters who like the us vs them emotion politics for the drama alone. </p>

<p>I would suggest we try using technology to make the entire political world more transparent. Estonia is experimenting with using blockchain tech to shift all things political online.</p>

<p><a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-governance/i-voting/">https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-governance/i-voting/</a></p>

<p>We can&#39;t expect the average person who has engagements of their own like work and family to be engaged enough to directly vote on every issue under the sun. More transparency in what exactly their elected representatives are doing and an ability to hold them accountable for for not taking their constitutes best interests into account would be a really good start.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah its really interesting what they are doing over there. </p>

<p>Imagine everything your reps were supposed to cast a vote on was up for your consideration and easy to see online in real time? Hell they could even have direct polling of the people they are meant to represent as well. Their vote and the polls visible to all. Why didn&#39;t they vote what their supporters wanted? They better explain that or face getting the boot come election time. </p>

<p>Get big money out of politics. The way it all works now is that if you want a snowballs chance in hell to get into an elected seat you need a large amount of money to run a campaign. You need to have your own money or get donation from people who support you. This is what is really meant when you hear &quot;grassroots&quot; its the idea that regular slobs gave this person a few bucks. What normally happens is some people with lots of money and special interests give lots of money then have some level of say in what the elected person does after they get into office. Pretty shitty particularly when it comes to big corps. </p>

<p>Make it all online with a series of vote offs. Everyone could run for office this way and just keep voting off till clearly popular people rise to the top. If it was fast and secure to vote there is no issue with this.     </p>

<p>Money out of politics is the key to all of this. But what about those who would skirt those laws and set up private charities and foundations instead? Or maybe they have an LLC where money could easily be laundered. </p>
