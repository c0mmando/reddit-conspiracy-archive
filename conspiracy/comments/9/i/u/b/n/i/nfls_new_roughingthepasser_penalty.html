       Does anyone else feel like this is a penalty that is deliberately discretionary so the Referees are able to swing a game one way or another? I always get the feeling that some penalties are meant to slow and stall momentum.

       If you want a quick overview of the new penalty:

       NFL is a huge corporate with little interest in viewers and is all about corporate sponsors and big betting from Las Vegas. So they’ll try their best to push certain teams to the finals, the nba does this as well, to make money and profits. So they can cheat and do whatever they want. And this new penalty rule can give a team an unfair advantage. Btw I haven’t watched sports in years. It’s all a scam.

       Another angle is female viewers.  The NFL is worried about attracting and keeping female fans.  Making the game less actually violent may be part of the plan to make it more appealing to female fans.

       How many NSA employees track referees and don't tell anyone about how they get paid and by who, coded phone calls that sound banal. Rather than prosecute, warn, arrest, or censure, there's probably a level of trade going on about actionable intelligence for the gambling addicted. Just knowing Vegas mobster A paid Referee B or what the owners agreed to about game outcomes, in advance, would be a cornucopia of lucre. In this latter day vulture capitalism, the ultra rich like their rube milking machines and all they have to do is stick together; the mob, NFL, NSA, the halls of power, in the clubs, at the private parties, industrial money launderers, thick as thieves. Now that's
       <em>

       Yes, things like the anthem controversy and "What is a catch" contributed to the loss in ratings last year, but one of the biggest contributors was that a lot of QB's got injured -- Aaron Rodgers, Andrew Luck, Derek Carr, Dashawn Watson, Carson Wentz.
      </p>
      <p>
       Casual fans like points.  These new rules are an overreaction to the desire of the NFL to keep QB's healthy and keep scoring high.

       The “grab QB, lift QB, take 2 steps, drop weight on QB” play is bad for football.  Worse than a few over corrected penalties early in the process

       Khlil Mack and Von Miller haven't been called, yet, this year.  Both players on the record for saying they have changed their approach to the rush.  Instead of going after the QB, these men go after the ball.

       I think professional sports are a conspiracy to keep us tribal, thus more easily controllable.

       I can agree that it's too glorified. Too bad we don't look at education the same way as sports.

       I don't even think competition in schools is necessarily a good thing.  We should be teaching kids how to learn, not teaching them to memorize.  We should encourage curiosity, and questioning what and why, and stop making kids who ask questions feel stupid.  It should be encouraged.
      </p>

       Unfortunately, that would make the populace too educated for the corrupt system of government we have, and that generation could undo almost a century of synarchy with that kind of power.

       Devil's Advocate:
      </p>
      <p>
       (Not including Olympic Medals) Have you ever lived in a city that has won a major sports championship? It is an incredibly galvanizing force for the residents of the city. Even fringe and non-traditional sports fans get swept up by the excitement that the local team might win it all, and the team(s) serves as a point of solidarity for the entire city. Quite often you can strike up an engaged yet civil conversation with a complete stranger in Boston about the Red Sox or the Eagles in Philly (try talking about politics, religion, finance, etc. with strangers in this capacity). Even people who truly resent sports can still appreciate the excitement that sweeps over a city when the local team makes a deep playoff run. More people are going out to the pub or getting together with friends to watch the game. You might find baseball boring, but will still tag along to the bar to have a couple drinks with you friends and be social. This opportunity for socializing does not present itself without professional sports as a primer.
      </p>
      <p>
       No institution is infallible, but I find people tend to conflate toxic masculinity/competition with all professional sports. No one likes the shithead sociopath who cares more about hitting 6 home runs and winning the company softball game than just having a good time with colleagues. These people ruin others' enjoyment of a game and I think a lot of people let these bad apples spoil the whole orchard. Again, let me underscore that
       <strong>
        NO ONE

       likes these people because they suck all of the fun out of the game. I have left ODR hockey games several times because of douche bags like this, with their insane need to win like its Game 7 of the SCF, who won't stop slashing, lifting sticks, and complaining at every opportunity. I still love sports, but I am certainly not "a little bitch" who can't handle a little completion when the heat gets turned up.

       I'm reluctant to use Lebron to underscore my argument because of the whole "shut up and dribble" controversy--pus its pretty easy to poke holes in his contrived brand/personality--but I think the point he makes is incredibly salient. Sports has traditionally been a unifying institution; one of the last meritocracies we have left. Lebron talks about how his fist exposure to other races was through sports, where the underlying emphasis remains on your performance in the game. The way sports (particularly the NFL) has been politicized in the last decade or two certainly seems like something is afoot. Although it need not be totally sinister either. Just spitballing, but there has been a steady decline into click-bait sensationalism for 24 hour news cycles, and sports has become a 24 hour, 365 day/year industry too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately I agree that, at least the NFL, has become a divisive subject. Personally, I think they've attempted to tear down the institution of sports because its a place where even the most racist redneck stereotype from Alabama can still appreciate the athleticism of Bo Jackson. But that's also my conspiratorial edge running wild.

       Obviously I am a sports fan, lol.

       I live in a university town.  I have to disagree wholeheartedly.  When your state university has to start a program to combat sports *fanaticism, you're way past a handful of douchebags.

       Adults didn't play sports
       <em>
        as a job
       </em>
       until the last century.  Sports are for children.  Adults work.  You're on the conspiracy subreddit.  Suspend your disbelief for a moment and look at how society has changed with sports.  It's not just about tribalism.  The whole thing is based around consumerism at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       While we spend billions on sports
       <em>
        entertainment
       </em>
       , it's held up as some paragon for the masses.  It's complete BS.  Every weekend I see masses of people get drunk, go to games, drink some more, and generally make the city less enjoyable for those with no interest in sports entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no study that would correlate sports entertainment with people getting out and being more active.  I'm sure you can find correlations between hours of sports watched, obesity, metabolic syndrome, alcoholism/binge-drinking, and not getting shit done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work in IT.  You'd think people would actually work at work, but during any tournament, everyone streams sports to their workstation and productivity drops.  Even when I've worked in places where they put the games up on a TV in the break room, fanatics can't stay away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the gambling.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you talk about group solidarity.  That's weak sauce.  It's tribalism.  The rivalry between team's fans mimicks the rivalry in politics and it's only getting worse.

       What an miserable, black and white position to take. Who told you sports are only for children? What would you classify E-Sports as? Did you know you can bet on E-Sports on Bovada?

       If you don't like sports that totally your prerogative man, but there is a lot of unsubstantiated vitriol in you response. I'm willing to acquiesce there are a certainly warts on all sports league but still prefer to focus on the positives like exercise and team building. Frankly I get the impression you're the type of person who makes belittling

       Before last night's game, I'd say you were paranoid. Now, I am in complete agreement. I'd say that they're trying to by rhe QB more time to generate more rating building offense.
