        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a conspiracy theory that i have made. </p>

<p>This is not fact just a theory.</p>

<p>Let us begin.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>![img](4ozzf6je8fo11 &quot;as this graph shows,the average college price has grown by 200% in just 40 years.&quot;)</p>

<p>now some people say this is based on the economy growth.</p>

<p>![img](8h4e7np39fo11 &quot;however in 30 years the average family income has only grown by ten thousand.&quot;)</p>

<p>and unlike the tuition rate (always climbing) the economy goes up and down. </p>

<p>So why is this? Well it might sound a little far fetched but the real reason that the tuition rate is so high</p>

<p>is not scholarships</p>

<p>not greed</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>but to keep society in check. </p>

<p>Think about it. Everyone wants to go to college right? Almost everyone wants to go to college.And if you don&#39;t you are considered a failure. So the college owners keep prices so high just so more people can go to bad jobs like subway or mcdonalds. Society intentionally puts college so high so America can make you your economic slave.</p>

<p>Please take a moment to think about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Price is determined by what someone can and is willing to pay (demand) and supply. Access to easy credit has made the can bit irrelevant and the willing is sorted out by society pressure. This mean demand keeps rising. Mix that with limited supply (especially for Ivy League colleges) then you have prices that will rise faster than they otherwise would.</p>

<p>It&#39;s similar with housing. Cheap credit means people can pay more for a house so they do and up goes the price. If people were more limited based on their income house prices couldn&#39;t rise like they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an excellent observation. We all need to consider motivations beyond greed, while remembering that colleges don&#39;t give a shit whether or not there&#39;s a job waiting for us after graduation. Imo that should be part of the deal for every course of study</p>

<p>Recently an Ivy league school  (princeton maybe) announced that they had 100 times more applicants than they had chairs in the school. If that&#39;s not a business coup - customers standing in line ten-deep just to buy what your selling - idk what is. </p>

<p>You could never achieve this in a truly competitive marketplace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My interest rate at Sallie Mae is fucking 12%. <em>12%</em> I go to a private uni but luckily got some scholarships, but if I was paying full price of 26k a semester, that‚Äôs an extra 3 thousand fucking dollars for 4.5 months of education. </p>

<p>It‚Äôs sickening and I‚Äôm so worried about what I‚Äôm going to do after college cuz I can‚Äôt quit at this point like I‚Äôve been considering cuz even if I get a job, it won‚Äôt be high income enough to be able to pay off the payments once they roll in after 6 months and also pay rent to live with a roommate in a neighborhood that won‚Äôt get me robbed walking down the street. </p>

<p>Which, btw already happens all around campus as well, I‚Äôve gotten at least 6 or 7 alerts if robbery or ‚Äúshots fired‚Äù or break in in the 6 months. Not to mention the high school student that was just shot in the crossfire of a drive by yesterday right off of campus. </p>

<p>But to get back on point, yeah college is basically the initiation to debt enslavement. </p>

<p>Somebody did the math and realized at some point all those Baby Boomers were going to want to cash in their chips and it&#39;d be ugly.</p>

<p>So they start pushing for everyone to go to college and trumpet &quot;Now everyone can afford college!&quot; (When what they meant was everyone can go into DEBT for college.) People now notice college costs going up.</p>

<p>In 1996, in come 529 &quot;college savings&quot; plans and voila! A buffer was created for the stock market. Cost of tuition goes up, investment in 529&#39;s goes up and there&#39;s no risk of big cash-outs like with the boomers, cause new college debt candidates are born every year.</p>

<p>Next up, fix it so college grads can&#39;t declare bankruptcy on their tuition debt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>College is a business, and just like a business they follow traditional supply/demand models. </p>

<p>I think the demand for college has increased a lot in the last few years, it&#39;s become the &quot;standard&quot; thing to do after high school, plus the party culture is really appealing. Lots of people want to go, and the colleges make this happen by creating BS arts degrees that anyone can cruise through, and making student loans available just make it easier to attend. </p>

<p>When everyone is getting degrees, they matter less, which is why we&#39;re seeing a whole generation of students struggling after graduation. College is no longer your ticket to a great job, it&#39;s a 4 year &quot;experience&quot; marketed to teenagers and supplied by colleges, for profit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a mystery. Fed backed laws about no discharging against bankruptcy is guaranteed money eventually. So lenders line up and pump tons of money into the system. Schools compete for those asses by getting bigger and offer better amenities/programs than the other schools. New schools pop up that wouldn&#39;t otherwise be in another climate. Prices rise but who cares- loans are plentiful. Repeat and once again, plentiful government debt distorts the market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here in Brazil, we have what we call &quot; public colleges&quot;, basically a government paid college, where no students need to <strong>directly</strong> pay it. Of course everyone must go through an exam.</p>

<p>Still, only 15% of people have a college, and half of the entire population don&#39;t even get to highschool.</p>

<p>Funny thing is a <strong>really</strong> big amout of people don&#39;t even have any jobs, and those who have just don&#39;t get more than R$950,00 per month ( less than 200 dollar, cuz <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> in here is just ridiculously expensive). There&#39;s people who don&#39;t have any home and are literally slaves because of that</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>TL;DR : We have really good public colleges, but half of the population don&#39;t even make it to highschool or the half of the basic education, making a lot of rural workers with no education, no money, no hope.</p>

<p>Yep, the powers that be absolutely use debt slavery as a tool to control people and keep them from climbing the socioeconomic ladder. This happens on the micro level to individuals, but it also happens on a macro geopolitical level to nations. Just as individuals are told to take on mountains of inescapable debt just for a small opportunity at capitalist success (and then have to take a minimum wage job anyway when no career opportunities are available), so too are nations coerced into taking massive loans from the IMF, so that they can be controlled and exploited. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In other countries they control it by entrance grades, like you have to have minimum X in grade average before you can enter Y studdies. This is so they don&#39;t educate too many of any particular profession which could mean a lot of job-less but highly-educated people.</p>

<p>In the US they just control it (and everything else) with money..</p>
