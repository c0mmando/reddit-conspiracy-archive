       This is a conspiracy theory that i have made.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not fact just a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us begin.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       ![img](4ozzf6je8fo11 "as this graph shows,the average college price has grown by 200% in just 40 years.")
      </p>
      <p>
       now some people say this is based on the economy growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       ![img](8h4e7np39fo11 "however in 30 years the average family income has only grown by ten thousand.")
      </p>
      <p>
       and unlike the tuition rate (always climbing) the economy goes up and down.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why is this? Well it might sound a little far fetched but the real reason that the tuition rate is so high
      </p>
      <p>
       is not scholarships
      </p>
      <p>
       not greed
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       but to keep society in check.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it. Everyone wants to go to college right? Almost everyone wants to go to college.And if you don't you are considered a failure. So the college owners keep prices so high just so more people can go to bad jobs like subway or mcdonalds. Society intentionally puts college so high so America can make you your economic slave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please take a moment to think about this.

       I say it's because the government is getting involved in loaning out money which means the colleges are going to raise prices since they know the government has it.

       That and the fact that you can learn pretty much anything online for free today but it will never be considered as “legit“ degrees UNLESS you have that piece of paper showing that you went through one of their credited indoctrinated for profited schools. Plus the more you’re working every day the less you have to sit around in question who is doing all this to you. It’s all a big game at this point. Way to go for realizing it’s all shit show👍🏻. Now go forth and open up peoples eyes to this reality ,among many others.

       Exactly, the LAST thing colleges can provide is no longer the actual education, it's just an official accreditation and even that is losing value rapidly.

       I don’t see a conspiracy. I see greed and the burden being placed on the citizen. The fact that suitable graduate job growth hasn’t matched output is a case of misselling.....possibly with a hint of poor student choice. The lower paid job providers now have a nice market of students to exploit.

       Taking into account his point, this is actually enough information to gain some amount of perspective.  Because say if college is 40k x 4 =&gt; 160k now, it was approx 80k nack then.  Wheres that extra 80k coming from if the average salary only increased by 10k *4 =&gt; 40k

       i thought the whole conspiracy was to get students in debt via the Federal Student Loans program. i remember reading a few years ago that students who have high debt are less likely to protest, and that the Federal Loans program was reactionary to all the students who protested the Vietnam War.
wish i could find the source but my work-break is about over.

       the reason college prices are through the roof is once again, the government and it's regulations and loan programs. Think about it, if you were a school and the government was offering loans and grants to students, why wouldn't you as a school charge as much as possible?

       Price is determined by what someone can and is willing to pay (demand) and supply. Access to easy credit has made the can bit irrelevant and the willing is sorted out by society pressure. This mean demand keeps rising. Mix that with limited supply (especially for Ivy League colleges) then you have prices that will rise faster than they otherwise would.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's similar with housing. Cheap credit means people can pay more for a house so they do and up goes the price. If people were more limited based on their income house prices couldn't rise like they do.

       This is an excellent observation. We all need to consider motivations beyond greed, while remembering that colleges don't give a shit whether or not there's a job waiting for us after graduation. Imo that should be part of the deal for every course of study
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently an Ivy league school  (princeton maybe) announced that they had 100 times more applicants than they had chairs in the school. If that's not a business coup - customers standing in line ten-deep just to buy what your selling - idk what is.

       You could never achieve this in a truly competitive marketplace.

       Colleges need to put lesser influence in “soft science” degrees and push more students to obtain degrees in “hard sciences.” A graduating student with a bs in Sociology stands no chance in the job market, period. My point is they are also allowing paying student a to obtain degrees in fields where they will make no money at all to pay off their loans.

       My interest rate at Sallie Mae is fucking 12%.
       <em>
        12%
       </em>
       I go to a private uni but luckily got some scholarships, but if I was paying full price of 26k a semester, that’s an extra 3 thousand fucking dollars for 4.5 months of education.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s sickening and I’m so worried about what I’m going to do after college cuz I can’t quit at this point like I’ve been considering cuz even if I get a job, it won’t be high income enough to be able to pay off the payments once they roll in after 6 months and also pay rent to live with a roommate in a neighborhood that won’t get me robbed walking down the street.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which, btw already happens all around campus as well, I’ve gotten at least 6 or 7 alerts if robbery or “shots fired” or break in in the 6 months. Not to mention the high school student that was just shot in the crossfire of a drive by yesterday right off of campus.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to get back on point, yeah college is basically the initiation to debt enslavement.

       I wanted to live in Philly and it was the only philly school that would accept me, plus if I went to PSU or the other state school I was accepted to it would cost more cuz I got a good scholarship from the private uni. I don’t even want to go to college anymore tbh but have to or the debt will start rolling in faster than I can pay off, my parents kinda kicked me out/I didn’t want to live w/ my parents anymore so I’m SOL basically

       Sometimes I think wants more than needs are half the problem with kids today having issues with college. So many of you are going to private schools when your budget is home-town state school, or
       <em>
        god forbid
       </em>
       , community colleges.
      </p>
      <p>
       You, for example, are a prime example of someone who should have went to a community college and gotten an associates degree. You're finding out now that college may not have been for you for whatever reason, yet you're stuck with the consequences.

       In 1982 401k's were invented and the stock market took off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somebody did the math and realized at some point all those Baby Boomers were going to want to cash in their chips and it'd be ugly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they start pushing for everyone to go to college and trumpet "Now everyone can afford college!" (When what they meant was everyone can go into DEBT for college.) People now notice college costs going up.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1996, in come 529 "college savings" plans and voila! A buffer was created for the stock market. Cost of tuition goes up, investment in 529's goes up and there's no risk of big cash-outs like with the boomers, cause new college debt candidates are born every year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next up, fix it so college grads can't declare bankruptcy on their tuition debt.

       College is a business, and just like a business they follow traditional supply/demand models.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the demand for college has increased a lot in the last few years, it's become the "standard" thing to do after high school, plus the party culture is really appealing. Lots of people want to go, and the colleges make this happen by creating BS arts degrees that anyone can cruise through, and making student loans available just make it easier to attend.
      </p>
      <p>
       When everyone is getting degrees, they matter less, which is why we're seeing a whole generation of students struggling after graduation. College is no longer your ticket to a great job, it's a 4 year "experience" marketed to teenagers and supplied by colleges, for profit.

       It's not a mystery. Fed backed laws about no discharging against bankruptcy is guaranteed money eventually. So lenders line up and pump tons of money into the system. Schools compete for those asses by getting bigger and offer better amenities/programs than the other schools. New schools pop up that wouldn't otherwise be in another climate. Prices rise but who cares- loans are plentiful. Repeat and once again, plentiful government debt distorts the market.

       Here in Brazil, we have what we call " public colleges", basically a government paid college, where no students need to
       <strong>
        directly
       </strong>
       pay it. Of course everyone must go through an exam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, only 15% of people have a college, and half of the entire population don't even get to highschool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny thing is a
       <strong>
        really
       </strong>
       big amout of people don't even have any jobs, and those who have just don't get more than R$950,00 per month ( less than 200 dollar, cuz
       <strong>
        EVERYTHING
       </strong>
       in here is just ridiculously expensive). There's people who don't have any home and are literally slaves because of that
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR : We have really good public colleges, but half of the population don't even make it to highschool or the half of the basic education, making a lot of rural workers with no education, no money, no hope.

       Yep, the powers that be absolutely use debt slavery as a tool to control people and keep them from climbing the socioeconomic ladder. This happens on the micro level to individuals, but it also happens on a macro geopolitical level to nations. Just as individuals are told to take on mountains of inescapable debt just for a small opportunity at capitalist success (and then have to take a minimum wage job anyway when no career opportunities are available), so too are nations coerced into taking massive loans from the IMF, so that they can be controlled and exploited.

       In other countries they control it by entrance grades, like you have to have minimum X in grade average before you can enter Y studdies. This is so they don't educate too many of any particular profession which could mean a lot of job-less but highly-educated people.
