<p>It may be irrelevant to you but not to me, which is why i mentioned it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a relatively new user. I use names to identify those who can debate well and those I have to remember not to get into discussion with. Usernames serve many purposes.</p>

<p>Not unless I&#39;ve said something that makes you suspicious. </p>

<p>If you previously interacted with me and the interaction was pleasant (whether we were in agreement or not), would you not have more reason to be trusting of my intentions? </p>

<p>If you&#39;d noticed me interacting with others in a pleasant way (despite disagreements), would you not have more reason to be trusting of my intentions? </p>
