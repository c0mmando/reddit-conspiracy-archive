        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Townsend used high frequency high voltage across metallic discs and was actually able to induce a small thrust. Some would just dumb this down to ion drift because that does occur but there is definitely an interaction on the atomic scale between the electric field and mass. To me any person in their right mind would have seen this and would have had to urge to look at it closer. Just a fun thought but these experiments were going on in the 20&#39;s. The first ufo siting was in 1947 and was a disc shaped craft. Could it be that a secretive black project group had been developing a vehicle using this principle?</p>

<p>Because the upper flow is faster, then, from Bernoulli&#39;s equation, the pressure is lower. The difference in pressure across the airfoil produces the lift.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If for an instant you consider that UFOs are alien machines and then go on to consider that what makes them unique is several things that remove them far out of the classification of being &quot;aircraft.&quot;  Their shapes do not give any evidence that they utilize air foils for lift to offset gravity.  Their abilities to demonstrate &quot;impossible&quot; capabilities of sudden stops, starts and 90 degree maneuvers  is further evidence that they are indeed not aircraft of even the most visionary kind.  Actually, you can bump your thinking up from those already unworldly aspects to wonder if that maybe those features also may make them space capable.  </p>

<p>Finally, VOILA!  You have reach an enlightenment that is denied across may areas today yet even as we look for non-threatening ET via radio signals light years away.  Isn&#39;t something is terrible wrong with science and government and what they want us to believe about what they know and say? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a pretty wild assessment of our current reality.  But if you deny the existence of exotic alien craft within our midst for decade after decade, without knowing the history of such events, then it would seem plausible.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t tend to do this, but I do once in awhile:  I&#39;m a UFO abductee from back in 1964 and I and about 20 others witnessed a humongous, low, slow and absolutely quiet triangle move across the sky in Wyoming in 1998. You can argue your denial all you want because of your conventional schooling, training or for some other reason, but ETs exist here and now and not just out at the furtherest reaches of our search for the same as current science and government would have you believe.  The situation is all part of the coming-to-terms with an honest perspective upon the cosmos.  We are nothing more than a Third World world as much as we don&#39;t want to accept that simple reality.    </p>

<p>Clintons sold out to the chinese long ago. They are better hackers too than the nsa. They were supposed to take over after America fell. We dont have the sharpest minds coming out of school. Only great confident kids with fair minded intellect. No floridation in the Chinese water.
They have the full database of top cleared folks working secret projects and probably hacked every one of them at least under surveillance.</p>
