       Here are some CIA conspiracy facts.

       Below is copied from another thread.

      <blockquote>

        Of course, we already know that the CIA does evil things. For example, the following are undisputed, public knowledge, and listed on Wikipedia:

          Operation MK-ULTRA

          Learn about the worst of MK-ULTRA here.
         </a>
         The CIA destroyed about 95% of the documents, and we only have the fraction that we do, because of a mistake in destroying the documents.

         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-contra">
          Iran-Contra
         </a>
         : the CIA violated Congress's Boland Amendment, which banned the CIA from funding the contras, by selling cocaine in the United States and by selling military arms to Iran.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Dark Alliance investigation by
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb">
          Gary Webb

         <a href="https://youtu.be/epXVDEn3gsQ">
          Mena Airport
         </a>
         : This is the famous airport in Arkansas where Barry Seal flow cocaine for the CIA. This is where Bill and Hillary Clinton got involved with the CIA, and were protected by the CIA. Notice that the CIA is really the only way to explain the giant trail of mysterious deaths and "suicides" in Clintons' wake that never resulted in murder convictions (I encourage you to take the time to read through
         <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/DEAD/clinton-convenient-deaths21.jpg">

       </ol>
       <p>
        In addition to these, I will add that the CIA is connected to other conspiracies:

         CIA assassin Ethan Hunt

          connections to the CIA

        </li>
        <li>
         Although 9/11 seems to be mostly a Mossad job, there must have been CIA and neoconservative complicity. For example, Osama bin Laden was our friend and a
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_CIA_assistance_to_Osama_bin_Laden">
          CIA/Mossad asset in the CIA Operation Cyclone war in Afganistan

         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda#Name">
          literally translates to "the database"
         </a>
         of CIA mujahideen in Afghanistan. Bin Laden's first reaction to
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPn-IdeN85s">
          9/11 was to deny his involvement
         </a>
         .
        </li>
        <li>
         A recent federal court decision

          confirms that the CIA was involved in the Oklahoma City bombing investigation
         </a>
         . Numerous conspiracy theories
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing_conspiracy_theories#US_federal_government_involvement">
          link the CIA to the bombing
         </a>
         .
        </li>
        <li>
         George Webb has a
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/georgwebb">
          popular youtube series
         </a>
         outlining how the CIA, and its private sector cutout DynCorp, do nation topples, human trafficking, and organ harvesting around the world.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        The CIA was basically setup, after World War 2, and filled with Nazis, to perform black operations, under the cover of the law, to benefit U.S. corporate interests. Attempted reforms, like the Church Committee and the Boland Amendment, were effectively ignored. Because the CIA operates under secrecy without meaningful discipline, and because people are too scared about the destabalizing effect of exposing its corruption (after JFK, 9/11, etc.), the CIA's corruption just grows like a cancer.

       If you seriously want to do a deep dive into CIA shenanigans, get into Peter LaVenda’s “Sinister Forces” trilogy. It is incredibly well researched (over 25 years with solid footnotes) and weaves a dirty take they politics, media, entertainment, murder, black ops, and pop culture like no other.

       Why would Bin Laden and Al Qaeda deny having anything to do with 9/11. If I'm not mistaken, nobody claimed responsibility for 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Terror groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS always claim responsibility for terror attacks, that's their whole memo, they attack and let everyone know that they did it to get everyone to fear them. Why would Bin Laden deny doing 9/11, if anything that would be their grand opus to instilling fear upon the USA and the western world.

       That Iran-Contra and related shenanigans was the CIA (or the related Shadow Government) taking control of the world cocaine trade. And the invasion of Afghanistan, coupled with the over prescribing of  opiods in the US creating a future growth in the market for heroin, was the same gaining control of the world heroin market.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also makes me suspect something else really interesting. Years ago there was a conspiracy tidbit floating around that was presented as an old Chinese secret society threatening to go to was with the "Illuminati". This makes me wonder if the flood of fentanyl into the United States causing a surge in deaths of heroin users is that Chinese secret society waging war on the Shadow Government by killing off it's customers, and creating a public crisis of opiod deaths to interfere with their business operations.

       I believe Area 51 is the HQ of Mind Control of these days. They are in contact with the aliens and exchange human behavior for new technology. This is for the New World Order. And the United States is propaganda, what we learned is bull shit. Our country isn't the land of the free it's the land of extremist terrosim. We shall not let this get into our heads we shall prevail and get rid of those evil acts! OPEN YOUR EYES YOU ARE A TEST SUBJECT FOR THE NEW WORLD ORDER! CASES OF JFK ASSASSINATION AND THE COVER UP BY THE ASSASSIN THAT ASSASSINATED JFK IS BY THE CLUB MANAGER THAT WAS WORKING WITH THE CIA. THERE IS A REASON PEOPLE! JFK WAS NEVER WORKING WITH THE ILLUMINATI, HE WAS TRYING TO GO AGAINST THEM! HE TRICKED THE ILLUMINATI TO LET HIM BE PRESIDENT BUT IT BACK FIRED. GOOD LORD, OH JESUS WHAT WOULD WE DO? THE ILLUMINATI IS TAKING OVER THE WORLD IN THE DARKNESS. WHAT IF THE SCPF FOUNDATION IS REAL? AND THEY ARE GETTING TECHNOLOGY TO ERASE OUR MEMORY'S AS WE KNOW IT.  WHAT WILL WE DO THEN? WE WANT FREEDOM, THE US IS NOT FREEDOM IS THE CONTROL OF THE MIND WHAT WHICH MAKES US THINK WE ARE FREE! EVERY GOVERNMENT IN THE WORLD HAS A ILLUMINATI  MEMBER. PUZZLES OF HISTORY, NON- INFORMATION IS COMING TOGETHER!
