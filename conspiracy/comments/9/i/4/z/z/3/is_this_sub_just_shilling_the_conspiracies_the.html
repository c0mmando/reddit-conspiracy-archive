    <div class="md"><p>There are definitely posts on this and virtually every subreddit from people who professionally motivated, whether working for a corp. or some gov&#39;t agency.  There are absolutely a lot of nonsensical posts with virtually no proof given.  However, there are some very important subjects covered as well.  That&#39;s going to happen in any open forum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Birch_Society">The Koch brothers father started this group. </a></p>

<p>This is a brief summary of the book you get when you join (from the same link):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A transcript of Welch&#39;s two-day presentation at the founding meeting was published as The Blue Book of the John Birch Society, and became a cornerstone of its beliefs, with each new member receiving a copy. According to Welch, &quot;both the U.S. and Soviet governments are controlled by the same furtive conspiratorial cabal of internationalists, greedy bankers, and corrupt politicians. If left unexposed, the traitors inside the U.S. government would betray the country&#39;s sovereignty to the United Nations for a collectivist New World Order, managed by a &#39;one-world socialist government.&#39;&quot;  Welch saw collectivism as the main threat to western culture, and American liberals as &quot;secret communist traitors&quot; who provided cover for the gradual process of collectivism, with the ultimate goal of replacing the nations of western civilization with a one-world socialist government. &quot;There are many stages of welfarism, socialism, and collectivism in general,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but Communism is the ultimate state of them all, and they all lead inevitably in that direction.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s been a mainstay for the right wing since it&#39;s inception. If you can&#39;t sell the people policies that only benefit the rich, the solution is to demonize the other side.</p>

<p>Have a look at the &quot;values&quot; section in the link, they&#39;re against civil rights for fucks sake. </p>

<p>Its literally called r/conspiracy. On the 3rd most visited website in the US, and 6th in the world.</p>

<p>And yet, the community here feels like its hiding away in its little secret tree house, with hidden knowledge of terrible truths.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>If half of the conspiracies posted on this site were true, then none of those conspiracies would see the light of day.  The NWO is taking hold and is orchestrating the grand event to usher in a new age of global domination, as exposed by [Random] user.  Fortunately, the expose was posted on the little known website of reddit, and the NWO/TPTB/Shadow Government/Deep State didn&#39;t think to look here to stop the secret getting out in time.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Either they are all powerful and we see what they want us to see, so what we end up seeing is their bullshit fed to us. Or they arent all powerful, and all these theories are bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taking action against the pursuit of any &quot;real conspiracies&quot;, as you might call them, has the effect of validating them and they wouldn&#39;t do that unless they were frantic and at their wits end to try and keep a lid on them. </p>

<p>All that accomplishes is to make those conspiracies all the more believable and raise even more suspicions and attract even more public attention to them which is the last thing that they want. </p>

<p>So the more typical official response, as well as that of their unofficial hired trolls and shills, is to scoff at, ridicule, and try to derail any discussions or further investigations into any of them and never directly respond to any of the niggling questions and anomalous events that surround them, and even there they have to be careful to not overdo that to such an extent that it too validates and proves that they definitely have something to hide and see any serious investigations into those questions as a threat that might fully expose them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about conspiracies and the people that follow them is more about the unconvincing official story, poor investigations and obvious cover ups that seem to occur. Major events where official storys change, witness die, and key evidence is kept secret, theres no wonder people get together to discuss them. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>In the end, people who are actually into finding the truth follow the facts. Sometimes the facts disagree with what the official narrative assumed or pushed - But even so, there seems to be no going back and having another look at anything, no matter what evidence comes about. And if you bring up any of those facts you get the eye roll and people telling you you believe in reptilian overlords and flat earth. </p>
