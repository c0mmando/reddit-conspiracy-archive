       I'm curious why so many people out there are convinced that Trump, a president who placed Goldman Sachs employees, Bilderberg committee members, and Rothschild bankers in his cabinet, is "taking down the deep state".

       Has there been any dramatic change in the quality of our lives? Or are you seeing essentially more of the same with the past several administrations?

       Trump supporters truly think that Trump "bucked the system" and beat Hillary. They fell for the "script" hook line and sinker. It was a cleverly crafted underdog story, hero vs villain. People eat that shit up.

       what does todays nonstop attack on donald trump have to do with partisan bickering? We have never, neeeever seen anything like what we're seeing the media do to President Trump. Not in my lifetime, not in any book I've ever read or any article I've ever heard of. THere is nothing normal about what the media, hollywood, universities, pop stars, late night shows, ect ect... there's nothing normal about this. Nothing. What we're living thru will probably go down as the worse partisan attack in american history. All because an outsider won the presidency.

       It's not all because he is an outsider for fuck's sake. Trump says divisive, cruel, and nonsensical things just to stir people up and be a huge distraction. The "left" plays its part by acting outraged and counter-attacking. The intensity has been turned up on a very old game.

       So you want to blame Clinton for placing the law and Sessions for enforcing it for only two weeks. And it wasn't cruel of Trump to allow Sessions to enforce the cruel law for two weeks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have a source that it was only enforced for two weeks? Because it seems like it was in place for a lot longer than that. I would love to be proven wrong on this.

       Nice job moving the goal post. You asked:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What has he done that's been cruel?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And allowing to separate families for a year and a half is a cruel thing that Trump did allow to happen during his presidency.

       Do you have a source to back up this statement? Because the source that I provided uses DHS records to prove that the policy has been in place at least since Trump was inaugurated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not using Trump as a scapegoat, I'm just calling him out on a cruel policy that he was complicit in executing for a year and a half.

       By their vague standards, Obama enforced it as well. Hell, if I go to jail tonight, Trump is separating me from my children.

       Sessions began enforcing it hardcore, the way it was written, for a couple weeks before Trump changed it. Simple.

       Out of respect for your time I will tell one, first one that popped up with a simple search. Spreading prejudice about Mexican immigrants being thieves and rapists has real world consequences for people struggling to live their lives. That was cruel and on a massive scale. Out of respect for my time I don't want to debate semantics or word choices on specific tweets or speeches, when the subtext is crystal clear.

       <p>
        How the Hillary Clinton campaign deliberately “elevated” Donald Trump with its “pied piper” strategy
       </p>
       <p>
        In its self-described "pied piper" strategy, the Clinton campaign proposed intentionally cultivating extreme right-wing presidential candidates, hoping to turn them into the new "mainstream of the Republican Party" in order to try to increase Clinton's chances of winning.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee called for using far-right candidates "as a cudgel to move the more established candidates further to the right." Clinton's camp insisted that Trump and other extremists should be "elevated" to "leaders of the pack" and media outlets should be told to "take them seriously."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You‘re right, the plan to elevate trump was certainly scripted. I don‘t think it went the way the DNC was hoping.

       Well said. I don't understand when people say, "Yea, he's corrupt but we're way better off with him than KILLARY". Not only does it sound completely ignorant, but it shows how real people still think the electoral process is. They've yet to realize the candidates are selected in advance and it's a big scripted puppet show.

       On one side they definitely are picked in advance. On the republican side however the primaries are a democratic process. If the republican voters don't want someone (the party itself was pushing either Kasich or Bush) then they pick someone else.

       I always took his actions as understanding the festering corrupted heap that is the DNC, is what it is, and is instead working on things he can actually change. I understand this is a glass-half-full view and get where you're coming from I suppose.

       Personally, I've seen nothing particularly compelling enough to lead me to believe one of our explanations over the other, but I was curious why you felt that way.

       If there was ever time to grow a pair for Bernie, this is it. No half-measures, no giving to "muh Russia" but working with an admin that is actually open to populist ideas and willing to work with anyone who acts

       I don’t know who you are speaking for. It’s often the case that the public doesn’t want to get involved in shit like this. But here we are. I’m not accredited in exit strategies for proxy wars, so I’m not going to pretend like i know walking away is the best idea. It sounds great in theory, but it’s also a highly complicated situation at this point.

       Bernie is pragmatic. He understood that Hillary had a good chance of losing and while she supported policies far from his, trump was even further away.

       He did what he could to avoid a trump presidency. There isn’t always a good choice in politics. just two bad choices.

       This is above and beyond normal politics... There is a concerted effort among liberals to shit on trump. Hos coverage is almost entirely negative. Have you turned on a late night show lately? Read a newspaper? Seen an award show? Trump gets attacked from every angle. Liberals are trash

       You need to look further into the Clinton related murders if you think that there is nothing there. The odds that all these deaths so close to one family are all complete coincidence are so astronomically high its crazy to think anything other than they have definitely had some people killed.

       The pragmatic choice is to realize that neither furthers his policies, so he should have stated as such. He could have added a personal preference for Clinton, but policy-wise it really doesn't matter whether Clinton won or Trump won. Both had issues where they came close to Bernie (Tariffs and isolationism for Trump, Healthcare and education for clinton)

       Painted as, yes, but that smear wouldn't have stuck if he had simply used the opportunity to picture himself as a less loudmouthed proponent of protectionist measures.

       Apart from that, the margin in these states was already slim. You don't need all of them to not vote Trump to actually make the difference.

      <p>
       I don't know about that. He sold them well in any case, and given a national platform. And if the goal is to not get Trump elected, taking away part of the protest vote and the blue collars would have gone a long way.

       Ideally, you work out a way that leaves the middle class well alone in order to finance this. Though I have to agree that that's a tall order.

       I watch it but i am not a cultist of it. Trump was never a politician and won the highest political office in America. this was a huge upset to the dems and the reps alike. the whole "cleaning the swamp" thing is in the q posts and is accurate. as for the prez acknowledging q, there are times he mentions the number 17, or points them out in a crowd or makes hand gestures symbolizing Q. you would have to check it out to decide for yourself. I read and look at everything as i enjoy to learn, whether or not I agree or disagree with the opinion or agenda. I find that is the only way i can make an honest decision about a situation..

       The administration's silence is deafening. Q told us Trump would totally isolate himself from the operation, at least until the endgame stage. If Q was something the administration was not behind, they could have easily denied involvement as soon as MSM started their hitpieces. Instead, he just keeps dropping hints that it's real.

       This is anecdotal to me, and I'll be honest and say I haven't followed Q nor am I one to talk about the credibility or "debunk" any of it, but the constant hashtagging and catchprashes out of Q followers has severely turned me away from it. It screams cult of personality, and I'm not sure why you all do it.

       Come on man, that's gatekeeping. I have a very good grasp on those events. My issue isn't about what Q followers believe, I think the beliefs about politicians are very noble. I just don't understand the constant "WWG1WGA", which barely even makes sense in English (Where We Go One, We Go All??), but it seems like any hardcore Q follower is super gung ho on the phrases and hashtags, which makes people like me super wary of them at all.

       Not to mention their elitist attitude, that they're so much smarter than everybody else. Anybody who questions Q on the voat sub gets called a homophobic slur or threatened. I sometimes wonder if the whole thing was created by the intelligence agencies to buy them some time with republicans starting to realize they voted for another authoritarian puppet.

       Q, for its part, has been incredibly effective in establishing mental stop signs in the minds of its followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Huge red flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your only tool is a hammer then, naturally, you’ll see every problem as a nail. Through various strategic explainers, Q followers can safely get past logical inconsistency with such narrative frames like...
      </p>
      <p>
       “trust the plan”
“disinfo is necessary”
“these people are stupid”
etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       One, “these people” (those corralled by this explain-all) are not fucking stupid. They don’t communicate in cryptic nonsense because they don’t have to — they reside, work, and play in an echelon outside of the reach of the type of people attracted to the Q worldview.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to feel “in the know,” it’s infinitely more delightful to pique the pattern recognition features in the Human.OS than to don pragmatist glasses and see a far more mundane, cold, and complex reality.

       The wealth gap continues to grow and the richest continue to get richer at an even faster rate than previous administrations. And as a bonus, average americans think that they are more involved in politics because they watch the constant media shit slinging from both parties while there is actually less reporting on the actual stuff the administration is doing.

       This is a chicken or the egg question. Except we actually do know what came first  Who started the divisive statements?

       <p>
        How the Hillary Clinton campaign deliberately “elevated” Donald Trump with its “pied piper” strategy
       </p>
       <p>
        In its self-described "pied piper" strategy, the Clinton campaign proposed intentionally cultivating extreme right-wing presidential candidates, hoping to turn them into the new "mainstream of the Republican Party" in order to try to increase Clinton's chances of winning.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee called for using far-right candidates "as a cudgel to move the more established candidates further to the right." Clinton's camp insisted that Trump and other extremists should be "elevated" to "leaders of the pack" and media outlets should be told to "take them seriously."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Like how the Clinton Campaign, DNC, and MSM were all conspiring together long before Sanders conceded the nomination?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s a list of reporters who ate dinner with Hillary 2 days before she announced her presidential run:

       Lol, nothing you cited has anything to do with my comment or OPs.  All I said was that his comment was incredibly ironic, which it was.  Trump is absolutely part of the problem and a person to blame for the social tension and division in this country.  He has been tweeting and saying incredibly divisive things since the Obama years. To think otherwise is near-sighted and ignorant.

       Did I say he wasn’t? Or did I just point out that the media is the one who were gaslighting and spotlighting his tweets and statements, which likely was the primary reason this issue got so blown out of proportion?

       It's all coordinated. The media covered trump and gave him free publicity in the election because he was not a true threat to the power structure. He's a figure that was chosen specifically for the controversy he would generate. I don't believe for a second, that the MSM and TPTB actually "fear" Trump. I am under the impression that he, along with every other modern president, was selected in advance.

       This is not how this works. If you actually tax the higher GDP, then you get less debt. We are not currently taxing the new GDP and have zero plans to, in fact we are taxing less now than previously, meaning our debt is increasing at the fastest rate since 2008.

       That's only partially true. The Fiat Ursury Federal reserve system creates debt by learning us all of the printed money, same with the IMF loans, selling debt to foreign countries, and Many other systems of debt fuck the whole country in the ass

       Yeah I know, and that has to be fixed, but so does the unfair Post WW2 Tariffs designed to help rebuild EU and others which were systematically designed to be unfair to us at the sake of others rebuilding. That's no longer the case, and they should ha e been renegotiated by the 80s.

       Thank you for saying this, and so eloquently. This tariff war is genuinely hurting
       <em>

       agriculture, stack on top of that, the bailouts for farmers. The total lack of understanding on who's "winning" the trade war by extension of who's actually paying more when these were imposed... it's just astoundingly sad.

       Yes and they are unfair. The tariffs you pay are low, the ones placed on out exports are high and some are so prohibitive that some companies has closed up shop in the US and moved to China making it super unfucking fair

       Unemployment numbers are entirely deceptive but, anyway, yes. I'd rather not have that $150 (which will disappear soon, anyway, to pay for the $1.2T tax break for the already absurdly wealthy who don't pay their workers - their
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       producers - enough to not be on welfare) and see my fellow Americans thrive, be a healthier workforce, have affordable homes, be free of the monstrous cost of health care as ACA is being gutted, making sure corporations are paying their fair share, a focus put on the fastest growing market in renewable energy, people who have a job - just the one - that can pay them enough to live their best life while still producing valued goods
       <em>
        within our borders
       </em>
       , dramatically shrinking our "defense" budget, public schools getting the money they're supposed to instead of corporate charter schools that are leeching off students from public schools and held to a lower standard of efficiency and financial accountability... and for America to actually be trusted again, globally, so that when someone makes a deal with us, they won't think out deals mean jack shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, ya. Take my $150 and then some. We'll all be better off for it. It's an investment in me, my kids, in you, my neighbors, in our future. I would rather die knowing my money went to work for some good, rather than dying with it sitting in a bank.

       No, what will help make more "jobs for Americans" is starting with universal healthcare. That takes a huge burden off of businesses to hire more, pay more, for doctor's offices to be more efficient and less focused on complex billing and worrying about what insurance covers vs worrying about what care a patient actually needs, and it'd even be a great incentive for businesses to move here, knowing they won't have that looming over them if they entertain the idea of moving to America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, you take the money saved + the  tax dollars from having a working class which is able to keep able bodied people in its ranks, and you dump it into infrastructure = even more jobs, literally everywhere.

       Where are you going to get the trillions to pay for socialized healthcare + wide opens borders that allows whoever else wants to come in to also be on that healthcare + people mad that you have to raise taxes so high to pay for it all + the massive long waiting lines for important surgeries like in Canada and UK?

       Businesses only give a shit about profits and having a low tax rate. If you tax them to high, like Under Obama, companies like Apple hide in Tax havens. Trump lowered the tax % on corporations and Apple brought back their tax Haven money and repatriated it laying taxes on it

       Taxes have to be massively increased to pay for this healthcare, on Americans who are already making low pay. You will destroy the middle class with this and the rich and corporations will flee to cheaper tax countries.

       This the problem debating with ideologues, you guys create this scenario in your head that something like one man building a house is easy and takes a week, but that's never the case. Go read some actual books on this topic and you'll see it's no so easy and will cause massive imbalances and possibly bankrupt the current system and classes

       Where do people get this talking point that the TPP was already dead? It only became dead when Trump got elected and pulled out of it. It literally was fast tracked for approval right before the election.

       other countries involved in the tpp had already decided not to go along with it. some sources below, Eight years in the making, the giant Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal between Australia, the US and 10 other regional powers is as good as dead after the Obama administration walked away from its plan to put it before the "lame duck" Congress ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration as president.

       Holy cow, that is some of the most revisionlist opinion pieces I have ever read. The other countries even signed the deal (abet with a different name) after Trump pulled out of the deal. The only reason the TPP was abandoned was because Trump pulled out of it according to practically  every source out there. Heck even the Australian PM called Trump after the election asking for him to reconsider (but the source you quoted said that Australian didn't want the deal which is objectively wrong). I think the sources you linked may have been confused with the Clean Power Act which was dead because of legal challenges around the same time. At least I hope because otherwise they are lying.
      </p>

       Check out any non opinion piece about the deal;

       I'm not trying to argue so please don't take my comment as so, but if the plan the whole time was to get Trump into office, why are so many members of his own party/cabinet trying to get him impeached or removed?  There's a lot of republicans with power and influence trying to say Trump is unfit for office.

       I can accept that getting him into office was the plan all along, but I don't know what their end game is now that they're trying to get him out of office.

       Maybe you can help we understand how I should be thinking about it then. I am just naturally skeptical of politicians and the political process in general, especially the presidency.

       Because a lot of the work so far has been done behind the scenes, out of public view, mainly because what's shaping a lot of the public view is the MSM, but the MSM has vested interests in keeping the status quo, so even if they were doing a lot of the things in front of the scene, you wouldn't hear about it regardless because of MSM
      </p>
      <p>
       So for now, a lot of it has been done backside, see list of CEOs/politicians resignations that really started going fast back in Oct 17 but had started a bit before that. Why are all those people resigning for no apparent reasons if nothing's happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       We're just now about to enter the phase where everyone reveals their hands, as elections are nearing close, the stakes are high and everyone wants the top spot
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately for the Deep State, they have been too reactionary and the opposing faction was 20 steps ahead the whole time.

       Idk, does a handful of CEO and politicians resigning prove anything?  It seems like you’re just choosing to interpret things in a way that supports your initial premise that work is going on “behind the scenes.”  Smells like confirmation bias to me.

       Can you give me an example of this? Because there have been a lot of pro-establishment policies and moves made by the current administration that Trump supporters conveniently overlook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the bombing of Syria under false pretenses for example. Or the multi billion dollar defense bill that Trump authorized. Do we really need more military spending and more war?
      </p>
      <p>
       He also campaigned on Saudi Arabia being a huge purveyor of terrorism and even condemned them for their involvement in 9/11, yet he signed a deal for several billion dollars providing weapons to them. Then, there's the false promises of "I will arrest Hillary Clinton", as well as the swamp monster cabinet I outlined in my post.

       Riddle me this:
      </p>
      <p>
       -US: "We have fired 59 tomahawk missiles, 57 of which reached their intended targets."
      </p>
      <p>
       -RU: "The Syrian air base was hit by 22 tomahawk missiles"
      </p>
      <p>
       Where (would you theorize) are the missing 36 missiles, 2 of which did not reach their intended targets, as per official statements from impacted parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can answer me this maybe we can get further in the conversation, else, you're not paying attention close enough to see what's going on behind the scenes.

       My thoughts exactly every time the Syria missile strike gets brought up. Fuck, that's not what the establishment wanted. The establishment wanted boots and tanks on the ground. They wanted a full on Iraq-style invasion. Check out the third presidential debate to hear it straight out of Hillary's mouth. Trump did
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       give the establishment what they wanted. He gave them a little taste and then went a completely different direction.

       I still contend that a huge portion of the reason that the turnout in the 2016 election was so low was because a whole lot of Americans could see that there wasn't a massive difference between the candidates in terms of what they were actually going to do for the American people.  Both of them seemed to want the presidency for petty, selfish reasons rather than an honest desire to make life better for the average American.

Now we have the highest gdp ever, economy is killing, unemployment is at record low, business regs have been slashed, rapeugees being brought in to live off tax payers... hes a wall a way for doing damn near everything he said he would do.. this sub was been infiltrated by u employed depressed liberal shills..

       Imagine being this far removed from reality. GDP is almost always growing therefore always reaches records. If you mean annual growth it is not a record, if you mean quarterly growth no record again.

      <p>
       Unemployment, the stock market, and all economic indicators from summer 2009 to 2018 all look the same, steady improvement with a slight uptick at the end from add 1.5 trillion in debt in a tax give away to the top earners.

       Also 'rapeugees' is a nice way to talk about those who have been forced to risk everything to save their families. I would you appreciate being born in a stable country more than you imply.

       Also, as an employed liberal shill who makes more than you, I feel for you and your ignorance coming on a conspiracy board to defend the Government and hate others for no reason.

       There's a surrealistic feeling to "trust" a couple of people on Fox over the other MSM networks, to be damn sure.  But at least they're somewhere in the 50/50 range and not claiming objectivity when they're anything but.

       Coincidentally, he was dubbed the “Pied Piper” candidate by the HRC opposition strategy team which is interesting on several levels, not the least of which could be strategic infiltration from shared bedfellows to preserve the balance of power and status quo.

       Which, to me, is the great black pill of the whole charade. Both sides
       <em>
        wildly
       </em>
       overestimate the power of a U.S. president in achieving or uprooting their aims.

       This is partly why I suspect they're trying to "merge" them into this culture. I wouldn't be surprised if they ban TD next to send the refugees here like with the Q crowd. No doubt that TPTB are trying to infuse this racist/anti-semetic/alt right vibe with this culture. Just look at the Voat subs.

       In that regard, The Trump presidency is now or never. If you want to stop China's growth, there will come a moment where doing so hurts the US more than it hurts China. At this moment it's still the other way around, but in five years time China will have eclipsed the rest of the world. Good luck at trying to stop their abuse of intellectual property then...

       <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2017/02/27/trumps-fake-crackdown-on-sex-trafficking">
        Here's a good article about why that claim is untrue.
       </a>
       The basic points are
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For starters, the 2014 data she links to is far from a complete account of U.S. sex-trafficking arrests that year. It reflects incomplete state-level arrest numbers from just 26 U.S. states, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. It does not include all state sex-trafficking arrests, by far, nor does it include anysex trafficking arrests by federal agencies such as the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which make thousands of sex trafficking arrests annually (though far fewer trafficking indictments and convictions).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And the specifics of the arrests
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        478 people arrested in a statewide California sting that included zero sex-trafficking arrests, according to a press release from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. One-hundred and forty-two men were arrested for attempting to pay consenting adult women for sexual activity. Thirty-six men were arrested for pimping. The rest of those arrested—300 in total—were women taken in on prostitution charges or people in trouble for charges unrelated to commercial sexual activity.
       </p>
       <p>
        178 men arrested in Texas for soliciting prostitution from an undercover cop posing as a consenting adult sex worker. The stings were part of a nationwide "Johns Suppression Initiative" organized annually by Cook County, Illinois, Sheriff Tom Dart.
       </p>
       <p>
        Four "pimps" and 12 people arrested on unspecified charges during a month-long Detroit operation concluded two days after Trump took office.
       </p>
       <p>
        11 people arrested as part of a "five-month cyber-sting operation led by the Spotsylvania Sheriff's Office Child Exploitation Unit in partnership with the Northern Virginia Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force." The sting—a To Catch a Predator-style operation involving police posing online as a 13-year-old into older men—began in October 2016 and ended in early February.

       This is the key question.  Investigations like that usually have been going on for months of not years.  Its same logic applied to unemployment rate.  It's as if it was 10% before trump came in and dropped below for 4% magically.

       Here's a good article about why that claim is untrue. The basic points are
      </p>
      <p>
       For starters, the 2014 data she links to is far from a complete account of U.S. sex-trafficking arrests that year. It reflects incomplete state-level arrest numbers from just 26 U.S. states, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. It does not include all state sex-trafficking arrests, by far, nor does it include anysex trafficking arrests by federal agencies such as the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which make thousands of sex trafficking arrests annually (though far fewer trafficking indictments and convictions).
      </p>
      <p>
       And the specifics of the arrests
      </p>
      <p>
       478 people arrested in a statewide California sting that included zero sex-trafficking arrests, according to a press release from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. One-hundred and forty-two men were arrested for attempting to pay consenting adult women for sexual activity. Thirty-six men were arrested for pimping. The rest of those arrested—300 in total—were women taken in on prostitution charges or people in trouble for charges unrelated to commercial sexual activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       178 men arrested in Texas for soliciting prostitution from an undercover cop posing as a consenting adult sex worker. The stings were part of a nationwide "Johns Suppression Initiative" organized annually by Cook County, Illinois, Sheriff Tom Dart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Four "pimps" and 12 people arrested on unspecified charges during a month-long Detroit operation concluded two days after Trump took office.
      </p>
      <p>
       11 people arrested as part of a "five-month cyber-sting operation led by the Spotsylvania Sheriff's Office Child Exploitation Unit in partnership with the Northern Virginia Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force." The sting—a To Catch a Predator-style operation involving police posing online as a 13-year-old into older men—began in October 2016 and ended in early February.

       Mainly that the entire establishment has been railing hard against this administration since the beginning. Every news media outlet, the tech companies, all of Hollywood, and sports. Late night television, and all of thier effort has only solidfied Trump's base even further. Unfortunately I do live in a very xenophobic racist area, and the biggest bigots love this guy. I am more interested in this because I find it fascinating. But I am not fooled for a second. Trump is all about himself. However he is heavily invested in this country and captalism, and wants to see his businesses last for his family. Nearly all of the top politicans hate him with a fury. He hijacked the highest office without going through the proper channels. Now he is somewhat building a third party. And really it's just a second party as the R's and D's are just two sides of the same coin. This will not be allowed.

        What exactly has the current administration done so far for people to think they are "anti-establishment"?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Easy.  He has been himself.    By being himself, he has become a target of the establishment.  They have attempted to nullify the election and remove or prevent his power through such things as the "Muh Russia" narrative, and the "Hillary didn't mean to break the law, let's let her go" thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       History is not going to look kindly on these things, and on those establishment actors pissing on the constitution and other laws so freely.  I thank the stars every day for having helped get him elected just for him becoming a lightning rod and his attracting the corrupt elements of opposition that he has, leaving them open to exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he's only 1/8th the way through his presidency!  Just think what other revelations are to come in the next six years!  Just think of what other antics his unhinged opposition are going to try!  This is, as they say, the best timeline ever!

       I keep an additional $4.60 every month. I am not willing to sell out my future for so low.  He's destroying the EPA, getting us in a trade war (which has and will continue to cause huge price increases in commodities), he's alienating our allies and filling his pockets with clear and obvious cronyism.   Who cares about Russia when you have a president who vacations to his own property on his own dime.  A president who hosts foreign diplomats in his own hotels? Who fills his cabinets with business partners, some of which are under federal investigation. Trump has done everything he said he was going to except "drain the swamp" and release his tax returns. We get all the worst of his promises and no benefits.

       The repeal of H1B has benefits to all American workers. It was a loophole to replace workers with cheap foreign replacements, now the loophole is closed. This contributes to higher wages for US workers. Trump's executive order to fire Federal employees at will, now he freezes their automatic pay raises, in which they already make too much and have unsustainable pensions. Repealing the individual mandate just like he said he would. "Right to try" legislation was pushed through by Trump, possibly saving millions if lives and giving those with terminal illness the dignity to treat their illness however they wish. All of these positions are right on in my mind, as a liberal. I can only imagine conservatives are even more enthusiastic.

       Trade is a big one. Trump is closer to sanders on trade with those countries that do not trade fairly ie china.  Trump is said to have suggested single payer healthcare but was dissuaded by the corporate interests in his party. Trump is highly, vocally critical of the iraq war.  Hes not anti establishment like many wish, but he is less establishment than clinton bush or obama. That is a fact.

       well i am enjoying the extra 100 a mo from tax cuts,the other stuff he has done don't affect me in things i do. but i agree w you on hiring the swamp creatures. The Elite have run the major world countries since they were born and will continue to do so. Voting makes no diff because the swamp covers both sides. All entangled together joined at the neck, all blackmailable, blah blah connect the dots.

       So you want to blame Clinton for placing the law and Sessions for enforcing it for only two weeks. And it wasn't cruel of Trump to allow Sessions to enforce the cruel law for two weeks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have a source that it was only enforced for two weeks? Because it seems like it was in place for a lot longer than that. I would love to be proven wrong on this.

       No, what will help make more "jobs for Americans" is starting with universal healthcare. That takes a huge burden off of businesses to hire more, pay more, for doctor's offices to be more efficient and less focused on complex billing and worrying about what insurance covers vs worrying about what care a patient actually needs, and it'd even be a great incentive for businesses to move here, knowing they won't have that looming over them if they entertain the idea of moving to America.

       Then, you take the money saved + the  tax dollars from having a working class which is able to keep able bodied people in its ranks, and you dump it into infrastructure = even more jobs, literally everywhere.
