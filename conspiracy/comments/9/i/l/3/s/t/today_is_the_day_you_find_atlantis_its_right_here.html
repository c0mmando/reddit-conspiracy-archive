        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Atlantis:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>DMS:</strong> 21¬∞ 7‚Ä≤ 26.4‚Ä≥ N, 11¬∞ 24‚Ä≤ 7.2‚Ä≥ W</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decimal:</strong> 21.124, -11.402</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=21.124,-11.402&amp;amp;q=21.124,-11.402&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=10">Google Maps link.</a></p>

<p>(But it&#39;s best to look at it in Google Earth. See below why).</p>

<hr/>

<p>Before you ask: it&#39;s called the Richat structure, or the Eye of the Sahara. I bet you never heard of it. It is so huge it&#39;s visible from space. </p>

<p>It is a complete and utter geological mystery. It used to be believed to be a meteor crater, but that was quickly ruled out. The hypothesis is now that it is a volcanic phenomenon: a half-baked eruption that subsequently collapsed on itself. Whatever it is, everyone agrees it was severely eroded.</p>

<p>Atlantis can&#39;t be in the Western Sahara, you say? Well, the evidence is overwhelming.</p>

<p>1) The Sahara was not always a desert.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.livescience.com/28493-when-sahara-desert-formed.html">https://www.livescience.com/28493-when-sahara-desert-formed.html</a></p>

<p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2010-01-secrets-sahara-revealed.html">https://phys.org/news/2010-01-secrets-sahara-revealed.html</a></p>

<p>That part of the Western Sahara in particular is ridden with sea shells. Look at the structure closely, and you will see traces of water flowing everywhere.</p>

<p>2) Place the Atlantic ocean 300m higher (or the Western Sahara 300m lower), and the &quot;Eye of the Sahara&quot; would be in the center of an island, with canals flowing into it.</p>

<p>3) It is the very same shape and very same dimensions as described by Plato (<a href="https://ascendingpassage.com/plato-atlantis-timaeus.htm">Timaeus</a> and <a href="https://ascendingpassage.com/plato-atlantis-critias.htm">Critias</a>) (when you add-up the lengths you get a total diameter of 127 stadia or about 77&#39;000 feet / 23.5 km, see sources at the end).</p>

<p>4) That&#39;s <a href="https://www.akg-images.com/Docs/AKG/Media/TR3_WATERMARKED/1/d/2/5/AKG5227499.jpg">pretty much where Herodote (450 BC) places Atlantis.</a></p>

<p>5) Look at this: <strong>21¬∞ 0&#39;54.18&quot;N 11¬∞50&#39;8.83&quot;W</strong>. This smaller circle is about 4 kilometers in diameter. Do you believe this is natural too? Quite amazing.</p>

<p>6) Look at this (zoom in very closely): <strong>21¬∞ 8&#39;13.16&quot;N 11¬∞29&#39;32.37&quot;W</strong>. You see all those parallel lines? Are these ruins of ship docks? You&#39;ll find them in several places on that western side of the eye.</p>

<p>7) If you download the NGDC ETOPO1 kms file for Google Earth, you get to see fine Earth relief in color. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO1/tiled/ice_surface/etopo1_ice_surface.kmz">https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO1/tiled/ice_surface/etopo1_ice_surface.kmz</a></p>

<p>Look around, you&#39;ll see other evidence of settlement around the Eye of the Sahara. Please post coordinates in the comment section, for the record. </p>

<p>8) Look at the coast due West of the Eye of the Sahara. Do you see traces of a tsunami or other cataclysm here? MudFossil University speculates the whole Sahara sea was drained (zoom out and you&#39;ll see what he means).</p>

<p>9) Doesn&#39;t it indeed look like an eye? You&#39;ve got the eyebrow and everything. Is this the &quot;eye of horus&quot;? Atlanteans are said to have migrated east after the deluge, to the highlands of Ethiopia, where they became kings, and subsequently the pharaos of Egypt.</p>

<hr/>

<p>If humans built this, they were indeed &quot;gods&quot;.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDoM4BmoDQM">This Youtube video</a> is the one that broke the news to the masses.</p>

<p>The documentary he refers to at the end, Visiting Atlantis, can be viewed for free on Youtube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76e-A7RNjKI">Here is Part 1.</a></p>

<p>The Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8v44qrU_Fdd7UN_XlUMpew/videos">MudFossil University</a> also has good content (search Atlantis or Sahara in his channel), with crazy stuff like the giant antediluvian fish &amp; dragon that became mountains :)</p>

<hr/>

<p>TLDR: Now you know where Atlantis was located, and where the &quot;eye of Horus&quot; design comes from. Cool day huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plato says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[...] the combatants on the other side were led by the kings of the islands of Atlantis, which, as I was saying, once had an extent greater than that of Libya and Asia (Turkey); and, when afterward sunk by an earthquake, became an impassable barrier of mud to voyagers sailing from hence to the ocean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But afterward there occurred violent earthquakes and floods, and in a single day and night of rain all your warlike men in a body sunk into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared, and was sunk beneath the sea.</p>

<p>And that is the reason why the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable, because there is such a quantity of shallow mud in the way; and this was caused by the subsidence of the island.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this is a hypothesis: there used to be was a Sahara sea (the same one that eroded the base of the Sphinx in Egypt), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas">12&#39;000 years ago</a> something caused it to drain into the Atlantic ocean (and thus produce a global flood/tsunami). So literally the &quot;island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared, and was sunk beneath the sea&quot; (as it was in the way of the massive drainage). And indeed it would have become &quot;impassable and impenetrable, because there is such a quantity of shallow mud in the way&quot;. </p>

<p>Thus was born the Sahara desert.</p>

<p>I agree with MudFossil that you seem to see this drainage taking place across the Sahara on Google Earth. </p>

<p>Interesting question: did the Atlantes attempt a canal between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic? Or did they try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara_Sea">something like this</a>? </p>

<p>The impact theory regarding the Younger Dryas I find interesting, because it has implications. I have lately been exposing myself more to the idea that it may have been related to sun activity, which I find interesting as a lot of the evidence to support it overlaps with the impact theory (Fulgarite vs Trinitite, etc)</p>

<li><p>Mauritania is not a safe country. Crime and terrorism is high and foreigners are targeted. Not easy to go there and explore.</p></li>
<li><p>Nobody has made any detailed exploration of the area. At most they have literally and figuratively only scratched the surface. </p></li>
<li><p>11,600 years is a very long time. What do you think would be left of any modern city on the surface in 11,600 years? That&#39;s right, you&#39;d see nothing without taking a much closer look (aka digging). I&#39;d also bet that with global sea level rises most coastal city areas would be underwater, making it even harder to find/see them. (Much like we can&#39;t see much of our past history due to sea level rises, but that&#39;s another story for another time).</p></li>
<li><p>If Atlantis was hit by earthquakes and floods so severe it wiped them out in one single day you can bet on that it was mostly -if not completely- washed away and/or buried deep. We just have to go look for it. (see #1 though)</p></li>
<li><p>The blueish discoloration you see in and around the area is indicative of big metal deposits - tin, zinc &amp; copper in particular. Plato described walls made of such materials. 11,600 years would reduce those solid metal into oxide deposits. </p></li>

Maybe it was a large nomadic trading center with non permanent structures or the hydrothermals eroded away everything that&#39;s left.

    <div class="md"><p>So... I&#39;m just a guy with a BS in Geology, so don&#39;t take this as some kind of &quot;rock solid fact&quot; (hee hee), but my specialty was sedimentology and erosion is kinda my jam.</p>

<p>So a dome forms when seismic stresses force a series of rock layers to bend upward.  When erosion (wind, sand) cut down that high spot, it results in a circular appearance to the cross section.  Here&#39;s a terrible MS paint example of what that looks like.  This is very common in nature, this structure appears to just be a very large example of that, in a place with no vegetation or moisture, so you can really see the beautiful and complex stratigraphy on display.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know the erosive patterns of this region, relative age of the mountains compared to the dome, or necessarily even the erosive forces at work here, but given the banded rock, circular faulting, and old evidence of aqueous erosion (the branch like patterns surrounding the dome) I&#39;d say it&#39;s fairly archetypical.</p>

<p>The mountains could be newer, or made of a more resistant rock, or not exposed to the same water sources the dome was.</p>

<p>Either way I&#39;d say it&#39;s far more likely that the circular bands in the rock here formed the way I said, than it being some portal to a lost ancient world or formed by some mysterious ancient technology.</p>

Interesting - certainly ticks a lot of boxes. However, would it not have been very cold last time global sea levels were that low? I live in the north west of Scotland and it is hardly a good place to grow food crops. 13 thousand years ago we were under an ice sheet! I&#39;d be interested to know whether you have considered this.Ôªø </p>

<p>I believe this is the correct version:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2fS9ixfQ_no">https://youtube.com/watch?v=2fS9ixfQ_no</a></p>

<p>OP had also added the correct timestamp to his link, to the place where he talks about the <a href="http://home.hiwaay.net/%7Ejalison/">ancient equator</a>. However I highly recommend you watch the whole thing.</p>

<p>Try it yourself on Google Earth: connect Gizah, Ollantaytambo, Nazca and Easter island with a straight line, and that line goes through what would have been the island of Atlantis. The eye is furthermore oriented like the line.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Plato mentions that Atlantis is an Island. For your theory to work, the plains of the Ric</p></li>
<li><p>Following the global deluge, the lands would have been flooded, not revealed. </p></li>
<li><p>Plato states that the inhabitants of Atlantis and the Athenians went to war. But there is no evidence of civilization at the Richat structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Herodotus is known for making mistakes with his geographical representations. A simple example is the orientation of the Thermopylae pass. Herodotus describes it to be oriented from North to South but in fact, the Thermopylae pass is oriented from West to East. Herodotus erred because he had in mind the function of the Thermopylae pass: It connects northern and southern Greece. </p></li>
<li><p>It is simply far too wide, at Approx. 35km, too elevated, at approx. 400metres, and too far from the sea, at approx. 500km, to be seriously considered as the location of Atlantis. </p></li>
<li><p>There are other structures very similar too it, <a href="https://www.google.ie/search?q=semsiyat+dome&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy97XU1NTdAhWGOsAKHai5BmUQ_AUIDigB&amp;amp;biw=1274&amp;amp;bih=696">even ones as close as 5km to the RS</a></p></li>
<li><p>There was a bustling port city in Atlantis. But the ground is too low to the structures for the ships to have traveled on them if it was indeed Atlantis. There is also no evidence of a port.</p></li>

<p>Then why do they matter? If he was so insistent on the coincidental clash of time between the sinking of Atlantis and the ending of the Younger Dryas, then surely he should be aware of what he&#39;s implying.</p>

<p>Again, what evidence does he have that they were indigenous?</p>

<ul>
<li>@ 10:19. &quot; What about stone buildings?.... Well, unfortunately, no one has ever gone looking...no heavy equipment has ever been brought to the Richat for excavation. &quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming you are correct in saying that the Richat had been pushed up, as stated @ 8:43, then why haven&#39;t the stone buildings been pushed up? Natural disasters reveal lost ruins all the time.</p>

<p>These are some of the few problems I have with this theory.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s not just the Richat structure that was lifted according to the theory, but the entirety of the surrounding land as well, including the sand that might be hiding the hypothetical evidence, thus leaving the buildings (if there are any) buried.</p>

<p>The 5000 years thing was how long ago large nearby lakes existed (and to imply that similar lakes existed long before that). He&#39;s suggesting that the ruins of Atlantis were buried when one such lake (for whatever reason) went the way of Lake Missoula and flooded out into the Atlantic. I guess he thinks the rapid climatic change was on hold for those ~7k years?</p>

<p>Yes, I am aware of that proposition. The problem is is that Subsurface magam enforced uplift doesn&#39;t work they way he&#39;s implying. </p>

<p>When magma pushes the earth up, it does so through a bulge. </p>

<p>The Richat would have to be a dome. </p>

<p>Unless this is some freak phenomenon.</p>

<p>In fact, the article he sources on Antarctica actually mentions this](<a href="https://www.livescience.com/60885-Antarctica-map-river-water-melt-magma.html">https://www.livescience.com/60885-Antarctica-map-river-water-melt-magma.html</a>)</p>

<p>As mentioned, this is very interesting, but there&#39;s very little if any evidence for it. And what evidece of an uplift that could be there would contradict what he says because thats not how magma uplifts work.</p>

<p>This proposition itself has several problems</p>

<p>Lake Missoula&#39;s flooding left obvious marks on the earth. You would today refer to these as the great Coulee and the scablands. </p>

<p>While experts like J. Harlen Bretz would propose that they were created by one cataclysmic wave, he would concede to accepting the multi-lake theory later on. reluctantly. </p>

<p>There are no such marks on Africa. And most definitely not to the scale that he&#39;s implying. Those marks that he brings up that seem to sweep from nears the northeast of the Richat to the southwestern coast? Those are the Atlas and other mountain ranges.</p>

<p>My other problems include the lack of a flood myth for nearby cultures.</p>

<p>Sure, the Mandin people&#39;s of the Mali empire <a href="https://books.google.ie/books?id=4Qiq4ps_wDIC&amp;amp;pg=PT71&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false">did have a flood myth</a>, but they never ventured deeply into Mauritiana, and they never truly interacted with the people&#39;s near the Richat.</p>

<p>EDIT: Rechecking my Atlas et al mountains claim. Will update soon.</p>

<li>It was an island 12,000 years ago. There&#39;s plenty of evidence to suggest the ocean once reached that far inland thousands of years, including sea shells and remains from sea animals hundreds of miles inland.</li>
<li>Depends on the kind of flood, and the direction it came from. Also, the land raised over time as the oceans frozen over. So its not entirely out of the realm of possibility or probability.</li>
<li>They have found canon balls and other remains in the area. Hasn&#39;t been properly excavated.</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>It matches Plato&#39;s dimensions precisely. 12,000 years ago this region was actually at sea level, and the land was actually an island.</li>
<li>Kind of, but none of the others match Plato&#39;s description or dimensions.</li>
<li>There&#39;s evidence this area was filled with water at some point, and it could have functioned as a port. There&#39;s also artifacts like fishing nets and canon balls that suggest there was once ships in the area. As well as remains of sea life, shells, etc. The ocean definitely reached this area at some point in history.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think a lot of your concerns are pretty easily addressed. I&#39;m fairly new to this theory as well, but this documentary has a ton of info: <a href="https://visitingatlantis.com">https://visitingatlantis.com</a></p>

<p>Based on all the other theories I&#39;ve seen, this one matches Plato&#39;s own words almost perfectly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is off the top of my head so some numbers might be off. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.  (And it‚Äôs probably choppy because it‚Äôs late here.)</p>

<p>Background:
Plato‚Äôs wrote about the lost city of Atlantis in 359BC. He described a coastal civilization with southern access to the sea, protected by huge, river-studded mountains to the north.  The civilization was built on two concentric rings of land, separated by rings of water (almost looks like an eye.) The people there enjoyed natural hot and cold fresh water springs in the eye of the land mass.</p>

<p>About 11,600 years ago, Atlantis disappeared into the sea in one day and night of turmoil. </p>

<p>On the coast of Africa, about 200 miles in and 1300ft above sea level there is a land formation of 2 concentric rings, measuring about 23 miles across. It‚Äôs called the Richat structure (the eye of the Sahara). He drew on these similarities:
-the concentric rings of the formation are exactly as Plato described
-11,600 years ago, when the oceans were deeper, this formation would be right off the Atlantic Ocean. Since then, the land has most likely risen due to plate tectonics, so at the time it was probably at sea level
-around 11,000-12,500 years ago scientists know there was some sort of disaster (like a volcano or comet) that would have caused sea levels to rapidly rise, and weather to rapidly change. This could have easily caused a tsunami that would have buried the formation
-the land flow in the area is indicative of just that sort of disaster. 
-there are natural fresh water springs in the eye of the land mass, despite the surrounding land only having salt water
-artifacts related to a sea-centric civilization have been found in this area. </p>

<p>The dude listed off more similarities between this area and the legend of Atlantis, but those are some big ones.  A lot of them were compelling. </p>

<p>‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
It makes me think of the fun fact ‚ÄúCleopatra VII existed closer to our time now than the time of the Pyramids.‚Äù  Humans are really ancient. 5000 years ago we were building the pyramids, and that history is almost lost to antiquity. 
There could very well have had a prosperous civilization existing 11,000 years ago that‚Äôs completely lost. Far more advanced than the primal man that dotted other regions of the world. 
Hidden by changing landscapes and climates. Hinted at in legend. </p>

<p>I hope archeologists start getting interested in this area. </p>

Imagine if there was snow on the mountains just west of the eye (seems plausible back then if there was more rain and lower temperatures), that melted down into a river along this path.

    <div class="md"><p>The bones are from fossils millions of years old,  far predating man,  and the creation of any Atlantis. There are signs such fossils found in the pyramid at giza.  Egypt, during the cretaceous period was partly ocean. There has not been ocean there in eons. The speculation is that the Sahara likely oscillates between desert wasteland and grasslands every 20000 years or so. Most estimates also put max sea level change in the last 200,000 years at 150 meters,  which is still significantly below the level the eye of the Sahara is at.</p>

<p>Plus there&#39;s the fact that he&#39;s using plato&#39;s description of the city,  but only using the concentric circles as a proof,  ignoring all other details laid out by Plato.  That is also covered in the video. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His point of the potential rise of the area is ignoring the rates seen at nearby subsurface activity that he mentions,  and ignores the causes of the incredible pace the Antarctic continent rise.  </p>

<p>Antarctica rises that fast due to losing weight via ice melt,  and other areas considered &quot;fast&quot; rise at half the rate of western Antarctica.  That region would have to rise at the same rates as Iceland and alaska,  in an area that&#39;s not rising anywhere near that rate in recorded geological history. </p>

<p>He looks at the canary islands,  which were from volcanic activity millions of years ago,  not an indication of quick,  sustained rise, especially in anything recent geologically. The comparison makes the richat structure less likely to have risen in that time. </p>

<p>The water underneath,  which does contain some salt,  is not similar to sea water,  but to other hydrothermal water sources, and the area does not have signs of being part of the ocean, or indications of sea life unlike some limestone in Egypt. He even mentions the fact that we have evidence of a mass river system in Mauritania,  ignoring that it wouldn&#39;t exist if his ocean theory were true.</p>

<p>He also noted that Plato specifically suggests Atlantis fell into the ocean,  so the area had to go underwater completely,  then rise faster than any other area outside of Antarctica in that time? Unlikely is an understatement, especially with such huge swathes of the continent needing to be under the sea for that area to be sea level. </p>

<p>The other descriptions of the islands around Atlantis don&#39;t match with his topographical tool, either,  as pointed out in the other video. </p>

<p>The existence of artifacts is interesting,  but does note mean anything when we are talking about Atlantis.</p>

<p>Just curious, where are you seeing that data? I don&#39;t know, but I agree that the elevation of the Riccat structure is the biggest thing against the theory. I still think that it could possibly have risen, considering that the African plate is moving and rising over the Eurasian plate.</p>

<p>I think everything else is fairly consistent and explainable. &quot;Falling into the ocean&quot; could be the same as being hit by a tsunami, then flooded until the water finally receded back as the land rose. The area would be muddy and just below the sea level, just as Plato described. And I thought the description of the islands seemed to match remarkably well based on the second video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The plates are colliding,  but historically Africa has been subducting under Eurasia, and the science for the opposite in the most recent 2 million years,  although possible, is still forthcoming, and mainly in the areas of the Mediterranean,  not the western region.

<p>You have to look at the islands,  not of Atlantis,  but the ones that were gifted to Poseidons other children. The topography just looks like a mess for what he claims should be the other islands. </p>

<p>Sea level along Mauritania has been relatively unchanged since the holocene ended,  seen here. </p>

<p>This also points to a tropical environment being more spread across the Mauritania and west Africa region by having certain species of tropical frogs from the period before the holocene era,  further giving evidence that the area was not oceanic. </p>

<p>it&#39;s also pretty obvious to me that whatever cataclysm ended that civilization radically changed the world. the <em>entire</em> sahara desert is the result of whatever happened. it doesn&#39;t seem far fetched that the ground levels changed in a moment due to plate tectonics, aka a megaquake. such a quake could have easily shifted things in more directions than just up and down, causing a massive tsunami and leaving atlantis high and dry after the waters receeded. it&#39;s honestly the only way to explain how like all of mauritania feels like its built from the sea floor, imo.</p>

<p>I cannot see the video because my internet is exceedingly slow, I can only see the faint outline of a half-loaded Google maps, and I noticed the Irish legends bit of your comment.</p>

<p>Is that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupine_Bank">porcupine bank</a> that you are referring to?</p>

<p>If so, I have done my own little bit of research on this. </p>

<p>My conclusion is that while it might not be Atlantis, it is most definitely something. Perhaps, although not likely, the lost island of Hy-Brasil. </p>

<p><a href="http://journals.fcla.edu/flgeog/article/view/76875">Robert Fuson</a>, a geography professor at the University of South Florida, <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Legendary_Islands_of_the_Ocean_Sea.html?id=tTyBAAAAMAAJ">considers Hy-Brasil based on a real observation</a>, in his opinion, it is based on some unknown but recent tectonic activity. Multiple portolans depict Hy-Brasil as an island. I perceive it to be Hy-Brasil post-innundation. </p>

In a geological sense, the world hasn&#39;t really changed all that much since humans came around. Sure there&#39;s been ice ages and shifting sea levels, but the biggest changes take far longer to go into effect. </p>

<p>Furthermore, there is evidence that early humans may have travelled through the present day Sahara before it became the massive desert we see now. And by travel I mean on foot, not by boat or anything like that. </p>

<p>Looking at the nearby city of Quadane, it seems to be a reasonable size too, although I would think there would be remains of other buildings. It also has marks that may suggest it is just river flow. </p>

<p>Much of the area seems to be surrounded by higher land, so it would be interesting to visualise this if the water was indeed higher. It could just be the erosion described on the Wikipedia page as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting post, you gathered a lot of references.</p>

<p>Looking at the geologic history of the area, I don&#39;t believe that it existed in a sea, per se. But from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/11/beneath-the-saharan-sands-a-river-valley/">this article</a> it looks like a river ran nearby around 5000 years ago. Perhaps there was something like what the Aztecs had with Tenochtitlan by using canals to create a low-lying lake around the area.</p>

<p>I would continue researching the idea with a deep dive on mythologies from ancient peoples of the region and trying to corroborate it with the geology of that specific region. The Sahara is a big place and the history of the Nile side might be very different from the history of the Atlantic side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;ve never heard it called Atlantis before.... </p>

<p>You are right about one thing, of course people used to live in the Sahara. A lot of things did. There are <a href="https://www.kidsdiscover.com/quick-reads/nigers-dabous-giraffes-sculptures-new-stone-age/">rock carvings in northern Niger of basically a life-sized giraffe</a>. The closest giraffes currently are about 600kms away. </p>

<p>The thing about The Eye is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_dome">lava domes are not uncommon</a>. How was the structure made? This <a href="http://eyeofthesahara-ses.blogspot.com/p/tourism.html">BBC Canada segment explains a bit of detail</a>. Lava dome. Erosion. Happens a lot.... Which is why there&#39;s a second smaller lava dome nearby. </p>

<p>Where I will leave the door open for you: The entire Sahara could have <a href="https://www.livescience.com/4180-sahara-desert-lush-populated.html">easily had water and people for a couple thousand years</a>. Then later erosion do the work of pulverizing the lava dome over the Eye, as opposed to the 7 million years ago erosion possibility when the Tethys Ocean covered the area. The real question is how such a technologically advanced civilization could leave the Eye so devoid of materials related to human settlement that exist elsewhere in the Sahara. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. See, this is the difference between theory and fact.</p>

<p>A lot of theories, which collaborate and can make it through review, become facts.</p>

<p>This is a bunch of theories which people are still debating,  therefore we don‚Äôt KNOW anything, so it‚Äôs not fact and I only have heard another theory for Atlantis, I don‚Äôt KNOW, as there‚Äôs only circumstantial (the appearance of connectivity isn‚Äôt evidence.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, the elevation difference in where the eye is to the coast threw me off, but it&#39;s relatively 2,000 ft above the coast of Western Africa.  I suppose it&#39;s plausible, but why would any water autodrain, unless you believe the land suddenly shifted upward. </p>

<p>I guess the confusion for me would be that for the &quot;tsunami-type&quot; exit this area shows, you have to wonder why it wouldn&#39;t focus on already established waterways, and be so broad in size.  There&#39;d have to be a massive exodus of water.  It would be like the Great Lakes draining or maybe a cut off of the Mediterranean that led the water west.  Any support of the Mediterranean being cut off and dried up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really well done, and thanks for linking the video. Even looking at the google maps link it was clear something unusual was going on. It looks very regular for a natural formation, and not quite right for an impact crater. Don‚Äôt know why the video made me think of this, but he mentioned Egypt as a vassal state to Atlantis, and also that Solon sets the date for the demise of Atlantis at approx 11,200 years ago, and it made me think maybe the Atlantans built the sphinx- cause around 11,000 years ago we were still in an age of Leo... just a thought</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gotta admit, I had my doubts (and still do), but this is one of the most plausible theories on Atlantis I&#39;ve heard yet. Now, I&#39;m still quite skeptical on whether Atlantis ever truly existed at all, but I do admit that if it did, this seems like a good candidate. I do however think that there are some holes in this theory, as well as some poor arguments/large assumptions/misinterpretation; but I don&#39;t think it completely discredits the theory. I&#39;d be very interested to see more experienced, scholarly parties get involved with this hypothesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you trace what used to be a shoreline, you can really get a sense of where the rivers and basins filled the landscape.</p>

<p>With the ancient shoreline close to the Richat structure, one can clearly see where the water cut main valleys/rivers ever closer to the structure (see north above and turn facing south). With water covering the lower areas, you can clearly make out an island just outside the shoreline. I&#39;ve scanned the area pretty comprehensive, and I&#39;ve found at least 3 structures clearly made by humans a long time ago. Can anyone shed some light to as what they might possibly be?</p>

<p>Coordinates: 21¬∞35&#39;08.92&quot; N  11¬∞17&#39;29.18&quot; W (all 3 structures should be visible here).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of a &quot;Sahara sea&quot; is indeed plausible/possible. Modern engineers even considered (re-?)creating it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Sahara Sea was the name of a hypothetical macro-engineering project which proposed flooding endorheic basins in the Sahara Desert with waters from the Atlantic Ocean or Mediterranean Sea. The goal of this unrealized project was to create an inland sea that would cover the substantial areas of the Sahara Desert which lie below sea level, bringing humid air, rain and agriculture deep into the desert.</p>

<p>The possibility of such a project was raised several times by different scientists and engineers during the late 19th century and early 20th century, primarily from European colonial powers in Africa. The concept of a flooded Sahara was also featured in novels of the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i mean its an interesting theory ill give you that.</p>

<p>what is the elevation of the place? how much higher would sea levels need to be for that to be accessible by the ocean?</p>

<p>what is interesting is just how far back you need to roll the clock for that to be the case. most of ancient history we&#39;ve been uncovering has been at the current edge of the water or below where a lot of old settlements were swallowed by rising seas, not receding ones.</p>

<p>alternatively has there been anything happened thats lead to an upheaval in western africa? </p>

<p>the geology locally looks like a good candidate and would explain how they were able to build a perfectly ringed city that large, if they built in the crater of a funky but dormant volcano (something that could also be the source for an upheaval)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is probably an old mine/quarry used during ww2. You see, France was invaded in the early days of the war and the country was occupied by the Nazis until 1944. But, the french owned pretty much all of west Africa as colonies, so this was most likely a mine used to supply the allies and the last of the french army with iron for weapons or sulfur for gunpowder. Even if it¬¥s not a mine, it probably isn¬¥t an ancient city either because it¬¥s very big and most old cities were only the size of towns, and, well, it¬¥s a hole.</p>

<p>I think it was near there. They probably lost some of the original landmass due to some sort of kinetic weapon (extremely dense material probably shot from a weapon that was suppose to deflect comets), and then were finished off from the flood. I imagine in our future we will rediscover the use of hyper dense material ( think a bb sized round that can level a tank and the tanks behind it ) and we will probably destroy ourselves again. The people 10000 years from them will tell similar stories about an advanced worldwide civ that could fly and talk across the globe. </p>

<p>This is the first time I‚Äôve heard of Atlantis being located in the Sahara. I‚Äôve always liked the idea that it was the prehistoric origin of the universal flood myth, something cataclysmic that occurred <em>somewhere</em> in the Atlantic (‚Äúbeyond the pillars of Heracles‚Äù aka the straitss of Gibraltar) causing destruction thousands of miles away and spreading survivors far and wide, and with them the story, which was passed down over the years. It slowly settled into distantly shared memory and eventually became the mythologies of wildly different cultures all over the world.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve always loved the subject and the mystery of the origin of the myology, including everything from Gilgamesh to Noah‚Äôs Flood to flood myths in Celtic, Mayan, and Minoan cultures.</p>

<p>That subject is compelling, and that image is gorgeous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch the documentary, it shows the kind of artefacts that were found. Nothing major. The Dogon&#39;s incredible knowledge about Sirius is probably the best regional anthropo-archeological trace we have.</p>
