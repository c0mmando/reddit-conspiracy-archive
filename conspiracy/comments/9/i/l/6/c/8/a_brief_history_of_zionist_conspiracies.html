<li><p>The RFK (JFK&#39;s brother) assassination</p></li>
<li><p>USS Liberty attack</p></li>
<li><p>The Lavon Affair</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Let&#39;s begin:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>911 Solved:
On the day of the 911 attack, 3 Israelis filmed both planes hitting the 2 towers. They were seen celebrating, dancing, and taking selfies with the burning towers. In addition, two men were arrested in New York on the day of 911 in a van filled with explosives under the George Washington Bridge. The institutional media totally stopped reporting on this fact once they learned that the men were Israeli.

<li><p>JFK assassination solved:
Here is the key information:
In the 1950s, Israeli agents stole enriched uranium from America and were using it to create nuclear weapons at their Dimona facility.
JFK told the Israeli prime minister that he wanted to have Dimona inspected for illegal nuclear activities.
JFK also wanted to make AIPAC (American Israeli Political Action Committee) register as a foreign agent.
JFK was also in favor of the right of return for Palestinian refugees to be able to return to their homes.
And Robert was the AG (Attorney General) under his brother.
As the AG, he was prosecuting the Jewish/Zionist mob, which is a major source of Israeli power.
So the Zionists killed JFK knowing that he would be succeeded by the vice President LBJ. LBJ was under Israeli influence because he was sleeping with an Israeli spy named Mathilde Krim. Krim was a former member of Irgun. Irgun was a Zionists terrorist group that used bombs, mass murder, and assassinations to help drive the British out of Palestine so that the Zionist could create Israel.
Under LBJ, all of the policies for which Israel hated JFK changed completely in Israel&#39;s favor.
Later, when RFK ran for president and was very likely to win, they killed him also. He had the same beliefs on Israel as his brother and if he won, he was preparing to initiate a real investigation into his brothers assassination.

<p><em>&quot;How do jews run the world&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read no such allegation in OPs post. Did I miss something?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;yet get fucked up every 50 years or so?&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>50 years ago was 1968. Israel had just won a huge victory in the Six Day War, seizing Jerusalem and the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula. Calling that &quot;getting fucked&quot; would be a stretch...</p>

<p>The 1940&#39;s saw the Holocaust (a horrific nightmare for European Jews, but a <em>&quot;miracle&quot;</em> for <strong><em>the Zionists</em></strong>, because it FORCED Jews to flee to Palestine). The late 1940&#39;s and early 1950&#39;s also witnessed the &quot;Nakba&quot;, where the Zionists FORCED some 800,000 Palestinian Arabs to flee from Palestine... Followed by the forced migration of a similar number of Mizrai Jews OUT of predominantly Arab/ Muslim countries in the Middle East/ North Africa INTO the freshly hatched Zionist State, where they (like their brethren who fled the Holocaust) served Zionist interests by creating the population base needed to form a viable <em>&quot;Jewish State&quot;</em>.</p>

<p>50 years prior to that -- at the turn of the century-- <strong><em>most</em></strong> of the aforementioned Jews living in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa were (with a few notable exceptions) doing <em>quite well</em>, especially in Germany, France, Britain and other Western European countries where they were enjoying the benefits of <strong><em>emancipation</em></strong> that had been ongoing for some time.</p>

<p><em>On the whole</em>, emancipation was working well -- Jews were integrating into the societies and social structures of their &quot;home countries&quot;, and were quite well accepted by their non-Jewish fellows, rising to prominent positions in commerce, industry, bureaucracy and government.</p>

<p>Indeed, some have suggested that Jews were doing <strong><em>too well</em></strong>, that they were becoming so adapted and acclimated in their <em>emancipated</em> status that they were FULLY ASSIMILATING -- interacting so comfortably in Gentile society (and <strong><em>intermarrying</em></strong>) that the were at serious risk of becoming <em>&quot;extinct&quot;</em> as a distinct Nation (people), not due to pogroms or persecution, but by attrition: There was a <em>very real fear</em> that Jews might blend-and-breed the &quot;Jewish Race&quot; out of existence -- a fate that had (apparently) befallen the <em>Lost Ten Tribes of Israel</em> many centuries earlier.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that <em>many Jews</em> of the day were keenly aware of this looming threat to the continuity of the &quot;Jewish Race&quot; which, amazingly, had managed to <strong><em>preserve</em></strong> its integrity and distinct identity for millennia, primarily thanks to laws and customs, both secular and religious, that enforced strictly limited social interaction between Jewish communities and their Gentile &quot;host&quot; nations. Jewish communities were notoriously insular, and intermarriage was virtually non-existent.</p>

<p>As <em>emancipation</em> progressed, all that began to unravel. The cohesiveness (and autonomy) of Jewish social structure began to dissolve, and <em>Jewish Identity</em> was waning, with Jews <em>primarily</em> seeing themselves as Germans (or Frenchen or etc), with their &quot;Jewishness&quot; becoming secondary, ancillary, or in many cases, <em>entirely irrelevant</em>.</p>

<p>It was during this period of social transition that Zionism took root -- with the seemingly far-fetched idea of PRESERVING the Jewish People (bloodline/race) from extinction by creating a Political Nation State (<em>&quot;Judenstaat&quot;</em>) that would allow (or force) a continuance of the <strong><em>separatism</em></strong> -- the social/ pseudo-religious barrier that had effectively preserved Jews *as a &quot;Race&quot;/ Nation for thousands of years.</p>

<p>It was a lofty goal, no doubt; as it would require Zionists gaining control of a sizable piece of real estate (Palestine was chosen, but others such as Argentina and African options were seriously considered) and the feat of convincing Jews to MOVE to the &quot;Jewish State&quot; envisioned by the Zionists visionaries would prove to be far more difficult than they had imagined.</p>

<p>But in spite of these obstacles and against all odds <strong><em>they did it!</em></strong> After 50 years of relentless effort (and unspeakable sacrifice on the part of common Jews and non-Jews), the Zionists carved themselves a &quot;Homeland&quot; where the precious &quot;Jewish Race&quot; (as the atheist Theodor Herzl called it) could be preserved.</p>

<p>At least for the time being... The threat of the dreaded ASSIMILATION still looms, especially among Jews in the USA... where nearly HALF of all the world&#39;s Jews presently abide... And this &quot;threat&quot; has NOT gone unnoticed... So it ain&#39;t over yet, it would seem.</p>

<p>How will it be dealt with THIS TIME??? We shall see.</p>

<p>And you were saying...</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Jews, Zionists, do you simple fux know the difference?&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yes. I, for one, most certainly do know the difference. And hopefully others have a better understanding as well.</p>

<p>Regarding the Holocaust, I recommend that you never make any serious attempt to investigate the details of that event from multiple perspectives. Because if you do, you may find some very disturbing information like this:</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interview with Jewish American named David Cole.
<a href="https://redice.tv/radio-3fourteen/the-truth-behind-the-gates-of-auschwitz">https://redice.tv/radio-3fourteen/the-truth-behind-the-gates-of-auschwitz</a>
In the 1990s, David Cole traveled to auschwitz looking at the evidence of homicidal gas chambers. He created a very interesting video about what he found called &quot;The Truth Behind the Gates of Auschwitz&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>If you listen to the interviews of Ryan Dawson, he knows the name of the man who fired the kill shot at RFK. But of course, they use a patsy, Sirhan Sirhan, who was drugged out of his mind at the time, to do the first couple of shots and take all the blame. Conveniently, the patsy was a Palestinian.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if RFK was anti-Israel, why did he support selling them the 50 Phantoms that Sirhan Sirhan was supposedly so upset about? Seems highly likely Sirhan was a patsy, so that&#39;s not actually why he died, but if he was selling Israel war planes, how much would they have hated him?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>RFK wanted to open a real investigation into his brother&#39;s murder. RFK has just won the California primary and was therefore well on his way to winning the presidency. But at the time he was killed, he had no secret service protection. If he won the presidency, he would have had the power to get a real investigation into his brother&#39;s murder. And considering what happened to his brother, as President, he would have been able to demand much tighter security than his brother had. So it was the perfect time to kill him.</p>

<p>What does &quot;SHA-2 identity&quot; mean/ signify? </p>

<p>What changes were made to the wiki page in the edit?</p>
