       As most of you know who browse real conspiracy forums instead of this drama subreddit, isn't it a weird how much time the mods spend on dramatizing this subreddit in order to make people forget about what actually is happening currently in the US?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously no grown up men would act like the mods here unless they are just pretending to be retarded in order to draw attention from important issues. It's also funny how this has become a right wing subreddit over the years and everything related to the current head of state will be removed

       Why do the mods have such a pro-Trump bias on a sub where they're supposed to represent non-partisanship? It seems like it's almost being forced down our throats. You have to ask yourself why would TPTB want to paint this community as alt-right Trump cheerleaders? Trump, IMO, was a false prophet that was supposed to "herd" us and crash us into a wall. Some people took the bait, others didn't, but the paid infiltrators online are reinforcing the whole thing and you can bet they've infiltrated or compromised the moderating positions on several online forums.

       Every time there's a "happening" this sub gets flooded with new users.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the vote count in
       <strong>
        any
       </strong>
       post made today and tell me this sub is pro-trump. Anything pro-trump gets mass downvoted. Anything pro-left gets mass upvoted. OP is full of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This country voted basically 50/50 for Trump/Hillary and that was
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       Trump has had all this success with the ecomony and jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you can't tell it by the votes on Reddit. Reddit wants you to believe most people are antitrump. It's simply not true.

       People here have different views and That’s a good thing. Conspiracy interested people have tended to lean right and it’s no different here.

       Mods are not impartial as they are mot here simply to mod. They are here because of their interest in conspiracies. The ones who had no tolerance for dissenting views have largely been removed.

       Leaning more towards, the government has grown too powerful and is the basis of most of the conspiracies.

       Based on leaning context only. Then the left tends to want a larger more powerful and controlling government. The right wants smaller and smaller, the smallest government possible.

       Plus if you were here in August, the posts were much different. This sub has been blitzed by new people &amp; tired theories for the past two weeks. I wish it wasn’t so obvious to those without an agenda. To those with an agenda, I’m glad they suck at cloaking themselves.

       So this post is just a fake excuse to complain about the mods allowing people to asses and be skeptical individual MSM talking points.

       I think it is pretty amazing that the two huge conspiracies currently playing out are nearly ignored by the conspiracy sub.

       right now, it looks like the Kavanaugh appointment is going to hold the Mueller investigation hostage,
      </p>
      <p>
       The White House hopes the threat of killing the Mueller investigation will gain approval of Kavanaugh, who may be guilty of perjury during two different  Senate inquires

       The Senate is meeting with Ford on Thursday, the same day Trump is meeting with Rosenstein.

       Way more anti-Trump "people" here based on the average vote counts, so your theory doesn't seem to check out.

       On the one hand, the moderators are humans too and entitled to their own opinions. I don't have a problem with moderators holding their own beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, it can become an issue if it seeps into their responsibility as a moderator. I agree that there are cases that can be pointed to that may be biased towards Trump. At the same time, I don't believe the sub is a "propaganda tool". I think you'd be very hard pressed to find someone who didn't have a favorable view of Trump "swayed" by the actions of the moderators on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       A very significant amount of people who use this sub use it as they see fit, some of which are Trump supporters, which is only fitting. Not everyone is going to be ardently anti-Trump. I think a healthy balance of pro and anti Trump is indicative of a healthy community.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't see anything "Anti-Trump" removed unless it's instigative. If it's blatantly just to start an emotional argument without basis in confirmed fact, or if it's an argument that's been hashed out a million times with no progress at all, I could see why those get removed. It's just spam at that point.

       I think that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has been hijacked by people trying to shift the narrative AWAY from the mushroom cloud of toxic scandals by the deep state and mainly democrats. So no, it feels like the opposite what you say.
