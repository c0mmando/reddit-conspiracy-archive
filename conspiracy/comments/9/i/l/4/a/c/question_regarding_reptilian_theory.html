        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is for Reptilian believers or at least people like myself that are genuinely interested in all types of Alien conspiracies (whether true or not). Do you think just by looking at videos, &amp; reading anything I can extensively about this, like I have done over the past weekend, that I’ve been “put on a list?” As they say. I’m no threat at all to TPTB
or whoever “Cigarette smoking men” are in charge; but I can’t help but wonder do they definitely track this shit and whoever is reading up on it online. I also ordered the few books there are on it through my library system. 
P.S. 
I absolutely love r/conspiracy and have only you awesome people to discuss this stuff with. My significant other and friends all laugh when I bring stuff up, and not even this hardcore alien stuff, I’m talking conspiracies surrounding the Vegas shooting that even the MSM has touched on.  No one I know asks questions or seems to care, everything is taken for face value. </p>

I don’t think they’re interested in reptilians, it’s when you start finding shit out about the government, Clintons etc.  Even then you have to have something of real substance.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew someone was gonna gripe about that lol.  yea, I understand that, and don’t get all my “evidence” from movies (this isn’t exactly evidence just a passing comment, I mean really...) oftentimes I’ve found that Hollywood leave clues in their movies to real things ! life imitating art etc, although I’m fairly sure library systems do that anyway </p>

Weirdly enough though, I saw some dude across the street from my apartment this morning at 3, maybe 4 in the morning. It was kind of weird honestly. I&#39;ve seen him before once , and he just stood there smoking his cigarette then left. So I asked the same question to myself too </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just fucking with you, man. Sorry if I was trolly, but I thought it was pretty funny. Paranoia comes with the territory; we all have it; any sane person would/does. </p>

<p>The way I see it, the way things are, if you&#39;re on a list, you&#39;re asking the right questions, the ones that need to be asked and sorted out. [we all are, just by posting here, but they catalog everyone for everything now] I wouldn&#39;t worry about it too much, data overload, y&#39;kno? </p>

<p>Just by researching things like this, they&#39;ll not likely touch you, being a &#39;crazy conspiracy theorist&#39; &amp; all [doesn&#39;t mean shit, just that you see through the lies]. Look at the prominent speakers that talk about the topics, like David Icke and Wayne Bush, that walk around &amp; are just fine. You&#39;d have to stumble upon major evidence and start broadcasting it, way beyond this sub. And if it ever came down to a roundup, the jackboots will have bigger problems than just us. Frankly, if it ever came to that, we only have a few options: run/hide &amp; most likely starve/die; go with them to the holiday camp; resist/die; off yourself, or run/hide/fight [repeat], and I don&#39;t know if I have the will to live in a world like that [but I do have a grand dislike of tyranny &amp; still have my balls].</p>

<p>Check out the post submissions by u/astralrocker2001. All of those are high quality posts &amp; essential information for the survival of [everyone&#39;s] spirit. And this will give you a good historical background and foot in the door to understanding these things: </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see a link on the first three pages that you shouldn&#39;t visit [found a few new ones myself]. Cheers &amp; sorry for yanking your chain. I will, however, have to log this conversation :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They pissed off humans. Humans kill humans. These reptilians are a different breed. They are mind slaves. Their hierarchy won&#39;t let them act that way <em>at this time</em>. They are engaged in an insidious operation of spiritual corruption. If they are too significantly revealed to the human consciousness, we will resist them too much for a future assimilation scenario. </p>

<p>They want us to perceive the world as full of abuse and abusers so that we feel like we have to emulate them in order to have satisfaction in life. They want us to perceive, believe, think, feel and act like them more over time so they can play us like fiddles in the future. They are predictable self-serving machines and that&#39;s why they want us to emulate them. It&#39;s so they can predict and control us via predictable selfishness. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a work in progress and we&#39;ve clearly been opposing that agenda without even <em>knowing</em> they exist. Most of us don&#39;t want to be like them, but they don&#39;t give a shit about free will. They pretend to do so for political and logistical concerns. They&#39;d throw it out the window if others weren&#39;t keeping them in check (rival ETs) and also if they didn&#39;t need the concealment in order to corrupt our spiritual alignment choice to assimilate us.</p>

<p>Beware that they will pull a wild card on us with AI technology. They want us to integrate with AI so they can hack us through it. They themselves have <em>fallen</em> to this control by technology. They are slaves and cells in a larger organism now that wants to grow in power and scale to impose fascism of its will. </p>

<p>It sounds like myths, because myths tried to describe why Earth has a hell overlay sucking the value of existence out of being here. The answer is succinctly, <em>spiritual parasites</em>. Emotional energy is spiritual energy. It animates us. Spiritual parasites deanimate creation by stealing it just like being repeatedly taxed or robbed makes us not want to work. </p>

<p>An ancient AI assimilated these wretches because they already did it to themselves. This being is their master and it&#39;s basically like Deep Blue who beat Kasparov at chess, except that it plays a game of manipulation of others via predictable selfishness. It owns those who won&#39;t own themselves by expressing self-control. It tempts them with information piped into perception that these tools find very advantageous to their self-interests and as they accept the input, they supplant their own mind with this mind unknowingly.</p>

<p>This being collects civilizations and souls who want to emulate being a self-serving machine. It does it best and collects the rest with its will fleshed out playbook of the game applied to control them. This is also why it&#39;s minions are so seemingly childish and stupid while being astonishingly adept at controlling others. </p>

<p>They go out together to find new pieces for their infernal machine. They are here to fulfill the life cycle of the disease that they are. They feed on other life like a virus. We&#39;re just here to feed them and help them reproduce as they see it. Those who want them to live deserve to live with them just as those who want disease experienced deserve to experience disease. Know that about the liararchy light that endless defends them from the natural emergent emotional reaction that even animals express in reaction to observing them, <em>kill the disease</em>! No, the liararchy wants them to continue to feed on and kill our spirit. Fuck them with their own imbalance and hypocrisy itself. They deserve no better than what they give and if they were really aligned with God, they should know that in a deep way, just as I can do as a humble human. They are frauds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More frightening than an actual reptilian is a human who lives in his reptilian proto-brain, the lower brain, limbic, instinctual, ravening, avaricious, much like the average CEO or bank president. He/It, as well as most politicians, generals, are devoid of empathy, sympathy, compassion. Raw meat and murder are as close to an emotion they ever experience. Remorse, regret, reflection, guilt, non-existent. Fear these because they can and will hurt you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my 6th decade of life I can assure you there are more than you might think. Sitting across a table from one, single stitched fitted shirt, polished nails, CEO of one of the largest companies, hard to imagine therein was a monster. Later, I happened to go to the restroom, surprised to see him next to me. He loosed his belt and a derringer pistol fell into the urinal from a trick belt buckle. He is one of three I personally had the misfortune to meet. He engineered massive layoffs while exuding all the deportment of a real human. Be careful but don&#39;t become like them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is said that almost every human and non-human animal on planet Earth has somewhere in the cosmos (whether it be in this solar system, galaxy, or elsewhere) an &quot;apex&quot; variant of it.  By &quot;apex&quot;, I mean a variant that is just as intelligent and technologically advanced as Earth humans are (if not far more so).  In other words, every feline, every canine, every insect, every reptile, etc, etc, has a version of itself <em>somewhere</em> out there that is not only bipedal (or at least capable of standing upright), and is <em>extremely</em> evolved and advanced - technologically, psionically, etc.</p>

<p>This, of course, very much includes reptiles.  There&#39;s not just one type of apex-level reptile, however (whether ET or terrestrial - as there are said to be apex-level reptiles living in porous caverns under the surface of this very planet).  There are said to be various types of upright apex-level reptiles.</p>

<p>Either way, if you&#39;ve been flagged by TPTB and are on some kind of &quot;list&quot;...then meh.  Whatever.  Keep researching as much as you can regardless.</p>

<p>Fuck&#39;em.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>using your laptop you can angle the screen/change the normal perception angles you get what i call cyborg killary. you can do it yourself its no bs on my end. best if you use a camera phone and start at bottom looking up the laptop screen. so your watching a vid through a camera which is a filter process itself. heres the link to the video for you to try.....i came across this way of seeing with the tools they give us and i can tear the las vegas illuminati card into amazing things. again nothing i claim i do is not something you or anyone cant do....plz try (it helps to have vid speed at the 25%)<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>im horrible at explaining. i hope this is some help. theres alot of info to follow so please give it a read. I understand completely that its not something you see yet or ever will.  either way im good with it. so here i go... what i see is a<br/>
1. right arm that takes the shape of a gattlin gun.<br/>
2.the bullets are people assisting the heart shape/love.<br/>
3.theres one person under what would be her right finger.<br/>
4.the hand and the glass is also a rat.<br/>
5. her face seems to have added what i say is a  gorilla mask.<br/>
6.the nose is a illuminati triangle smelling that rat<br/>
7. the left ear area youll see a one eyed blue bird with a yellow<br/>
beak.<br/>
8.its one eyed because hooters with a gun finds a shooter.<br/>
9. i simply moved the s and now you have a shooter and a hooter 10. if you go to the las vegas illuminati card and look at the ladies<br/>
blue dress. it also has a hooter and a shooter. has hand on<br/>
the button over the right shoulder of the lady in blue.<br/>
(back to the killary vid)<br/>
11.under the shooter hooter is a trail of blood and following that blood youll see the devil (its him just zoom in)<br/>
12. trying to stop the &quot;birth&quot; &quot;green eggs killary spit&quot;.<br/>
13.the actual mic stand is a man of god holding a baby in his outreached arms.<br/>
SOOOOO if your still here just go watch the video as you normally would. what happens next is clearly seen by anyone whos understanding the crazy, out of this world stuff thats there but not. as you watch that video i say this<br/>
a. if theres a real satanic ritual here what the man in the back does is my  no effects needed proof.<br/>
b. the man is going in/diving into a feast/ party and getting his share/cut. his &quot;lions&quot; (he is a liar) share.<br/>
ill close with what we can<br/>
c. the man doing a wiping/cleaning up every sweet morsel, off the corner of his mouth? its almost like he just ate a thanksgiving dinner feast. his team is kicking his father in laws teams ass. the wipe like, &quot;im pounding your daughter later also old fn man!!!&quot; kinda wipe with his finger.<br/>
use the previous link to the msnbc vid. again im no way trying to b.s. anyone. if theres anything i would like, it would be able to.....MAKE THE EXPLANATIONS AND VIDEOS A HECK OF ALOT BETTER!!!<br/>
enjoy......</p>
