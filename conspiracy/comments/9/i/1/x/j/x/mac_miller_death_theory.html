       I think he died when he could have been saved. He OD’d while he was with his friends. They freaked out and called their drug dealers before they called an ambulance. They tried to revive him themselves, unsuccessfully. Afterwards, they cleared the house of drugs to selfishly make sure that nothing could be tied back to them. Only then did one of his friends finally call 911. But it was too late. He was already gone. Now the 911 caller refuses to out themselves, because they know that his death will be tied back to them and whatever dirty drugs they gave him. Had they called an ambulance when he first OD’d, instead of covering their own asses, there is a great possibility that he would still be here right now.

       When you’re with your friends, you expect them to call 911 if you start dying in front of them. Most friends wouldn’t sit there like, “Oh well, he did it to himself, better just wait for the death to settle in.”

       Most good friends wouldn’t let him take an amount that could kill him either. You’re trying to rationalize the actions of people who were likely high themselves, which is impossible to do

        They weren’t too high to call someone to wipe the house clean before they finally called 911, or just left until someone else found him. Most likely the latter.

         I think that’s why they wiped the house first. They didn’t want to call an ambulance and also have to explain the drugs/ I’m curious to know how long this takes. Unless the whole house was covered in paraphernalia I feel like they could have cleaned up and sent somebody away with it by the time the EMT got there.

         If so, why does only Miller go down? Unless he did it first and the rest were waiting their turn. That almost makes it more conspiratorial.

       They were cleaning up because they still didn’t want it tied back to them. It’s still illegal drug use and they didn’t want to go to jail or catch any minor charges. Making it that more fucked up that they didn’t just call 911 first.

       The whole apartment was wiped clean. No weed, pill bottles, bongs? All of it completely cleared out. Except for a small trace of white powder. In the whole house. It was Mac Miller, he there was not a single piece of paraphernalia in his entire house. Especially after an overdose when people were at his house since Thursday and he wasn’t found until Friday? Hmmm

       Honestly? I don’t know. We can only be sure once the autopsy cause-of-death is released. In my opinion, I think he did more drugs than he was used to after his attempt at sobriety, he overdosed, and people who had the ability to save him with a single phone call chose not to.

       People freak out when people die, I think this is plausible. I mean it's like when that other guy (Lil Peep I think?) died and his friend made some video thinking he was asleep and making fun of him for being lazy, but the guy was dead. I think if you're gonna take 6 Xanax for fun you should have a dedicated "Make sure I'm alive regardless of what I'm doing" person.

       I don't disagree with you, I think we all like to believe someone there would have the decency, but at the same time, humans have shown time and time again that there is an ability within some that allows them to completely disregard that feeling. Those kids who let that guy drown in the lake while they watched and filmed come to mind. I don't think this is necessarily an issue of indecent people as much as idiocy and fear, I can't look in to their minds but I imagine someone there is having guilty conscience issues, especially if he was surrounded by friends.

       Again how is that a conspiracy? Who wouldn’t freak out and do something like that if there was a dead/dying celebrity in your care?

       No I’m saying those are the actual conspiracies we should be focusing on. Fuck it, aliens, Bigfoot, podesta, soros, big pharma, Monsanto, doesn’t matter, just not this reach in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       People did the same shit when xxx died. That’s what people do. They fucking die. Not everything is a conspiracy, because then nothing is a conspiracy. People die. It sucks but it doesn’t mean there’s some “deviant plot” it means we’re super fragile creatures with overlords enslaving and poisoning us. The real conspiracy here is how Big Pharma’s saturated the country so much with pills that the celebrities are starting to die off.

       It happens ALL THE TIME.  There are literally billboards here in Northern Maryland that say "Someone you're with overdosed?  DON'T RUN, CALL 911".
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I've lost 3 friends to heroin and the story is the same EVERY TIME.  They were found alone, twice by a parent, and once in the passenger seat of their own car, in a hospital parking lot. In all 3 cases, it was confirmed they weren't alone when they died.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what it's like to be high on anything like heroin, but it seems like the first reaction is "oh shit, let's get out of here cause I don't want to go to jail".

       When you’re with your friends, you expect them to call 911 if you start dying in front of them. Most friends wouldn’t sit there like, “Oh well, he did it to himself, better just wait for the death to settle in.”
