       Now, I hate to bring politics into r/conspiracy and further widen the divide the elites worked so hard to keep wedged between us but this cannot be ignored any longer. We have seen the blatant brigading that has occurred over the past 3-4 days surrounding the "divesttrump debacle" in this subreddit. That same post being posted 5 times every hour almost; so why the push now?
      </p>
      <p>
       The banning of r/greatawakening has emboldened the fact that any community with majority dissent to the MSM and left-wing narrative on this website will be caricatured and assassinated if it gains any traction. There are whole subs dedicated to being the literal thought police of reddit (TMOR, FTAR). The whole idea of these subs is to identify, caricature and ultimately put pressure on reddit to ban certain communities they do not like. That in itself is breaking the rules of Reddit itself and would make the founder of this website ashamed at the current state of the Reddit community. They turn blind eyes to billionaire funded media operations like Shareblue, CTR, Moveon
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9hsdj6/rosenstein_suggested_he_secretly_record_trump_and/e6e44fq/">
        Example
       </a>
       and SPLC
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9gnado/splc_pushing_to_get_t_d_banned_from_reddit/">
        SPLC Breakdown
       </a>
       backed groups completely astroturfing major political subreddits and encouraging the bullying and identification of other communities that do not align with their agenda. They create a Russia boogeyman story to justify the eventual banning of their targets when in reality what was "uncovered" was just a few tiny websites originating in Russia getting upvoted a few times but that apparently means every mod on that subreddit is on Putin's payroll and the users of the sub are russian bots upvoting russian propaganda. It is a complete detachment from reality and a gross exaggeration of the truth. Do they really assume that everytime a trump supporter on r/t_d upvotes a positive article about trump on a small website from russia it means they are colluding with Russia actively? It is ridiculous and peanuts compared to what is really happening to reddit in terms of what they are accusing them of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their stated goals is to ban r/t_d and all subs associated, they are trying to target this sub as demonstrated by the ongoing brigades and attacks on the moderators of this subreddit. All conveniently timed before the midterms and as the SPLC has gotten into the action.

       Because every conservative goes there since they get harassed, downvoted, and banned from everywhere else. If they weren't echo-chambers they'd be paved over by shills and become yet another left wing sub.

       They definitely have the right to have a community on reddit which many leftwing subs are openly trying to take away and are openly calling for a ban on a community with 600k+ subscribers and millions of visitors daily. They are engaging in very unethical practices like brigading, intimidation and doxxing daily. Can you imagine the uproar if t_d took part in this type of activity that these leftwing subs are? They would be banned instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont know why these other subs feel so threated by a right wing community on reddit so much that they need to engage in these types of activities to attempt to ban t_d

       , as one note as it is, won't ban you for dissenting views. I know because I spent a lot of time posting controversial perspectives there in 2016 and never so much as got a warning from the mods.

       I highly doubt you were banned for saying that. Like 99% of the time someone says they were banned for something innocuous while pretending like they didn't break dozens of rules (which was the real reason for the banning).

        /r/t_d

       for disagreeing with Trump policies. Then I got banned from r/TwoXChromosome (a sub I've never commented in) for making comments in
       <a href="/r/t_d">
        /r/t_d

       Nice projection. R/conservative had a mod post a few weeks ago about how their sub is not for debate. It's for conservatives only and they ban you for dissent. T_D has been that way since the beginning. If their ideas are objectively right, why do they need to hide from opposing ideas?

       and here is a perfect example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Objecting to illegal immigration doesn't make you a racist.  Uncontrolled immigration with the introduction of a mass influx of low skilled immigrants can have harmful effects including depressed wages, increased crime, and higher utilization of social services (requiring higher taxes).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recognizing that unbalanced "free trade" agreements and currency manipulation resulting in dumping can have economic consequences. That doesn't make you a dictator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recognizing that some religions might have more violence associated with it from others, doesn't make you a bigot either.
      </p>
      <p>
       France, Sweden, Germany and many European nations are experiencing the negative consequences of uncontrolled immigration.  If you think these type issues are exclusively a US problem you're completely mistaken.

       Activist groups have paid for bail for years. That is a long ways from soros paying people to simply protest.

       No see in his head the left is the worst and Trump is the opposite of the left so therefore Trump can do no wrong. So long as everyone outside his special interest group is suspicious and angry everything is going great. Don't you love Trump and his supporters now? Remember to be civil!

       Liberals have humanity and that pisses you off, got it. Being accepting of everyone is antiwhite since they're against the right oppressing minorities. Social degeneracy? Is that code for 'i hate the gays?

      <p>
       Do you think it is American to hate fellow Americans, turn a blind eye to human suffering, and to rail against those that show compassion for all humans? You've got it twisted. The resistance to compassion is what is destroying America and the ones doing that are in your mirror. Want to save America? Love your fellow man.

       You really don't know how the Democrat Party and their supporting NGO astroturf front groups (SPLC, ShareBlue, CTR, Soros Open Society Foundation, etc) operate do you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Soros funnels millions of dollars into various shell companies and NGO around the world to fund his color revolutions (political disruption, funding agitators).
      </p>
      <p>
       David Brock is one of the conduits and runs several NGO  (ShareBlue, MediaMatters) involved in a variety of activities including online astroturf targeted an large social media plaforms including Reddit. CTR put millions into astroturf during the 2016 election.  Post election his org ShareBlue seems to be handling it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is SPLC which also receives private funding from Soros.

       Tbh i want td banned. Not because i support censorehip

       But there mod team has run it into the ground. They control the narrative too hard. Certain keywords are banned. For a long time any post containing "facebook" was auto filtered
      </p>
      <p>
       Also reddit has banned them from the front page. They essentially act as a wquarantine

       A very uncomfortable truth about the world right now is sometimes Russian interests align with the interests of the Democratic or Republican parties of the US.  Maybe an RT article is critical of Trump, maybe another one is sided with Trump - either way it is likely to side with what the Russian state wants, but this doesn't necessarily mean the information in wrong, that the idea is bad or the USA, or part of some larger conspiracy.

       r/greatawakening had a god damn list of leftists they had identified as enemies of the state. You are being completely disingenuous when you pretend this is about free speech. You know damn well you were spreading dangerous lies that were going to get people hurt.

       Oh please. And radical lefttist subreddits dont paint Trump and republicans as enemies of the state? I can picknout thousands of examples of unhunged leftitst on reddit calling for the death of Trump and making lists of republicans that support Trump, and it happens everyday. This type of radical caricaturing can lead to violence and radical actions like the Scalise shooting of a Republican baseball practice and riots like Antifa do all the time emboldened by that type of rhetoric.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the "its only ok when leftists make lists and engage in radical dialogue everyday" doesnt work. You either ban greatawakening and fuckthealtright or you ban neither. Just banning one is hypocritical if you use the "violent speech" argument.

       Liberals have humanity and that pisses you off, got it. Being accepting of everyone is antiwhite since they're against the right oppressing minorities. Social degeneracy? Is that code for 'i hate the gays?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it is American to hate fellow Americans, turn a blind eye to human suffering, and to rail against those that show compassion for all humans? You've got it twisted. The resistance to compassion is what is destroying America and the ones doing that are in your mirror. Want to save America? Love your fellow man.
