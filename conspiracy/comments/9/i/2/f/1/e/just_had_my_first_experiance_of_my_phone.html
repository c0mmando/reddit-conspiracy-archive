    <div class="md"><p>They make a good point, it&#39;s common for upcoming/returning shows to advertise so heavily in the weeks leading up to it. </p>

<p>However, it&#39;s not to dispute that anything with a mic listens, because they do. If you want to do some experimenting with this then pick a subject of something so random that if there are ads promoted for it you can reasonably see it was the mic listening in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Managing your permissions will do NOTHING! Both Android and iOS listen at the system level.</p>

<p>Nothing on my phone is permitted to use my microphone (expect the phone itself). With no apps opened, my wife picked up my phone and said, “I really need a new huge dildo, I want a big dildo!” She walked away laughing.  Two days later, amazing is trying to sell me dildos.</p>

<p>My co-worker and I were talking about chainfalls to lift heavy grain bags during beer brewing. No phones were around BECAUSE WE WERE IN A SECURE GOVERNMENT ROOM WHERE PHONES ARE NOT ALLOWED! Next day? Chainfall ads on Facebook and Amazon - because I was logged into Amazon and the computer was listening. </p>

<p>In the middle of a 200 acre farm discussing getting a stump pusher for our tractor. Phones were in our pockets. 45 minutes later at the house, I got ads for stump pushers for tractors.</p>

<p>Welcome to 1984 dude (or dudette).</p>
