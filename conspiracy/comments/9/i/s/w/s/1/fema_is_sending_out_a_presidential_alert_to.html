       The purge movies also seem to allude to this. I could be putting pieces together that aren’t there but I have a weird feeling about this. Something is going to happen if not for this, you can feel it in the air.

       Believe it or not this is one of the ways I think an awakening or big movement can happen. Figure out a way to send an Amber alert everyone’s phone but have it contain some huge amount of information that nobody can really deny or dispute.

       Part of me wants to believe you because that is what I wish for. However, another part of me thinks the people that currently rule this land are dying out, and instead of letting us transition into a better age peacefully, they are going to cause as much chaos and division as possible.

       They very well could just let it all go to hell. We just need to be smarter than them and realize not to pull the trigger just because they tell us to. Evil obviously attracts evil, maybe the evil is starting to realize that nobody wants to join their side anymore therefore their numbers are dwindling like you said. They’re probably going to ruin things on purpose as a last chance power grab to try to keep this shit going but pass it down to like minds like them. But Because no one wants to adapt to their shitty behavior and lifestyle they’re going to be snuffed out. Even some of these rich oligarchs kids don’t want to carry-on their mission. Ever seen the Johnson and johnson documentary? Even the owner of that companys son (jaime) doesn’t want to carry-on with the level of greed/control that his family has been building.

       Good point. It def is a very demonic system we are in. It completely ignores the most humane things about us for the sake of a green piece of paper, one that has no value outside of the value we give it.

       I am at work and my thoughts will be scattered considering but please try to look past that. I am not into the Bible but I think there is truth behind it. There is something extremely important about the numbers 9 and 10. I believe we are about to experience the earths “9” phase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anton LaVey, church of Satan founder, said that he devils number is 9. Because it’s the number that always comes back to itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, 9x3 = 27.    2+7=9. or 9x9= 81.   8+1=9.
666 = 6+6+6= 18. 1+8=9. (Sacred Geometry)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you notice Windows went from windows 8 to 10. iPhone went from iPhone 8 to iPhone 10(X). They skip the number 9. What are they alluding to? What is it they want to avoid so desperately? Why do they want to skip whatever 9 represents so badly? In the Bible the number 10 represents the completed course of time or the completed course in divine order.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are slowly coming into the age of 9 so to speak. Politicians are slowly being exposed for being pedophiles. People are seeing strange phenomena in the skies. There are record shattering natural disasters happening back to back. The Federal Emergency Management(FEMA) is preparing to setup a nationwide alert system should anything crazy happen. The elite are building doomsday bunkers and telling people about it. Almost like they don’t care if we know at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can clearly see they have stopped investing in America so to speak. Homelessness is rampant. Music sucks. Movies suck. Good singers and actors have disappeared. Apocalyptic movies have become the norm. The list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have the X-Men. In 1991 Robert Harrington discovered a planet called Planet X and he surprisingly died 6 months later. Then in 1992 they released a new X-Men series.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go to this website and look at the X-Men timeline
       <a href="http://xmenmovies.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline">
        http://xmenmovies.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What’s crazy is if you google the events that happen in X-Men they actually happened in real life. Down to the date. Then they come out with a show called “the gifted” that has nothing to do with X-men yet the X-men are a part of the series. However, apparently they don’t appear because they have “disappeared to go on space missions.”
      </p>
      <p>
       My girlfriend saw what looked like a planet a few days ago and told me to go outside to look at it. A few moments later it disappeared. The chem trails somehow hide it most of the time. However, the changes it’s making to the world are quite obvious. It should be 70 degrees where I live but it’s 90. There was weird black smoke covering the skies today. The earth is heating up at an alarming rate and the government knows it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In summary, there is something significant about everything that is going on right now. I haven’t put the pieces together yet. I know this is poorly put together and you most likely think I’m insane but I’m telling you there are humans here that have dormant X genes and that planet is somehow associated with it. Human evolution is coming into a new phase. In order for it to happen the world as we know it must “die” so to speak. There is a reason there is so many magic based/superhero movies coming out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s also a reason why in the new venom trailer the doctor says “humans are on the brink of extinction, this (venom symbiote) is the next step in human evolution.”

       EDM now is better than music ever before, I know there's a growing disdain for edm for some reason, but big labels can't sell it and it's all self-propelled.. so ofcourse the media wants you to think that music sucks, while indy artists are using bare bones tools and no producer to make the best tunes yet

       i think they may be talking about the actual types of hrtz being used, and at what resonance. or the general feel of the mainstream music nowadays. maybe i didnt notice it when i was younger, maybe it has been there all along.. but it feels.. empty, or worse, narcissistic and petty.

       Ok, take your favorite era of popular music, and then find someone 20 years older than you and ask how they felt about that time frame in music. Chances are, they think it's not very good. Why is this? Lol. Is music getting worse or are we just getting old and bitter?..

       idk.. i personally like trap music and couldnt stand the bands of my generation. i've always been into all kinds of music, favoring tom waits over adele, or shogo takumaru over kurt cobain. i dont think i am getting older and bitter in my tastes, i'm all over modern music... just not the shit they play on repeat for everyone, at every chance they can.

       If you have even a base knowledge of an underground or non-mainstream genre, like trap, mainstream music is already not going to be as potent of a listening experience

       Sorry but this appears to be you just pointing out 0 isn't a number in base10.  Learn base12, base8, or binary and you can do the same thing with the largest denominator.

       It's because we're living in a time of dizzying technological, social, economic, and political change. A lot of those changes have been good, but almost all have had side effects that hurt a lot of people. And of course, the people who benefited from the old way of things are terrified of losing their power.

       I believe you. Could you write it dripping with honey instead of vinegar, despite how dark and terrible the topic is? I find relating to people best works with a side of sweet. It's a true challenge to bring the sweet when the meat is sour.

       It’s quite obvious at this point. What’s really weird is, there are multiple movies/shows that hint as being robots. The common theme is.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         They think they are humans
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some big event happens
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They realize they were robots the entire time
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They eventually learn the truth and realize they have had their memories wiped and/or consistently have their memories wiped.
        </p>

       West world touched on this. Dark city touches on this. The new Netflix movie EXTINCTION touches on this.

      <p>
       AND ONE I RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE IS the Electric dreams episode “Autofac”.

       Yes, transhumanism, I’ve definitely read about it on this sub before.  I reckon they’re really trying to ingrain this stuff in our head, once it happens it’ll be so normalised to us people won’t think twice, or actually accept it as being good!!! Mental

       Yes I know it dates back to the 60s. I would then ask you why they decided to remake 50+ years later. I don’t think they are coming up with these ideas out of pure entertainment and imagination but I respect your perspective enough to not push mine on you.

       Its very naive to focus on movie tropes than real life, hard evidence. These things you see in movies are fantasy. You are putting store in fantasy. Its very sad that there are adults in this world who think this way.

       Do you consider yourself managed or controlled by tornado sirens or fire alarms?  It's another piece to the emergency alert system, just like what already blares out regularly from the radio, TV, and sirens.  But it's 2018 and it's increasingly common for households to have multiple cell phones but no TVS or radios.  I really don't understand the suspicion over this test or the alert system.

       Tornado sirens and fire alarms are exclusive to the areas that they are happening in. They can’t be used as examples in this scenario. They are going to use that system to manipulate gullible people and instill fear in them. Mark my words.

       Does one find it strange that a guy who wrote probably 70 horror and suspense novels about all kinds of shit wrote one about cellphones being scary? No.

       It's a convenient tool of fiction, repurposing everyday banalities into nightmare realities. Before Television people called it, "using your imagination."

       I’m not shunning reason. I am simply choosing to believe something. Life isn’t any fun if your constantly logic. I don’t care if I’m wrong. Bare minimum at least I get to talk with like minded individuals.

       idk.. i personally like trap music and couldnt stand the bands of my generation. i've always been into all kinds of music, favoring tom waits over adele, or shogo takumaru over kurt cobain. i dont think i am getting older and bitter in my tastes, i'm all over modern music... just not the shit they play on repeat for everyone, at every chance they can.
