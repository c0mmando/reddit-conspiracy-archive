       We've all heard the story.  Feinstein has had a driver for 20+ years and that driver was recently outed as a Chinese spy.  This got me, and many other conspiratorial minds, thinking about how deep the rabbit hole goes on this one?
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard on the Radio about Diane Feinstein's husband's ties to China, and how they were enriching themselves on Chinese trade.  I had no idea it had been reported on as far back as 1997 - coincidentally, 21 years before the 20+ year driver was outed as a Chinese spy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some articles with excerpts and some contain my thoughts on the matter.  All lines quoted from the article are in quote format here on reddit.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        WASHINGTON — On Capitol Hill, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has emerged as one of the staunchest proponents of closer U.S. relations with China, fighting for permanent most-favored-nation trading status for Beijing.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the same time, far from the spotlight, Feinstein's husband, Richard C. Blum, has expanded his private business interests in China--to the point that his firm is now a prominent investor inside the communist nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        For years, Feinstein and Blum have insisted that they maintained a solid "firewall" between her role as an influential foreign policy player and his career as a private investor overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        But such closely coinciding interests are highly unusual for major figures in public life in Washington. And now, as controversy heats up over improper foreign influence in the U.S. political process, the effectiveness of the firewall between those interests could be called into question.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1992, when Feinstein entered the Senate, Blum's interests in China amounted to one project worth less than $500,000, according to her financial disclosure reports. But since then, his financial activities in the country have increased.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the last year, a Blum investment firm paid $23 million for a stake in a Chinese government-owned steel enterprise and acquired sizable interests in the leading producers of soybean milk and candy in China. Blum's firm, Newbridge Capital Ltd., received an important boost from a $10-million investment by the International Finance Corp., an arm of the World Bank. Experts said that IFC backing typically confers legitimacy and can help attract other investors.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The firm is Newbridge Capital, a joint venture between Richard C. Blum &amp; Associates and another firm called Texas Pacific Group. It maintains an office in Shanghai for an affiliate called Newbridge Asia, public records show.
       </p>
       <p>
        And in the past two years, the firm has pumped more than $400 million in U.S. venture capital into East Asian businesses in hopes of profiting from the region's rebounding economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        At least $90 million of that - perhaps more - was invested in companies whose profits are pegged to the burgeoning mainland China market, according to the companies themselves.

        Feinstein has advocated closer relations and expanded trade with China. But her career has been
       </p>
       <p>
        dogged by allegations that her husband has sought to trade on his wife's official position to enhance his prospects as an international investment banker.
       </p>
       <p>
        Feinstein has adamantly denied a conflict of interest, saying she had erected a "firewall" between her office and her husband's career. In 1997, Blum said he was donating profits from his China investments to charity to further defuse conflict concerns.
       </p>
       <p>

        , Feinstein's Republican opponent in the November election, sought to make Blum's China investments an issue, Feinstein responded through a spokesman by saying that Blum no longer had investments in China.

       And more recently, The Federalist provided this write up, which combines the sources I've mentioned, with many others, for a very detailed, in depth, and seemingly accurate history of Feinstein/Blum and China, and how deep the ties actually go:

      </p>
      <p>
       So, not only do we have a politician enriching herself/her family over the course of 30+ years, we have a politician, in any capacity, in power for 30+ years.  This is one of the biggest problems in the USGOV - We need Term Limits now.  And we need to cut out these slime bag dealings with foreign nations - where scummy politicians end up making a ton of money off of the backs of the US Taxpayers.
      </p>
      <p>
       BONUS: Feinstein's Net Worth is $80M today.  Why?  What has she produced to be worth that much money?  Pelosi is worth $120M. Why?  What product or service has she EVER produced?  I will be doing a write up on Pelosi next.

       "The last time Congress passed joint resolutions saying that a "state of war" existed was on June 5, 1942, when the U.S. declared war on Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. Since then, the US has used the term "authorization to use military force", as in the case against Iraq in 2003."

       True, but that still allows for military tribunals for those tried for treason.

       For years, I've wanted to create an mobile app where you put in your zipcode and it shows you all of the non-incumbent politicians in your area on the ballot. Ignoring all positions, party affiliation, etc, the one aspect that matters is...only vote for all non-incumbents. I call it, the "Term Limit" party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it would hurt voting for some shitbags but a couple voting cycles of this and Congress would start listening to it's constituents out of fear.

       China is a major player in their own right. No, the Chinese menace was not "created by Wall Street." China is doing this all on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, China literally owns the DNC, and they are starting to take over the DNC's propaganda wing in Hollywood. They literally own a majority of DNC politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why they used literal commie chinese tactics at the 2016 Democratic national convention to silence protests and boos.

       Do the Chinese have anything to do with the GOP, or do they just influence the currently less influential party in US politics?
      </p>
      <p>
       The zeitgeist on this board is that the two parties are the same, except of course those who come over from t_d.
      </p>

       Are you blinded by partisanship, or do you honestly believe that the Chinese only influence Democrats?

       The DNC are not "the less influential party"
      </p>
      <p>
       China owns some GOP politicians sure, the Republicans in Name Only like Paul Ryan for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC are not "the less influential party" and you are deeply confused if you think they are. The DNC owns the mainstream media AND Hollywood. They are in power in this country, make no mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dems vs Repubs is largely a false dichotomy and there is one uniparty, but a majority of the DNC side is owned by China.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama for example was DNC but he was owned by Citibank and the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudis, who funded and sponsored his education and groomed him during his rise to POTUS.

       How on earth would I know? I'm not a Republican and never have been one. I know they are the party that fought against slavery and the KKK, so there's that atleast. Dems seem to stand for big government and racism, Repubs seem to stand for individual rights and state rights in theory-though in practice they are working for the same thing the Dems are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, uniparty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sides are designed to eternally be in conflict and congressmen and senators from both sides are blackmailed and controlled to ensure nothing ever gets done that will benefit the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a convenient scapegoat to keep everyone divided.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Dems would have passed that bill if it wasn't for the greedy racist Repubs!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Repubs almost passed that law if it wasn't for the racist, lazy Dems!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide and conquer. It's a basic strategy that always works.

       It appears no one in government actually works for the people. Between corporations, china, and Israel find me a politician that isn't working for them.

       sure.... they're boogyemen.....

       They're not "drivers" for an "elected official" whose been in office over 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not enticing our companies to come to China (Apple) for a 0% tax rate - so long as the company fully cooperates with the Chinese Communist Party government.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not committing industrial espionage - nor have they been, for the past 40+ years.

       They're not shutting down trade routes through the South China Sea. They're not building "man made islands" out there to expand their claim into international waters.

      <p>
       Yeah.  You're right.  China is nothing to worry about.  Carry on.

        Macedonian Boogeymen.

       And we cant forget about the ever present Iranian Boogeymen. Now, it is Chinese Boogeymen?

       yep, lends further credence to my "replace gloablists" with " " israelis" " (insert your word of choice there - read between the lines, im trying to not get banned) in all of Alex Jones' theories, and we've got the REAL conspiracy.

       Yes.  Soros is a jew, who was also a WW2 nazi collaborator.  That has been proven time and again, and admitted by Soros on 60 minutes, but now denied 20 years later.
