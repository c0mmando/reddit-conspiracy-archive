<p>YouTube has nothing to do with the actual process of voter registration. Clicking that link simply sends you to a google page with more information about <em>how</em> to register. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s their job to be doing this.</p>

<p>It should be every individual citizen&#39;s job that cares about the future of this country. But Americans are notoriously ignorant and apathetic - so sorry if I don&#39;t see the negative in making sure the information is out there.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t like that in theory I might have to see this message for the next 2 months.</p>

<p>I think the two party winner takes all system is a cause of our problems and not a symptom.</p>

<p>Maybe it is, maybe it is not - but, for now, it&#39;s our only option. I, for one, will be voting, and I hope you will be too.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to disagree here. Spamming messages about voting gets that idea into people&#39;s brains and influences the chances of them voting.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We have no say.</p>

<p>Our 2 party winner take all system ensures that no 3rd party challenges and therefore no real change can ever be made. This forces people to play ball with one of the two parties or get nothing done by fighting both.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also some other factors at play that keep the status quo:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You have to have money to run. </p></li>
<li><p>The media controls whether your message ever gets heard or not and then controls what gets heard if you slip through.</p></li>
<li><p>America is too big. </p></li>
<li><p>A 3rd party is doomed to get slotted as an offshoot of one of the other two and therefore will end up splitting the vote. The Green party is seen as an offshoot of the D&#39;s. The Libertarians is seen as an offshoot of the R&#39;s</p></li>

<p>There&#39;s no good answer, but there are answers.</p>

<p>You can change the system, but you&#39;ll get shut down before you make any real progress. However, if that&#39;s done incorrectly, you can maybe then get in a position where you can make progress.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t do anything and you are guaranteed to lose.</p>

<p>Imagine if you had the ability to communicate with an overwhelming majority of the country. Nothing is &quot;your job,&quot; but you may see promoting certain causes as something that you <em>should</em> do.  </p>

<p>And you&#39;re right. I&#39;m sure that at least to some degree, they&#39;re hoping for left-leaning voters to spot the notice. Effectively though, it&#39;s not inherently a bad thing.  </p>

<p>Now if they were only promoting this towards users who exclusively watch left-leaning content while hiding it for those who view right-leaning content, then that would be good reason to question their intentions. </p>

<p>Since it seems like anyone visiting the website will see it, I don&#39;t see a reason to suspect anything. They&#39;re a big site and voting-season is coming up. It&#39;s a pretty usual thing for large platforms to promote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>National, from a “how to entice voters” standpoint. Tax cuts are the epitome of the candyman analogy. “You want some extra cash in your pocket? Vote for us! You’ll get a tax cut! Don’t worry about how much it’s goin to be or where the money to make up the budget deficit will come from or who else is the actual audience this policy is designed for, you can get a new tv! Or even a new <sup>to</sup> <sup>you</sup> car <sup>payment</sup> !”</p>

<p>And the rich people know that they can “convince” the politicians to hook them up with a big break, and the poor people think they are the intended beneficiaries (lol) so there’s a lot of support for the candymen all around. Then it turns out the amount the poor people receive is negligible compared to the huge amounts saved by the ultra wealthy, and the plan limits the write off for your state and local taxes so if you are poor in a state with high state taxes instead of a new tv you get to take your family out to eat at olive garden once! Yay! Unlimited breadsticks!!</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But you can get elected into public office</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not easily.</p>

<p>This gets harder the bigger your place is. You might only need a few hundred votes in rural Montana to get in, but you are going to have to get tens of thousands in a place like NY, if not more. But the guy in rural Montana doesn&#39;t have a lot of say on a national scale, does he?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>where I live takes the bus and makes hardly any money, yet he is in a position of power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s always going to be people who beat the system, but they aren&#39;t the norm.</p>

<p>I know someone who went from a no one to someone with some power in my district, but he had advantages. He coached a little league team when it meant more. You might think this is nothing, but it ensured a good 500 people or so knew he was. He then joined a citizens council and did various do-gooder things, which got him some free air-play in the media and then was able to become a local magistrate. </p>

<p>Now someone like me is a different story. If the general population in my city knew what I was about, my house would probably be burnt down and I&#39;d suffer other consequences as well.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The left leans more towards collectivism while people like myself lean more towards the individual.</p>

<p>The things I would push for that would be best to the community would never be accepted by the masses nor the media and even if I got into the position where I could win, I would lose or end up losing the long game through blacklisting/harassment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The media has the loudest say over who is good and who is bad and the media is left leaning.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Would you take money making tips from a poor person or a rich person? The poor person can probably say more things you can identify with, but the rich person is more likely to give you the better advice. On a mass scale, the poor person wins every time.</p>

<p>Is literally the key purpose of democracy. Voting is to pick a candidate. So the populace picks a candidate they want. And of they don&#39;t want some racist Nazi then he won&#39;t win. You&#39;re honestly one of the bigger whiney bitches I&#39;ve seen on here. Did you fail civics class or something?

<p>You got a problem with poor people? Yeah politicians lie to the poor, but is that really your argument? ALL Republicans politicians lie to the poor and most Democrat politicans. &quot;It will trickle down&quot; BULLSHIT. The middle class has shrunk thanks to these NWO bastards.</p>

<p>Do you just want low taxes for corporations and sociopath CEOs to indulge like degenerates while the poor suffer under-funded social programs suffering cronyist profiteering inefficient waste?? The SJW idiots are half right. Fascism is the main enemy but it&#39;s not Hitler. It&#39;s Mussolini style gov/crony corporation union against the people.</p>

<p>Stop being a bootlicker. The elites are bastards, stop kissing their asses. And no Obama/Clinton are NOT &quot;left wing&quot; like the CORPORATE media falsely claims. Bernie and FDR yes but not wallstreet Killary and Obama. I have hope either the Dem party will be fixed from the inside (because the Repub party is too far gone and not even showing any change at all....Trump 3D chess my ass) or the people rise up and demand corporate money out of politics. If we do that, at least corporations can&#39;t buy out the politicians.</p>

<p>And just to be clear, I&#39;m not against ethical small/medium businesses and millionaires but tax dodging big corporations that take tax money, pay low worker wages and move jobs to poor countries for sweatshop exploitation. Time to stop rewarding sociopaths.</p>
