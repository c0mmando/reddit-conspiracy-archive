<p>Other thing that comes to mind is the overwhelming consensus that he deserved to be banned/censored because of people getting harassed or threatened because of stuff he said. They&#39;re turning it into a safety issue. &quot;You can&#39;t say these kind of things, because someone will get hurt.&quot; Removing freedoms for safety, they love that card.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;re using him to &quot;make an example&quot; of him.</p>

<p>Not a huge fan of Alex Jones myself. I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to say he&#39;s a plant or anything, but I feel like he took conspiracies and found ways to sensationalize them to make a living. Alex Jones has made himself a household name and I think it falls more in line with &quot;if you do what he does there will be repercussions&quot; rather than him being on the brink of something world changing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t Jones&#39; conspiracy theories (per say) it was the &#39;damage&#39; he caused by propagating unverified information (often knowingly spreading factually incorrectly information.)</p>

<p>For example, he published someone&#39;s named and cited that they were the gunman behind a mass school shooting, but the guy wasn&#39;t the shooter.  The guy received death threats and was harassed for no reason other than Alex Jones&#39; irresponsibility and neglect.  You can&#39;t go doing that (without proof.)</p>

<p>In that context, Alex Jones has a history of putting people in jeopardy and/or inciting violence against them after making stuff up for his show.</p>

<p>It is not that Alex Jones is censured.  Alex can still do his show.  What has changed in that popular mainstream platforms now recognize that the liability his show brings them isn&#39;t worth the traffic.</p>

<p>Families of school shooting victims got tired of hearing Alex Jones insist the various shootings didn&#39;t happen, and started to put legal and public pressure in place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, if a company gives Alex Jones a venue where he makes false claims that Johnny Innocent is a murderer and that slander/libel instigates Billy Moron to extract vigilante justice, then the company giving Jones a platform is involved in that.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Mr. Fontaine claimed defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge upheld Mr. Fontaine’s defamation claim, but denied his emotional distress one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The judge also ruled that Mr. Fontaine could sue Mr. Jones’s business and the Infowars employee who wrongly identified him as the gunman, but that he could not sue Mr. Jones personally.</p>

<p>So you’re citing an instance where one of Jones reporters wrongfully identified the shooter.   The name of the alleged shooter likely showed up on hundreds of websites before they reported on it. </p>

<p>[Twitter was original source]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reports about a second shooter at a high school in Parkland, Florida, this week started with a tweet from an account falsely purporting to be former Fox News host Bill O&#39;Reilly. The account was later suspended and police say that suspect acted alone in the massacre that killed 17 people. Also, Florida elections officials refuted a report that the teen charged in the shooting was a Democrat, saying that he was not a registered voter. And some social media posts this week wrongly identified the teen charged as a man seen wearing a T-shirt with Communist leaders&#39; images. The man&#39;s attorney said his name is Marcel Fontaine and he &quot;suffered a lot of harassment&quot; over the misused photo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/amp-article/20180216/news/180219119/">www.dailyherald.com/amp-article/20180216/news/180219119/</a>). Should Twitter be taken off all social media platforms?  </p>

<p>News agencies make mistakes all the time.  They retract the information and sometimes they have to pay out some money to correct the problem.  Every news agency has had a multitude of defamation cases brought against them, and yet their social media presence remains untarnished.  Even companies like CNN have had people on their shows talking about harming the President.  Why doesn’t anything happens to them?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jones can&#39;t be sued personally for his &#39;on air&#39; BS because he is protected by the corporation he (and his program) operates under.  This is typical.  The organization is liable for damages, not Jones personally.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter who Jones is blaming for that piece of bad info.  His organization puts a lot of libelous/slanderous stuff out there.</p>

<p>There is typically a &#39;source&#39; for erroneous information and a newspaper (as long as they are acting in good faith) can redact their statements, apologize, sometimes payout damages and take corrective measures to prevent repetitive occurrences. </p>

<p>Jones continues to propagate much of his BS, even with factual evidence proving the contrary.  This is him acting &quot;in bad faith&quot;.  i.e.  Ignoring the evidence and doubling down on misinformation.</p>

<p>Jones can do that all he wants (he is entitled to his opinion), but don&#39;t expect Twitter to allow him to spread BS on their platform when there is a provable liability for slander/libel.</p>

<p>A good example would be tabloid newspapers.   You know the, &quot;Tom Cruise has alien baby with Oprah&quot; tabloids ... They get sued all the time. 
Why do they not have a YouTube channel?  Why are their headlines not covered in Google News?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t see all the other stuff that is too much of a legal liability because they are &quot;censured&quot; too (not really censured, just not welcome on someone else&#39;s platform due to liability concerns.)</p>

<p>Jones is legally allowed to have his show, he just crossed too many lines and now he needs to provide his own platform.</p>

<p>He does have his own platform, just like the &quot;alien baby tabloids&#39; publish their own material, so go there and view it, right?</p>

<p>I hope this makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Mr. Fontaine claimed defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge upheld Mr. Fontaine’s defamation claim, but denied his emotional distress one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The judge also ruled that Mr. Fontaine could sue Mr. Jones’s business and the Infowars employee who wrongly identified him as the gunman, but that he could not sue Mr. Jones personally.</p>

<p>So you’re citing an instance where one of Jones reporters wrongfully identified the shooter.   The name of the alleged shooter likely showed up on hundreds of websites before they reported on it. </p>

<p>[Twitter was original source]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reports about a second shooter at a high school in Parkland, Florida, this week started with a tweet from an account falsely purporting to be former Fox News host Bill O&#39;Reilly. The account was later suspended and police say that suspect acted alone in the massacre that killed 17 people. Also, Florida elections officials refuted a report that the teen charged in the shooting was a Democrat, saying that he was not a registered voter. And some social media posts this week wrongly identified the teen charged as a man seen wearing a T-shirt with Communist leaders&#39; images. The man&#39;s attorney said his name is Marcel Fontaine and he &quot;suffered a lot of harassment&quot; over the misused photo.</p>

<p>News agencies make mistakes all the time.  They retract the information and sometimes they have to pay out some money to correct the problem.  Every news agency has had a multitude of defamation cases brought against them, and yet their social media presence remains untarnished.  Even companies like CNN have had people on their shows talking about harming the President.  Why doesn’t anything happens to them?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jones can&#39;t be sued personally for his &#39;on air&#39; BS because he is protected by the corporation he (and his program) operates under.  This is typical.  The organization is liable for damages, not Jones personally.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter who Jones is blaming for that piece of bad info.  His organization puts a lot of libelous/slanderous stuff out there.</p>

<p>There is typically a &#39;source&#39; for erroneous information and a newspaper (as long as they are acting in good faith) can redact their statements, apologize, sometimes payout damages and take corrective measures to prevent repetitive occurrences. </p>

<p>Jones continues to propagate much of his BS, even with factual evidence proving the contrary.  This is him acting &quot;in bad faith&quot;.  i.e.  Ignoring the evidence and doubling down on misinformation.</p>

<p>Jones can do that all he wants (he is entitled to his opinion), but don&#39;t expect Twitter to allow him to spread BS on their platform when there is a provable liability for slander/libel.</p>

<p>A good example would be tabloid newspapers.   You know the, &quot;Tom Cruise has alien baby with Oprah&quot; tabloids ... They get sued all the time. 
Why do they not have a YouTube channel?  Why are their headlines not covered in Google News?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t see all the other stuff that is too much of a legal liability because they are &quot;censured&quot; too (not really censured, just not welcome on someone else&#39;s platform due to liability concerns.)</p>

<p>Jones is legally allowed to have his show, he just crossed too many lines and now he needs to provide his own platform.</p>

<p>He does have his own platform, just like the &quot;alien baby tabloids&#39; publish their own material, so go there and view it, right?</p>

<p>I hope this makes sense.</p>
