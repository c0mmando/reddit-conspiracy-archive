       I think you can get more people to understand the seriousness of this by, rather than saying it was “worse than Watergate”, pointing out that not only is using the IRS to target political opposition not “no big deal” ( as Obama sycophants would argue) it was actually specifically mentioned in one of Nixon’s articles of impeachment as a reason Nixon should be removed from office.

       Here is the preliminary, final settlement, would  you point out where the IRS says they targeted enemies? 
That would have been  a crime, this is a civil lawsuit.  There was no criminal case.

       Oh I would imagine that is part of there directive anyway since politicizing it is already a crime.

       But I would bet my game tokens the current administration will be directing the IRS to target liberals and Democratic.

       There was no evidence ever found that linked Obama to what the IRS did and no criminal charges.

      <p>
       Here is the final settlement for a civil lawsuit, not a criminal case.

       The Republican Congress, led by Darrell Issa, conducted a long investigation and did not recommend any criminal charges,  the DOJ's Inspector General found no criminal activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were no criminal charges because there was no crime, thus the tea party folks filed a civil lawsuit claiming they had been picked on.

       That was a Republican Committee led by Darrell Issa, who promised the nation he would impeach Obama.  If you remember the week the investigation opened there were , "Impeach Obama," demonstrations all across the U.S. including the town I lived in where a group set up in an empty lot by the post office, with a table and a huge sign.
      </p>
      <p>
       The town drove by and hooted at them, until they gave up.

      <h1>
       IRS auditor reaffirms that conservatives, not liberals, were targeted
      </h1>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        IRS
       </a>
       inspector general said this week that while some liberal groups were given extra scrutiny by the tax agency, they were not subjected to the same invasive queries as tea party groups — a finding that seems to confirm a political bias was at play.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a letter sent late Wednesday and released Thursday, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/j-russell-george/">
        J. Russell George
       </a>
       said that just 30 percent of groups with the word “progressive” in their name were put through special scrutiny for tax-exempt applications, but 100 percent of groups with “tea party,” “patriot” or “9/12” in their name were subjected to invasive questioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       “TIGTA concluded that inappropriate criteria were used to identify potential political cases for extra scrutiny — specifically, the criteria listed in our audit report. From our audit work, we did not find evidence that the criteria you identified, labeled “Progressives,” were used by the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        IRS
       </a>
       to select potential political cases during the 2010 to 2012 time frame we audited,”
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/j-russell-george/">
        Mr. George
       </a>
       said.
      </p>
      <p>
       That finding contradicts claims by congressional Democrats who said liberal groups were targeted too — and, they argue, that suggests the scrutiny by the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        Internal Revenue Service
       </a>
       didn’t have a political bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hours after the letter was released, acting
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        IRS
       </a>
       chief
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-werfel/">
        Daniel Werfel
       </a>
       said that while an initial investigation has found no evidence of bias or political motivation, he didn’t disagree with the auditor’s conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The findings served to reinvigorate the controversy over the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        IRS
       </a>
       , which has raged since revelations last month that the tax agency probed conservative groups in the run-up to the 2010 and 2012 elections, and was delaying approval of many of the groups, in some cases by three years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rep. Dave Camp, Michigan Republican and chairman of the House and
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ways-committee/">
        Ways Committee
       </a>
       , said the evidence shows conservatives were being systematically targeted — not just flagged.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Americans deserve better than to fear whether the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        IRS
       </a>
       will unfairly target them,” Mr. Camp said. “One thing is clear: Congress has a lot more work to do to bring this out-of-control agency in check and hold them accountable to the American people.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-werfel/">
        Mr. Werfel
       </a>
       vowed Thursday to do just that.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I want the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        IRS
       </a>
       to be in the business of just detecting — because we have to under the law and regulation — the extent of political activity, not knowing the type of politics,” he told the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ways-committee/">
        committee
       </a>
       . “What I’m suggesting is more analysis. Significant more analysis is needed before we reach conclusions about what that means in terms of an
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        IRS
       </a>
       failure or an
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        IRS
       </a>
       issue.”
      </p>
      <p>
       But many committee members were not assuaged by the pledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Back in my district, it appears the Allen Area Patriots have also been a target of the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        IRS
       </a>
       ,” said Rep. Sam Johnson, Texas Republican. “The bottom line is that the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        IRS
       </a>
       has been used as a political weapon, and that’s just outrageous.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats, who have argued that the problem at the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        IRS
       </a>
       stems from campaign finance rules more than political bias, questioned
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/j-russell-george/">
        Mr. George
       </a>
       ’s latest letter, after he said earlier this week that his audit wasn’t tasked with looking at how the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        IRS
       </a>
       handled progressive groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Congress deserved to know that ‘progressives’ were on the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        IRS
       </a>
       screening list during the time of the audit and progressive organizations were in the review group,” said Rep. Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ways-committee/">
        committee
       </a>
       . “These omissions changed the nature of the investigation, and the IG’s testimony is not consistent with his written response.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats on the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ways-committee/">
        committee
       </a>
       have sent a letter to Mr. Camp criticizing
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/j-russell-george/">
        Mr. George
       </a>
       ’s audit report as “fundamentally flawed,” and requesting that
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/j-russell-george/">
        Mr. George
       </a>
       return to the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ways-committee/">
        committee
       </a>
       to address the fact that the audit fails to mention that “progressives” was used as a screening term and that it does not mention liberal groups were among the 298 applications reviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-werfel/">
        Mr. Werfel
       </a>
       said his investigation is continuing, but there is no evidence of intentional wrongdoing by anyone at the
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/internal-revenue-service/">
        IRS
       </a>
       or involvement from anyone outside the agency, nor was there evidence of inappropriate “screeners” beyond those outlined in the IG report.
      </p>
      <p>
       “We recognize, however, that there is public concern regarding the criteria used for applications or tax-exempt status, and more needs to be done to evaluate our screening criteria and procedures,” he said.

       Nice spin, the IRS was found guilty and admitted such in the apology.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The IRS on Thursday tentatively settled two lawsuits brought by conservative tea party groups targeted for extra scrutiny earlier this decade, apologizing for its conduct in one and agreeing to a multimillion-dollar payout in the other.

       And earlier it was reported that settlement was, $2.5 with ought to cover the legal costs and if there was any evidence, why didn't they continue with the trial instead of settling.

       I think the investigation now ought to be, why did Jeff Sessions settle a lawsuit that didn't have any evidence?

       Could you help me if my interpretation is incorrect, I don’t know much about this topic. From the article it seems to me like the IRS committed and basically admitted to some form of discrimination against some conservative groups.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But in the consent decree, the IRS acknowledged that the treatment of those groups was "unnecessary to the agency's determination of their tax-exempt status."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The groups were described in the lawsuit as conservative groups. The treatment of the groups was unnecessary to determine they were tax exempt, so it was done for some other reason, possibly just to hassle them and give them a hard time by making the process more painful. Anyways, the part I really fail to see is the direct Obama connection that some people arguing with you talk about. To me it seems like it’s possible the IRS just behaved that way on its own, and Obama had to have their backs I guess. So yeah to me it seems like the IRS admitted to some type of discrimination against the groups, but that doesn’t mean it was ordered by Obama or that he was even involved/knowledgeable of it.

          But the abuse of the immense power at the Internal Revenue Service’s disposal was a story that burned white hot for only a short time. Remarkably, the fire was quickly doused when Obama insisted that the story had run its course. The Washington press corps, 90 percent of whose members probably voted for Obama if previous data about their attitudes are accurate, were entirely happy to follow his direction.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          In spite of Carney’s best efforts, the grave implications in the acknowledgment that the IRS had strategically limited the ability of conservative groups to exercise their right to participate in politics forced President Obama to speak on the matter three days later. “I can tell you that if you’ve got the IRS operating in anything less than a neutral and nonpartisan way, then that is outrageous, it is contrary to our traditions, and people have to be held accountable and it’s got to be fixed,” Obama insisted. His denunciation was convincing. And he seemed to acknowledge the self-evident gravity of the charge that the First Amendment rights of conservative groups had been curtailed, though he added that he “first learned about this from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this.” (this is a flat out lie, we later learned.)
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Carney assured the press, however, that Obama never demanded to know from his staff why he had learned of these scandalous revelations only from news reports.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          On May 15, Obama held a press conference in which he announced that, along with the two “rogue” employees, Miller was also to be jettisoned. “Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it,” Obama said

         <p>
          At a campaign-style event in late June,
          <strong>
           Obama shifted from insisting that the revelations regarding the targeting of conservatives made him “angry” to dismissing them as just one in a series of “phony scandals.”

          It is testament to the potency of the initial revelations about the IRS targeting scandal that the press was deeply critical of Obama for failing to address it immediately (recall that he waited three days to speak).
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The IRS targeting story lay dormant in all but conservative media before it was resuscitated this February, when the president sat down for an interview with Fox News Channel’s Bill O’Reilly. Pressed,
          <strong>
           Obama insisted that there was “not even a smidgen of corruption” at the IRS.
          </strong>
          The president was merely echoing a sentiment that had become gospel among left-of-center journalists in the intervening months: The targeting of conservative groups, they argued, had been neither irresponsible nor unusual.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          In one email, Lerner joked to colleagues about seeking an open role at the political wing of Obama’s eternally active campaign apparatus, Organizing for Action. This implicit admission of political allegiance would have appalled the press corps, had the political affiliations in question been reversed. But the media was firmly settled into the collective impression that the IRS targeting scandal was no scandal at all. The emails landed with a thud.

       Shouldn’t that be the way it should be? If you have a claim then it’s reasonable to present evidence and expect people to look for holes in your reasoning or evidence. Otherwise faulty reasoning propagates and becomes the norm.

       That page literally has factual inaccuracies (lies) on it. We know that liberal groups were targeted. Roughly 30% of the groups were liberal. That page says 100% were conservative. That's just blatantly untrue. I don't have time to go through the rest and find out how much of it is untrue.

       Shouldn’t that be the way it should be? If you have a claim then it’s reasonable to present evidence and expect people to look for holes in your reasoning or evidence. Otherwise faulty reasoning propagates and becomes the norm.
