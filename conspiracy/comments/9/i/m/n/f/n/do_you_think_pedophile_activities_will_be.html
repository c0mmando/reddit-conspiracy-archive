With full respect to LGBT, 10-15 years ago it was illegal, disgusting and sickening to many, and hated by most people. Later on, they initiated rights, and it became a normal thing nowadays. This got me thinking that the same scenario may happen again in the future to legalize pedophile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>I think the LGBT movement has support by those who aren&#39;t LGBT because the idea that, being that gay marriage etc is perpetuated by adults. </p>

<p>I think any attempt (if there are any attempts) to legalize pedophilia will fail based on the idea that a child does not have the mental faculties to consent to a sexual act with an adult.</p>

<p>I think if we ever see something like that even being considered, it will be long long after age of consent laws, drinking age laws, pretty much any law distinguishing that a minor cannot make legal decisions for themselves are abolished, if that ever happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming a child can legally give consent, no, since they didn&#39;t, well, consent. Right now legally a child cannot consent so its de facto &quot;no consent&quot; unless their legal guardian gives the go.</p>

<p>The tricky part is to convince the general population that children can give consent, or that consent can be taught to children, until it reaches the ears of the politicians that may change the legal definition of consent in favour of pedophiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the current grey line. The basis of giving the legal guardian the right to consent for the child is because of the premise that a child is not mature enough to know what is and isn&#39;t best for them, and therefore their personal consent is meaningless.</p>

<p>If the legal guardian abuses their power of consenting for the child &quot;by proxy&quot; for things that are clearly not in the child&#39;s interest, say, for a flat-out sodomy, then that is by legal definition abuse. If it&#39;s for a rollercoaster, i&#39;d say the legal guardian should have the wisdom of seeing that the child is not interested in the activity. Then again for a rollercoaster that may not have a long term impact on the child&#39;s developement, it may be trivial to respect the child&#39;s decision of not going.</p>

<p>This is the same as a child refusing to go shopping with their legal guardian because it is boring. They do not consent going, but respecting their lack of consent doesn&#39;t add anything of value to the child&#39;s &quot;best interests&quot; and may complicate things as it may be unsafe to leave the child home alone while the legal guardian is away.</p>

<p>On the contrary, a child refusing an antibiotic treatment because of the syrup&#39;s bad taste is not good for the best interest of their health, so a legal guardian should have the legal power of forcing a decision to the child for the sake of their wellbeing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, it is up to the legal guardian to determine if a denial of a child&#39;s consent will cause trauma, the amplitude of that trauma, and wether the long term beneficial impacts (for the child) of denying that consent outbalance the potential trauma.</p>

<p>In the end it is very case by case because the example of the rollercoaster will yield trauma to some children, while others might actually enjoy the ride.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know what the magic word, the only thing that matters in American sexual mores today is? One thing. You can do anything, the left will promote and understand and tolerate anything, as long as there is one element. Do you know what it is? Consent. If there is consent on both or all three or all four, however many are involved in the sex act, it&#39;s perfectly fine. Whatever it is. But if the left ever senses and smells that there&#39;s no consent in part of the equation then here come the rape police. But consent is the magic key to the left.  <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2016/10/12/limbaugh-left-sends-out-rape-police-whenever-theres-sex-no-consent-also-known-rape/213787">Source</a>  </p>

<p>The left will never support the idea that a child is capable of consent.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but if a 9 year old child is capable of choosing their gender, in their eyes, asking if a 9 year old can consent is not that far away.</p>

<p>I am very concerned with the direction the radical SJW are pushing their narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comparing LGBT rights recognition to the normalization of pedophilia is comparing apples to oranges. LGBT relationships are between consenting participants. Pedophilia, by definition, involves participants incapable of consent. Unless they are going to reduce the age of consent significantly, I cant see pedophilia getting normalized. </p>

<p>My bet is that polygamy gets normalized next. By increasing the household population density, the wealthy can extract even more from the lower classes. </p>

<p>They allow children to choose their gender.</p>

<p>They will say children should be allowed to choose their sexual partners.</p>

<p>Children can be groomed into consenting.</p>

<p>&quot;We believe parents can start educating children about consent and empowerment as early as 1 year old&quot;</p>
