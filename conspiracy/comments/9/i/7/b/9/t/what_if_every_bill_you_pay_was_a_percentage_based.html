       Instead of paying a flat fee for something you buy (regardless what it may be), pay an instantly accessible percentage of your income.

       I'm sure there are holes, but wouldn't the idea create instant equality?

       Yes. Prices based on supply and demand. The value of the thing itself as decided by the mass of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Equality is not a desirable goal. It can only be achieved using tyranny. When people are free they make different choices, and different choices lead to different outcomes.

       Yes it does. You want equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity. There is no way around the negatives when you're trying to impose equality of outcome because it is unnatural and phony.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want tyranny imposed to make everything cost the same proportion to all people, but as someone said already, that kills the incentive to create things (if things aren't sold for what they are worth) and efficiently allocate resources based on market signals (prices).
      </p>

       All these "what if the world was equal and full of love" nursery ideas are all one big joke.

       They don't keep the difference in taxes though, that goes to the government. They would still make maybe 10% margins on the luxury car, the only difference is who is buying.

       10% of nothing is nothing. This won't help poor people. This would only increase the costs for rich people, exactly the type of people with resources to get around such a problem by bribing poor people. This is how the tax system is used and abused. The poor pay the majority of tax.

       That's a big if. Who is suddenly going to have global dictatorship power with exact knowledge of everything and everybody's finances and be able to apply this scheme without massive backlash. Whilst I don't think we live in utopia I believe a large part of our current systems rely on human nature. It's not actually fair that hard working or save oriented person suddenly has to pay more than reckless lazy others. Application of proposal is lacking, I think it could possibly be flawed or lead to worse outcomes than initial thoughts. It doesn't solve any fairness issues except maybe for the extreme ends of rich/poor. Relative wealth is quite a spectrum and not so easy to quantify or apply a simplistic notion to. We have a system in the world right now where products and services have unequal value around the world. This fuels global inequality and the third world/first world trade issues and free movement of people problems.

       That seems way too complex. Ultimately I think the best political system requires a racially and religiously united populous that is so united that the rich willingly give away their wealth away to people who need it more. Rich people nowadays are hesitant to give it away because they feel it will go to people who are unappreciative and hostile towards them

       People aren't equal though. Some people are stupid and lazy. Why should a stupid lazy person who has no positive impact on the world and isn't productive be compensated equally as someone like Tesla who worked hard every day and changed the world with his inventions?

       People should be treated as equals but should be compensated for the value they bring to the world, not compensated equally for different work.

       Call me old-fashioned but I think as long as you have a beating heart you should have a place to live regardless of your financial situation. What difference does it make anyways if a person is contributing to the economy or not? This just seems a little selfish. It’s like saying, YOU are not generating anything that’s benefiting ME so why should YOU have a right to have the things you need to live?

       I don't think anyone has an obligation to contribute to the economy or be productive. OP is suggesting that people pay for goods and services based on a percentage of their money. Why should someone who contributes nothing be able to basically steal other people's hard work? Say a really poor person buys a new iphone and barely pays for it because he is paying a percentage of his tiny income. He is now making someone else who is more productive subsidize his lifestyle. I'm not the one being selfish. I don't want to subsidize the lifestyle of someone who is lazy and does nothing all day but still wants a bunch of cheap stuff.

       Oh, better yet, what if everything was just free. That way your income wouldn't matter at all and you could just have everything you wanted all the time without having to earn or appreciate it. Super awesome!!

        I'm sure there are holes, but wouldn't the idea create instant equality?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Short answer: no, this idea alone wouldn't work in our current society. You would need to take much more drastic steps to create total economic equality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long answer: It's too broad, because there are vast differences in costs between things wealthy people buy and things poor people buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, for most people their biggest expense as a percentage of their income is their rent or mortgage. For a very poor person, that might be a three-figure monthly bill that consumes more than half of their income; for a fairly wealthy person in a big city it's four or five figures and a smaller percentage of their income.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's say that your system decides the appropriate percentage of income to spend on rent is 35%. That means that the rich person is now paying way more for their house than it's actually worth, while the poor person is paying much less than it's worth. Of course, that's the whole idea, and maybe your system has a way to redistribute the wealthy homeowner's payment to make up the difference of all the people losing money renting to poor people, but there's another problem: in your system, at least as stated, there's nothing to stop a poor person from renting a very expensive house. They'll pay the same rent no matter what (35% of their income), so why live in a $600/month apartment when they could be in a $6000/month luxury home?
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that this same problem will crop up with almost any utility or expenditure you can think of: if the 'luxury' option costs the same as the 'budget' option, there's no incentive to be cheap.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is unworkable, because now your rich guy who overpays can only cover the cost of one poor person that underpays, and rich people are vastly outnumbered by poor people. Presumably you've enacted laws that landowners can't discriminate based on income, so your government program goes bankrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can try to fix this by mandating that poor people are only allowed to purchase things 'within their means', but that's arguably worse than the system we have now, because you're essentially telling people that they're not allowed to purchase extravagances for themselves by law. ('Sorry, with your income you don't qualify for this Thanksgiving turkey. You can have these hot dogs.') You're also making it much harder to save money; if someone wants to save some cash by cheaping out on a bunch of their expenditures, that's no longer an option.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is ignoring some other issues, like what counts as income, and whether people have any extra left over to invest, and yada yada yada.
