    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever done remote viewing?  I&#39;ve actually done it, and it&#39;s legit.  You can regurgitate some report, but remote viewing is real and not so hard to do at a novice level.       </p>

<p>&quot;Research was done&quot; is such a massive understatement that it feels more like a lie. Project Stargate started in the 70s and was officially ended in the 90s, though most involved are certain it was unofficially continued.  The government developed the remote viewing protocols, with the help of legitimate psychics, like Ingo Swann.      </p>

<p>For some reason, people on a conspiracy sub want you to believe in the high school jock version of reality. Waiting for the  &quot;Psychics are stupid, dude&quot; or &quot;the report said it was gay&quot; posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have misdirected blame -- your real problem is with liars and frauds, not psychics. You can find liars and frauds anywhere you look, but just because you&#39;ve shown one person to be a liar doesn&#39;t allow you to conclude that therefore anyone/everyone else is.  I get it - you believe all psychics are liars, but I wonder if you&#39;re simply choosing to ignore the genuinely unexplainable examples of psychic abilities in favor of the low-hanging fruit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because that’s not really the realm of how psychic phenomena works. Psychic “powers” (I really don’t like calling them that) are much more in the realm of spiritual and emotional information. They deal with the non-material. Some people think psychics are all about dealing in hard facts and picking up lotto numbers and stuff like that, but this just isn’t the case. Those tend to be the psychics who are scamming you, the ones who claim to be able to get you great wealth and power. Psychic development is a spiritual practice more than anything. It’s not like psychic info is a magic fix for anything, it is just another avenue of gaining some wisdom and perspective.</p>

<p>That said, a lot of psychics also work as astrologers. Astrology isn’t necessarily a psychic field, but there are a lot of people who practice both. And astrology definitely has a long history of very wealthy and successful people using it to make the right decisions so that they can become rich and powerful. JP Morgan famously used astrologers. As did Ronald and Nancy Reagan. I’ve also heard (haven’t confirmed) that Apple releases their products on astrologically-advantageous dates. Run a couple internet searches for “billionaires and astrology”, it’s a really interesting avenue of inquiry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure that question has an answer... I mean, how would you determine if you yourself were psychic vs. just a really lucky guesser?  Are you familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_reading">cold reading</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_reading">hot reading</a>? These are basically tools for successfully lying. I would say that if an alleged psychic is employing those techniques, especially hot reading (obviously), then that&#39;s a red flag.  But you have to look at the examples where information is provided by the psychic that cannot be explained by either technique.</p>

<p>So for an anecdotal example, I went to see a psychic once and she was very accurate and specific.  She did all of the talking, did not ask vague or probing questions as per cold-reading. I had brought a picture of my family for her to &#39;read&#39; and she specifically said about my mother that her wrists hurt her and that it was psychological because she was stressed about having to handle more than her fair share of the housework such as vacuuming. Now this was 100% true, even to the point of my mother asking me to vacuum because of her wrist pain.  Lucky guesses?  My mother never saw a doctor about this, there were no medical records, never posted on social media about it (this was in 2000 anyway), etc; there was just no explainable way for her to have known or guessed this from my body language.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re being ridiculous -- &quot;an easy guess&quot;...no way.  First of all, how do you know how old my mother is?  Are you psychic?  In 2000 she was 45 years old, and quite healthy I might add - hardly elderly. Secondly, the wrist is a very specific body part to guess, so is vacuuming out of all possible household chores to pick from. And third, this psychic basically repeated word for word what my mother had said to me earlier that very week about feeling stressed and overwhelmed and needing help with said chores because of the pain.  That&#39;s not an &quot;easy guess&quot;-- it&#39;s three specific statements combined and highly improbably to be coincidental.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is impossible to explain how she could have been a fraud without a recording or even a transcript, but there are a couple of techniques cold readers use that would be applicable in the situation you describe. </p>

<p>You say you did little talking, but talking isn&#39;t the only way we communicate. A good cold reader is adept at reading body language and flickering facial expressions. As the reader speaks, she sees that her client appears to be expressing disappointment or skepticism, she knows that what she&#39;s missing the mark, and she abandons whatever it was she talking about. Some people will nod or shake their heads, while not remembering doing so, but it doesn&#39;t even have to be that obvious. It could be that client narrows her eyes when the psychic is off and widens them when the psychic is on, or leans forwards toward the psychic when something sounds right. So, if the client appears to be expressing excitement or surprise, she knows that she&#39;s barking up the right tree, and she keeps pursuing the line of thought she&#39;s on, honing in.</p>

<p>Your psychic did all the talking--a lot of talking? Was she shotgunning? Was she suggesting many possibilities while watching for your cues? Lots of people will come away from a psychic very pleased that the psychic had correctly guessed, let&#39;s say, their father&#39;s name. But a recording or transcript will show that the psychic suggested many other names before arriving at the right one. (Other people will helpfully tell the psychic themselves--&quot;Was your father&#39;s name John or Joseph, James...&quot; &quot;Gerald!&quot; &quot;Gerald, yes! He was telling me his name began with a J  sound...&quot; And the reader won&#39;t remember doing so. I know this doesn&#39;t apply to your situation though.)</p>

<p>And then you can&#39;t discount hot reading completely. Before psychics could research their clients online, they kept notes, often on index cards, which they guarded from their rivals but shared with their partners and friends. So if Psychic A learned anything about a new client via cold reading, she could give (or sell) that info to Psychic B. and if that client then went to Psychic B, Psychic B would knock that client&#39;s socks off without even having to resort to cold reading. </p>

<p>Referrals as well...if one client, impressed by a psychic, wants to send a friend in, she might just tell that psychic more about her friend than she thinks she did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psychic phenomena is a very real thing. I think everyone has latent psychic abilities that we can all learn to access. It is a skill set like any other, although some people will naturally be much better at it than others.  Being psychic is part of being human.</p>

<p>That said, plenty of professional psychics are conmen. And plenty of professional psychics are genuinely gifted people trying to help others, and a session with a real good psychic can be more productive than years of psychotherapy. YMMV.

    <div class="md"><p>Let me tell you this.</p>

<p>I have never met a true psychic (or a &quot;healer&quot; for that matter) who has felt comfortable calling themselves that, but I have met both psychics and healers. I have met a good amount of charlatans and frauds too.</p>

<p>It seems clear to me from my own experience that it is possible to receive glimpses and visions of both past and future events, springing from the unconscious mind, in dreams, hallucinations, or intuitions, and it also seems clear to me that it is possible to increase our bodies&#39; ability to heal itself by guided attention, either within oneself or within another person (and to cause damage too). </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t call these things supernatural, but I would call them rare and weakly developed in virtually all people (skills that were potentially simply forgotten about many thousands of years ago). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prahlad_Jani">Meditators of the highest degrees have been shown to have such control of their bodies that they can go without eating, drinking, urinating, or shitting for as much as 10 days, while claiming they have been doing this for up to 7 decades.</a></p>

<p>I have personally made an impossible recovery from a severe spinal chord injury through the help of a genuine healer, who would never ask for money or would call herself a healer. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a field that is filled with such hope and potential for people who suffer from illness or hopelessness of another kind, that it&#39;s sadly a breeding ground for scam artists and delusional frauds. But that doesn&#39;t mean that the phenomena aren&#39;t real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that is what I linked to. I assume you mean to imply that I&#39;m ignoring skeptics of this guru&#39;s claims and the research done. I am not.</p>

<p>While especially the first study, but also the second could and should have been stricter and more foolproof than they were, there is no reason other than assumptions to believe that cheating did occur. I do agree that these tests should be done more often and more rigorously to understand what is going on. After all, even if he managed to sip a sip here and there while bathing under supervision, it&#39;s clear that he shouldn&#39;t have been as healthy by the end of the trials as he was with little to no nutrition for sustenance.</p>

<p>And one more point about open mindedness: the reason given in the paragraph you quoted reduces to &quot;it couldn&#39;t have been possible because it&#39;s impossible&quot;. That is a non-sequitor. What&#39;s impossible for almost every other person may not be impossible for a specific individual, especially if they have dedicated their lives to proving it possible.</p>

<p>besides basic biology... as it is stated most people who properly document their journey have being debunked or die.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>even if he managed to sip a sip here and there</p>

<p>he could have done much more, you are just excluding the possibility based on your beliefs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;it couldn&#39;t have been possible because it&#39;s impossible&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there is no such an argument in the paragraph, he says that &quot;a human of average weight would die after &quot;15 to 20 days&quot; without water&quot; but his argument is not this.<br/>
the principal argument is that there is no proof that this man was without water or food for days, that the experiment is flawed by design, and it can&#39;t reach the conclusions that are stated by the researchers that were responsible for the study.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres a lot of cons, cheats, and tricksters in any field of life. This includes psychics. When there is money, there will be greedy people trying to take advantage.</p>

<p>With that said I believe psychic powers are real and that the akashic records and past life experiences can be tapped into. </p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point. I paid over $500, for a past life reading from a very well known credible author (she writes akashic record past life readings) and it absolutely blew my mind and explained many things about my life and preferences. There is more esoteric knowledge within us and in our past lives than we realize. We are truly powerful spiritual beings.</p>

<p>The psychic healer with the single best scientific track record/most experiments successfully performed with him:</p>

<p>Dr. Christos Drossinakis from Frankfurt: <a href="https://www.heilerschule-drossinakis.de/de/">https://www.heilerschule-drossinakis.de/de/</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>One Swiss remote viewer with really high percentage of successful viewings (even found lost airplanes in Ecuadorian jungle or some place over there),</p>

<p>Martin Zoller: <a href="http://www.martinzoller.com/">http://www.martinzoller.com/</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Unfortunately most of the content you find about these guys is in German, but there is a distinct correlation between German language/people/places and paranormal phenomenons anyway in my opinion.</p>
