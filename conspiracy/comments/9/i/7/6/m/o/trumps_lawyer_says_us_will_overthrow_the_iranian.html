       There won't be a ground invasion of Iran. However, there is a big problem that the Obama admin exacerbated over there that needs to be taken care of. Not that Israel's hands are clean in all of this, they aren't. Although, I'm sure the Cryptos there would love to see us invade another one of their enemies, I don't think it will happen.

       All the long term indicators of US policy in the Middle East have been to set up favorable condition for the invasion of Iran.  Iran has been surrounded by US bases in preparation for an invasion from multiple fronts, and most importantly the neoconservative Kagan family, let the cat out of the bag, in their think thank called, Institute for the Study of War a year and a half ago.  They published a Syria report in which they stated war with Iran in the next 5 years...2 years ago.  Timetable is in 3.  The Kagans were the chief architects of us policy in the Project for the New American Century, and under Obama.

       I understand that it is an eventual goal, but the signs of a ground invasions just aren't there. Under an HRC presidency perhaps, but Trump would risk reelection in 2020 if he started to repeat the the mistakes of the Bush era.

       What signs?   We are seeing increasingly antagonistic posturing from the US, with a new CIA program in place to collapse the state.

       Under HRC we would have had the US increase its efforts in Syria, in order to have better control of variables for the eventual Iran operation.  Trump is just reckless, clueless and completely surrounded by worst neoconservative scum implementing right wing Israeli policy.   Moreover, the rehabilitation of Bush era war criminals, with some of them seeing boosts in favorability ratings shows that the US public, and political class have forgot about Iraq, and presidents see a surge in popularity and favorability in the early phases of a war.    A violent move of this nature would help Trump in an election year.

       Actually, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Afghanistan want exactly as planned. Israel's plan was to have these enemy nations destroyed by the US and their governments replaced by anarchy. The resulting chaos drove waves of immigrants into Europe, which deteriorates the political and economic power of native Europeans, allowing these countries to be further subverted. Win-win for Israel.

       Syria most certainly did not, as the state has not been collapsed, and US/Israel/Saudi proxies are on the verge of defeat.  Therefore the claim that 'they went exactly as planned' is false.

      <p>
       That Israel foreign policy was destabilization of regional rivals, and installation of institutions weaker, and friendlier to Isreal is true, however that they be replaced by 'anarchy', is certainly not.  No state wants an unpredictable and chaotic situation in a neighboring territory, states seek to create predictability and situation they can control.

       That wars generate refugees is uncontroversial; what is controversial is the second part of your statement.  As the opposite has actually occured, with nationalist elements exploiting the situation in Europe to argue for and implement a more austere policy.   Countries are not 'subverted' by the presence of refugees.

       The only reason that the Syrian government is still standing is due to Russian intervention. Nevertheless, Syria is no longer an effective antagonist to Israel and the Israeli spawned "civil war" has

       Except, of course, that any government that replaces the one that Israel subverted is apt to also view Israel as an enemy. Thus, Israel prefers anarchy and chaos for its own security and to create refugees to advance the achemes of its backers.

       Yea, I doubt it. I think I remember Trump saying he's never taken a drink because his brother died because of alcohol.

       Or you could actually read my link and see Trump's quote that he does sip wine at church.

      <blockquote>

        “When we go in church and I drink the little wine,

       He never promised to lock up Hillary. He didn't lie about crowd size. When did he lie about the weather? Wall has miles and miles around completed, still going up everyday. Coal industry is doing much better under Trump. WTF are you talking about lolol I thought you would come with a decent example or some washington post article.

       Iran is pretty much fighting an open proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen and Syria. The straw that broke the globalist back was when Iran resumed trading oil with China and India without using the dollar standard. It threatens the dollar being the world's reserve currency which spells huge trouble for the US and Israel

       Excellent question. The way the Federal reserve and the central bank are set up basically burdens the population with debt while bypassing government control. I think the book was "creature from jeckel Island" that outlined how the US monetary system was designed from the ground up to be a system of control and fix the mistakes that they learned from with the British pound.

       I'm not saying the Chinese yuan is perfect but the fact that the communist party can decide to devalue or float their currency at will pretty much explains why their nation is extremely wealthy while the USA is 19 trillion dollars in debt

       Bill Kristol co-founded the PNAC, which openly called for the need for a Pearl Harbor-like attack on the US to justify having the US military destroy Israel's enemies for it. Once Bush was elected, numerous PNAC members were incorporated into the administration and they got their Pearl Harbor-like attack.

       But why would the US dollar undergo hyperinflation if OPEC stops selling in dollars? Oil is a tiny part of USD demand, the fact that it's the reserve currency has almost nothing to do with oil and everything to do with the financial situation after WWII.

       After WWII, war-ravaged European countries imposed strict capital controls on their currencies. This meant you couldn't take francs, marks, pounds, etc. Out of their countries without getting in trouble with the law. This was so that as much money as possible was available for investment or taxation during reconstruction instead of sitting in tax havens somewhere. On the flipside, it made it very impractical to actually do international trade in these currencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dollar had the advantage of not having these capital controls as well as being issued by the one industrial country that hadn't been bombed to ashes or absorbed into the Eastern Bloc, therefore everyone wanted it.

       Right. You mean Israel is wanting to use a puppet force, like it did in Syria, to start a civil war. If anyone knows how to subvert a sovereign state, it is Israel.

       They are the enemy of the oligarchy,  not the American people. And yet, it will most likely be the American people's blood that ultimately gets spilled. Israel's backers don't care how many American kids get killed or maimed fighting its wars for it.

       There is no American blood being spilt to taken care of Iran.  It’s economic sanctions.

       It's true. The coup pulled off by those who would replace the globalist cabal with a Christo-fascist empire has been slowly eroded by the globalist elites. Trump has largely become their puppet now. (He was always a puppet, merely used by the other side now.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The "War in Heaven" is likely still a long way from over, imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Dems take over the House and Senate in January, they will be facing a crossroads. Do they leave Trump in office and merely work around him? If they do, how will Americans react when things continue to fall apart?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or so they impeach Trump and force his resignation (long planned by the Christo-fascists) and allow the designated POTUS to take over. Mike Pence is clearly NOT Donald Trump. At that point, team Christo-Fash will get new life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, all the while, the military is happily filling civilian gov't positions, ready to sweep in if chaos breaks out.

       How do you think he can possibly win?
      </p>
      <p>
       1)He has record low approval ratings.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)Much of his base has had to bear the negative ramifications of his decisions. Will they really stand by him after all the damage that he has done?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) We’re not at war so he doesn’t have the “don’t change horses midstream” tactic to fall back on.
      </p>
      <p>

       I personally think it is far more likely for the GOP to throw him under the bus, put Pence in charge for the last two years and then flip the ballot so that Paul Ryan can be the presidential bid in 2020.

       I don't understand the lure of people trying to shame and harass others for have a different belief. I personally think Trump is a horrible president, and that we haven't had a good president in many years, but I'm not going to go out of my way to try shaming somebody who thinks differently into submission. It's weird.

       That doesn't mean there is no Democrat and mainstream media apologia in this sub. Some people protect Fox news and others protect CNN. They are nothing but corporate bootlickers.

       Of course somebody will say I'm thinking in terms of the two party system, but to refrain from doing so would be handicapping me and everyone else from forming a proper response to the user that I replied to. If anything, I'm a 3rd party person, but only dedicated to the concept of 3rd party, not any one in particular.

       The Republican party will never say no to Israel because their most loyal voting block - christian evangelicals, wont stand for it. They believe the Jews need to be in Israel for their twisted end of the world fantasy to come about.

       Are you saying Trump is controlled by Putin or Netanyahu?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe even both? Do you really believe that yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is the only TRUE man who has run for President since JFK. He is not a politican.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is not corrupt. They don't have ANY DIRT on him. He cannot be blackmailed as all the other puppets were.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look for it you will see that the so called, "Deep State" or w.e people call it - is in panic mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait and see what happens. Either he is just another puppet and the show goes on as it has since JFK died, and before JFK, - or he is actually going to bring real change. (GOOD). No need to spread fear among the news meanwhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either everything stays the same,or gets better, so no stress? :-)

      <p>
       P.S I remember Trump taking a flight to Saudia Arabia and arresting, what was it, over 10 corrupt princes/high-placed((rich)) Arabs? Everyone had paid donations to the Hillary blah blah... She granted them favors, they paid to play. (Pay to play was the actual name of the 'system' they ran, involved a lot of SA people, and others).
      </p>
      <p>
       And I remember MSM pushing how Trump was going to bring about WW3, USA vs NK, (fear tactics by fake news as ALWAYS) - What happens? He brings PEACE. What more? They start tearing down their Nuclear facility, no more nuclear weapons for NK. What happens? NK and SK meets in the first time for....
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump speaks with Putin, MSM (fake news) just screaming bullshit like always - What really happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       PEACE. Peace with Russia. Putin may I add is a great guy, big heart - INTELLIGENT and kind. I've listened to several interviews with him and several times has he said that he knows that USA is being corrupt and it's not your fault, and that he likes you and blah blah. You should hear him out. He doesn't want to harm anyone. Don't listen to MSM, listen to him himself speak. I think he is a better source for himself than some paid political "news corp".
      </p>
      <p>
       Much more going on.. But what I am trying to say is - it might not be over. And if it is, well hasn't it always? Right? And had Hillary won it would have been worse. So either way I think you're getting the better deal here.
      </p>
      <p>
       And remember it is the people who has the power. Have a good day :-)

       Right! And this 'showmeur..' user.. I bet he hasn't taken time to actually LISTEN to Putin/Trump and see for himself. Bothers me since he is obviously in some sort of pain/stress. When he doesn't need to be. Either the show goes on, or it changes for the BETTER GOOD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not take some time if you got it - to look into Putin/Trump more. What they have to say about things. Answering questions. (Putin mostly) ((Trump being busy draining the swamp + fake news would never air an interview that's not just about trying to make him look bad.)) - If you're going to watch Trump, I recommend watching his rally's.

       Fake news. Trump being a zionist shill cannot leave "things are going to get worse" off the table. It's a high possibility that the 3D chess is a psyop against the people rather than the swamp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if things stayed the same, that's still horrendous. And by things staying the same, it will still steer in a worse direction naturally. Corporations and banksters get more powerful as they accumulate even more wealth and pull more bullshit against the people.

       You have not done enough research. There is, almost like secret societies, "deep installed" Military within US, where? I don't know, perhaps in Pentagon. They know everything. And I mean everything. 9/11, all.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have had enough. THEY are protecting Trump. THEY asked him to run for President. Nobody from "The Cabal" asked Trump to run. Nobody thought he would win. He shocked the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Trump (Military) has already begun the dirty work.
One traitor is dead, we don't speak his name.
However Trump wants to do everything by the law. It will take some time. But you will see if you seek, people are already getting sentenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take Paul J. Manafort, JR for instance.
***Count 1: Conspiracy Against the United States (18 U.S.C. § 371)
bla bla bla.. MANAFORT engaged in a variety of criminal schemes, and knowingly, intentionally, and willfully conspired with Richard W. Gates, Konstantin Kilimnik, and others to carry out the criminal schemes that make up Counts One and Two of the Information, as more fully set forth below.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go ahead and read, - You will see more people, "bigger" names.
I believe. I'm not saying I am telling you "this is how it is, and will be".
I'm sharing my point of view and thoughts. And I believe it to be true.

       Let's say if Qanon was lying to you, when would you know? You know why I ask this. Because if you're wrong, Trump/Qanon could be stringing us along for a 4-8 year psyop like Obama's hope and change potentially.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like that some Trump supporters are acting like "if Trump admin is doing something bad, it's the deep state's doing, if it's doing something good, that's Trump fighting back". How would we know they're not screwing with us? I believe there's pro-Trump shills along with pro-Clinton shills on reddit so you can see my skepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have a fair way of confirming whether Trump is compromised VS is truly playing 3D chess for the good of the working/middle classes? Despite my open mindedness, I don't trust Trump for obvious reasons. If Trump needs corporate money to continue a second term "for 3D chess" I am 100% going to call bullshit. Corporate donors = automatic shill imo.
      </p>

       Without relying on blind faith, is there an objective way to know?

       I absolutely hear you and of course I ask myself these questions.
Right now I can only tell you to actually look into Q, I do.
And it tells me (logic, etc) tells me we're going in the right way.
And that Trump is not a puppet like all have been before since JFK.
But of course I could be totally wrong. But it will not take long to know.
Alex Jones supports what is mainstream to stay mainstream, to keep the followers, to keep the money going. He is a Mossad installed shill and he has been taught how to take truth and poison it with disinformation. As for Fox News I am not sure. Perhaps was he too a Patriot. Perhaps had he taken a deal(if he had done something illegal) I really don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you will (or I will) know rather sooner than later if this is simply a ploy or not. Yes a human is rather intelligent but in a group they can be pretty dumb, it happens. But I honestly cannot believe people truly believes in Hillary still today. She and Bill have done horrible illegal acts, and I am not sure if all truth can be exposed due how it would distrupt the 'normal' citizens worldview or something like that. But criminals they are, and sentences they should get.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they say that the Military already had adviced a plan to take back the US, take out all the corrupt sick people in power (that has been in power for a long time) even if Trump did not win. They asked him to run for President. And using Trump is a better choice, they can now do this quietly while the citizens don't realize what's going on. (An internal war between central intelligence agencies, and the military, kind of).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is not much to source for this but if you seek you will find some.
I'm really tired - I know I should provide as many sources as possible, sorry. But what I do know is that I have been digging on Hillary and The Cabal long before 'Q' came and I know they would do anything (sell out US totally) for their own power. And according to 'Q' - "The Cabal/Hillary etc" had a plan. I'll leave it below.

       Bullshit. Russia wanted USA to be free from Israel. He warned you.

       He was an KGB agent as a teenager, climbed up - saw how it all worked, (The Cabal),
      </p>
      <p>
       how all the oligarchs controlled his country. When he became President, what happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       He took them all down, sent them out. They are no longer in control of Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think the Western Media, USA+Europe is attacking Russia year after year?
      </p>
      <p>
       When Russia is doing NOTHING harmful towards any of us. Sure you got the Russian Mafia and others who can cause a little uproar and are involved in things, but other than that.. Russia is not a threat but an ally.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the people in power knows this, and they fear Russia, and this is why they attack Russia.

       For Republicans it's the strong Evangelical Christians presence and voter base. It's basically a doomsday cult that believes they have to rebuild Israel and have the Jews come back so Jesus's second coming will happen and bring about the rapture/armageddon.

       If the US government is so in the pocket of the Russians, why are we continually butting heads with them over Syria? With every false flag in Syria and our retaliation towards the Syrian government is just another step to a real war with Russia. So how are we in the pocket of Putin?

       Putin got exactly the result he wanted in Syria, rebels mostly defeated after a long war, and Asad still in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin wants war between KSA and Iran, because that would skyrocket the price of oil, and that is the key to the entire Russian economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Trump Admin is doing everything to stoke the flames of war between KSA+Israel against Iran+Syria.

       The current Iranian regime was put in by the CIA. I presume this means they are only a threat to Israel when the puppet strings get pulled, but they have to act really annoyed at Israel in the meantime. For Israel’s part, they have to periodically do annoying things that receive wide media coverage

       Interesting points, worthy of further research.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems the war left all parties burdened with heavy debt, including the US, but especially European countries whose infrastructures were ravaged, in many cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       No doubt the dollar was positioned to become the "reserve currency", but that was long ago, and the national debt we (and other countries) have amassed in the interim must be considered -- as do trade deficits, and the fact that our economic base has evolved from being manufacturing/ industrial based to tech and service.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sense that these factors have made us far more vulnerable to shifts in power balance, and our reliance on foreign manufacturing is a serious liability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Food for thought. Thanks.

       of any given country.
