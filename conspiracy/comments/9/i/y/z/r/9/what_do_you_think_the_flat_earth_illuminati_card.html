<p>I personally think what flat earthers are noticing is that the earth is growing and/or is far larger than what we&#39;ve been told. That would explain a lot. If you ask how it&#39;s growing well the hollow earth theory could provide the answers for it. </p>

<p>Oh, my bad. Misread your comment. A growing earth would explain why people are noticing the curvature is not correct with the advance of lenses and zooming in. Boats should go over the horizon but that is just because of the eye. The lenses allow us to see further and they do not go over when they &quot;should&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the maths for the curve/horizon/boats etc is so off, that would mean there&#39;s been a huge amount of recent expansion. </p>

<p>Such an expansion of the Earths crust would surely cause gaps (Unless you think the crust is elastic?) between where it&#39;s expanded. So where are these gaps and why haven&#39;t any of them occurred on land to be observed? </p>

<p>But lets put on our imagination caps and go with the idea of the Earth growing - For the Earth to be widening, the crack in your photo would have to be a LOT wider, a SHIT-TON deeper and a GREAT DEAL longer. This would have to be happening all over the Earth.  </p>

<p>What you&#39;re probably talking about is visual acuity, where something is too small and too far away to be discerned with the naked eye (or a zoomed out camera) anymore. This is different to something disappearing over the horizon. If you can bring it back with zoom, it never went over the horizon to begin with. The same light is hitting your camera as is hitting your eyes, unless you&#39;ve changed position or elevation.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s confusing, imagine seeing ants at your feet. Then climb a ladder a few metres up until you can&#39;t see them with the naked eye anymore. They didn&#39;t disappear behind anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, that&#39;s exactly what I described in my original comment. It&#39;s not disappearing over the horizon, it&#39;s just too small for the camera to pick up. It&#39;s still &quot;there&quot;, having not actually gone over the horizon. Refer to my ant analogy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something disappearing from eyesight doesn&#39;t mean it went over the horizon, necessarily. If someone makes that claim then they&#39;re incorrect.</p>

<p>The most common flat earther claim in this situation is that you saw it &quot;go over the curve&quot; but brought it back with zoom, which is what I assumed you were saying. In my defense, it&#39;s basically what you said and it&#39;s what most flat earthers are claiming on the video you linked.</p>

<p>If your claim is just &quot;zoom has made it easier to determine how far away something is when it disappears from view&quot;, then sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do the Illuminati card show other propaganda projects because that is what the flat earth effort,  looked like, manipulation.</p>

<p>I apologize for such a basic question, but I haven&#39;t really looked at the card set, </p>

<p>but others here know of various manipulative propaganda  campaigns, such as, &quot;Islamic Terrorism,&quot; </p>

<p>and one that began after 2012,  our alleged desire for a &quot;Strong Authoritarian Leader.&quot;</p>

<p>I remember seeing articles about our alleged desire for a strong leader kind of nation, and Fox News and the radio people talked up Putin for being a &quot;strong leader.&quot;</p>

<p>So that is what I meant when I asked if they have cards for the big, move the thinking of the nation, kind of propaganda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The card says they know something. So I think what they mean is the flat earthers are correct in fact the Earth is not how it&#39;s presented to us, at least not anywhere near 100%. Now this could mean the Earth could be anything, could be hollow, could be round but space is water, could be round but with a dome, is could be concave or whatever. The card also mentions that their weird alternate geology (so I take it weird views of the world looks like) has led them to a gold strike (meaning we are finding lots of info about how the Earth isn&#39;t how it&#39;s told to us)</p>

<p>This is my interpretation of what the card is</p>
