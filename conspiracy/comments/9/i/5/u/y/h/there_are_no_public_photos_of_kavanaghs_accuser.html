        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just a weird thing I saw on r/thedonald. I decided to look into it and it turned out to be true. There are only two photos the press have used for Christine Ford, both of which are her in an outdoor setting with sunglasses. </p>

<p>I&#39;d just like to ad that I&#39;m not a trump-tard, nor do I think Kavanaugh is an angel. </p>

<p>Also, there seems to be evidence that Ford was already anti-trump and that her lawyer has attended anti-fa rallys. It also came out today that 0 of the 4 &#39;witnesses&#39; cited by Ford have confirmed her story. </p>

<p>Is this whole Kavanaugh thing just a distraction from something more important? Is it just a standard political attack? Discussion on this issue would be appreciated, I really dont know what to think about it.</p>

<p>Of course it is. Not saying it didn&#39;t happen, or if it did. Just that the minute she decided to come forward with something that happened 35 years ago (that she never went to the police about) at this moment in time she became a political player. </p>

<p>Look at American history. Washington politics has always been a dirty, anything goes game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems she was a bit of a promiscuous girl herself. </p>

<p>Have you seen her <a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/files/1984-Scribe-by-Holton-Arms-School-issuu-2018-09-20.pdf">Yearbook? </a></p>

<p>Christine Blasey Ford graduated Holton Arms
School in &#39;84. The graduating class was described like this by her classmates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;Cuz we are, wild and craaazy gals. The Class of &#39;84 is indeed a unique senior class. There has never been a
class like us and there will probably never be one quite like us again. W e like to do things in our own individual
way. That&#39;s why w e attend parties dressed ferocious as feline animals. That&#39;s why w e wear towels instead of
uniforms to school. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As accounted for by another girl in her class, the many parties they had revolved around the two B&#39;s, Beer and Boys, and also seemingly food, as the parties were renowned for causing munchies, which in my mind brings us to not alcohol, but another drug as well. </p>

<p>On the first page in this article, there&#39;s a picture of a pretty young Christine, who is noted as being a cheerleader. In another censored picture, members of presumably the cheerleading team are wearing playboy bunny outfits. </p>

<p>Cheerleaders: First Row: H. Huelsman, C. Blasey, S. Outman. Second Row: W. Cutting, L. Havener, W.
Hookman, E. Mason.</p>

<p>Teachers wrote this of her in the yearbook:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Chrissy managed to accumulate enough Fridays to keep her in detention for two trimesters;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The tenth grade taught us h o w to party
also; and Martha Mispireta usually provided the circumstances in which to do so. Celebrating her sweet sixteen
or just the weekend, Martha managed to entertain her guests with her hospitality, her pool (after
descummification), and her erotic male dancer; the latter, in his gold G-string, being by far the most effective.&quot;
-Another classmate.</p>
