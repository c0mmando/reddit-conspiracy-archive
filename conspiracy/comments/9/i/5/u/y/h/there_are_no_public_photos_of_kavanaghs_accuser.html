       Just a weird thing I saw on r/thedonald. I decided to look into it and it turned out to be true. There are only two photos the press have used for Christine Ford, both of which are her in an outdoor setting with sunglasses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd just like to ad that I'm not a trump-tard, nor do I think Kavanaugh is an angel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there seems to be evidence that Ford was already anti-trump and that her lawyer has attended anti-fa rallys. It also came out today that 0 of the 4 'witnesses' cited by Ford have confirmed her story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this whole Kavanaugh thing just a distraction from something more important? Is it just a standard political attack? Discussion on this issue would be appreciated, I really dont know what to think about it.

       That would be hilarious.

       I don't know what the conspiracy is, but I just cant believe the press could only find two pictures of her let alone both of them of her wearing sunglasses.

       That statement is also ironic because her lawyer also doesnt think violence over words is out of the realm of possibility, being at antifa rallys and all.

       Anyway, I don’t have cable or watch CNN? That’s also not what ironic means. I literally said she is probably hiding her face because of violence from humans. You decided to add “antifa rally”. You’ve decided to push your own agenda.

       Well, lots of people don't have an internet profile (facebook, etc.) with pictures of themselves. There are no pictures of me on the internet. So I don't really think anything is strange about just having two photos of her.

       I honestly don't have any pictures online of me. I'm 50 and have a son with autism (19). So I have not been social in real life for 19 years. It has nothing to do with being a conspiracy person either, but I only started getting into conspiracies two years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I have friends. We chat on the phone or they come over to my house to visit. But having a son with autism makes it difficult to go out and lead a normal life. So no pictures of me. Sad.

       I think it’s weird that to my knowledge they haven’t shown a high school year book photo of her at the time. I saw one of Kavanaugh at the time this was supposed to happen, but of her nope.

       Of course it is. Not saying it didn't happen, or if it did. Just that the minute she decided to come forward with something that happened 35 years ago (that she never went to the police about) at this moment in time she became a political player.

       Look at American history. Washington politics has always been a dirty, anything goes game.

       Seems she was a bit of a promiscuous girl herself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you seen her
       <a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/files/1984-Scribe-by-Holton-Arms-School-issuu-2018-09-20.pdf">
        Yearbook?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Christine Blasey Ford graduated Holton Arms
School in '84. The graduating class was described like this by her classmates.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        'Cuz we are, wild and craaazy gals. The Class of '84 is indeed a unique senior class. There has never been a
class like us and there will probably never be one quite like us again. W e like to do things in our own individual
way. That's why w e attend parties dressed ferocious as feline animals. That's why w e wear towels instead of
uniforms to school.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As accounted for by another girl in her class, the many parties they had revolved around the two B's, Beer and Boys, and also seemingly food, as the parties were renowned for causing munchies, which in my mind brings us to not alcohol, but another drug as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the first page in this article, there's a picture of a pretty young Christine, who is noted as being a cheerleader. In another censored picture, members of presumably the cheerleading team are wearing playboy bunny outfits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheerleaders: First Row: H. Huelsman, C. Blasey, S. Outman. Second Row: W. Cutting, L. Havener, W.
Hookman, E. Mason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Teachers wrote this of her in the yearbook:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Chrissy managed to accumulate enough Fridays to keep her in detention for two trimesters;"
       </p>
       <p>
        "The tenth grade taught us h o w to party
also; and Martha Mispireta usually provided the circumstances in which to do so. Celebrating her sweet sixteen
or just the weekend, Martha managed to entertain her guests with her hospitality, her pool (after
descummification), and her erotic male dancer; the latter, in his gold G-string, being by far the most effective."
-Another classmate.

       At this point, all I have seen is decades old photos of some young girl, and "recent" pics of some blonde that looks like it could be the same person. Can anyone say for certain this person really exists? Makes me wonder if we're being distracted from something.
