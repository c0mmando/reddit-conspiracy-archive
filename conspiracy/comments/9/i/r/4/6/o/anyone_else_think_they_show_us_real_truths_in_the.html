    <div class="md"><p>The problem I have with this is that the examples given are usually based on the interpreters biases. Convinced the cdc is going to wipe us out with a plague? Then you&#39;re likely to believe that Contagion is predictive programming.</p>

<p>If you are a David Icke fan, you&#39;ll probably think that V, or the upcoming Captain marvel movie (which I&#39;m assuming features the subversive shape shifting Skrulls) are predictive programming</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with the idea, I just don&#39;t think we can actually know which ones are actually predictive for sure</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, I don&#39;t doubt that they do this. It&#39;s just that you are more likely to assume a film is predictive programming when it fits the narrative that <em>you</em> expect the elite are pushing, and will think nothing of films that <em>don&#39;t</em> fit what you think the elite are promoting. Meanwhile, it could very well be that you&#39;re <em>100%</em> off, and the actual message they&#39;re pushing is subversive enough that you are completely off. So to some degree, it&#39;s an exercise in futility to try to figure out which movies are propaganda simply because you&#39;re almost guaranteed to be wrong, or at best, can&#39;t know for sure when you&#39;re right</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shane Black&#39;s &quot;Mandarin&quot; in &#39;Iron Man 3&#39; and Spielberg&#39;s &#39;War of the Worlds&#39; suggest Hollywood is in on the Joke.</p>

<p>Steven Spielberg&#39;s reaction-to-911 movies were &#39;Munich&#39; and &#39;War of the Worlds&#39;...WotW directly references Welles&#39; radio play &quot;dramatizing/faking&quot; an alien attack that, as the story goes, was taken as real by many people.</p>

<p>Later, he had set-up a very dramatic &quot;crashed airplane&quot; display at Universal Studios Tour which looks like a crashed airplane--highlighting the lack of crashed planes in the Sept 11 drama.</p>

<p>‘War of the Worlds’ also featured these ideas:
&quot;They (perps) were here&quot; (not foreign to USA)</p>

<p>In the extras, Stephen is quoted as wanting the tripods to have a heavy, realistic gait indicative of their great mass. The tripods as they appear in the film are ethereal, lightweight &quot;nonphysical&quot;. </p>

<p>When does a director like Stephen not get what he wants?
He is, in fact, referencing the ethereal, lightweight &quot;nonphysical&quot; planes shown on television on 911.</p>

<p>From ‘a View to a Kill’, 1985:</p>

<p>Max Zorin is pumping sea water into the San Andreas Fault, something Tanya Roberts declares is &quot;extremely dangerous&quot;.
 (fracking…causing earthquakes)</p>

<p>I have also posted that the early &quot;actual nuclear bomb&quot; footage was made by MGM:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment checked me better than I have experienced in a long time.</p>

<p>I posted yesterday about how vocal contenders are re-educated or killed. My tagline was &quot;witnesses re-remembering!&quot; It was your notice that urged me to tone down what is, actually, a very sobering aspect of the intimidation used.</p>

<p>Having said that, I do think there is a &quot;I want credit!&quot; aspect to the governor&#39;s shows. Like they play details just to flaunt their talent.</p>

<p>A documentary on photographer Harry Benson (RFK and MLK killings) displays one of MLK&#39;s minions <em>holding a jar of blood!</em> Had to tilt my hat to that.</p>

<p>I know there is a real world out-there. Frank Zappa said that when the sets and curtains are put away, you will see the brick wall at the back of the stage.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind the brick wall. Hollywood also has the hero crawl out of the sewer and see the sunset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently there&#39;s a cut scene where Tom Cruise walks past a room with signs of a Satanic Ritual , (Pentagram, candles etc) , but this was cut from the movie. No actual proof of this, but it was leaked by some insider who got to watch the original pre-cut footage. I haven&#39;t seen the film in a while but I remember Tom Cruise has a shocked expression directly after this scene (which wasnt cut) and that is why the theory has more weight </p>

<p>This does seem plausible though, because its only a short scene and no sacrifices or children etc. If someone wanted to make up info about cut footage from this film (which is fact that it exists) then you&#39;d think they would ham it up to make it more sensational. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like Eyes Wide Shut. Original version was only shown to Executives and main cast. Kubrick died before official release, nearly 30mins were cut out after his death. The hallway scene near the end of the movie is the most likely part that would&#39;ve been cut. (Possibly the showing or idea of their young daughter being tortured/killed or more as incentive to not speak up)</p>

<p>Kubrick was also known to continue adding and mastering even after the executive viewings.</p>

<p>Now is this intentional as if David Chase (the creator) knew this was going to happen? I&#39;ve had experiences as a writer that have been pretty wild in terms of picking up on future events. Writing something into a story about a specific place and the same thing happening a few weeks later.</p>

<p>Artists live in a non-linear, out-of-time, trippy place in the brain and I think they pick up on things unconsciously and put things into their art , not knowing it&#39;s connected to a future event.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see... Westworld, Fallout 4, Altered Carbon, Detroit: Become Human, Almost Human, Deus Ex, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Ex Machina, hell I&#39;d even count Logan, with its weird engineered wolverine clone, cool prosthetics, and self-driving vehicles. </p>

<p>Radical life extension and augmentation is coming...but only for the mega-rich. As bad of a movie as it was, Elysium is likely our future, mixed with a little Interstellar-style climate desparity and food security issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or it&#39;s no more complicated than the fact that science-fiction has ALWAYS looked at the current technology of the world and then expressed our fears/worries/dreams about the future.  </p>

<p>If you look at ALL of science fiction, you will find that it DOES sometimes accurately portray what is to come (microwave oven, cell phones, tablets). It also equally FAILS to adequately portray the future (even going as far as Frankenstein or Jekyll and Hyde, which ARE science-fiction stories).  </p>

<p>Currently, we are most definitely coming to a place where robots, A.I. and synthetic replacements of body parts are possible. So there&#39;s nothing -conspiracy related- to the idea that sci-fi will create stories about such things.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s no different than the giant spat of &quot;nuclear explosion creates monsters/mutations&quot; stories from the 1940&#39;s and 50&#39;s. And yet THAT wasn&#39;t the future that happened.  </p>

<p>So claiming that it IS predictive now is failing to understand the past.</p>
