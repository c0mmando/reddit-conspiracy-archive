      <p>
       I’m a professional poker player who has written a book that teaches you exactly how to think through poker decisions. When this book was finally complete, I realized that I had accidentally mapped out the way in which all beings think through all decisions. I had uncovered a secret strategic formula which is built into the everyones mind!! I also realized that not being consciously aware of this formula is the cause of all mental distress. Perhaps even more importantly, I realized that this same problem is sucking all the profit from our society. And whats worse of all, is that when I explain this formula to anyone, their mind vehemently rejects the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something very similar to cognitive dissonance is experienced whenever I explain this stuff to people. Basically, this is THE rational thought-process, and if anyone has come to trust in any kind of irrational strategies the two things cause conflict in the mind. What this means, is that when I come to explain how this rational thought-process works everyone goes completely insane. They will do anything they can to discredit the rational-thought process so as to protect the strategies they have come to trust. I’ve been trying in vain to push this logic in the poker world for a long time, and I have got nothing but laughed at, shouted at, and hounded with abuse. I’ve given up on poker players now, but I’ve tried talking to psychologists and mathematicians with much the same results. These people don’t just try to discredit this information, they also, for the same reasons, mindless try to promote the opposing strategic-formula. Something we poker players call Game Theory Optimal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever seen a film called “A Beautiful Mind”? In this film a guy called John Nash, with the help of apparitions, finds an unbeatable strategy we call Nash’s Equilibrium. When applied, most strategists realize that this strategy sucks the potential for profit from the game. They realize that it grows exponentially. This thing is like the anti-game. Is sucks all the profit out of a game, spreading from player to player, until the game is destroyed. This thing is dark. It is also worshipped by economists, businessmen, politicians. Strategists of all kinds. They do understand it pretty clearly, but they don’t realize that it is always an irrational strategy to apply, which means that learning this strategy stops them from being able to strategize naturally. When they can no longer strategize naturally, they see little else to do but use Nash’s Equilibrium more and more. Game Theory Optimal, the unbeatable strategy, is ridiculously trustworthy, and this sends the psychological problem into overdrive. When I explain this thought-process to those who study Nash, they literally rip off my head and spew down my throat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake, this problem is huge. I’ve read economy textbooks which describe those who use don’t use Game Theory Optimal as arrogant fools. They are teaching that shit to kids!
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know what to do anymore. All I get from anyone in any associated field is irrational abuse. I have been called crazy about a billion times, by people who are clearly being irrational! I mean, this information is huge, I feel its my duty to tell everyone about it, but I am getting no-where. Perhaps you guys will be able to help get this information out there?

       I don’t understams if Game Theory Optimal is the opposite of your strategy (as this quote seems to say), or if it’s your strategy. I’d say it’s the opposite, as the Nash equilibirum is a fundamental aspect of game theory.

       We poker players call the two types of strategies GTO (Game Theory Optimal), and exploitative. It's the exploitative strategy which we naturally use, and GTO is the opposing strategy... Mate, it took me 5 years to write this book and I only released it this year, but here, take a free copy...

       Sorry mate, I did mean that I'm happy to share, but do be aware, this thing was really hard to write! It's precious to me, and does hurt to give it out for free. It took me about 1 million drafts to organise all poker theory into these "Levels of the Mind". (please see link below)

       Think about it this way: if your book gives insight into the way propagandists reason and act, sharing this knowledge made the word a better place.

       I'm interested, but I feel like you need more room to describe this phenomenon. (Or, if there's a video that describes it more fully, kindly point me that direction.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like you're describing truth vs illusion. And poker is an interesting analog. Can one be successful playing only rationally? The whole point is trying to get an edge on the other guy by projecting and detecting "tells". If everybody just played the math, you might as well flip coins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I definitely thing we have, in western society, gone waaaaaay too far to the illusion side of the equation. Everybody's making themselves out to be something they're not. And it's been industrialized, weaponized, turned into a genocide machine.

       If everyone were using this GTO, Game Theory Optimal, you might aswell just flip coins. This rational thought-process is how we take advantage from the opponents irrational behaviour. You can use math instead to calculate your advantage, but this is the natural way to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that everyone thinks 'wrongly' of themselves, and I think all Buddhist lessons seem to be based on this. In this formula, which is split into Levels, Level One is about ourself. Everything else comes from that. I've linked a copy of my poker book in this thread, please do read away.

       i know exactly what you are talking about, but DO NOT THINK ABOUT IT. don't believe everything in your head, because knowledge is circular, or in another words, it has now right or wrong. that is why in the bible if you use the tree of knowledge , your brain, you will be cast out of the garden of Eden, but if you the tree of life, your heart, you will be closer to heaven. people have to listen to their hearts, but it is hard these days when everything around you makes you use your head, so you stuck thinking logically. when you are thinking or doing something if you get the feeling in your heart then you know that you are doing the right thing. so you will find out that all this political mess and science doesn't matter at all and you just want to be at home with your kids playing Legos saying fuck you to all the news. because all that matters is my family not what fucking gender people want to be called. Stop think people, please and be with your families. you might miss your opportunity.

       The Buddhists say that if you fully understand what is good and bad, you will go beyond heaven, and become something very similar to a God. Which is exactly what that angel told eve when he convinced her to eat from the tree!
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think your right, and that you can just follow your heart. I think that is a far easier way to reach the same place as the Buddhists shoot for. However, I dont think it's a bad thing to think rationally either.

       i think you are right also. you are going to use logic no matter what and everything can be view as good or bad if you think about it enough. i am saying be in touch with your heart because that will tell you if you are doing the right thing, the good thing. now these days it is impossible to not use your brain, just feel down below and see if you heart is agreeing. its called being in touch with your feelings. something i believe people are lacking these days.

       Basically, it's split into Levels...
      </p>
      <p>
       Level One does not actually relate to the mind. It relates to the strength of our physical attributes. Things like our cards, and our chips. Our hands and our feet. This is the last thing we always consider during a decision. What we are going to do with ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Level Two is about the opponent. Or, the external object. At this Level we compare the strength of our opponent to ourselves, before choosing what to do with ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Level Three is about the opponents perception of our strength, and the opponents/objects reaction to our actions. At this Level we learn to deceive the opponent and control their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Level Four is all about defending against the opponents attempts to control us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each Level serves to enhance the last. And each Level is divided into timeframes. When reacting to the opponents moves whilst making a Level Two decision, we use the past. At Level Three we start using the future. At Level Four we consider our next move, after the future has come about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Level Infinity, or the highest possible Level, is actually GTO.

       Right, but what does this specifically have to do with game theory and with predictive calculations. My understanding is that the point ultimately is not only to predicate a reality, to establish a reality and then observe the behavior of a subject and compare such behavior to pre-established or predicted outcomes--proceeding and refining from there.

       Well, game theory is defined as; "the science of rational decision making in humans, animals and computers."
      </p>
      <p>
       This entire decision-making model matches almost exactly any other game theory decision-making model you will find. But they all miss-out pieces of the puzzle.

       Well, I really don't wish to take anymore of your time, but would you say there is, let us say, an algorithm for evil? Since this latter is by its very nature both contagious and repetitive (not that evil alone is so).

       Yeah, I think there is, but I think you'll get a much better answer from a Buddhist monk than you will from me. I am just a poker player.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Buddhists are very good at giving shape to things that we dont usually consider to be tangible. For instance, they describe the exact cause of fear, hate, and anger. They explain the results of these emotions and how to prevent them from affecting you. It seems to me that Buddha cracked this algorithm for evil, but I'll be damned if I know it.

       The downvotes are interesting but don't worry about it. Many people are resistant and close-minded, and also it is slightly off topic as there is not really a conspiracy any where. 
Thanks for the book, looks promising and I will give it a read as I am also a Poker player and find something inherently wrong with GTO and more of an exploitative player.

       Okay, I read the book but can't agree with your implied conclusion, applied to society in general. GTO, if I have this right, is Truth without deception. It destroys the Satanic game of deception that enslaves us. If this ruins the game for our controllers, well, they can move on to another game. Perhaps poker.

       Alignment with truth and virtue is what gives us power, removing our vulnerability to lies and sin. Combine enough of us into the super-organism of Christ... this is the second coming, how Satan will finally be defeated. I believe it is inevitable. Perhaps not in our lifetimes, but I have hope.

       Well, mate, I know all about the second coming. Someone with my name once said that he was the messiah reborn. Yadoula is my real name, it means "Hands of God" in Persian, which is an awesome name for an English poker player, but also seems to fulfil both Buddhist and Muslim prophecies regarding this messiahs new name. Add to that the strange string of circumstances that led me to feeling like I've both uncovered a madness that plagues society and found the cure. Then add to that my relatively simple plan to overcome all of societies financial problems with a simple website. AND, to top it off, when I fed the Fibonacci sequence into the diagram I made for this mind map, then laid said diagram over Pascals triangle, I felt like the resulting image showed how all existence is born from the mind, and the bloody thing was shaped like a tetrahedron! Which they say will be closely associated with this messiah. I definitely dont recall any visits from archangels lol, but these coincidences are enough to drive a person insane!
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, funnily enough, I have always thought that this GTO is like the devil himself, but I also always seen it as the pinnacle of all knowledge. I dont know if it's good or bad in the end, but it definitely seems dark as fook to me.

       Is it rational to keep attempting to change the minds of others who are firm in their belief systems and don't seek such change? If you know that all you'll receive is defensive reactions, abuse, and perhaps on occasion a violent reaction, is it a rational decision to keep forcing the issue?

       I honestly dont think so, if it isnt helping anyone and is only causing stress why bother. Thats why I decided to stop pushing this stuff on poker players etc.

       Wisdom is hard earned, and usually comes by trying things in our relationships with people, places and things. I learned that my desire to have others think like I do was rooted in a resistance to the cosmic aloneness that is existence in a bubble of awareness (we don't really know what's going on outside of our senses--we can only listen to stories about it--that may or may not be true).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once I accepted the cosmic situation, I started letting people believe what they want. They come into awareness, perhaps tell me some stories, then leave.

       Looks interesting. I hear there's a book about motorbike maintenance that speaks of a lot of these things too. I do mean to check these books out, but have very little time nowadays.

       The guy it's about, Stafford Beer, was one of the original thinkers in operations research &amp; decision-making.

       Chile was doing something wild with computers (&amp; his guidance) in the early 1970s:

       I lost credibility cause you think I'm doing something clever??

      <p>
       I assure you mate, giving a book out for free is not a clever way to sell books lol. I do hope to make some money from this eventually, but only through consultation work after I pick up a couple of nobel prizes. Before then, I need to teach everyone all the things I've worked out.

       Then why are you so secretive about this? I read your posts and it seems like you're deliberately hiding away the core of what you are trying to say here. I barely understand what this is all about.
