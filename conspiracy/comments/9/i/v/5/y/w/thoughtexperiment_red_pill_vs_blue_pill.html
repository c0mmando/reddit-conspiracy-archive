        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Imagine you are in the shoes of Neo from &#39;The Matrix&#39; when he is offered the choice between The Red Pill vs. The Blue Pill.</p>

<p>Scenario 1:</p>

<p>If you pick The Red Pill you will awaken to the Truth of the world regardless of any preconceived convictions.When you make your choice, you have no idea of what the truth is that you are waking up to. It could be something like The Matrix, but it could be something else entirely. It could be a frightening &#39;negative&#39; reality, or it could be a freeing &#39;positive&#39; reality, or it could be something that transcends the notions of positive and negative. You have no way of knowing before you make your choice. All you know is that it is the Truth.</p>

<p>If you pick The Blue Pill you will awaken the next day knowing nothing of the choice that you have just made, and continue your current existence. You will never feel the burden of questioning your reality and it will become easier for you to achieve genuine happiness and live the rest of your life in content.</p>

<p>Scenario 2:</p>

<p>Same as Scenario 1, but if you pick The Blue Pill you will awaken the next day with a winning lottery ticket for 1 Billion $. No strings attached and you are free to do whatever you want with the money for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>-What would you pick in each scenario?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I need a little more to go off of than “the truth of the world.”  Is this a material truth or a psycho-spiritual truth?  Is this all encompassing truth or just the beginning of something to get the ball rolling?  What will this truth ultimately enable me to do?  “The truth of the world” is just way too broad to make a value judgement against something as concrete as a billion dollars.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not trying to argue what the Truth is, just that given the situation of knowing the reality you live in is in some way an illusion or not based in truth. Just like the situation Neo is presented with in the movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still though, in what capacity is the world supposed to be an illusion in this scenario?  Metaphysical? Geopolitical? Psychological?  Historical?  </p>

<p>There’s some truths that are more valuable than any amount of money, while there’s some that I really can’t do anything with.  Knowing that human history is largely fabricated won’t do me much good compared to a billion dollars, whereas understanding fully the human condition and what causes human suffering is vastly more valuable that money.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the idea is that whatever the Truth may be, it is inherently uncertain. It may be whatever you can think of, or something else entirely. It could be something metaphysical or spiritual, or the complete truth of human history which may have been rewritten. Whatever you can conceive of. </p>

<p>But when you make your choice, you don&#39;t have any way of Knowing what the Truth may be, so you have to choose between an uncertain Truth, vs. Certain illusionary outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so from what I gather from your clarification, it’s gonna be something roughly as paradigm shifting as Neo’s realization in the Matrix.  It’ll change how you view life and the totality of your life’s experience up until the point of taking the pill.  </p>

<p>Idk, that’s a lot to pass up.  I still have to wonder though, if there’s no guarantee that it’ll enable me to find inner peace better than a billion dollars, then why walk away form taking the billion?  With a billion I know exactly what I get and the extent it enables me to live my life stress free and walk my own path towards finding truth and happiness.  With this truth bomb, it could end up jumpstarting a level of understanding otherwise not attainable in my life time, or it could just be largely irrelevant to what I consider meaningful in my life, even despite the fact that it’ll probably rock some fundamental assumptions I’ve had for my entire life.  </p>

<p>For me personally, I’m driven to make money so I have freedom.  Not because I want an extravagant lifestyle.  That’s how I live my life, so it’s no wonder I’d have a hard time turning down total economic freedom.  I view it as a necessary condition to reaching the most valuable truth.  </p>

<p>For the other option, it just sounds pretty underwhelming compared to the mystery truth, so I’d probably take the red pill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting and yes the idea is that the Truth will fundamentally change your perception and view of reality, it could be that you are a slave on prison planet earth, it could be a truth about heaven and hell, or that reality is a simulation from a higher dimension, or that you perhaps are a god having a dream of living a human life. Whatever you can conceive of and then more possibilities.</p>

<p>I find it interesting how a lot of people tend to go for the uncertain Red Pill when you know that reality is an illusion,  and The Blue Pill is just continuing life, but when given certain wealth within the illusion, then it becomes a much harder choice to make.</p>

<p>Of course in reality the distinction might not be that easy to make, but given the scenario of having to pick one or the other, we seem susceptible to being paid off with material wealth, even if we know that it is just an illusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same way. I always wondered what the point of that scene in the movie was, because i thought it was an obvious choice that everyone would make.</p>

<p>But after presenting this to some friends i was really surprised at the responses i got. A few were blue in scenario 1, but almost all the rest went blue in scenario 2.</p>

<p>Although i do think this subreddit is probably gonna be way more biased to the Red Pill than the general populous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i don&#39;t want to get into my own opinions based on my own truth-seeking experience here, but i do think the answer to this question is very determining of how people make a lot of unconscious decisions during their life.</p>

<p>What makes people take the Blue Pill? Is the Red Pill inherently better than the Blue Pill? What would happen if all of humanity took the Red Pill? Are there different &#39;levels&#39; of Red Pills? Those are questions that may lead to interesting answers for another discussion :)</p>
