       I was watching a Kitchen Nightmares Video on YouTube. An ad played about how immigrants take jobs away from hard working Americans. It was so direct and actually blamed immigrants for taking jobs away. What kind of people would create this kind of ad? Im posting here because I've also seen other ads on how slavery was encouraged by democrats and how President Lincoln was a Republican. People know that political parties change overtime. I feel like theres an agenda behind all this. im just wondering what you guys think.

       As a center-left leaning person, I see him more as a center-right leaning. But to each their own, I suppose. I also see from your post history that you are far right of center, so maybe from your perspective, you're correct.

       You know the old saying?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you’re not left leaning in your 20s, you don’t have a heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you’re not right leaning in your 30s, you don’t have a brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find this to be very accurate. When you’re young and in school it’s very idealistic to lean left, but as you get out of school and get a job, maybe start your own business, work really hard to be successful, and see others that are just milking the system, while you’re spending 15 hours a day working your ass off and you’re watching all of your hard work taken away to support social programs for those who have made their own choices.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are exceptions to this, and there are people who were just dealt a shitty hand, and for sure we should always help out fell man, but at the same time there is a limit to taxes, and social programs that are actually not really helping as much as enabling.

       It’s not about “changing views”, it’s about growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you still have the same views when you’re 25 as you did when you were 15, you didn’t learn from your mistakes and experiences. That’s really all that life is about, leveling up through XP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not really talking about major fundamental moral issues, I’m talking about political, spiritual, etc. It’s all relative and as you grow and learn things like this are bound to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone who has had the same views their entire life just never grew up.

       So will dumping toxic waste over the area or just droning people walking around the area. That doesn't mean that it's a good idea or even effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants come here on valid visas and over stay their welcome. Don't see how a wall will do anything for that. And why aren't you folks yelling about the first lady breaking immigration laws &amp; using chain migration to bring her parents over?

       if we could dig a massive moat and fill it with sharks (fitted with lasers) I'd be 100% down. Mass amounts of people simply walk across the border, this in undeniable fact, and we want to put an obstacle there. we already have the land, because we were supposed to put up a fence at one point.

      <p>
       I'm also 100% better Visa enforcement, maybe put tracker chips in worker visas.

       It's election season again. I'm getting a ton of conservative ads for politicians. My favorite is the one blasting a woman for saying she'd abolish ICE. Wouldn't most of Youtube's hyper vigilant leftists agree with that?

       As a center-left leaning person, I see him more as a center-right leaning. But to each their own, I suppose. I also see from your post history that you are far right of center, so maybe from your perspective, you're correct.
