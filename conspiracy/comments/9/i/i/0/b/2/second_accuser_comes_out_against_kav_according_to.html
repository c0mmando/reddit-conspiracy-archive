<p>I agree that it would be naive to expect anything less than a shitstorm after accusing a Supreme Court nominee (especially within the context of today&#39;s politics) of sexual harassment. But I can&#39;t speak to her state of mind or her experiences - all I can do is make a judgement based off of evidence, evidence we won&#39;t have unless an investigation is performed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes BUT.<br/>
Anyone can make an accusation for something from decades ago and there is no way to easily disprove that. I think the timing of these accusations is intentional, the claims have been discredited by more people than have supported them, and it&#39;s only a ploy to indefinitely delay until they get someone in office they like.<br/>
This is also hardly a swift vote, this SCOTUS appointee has faced more scrutiny and vetting than any other. Ever. Must we only elect and appoint Jesus-types? Is anyone really that righteous and pure? As we get further into the digital age more and more candidates and nominees will be scrutinized death. You almost have to plan on running for office since kindergarten so you don&#39;t try to kiss Sally on the swing set. She could remember in 50 years and ruin your fucking life. What if little Sally felt like she was in danger? Who&#39;s to disagree? That&#39;s aggravated sexual assault.</p>

<p>I can’t see any point to it other than political. If Kavanaugh is not confirmed because of this, that’s when we’ll know if they are true or not because, if they were made up, they’ll let it die out. </p>

The goal is to delay the nomination until midterms when Dems think they will regain control of Congress and then can reject any appointment, and then hop they win in 2020 when they can get their own judge in there. It&#39;s a good strategy I guess, albeit underhanded and of questionable legality. Accuse ANY appointment of sexual anything or racist anything. How could it be dispelled? It can&#39;t.</p>
