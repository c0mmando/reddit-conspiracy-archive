        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-09-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/axolotl_peyotl.html">axolotl_peyotl</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, I want to apologize to the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community about how this was handled.</p>

<p>The <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team is proud of our cohesiveness, and we are proud of our transparency, and this incident called into question both of these mandates.</p>

<p>We have public mod logs for a reason...we had no intention to remove <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">/u/illuminatedwax</a> without first informing the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community.</p>

<p>However, as stated in previous threads, the removal of a top mod can be a long process, and we started that process several months ago.</p>

<p>We did <em>not</em> anticipate that a &quot;bug&quot; would remove wax <em>and</em> the rest of the mod team.</p>

<p>Now, much noise has been made about my actions after this bot&#39;s alleged mistake, namely that I didn&#39;t immediately invite back the rest of the team in the same order.</p>

<p>The reality is that inviting the team back, and having everyone accept in the same order, was going to be all but impossible (everyone has to be online at once which can be ferociously difficult to coordinate).</p>

<p>A similar situation actually arose less than a year ago when ex-mod SarahConnor unilaterally removed the entire mod team except for me and IW. </p>

<p>While I appreciate SC&#39;s passion and believe his intentions were good, that was <em>not</em> the way to go about it, especially on a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> sub. </p>

<p>As a result, getting the mod list back into the proper order required intervention from the reddit admins, and they removed SC as well, as this type of &quot;rogue&quot; moderator behavior is not tolerated, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Because of this previous experience, it was clear that we were going to need admin help again to restore the proper order of the team.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I suddenly found myself as the <em>only</em> mod of a 700k-strong sub, and it was approaching midnight my time. It was clear that I couldn&#39;t go to sleep until <em>at least</em> one other mod was added again, as one can only imagine what would&#39;ve happened while I slept.</p>

<p>After checking the modmail, I invited back the mods that were active recently and then immediately stickied the announcement about what had happened.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the sticky attracted the attention of several other mods, and by the end of the night I had re-invited all of the mods back to the team who were currently active in that thread. With about half a dozen or so added back, I felt comfortable enough to finally go to sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning we immediately enlisted the help of the admins and they restored the list to the proper order, just as I had anticipated.</p>

<p>In addition, they apologized for what was apparently a mistake caused by a bot, and indeed they even thanked us for finding the bug!</p>

<p>Granted, I&#39;m <em>well</em> aware that the optics of this transition are extremely poor (this <em>is</em> a conspiracy forum), and we&#39;ve been working overtime to mitigate some of the damage.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I&#39;ve prepared for instances like this after becoming accustomed over the years to receiving all manners of abuse and threats hurled my way. This time it was no different, as a trifecta of threads at <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a>, <a href="/r/drama">/r/drama</a>, and <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> collectively called me a psychopath and were viewed tens of thousands of times.</p>

<p>Indeed, I received numerous threatening PMs and threats to doxx, not to mention the outright vitriol brimming from those threads.</p>

<p>Out of respect for the admins, I&#39;ve waited for permission to share the screenshots of our interactions, as they should overwhelmingly corroborate everything I&#39;m telling you.</p>

<p><a href="https://image.ibb.co/nEBt1p/aiwyhbfjhs.png">The first image</a> documents my formal request to have IW removed.</p>

<p>To remove an inactive top moderator of a large sub like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, the rest of the mod team must demonstrate that they made a good faith effort to contact the top mod.</p>

<p>In addition, the mod team must vote on a &quot;requestor&quot; to assume the top position after the removal. As the #2 mod, I was unanimously voted to be the requestor. </p>

<p>In the screenshotted message provided, I documented our vote for me as the requestor, as well as a thread detailing all of our attempts to contact IW.</p>

<p>As an aside, we&#39;ve been attempting to contact IW for <em>years</em>. The last time he wrote a comment in our sub was in 2013. We <em>needed</em> his help when SarahConnor went rogue, and he wasn&#39;t there, requiring us to go to the admins.</p>

<p>Just so we&#39;re clear: <em>the admins don&#39;t want to deal with moderator drama.</em></p>

<p>For those who claim IW was a &quot;failsafe&quot;...he demonstrably was not.</p>

<p>The reddit admins are not in the business of dealing with moderator spats, and having an inactive top mod had already forced them to act.</p>

<p>For the benefit and future prosperity of this sub, the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team needs to demonstrate both cohesiveness and independence from the admins, <em>especially</em> now that certain &quot;controversial&quot; sub are apparently on the chopping block.</p>

<p>To return to the first image, I was genuinely surprised to learn that I had permission to use the &quot;redditrequest&quot; function to have IW removed.</p>

<p>Because &quot;redditrequests&quot; can often take days and even weeks for the admins to act, I assumed my request was going to be no different. In fact, I was in the middle of drafting the announcement for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that we had formally made the request to remove IW. </p>

<p>Instead of taking days or weeks, this bug <em>immediately</em> removed IW <em>and the rest of the mod team</em> and I found myself in a very difficult position. </p>

<p>Although I had no clue what had happened or why, the one thing I was sure was that I was going to be viciously attacked (and boy was I ever).</p>

<p><a href="https://image.ibb.co/mwRbMp/nlkjinasdklsjn.png">I&#39;ve received permission to share this screenshot</a>. </p>

<p>I really, <em>really</em>, hope this satisfies the skeptics. I recognize how poor the optics are here, and I&#39;m doing everything I can to be as transparent as possible.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to lie: I&#39;m not pleased that I was put in this position. Yes, uncomfortable experiences (and personal attacks) come with the terrain, but this seemed unprecedented in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>I also apologize for the locked/deleted threads pertaining to these issues. Now that SRD and their ilk have started to move on, the &quot;noise&quot; should start to subside, and hopefully the attacks will too.</p>

<p>Having thicker skin is one thing, but simply standing by while thousands of people call you a psychopath is another thing entirely, <em>especially</em> when they&#39;re accusing you of something you demonstrably <em>didn&#39;t</em> do.</p>

<p>Please let me know if I can help explain things any further.</p>

<p>While much of the damage is already done, at the very least I can still offer this explanation for those who are still paying attention.</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and much love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of it, I&#39;m sure is the conspiratorial nature of this subreddit and the fact that suspicions arise whenever such things happen. This is natural, to an extent and suspicious activities should be questioned, the community should remain vigilant.</p>

<p>But this particular situation, which was so minor and such an obvious slip-up, that created an atmosphere where axolotl has to defend himself in the third or fourth thread, was a provocateur&#39;s dream come true (as any such slip up would be).</p>

<p>If you want to totally undermine the trust of a community and especially its moderators, look no further than to make every slip up by the team into a conspiracy of epic proportions, link the drama from every other sub imaginable - and astroturf it into oblivion. Downvote everyone that disagrees with you and create a brigade so obvious you can see it from Earth&#39;s orbit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I can only imagine how frustrating the last few days have been for the mod team. I have a follow up question on the mod list that I hope can be addressed here. Since IW was removed for inactivity this question pertains to another mod who appears inactive. The mod is Amos_Quito. This mod has not made a public comment in 8 months. Did this mod respond to the remod request, or were they added back by admins? Can you verify that this mod is still active in private subreddits? If you can&#39;t verify recent activity will the mod team also be removing this mod?</p>

<p>Thank you for the transparency. </p>

<p>The admins restored the entire time, including AQ. </p>

<p>AQ was last active about a month ago and if I recall correctly requested some time away from reddit, which we all need every once in a while!</p>

<p>This hasn&#39;t been formally discussed by the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team yet, but I would think that somewhere around 6-12 months of inactivity would be grounds for removal.</p>

<p>IW, who hasn&#39;t even written a comment in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for 5 years, certainly qualified for removal.</p>

<p>Please respond directly to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ve been attempting to contact IW for years. The last time he wrote a comment in our sub was in 2013. We needed his help when SarahConnor went rogue, and he wasn&#39;t there, requiring us to go to the admins.</p>

<p>Just so we&#39;re clear: the admins don&#39;t want to deal with moderator drama. For those who claim IW was a &quot;failsafe&quot;...he demonstrably was not.</p>

<p>The reddit admins are not in the business of dealing with moderator spats, and having an inactive top mod had already forced them to act.</p>

<p>For the benefit and future prosperity of this sub, the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team needs to demonstrate both cohesiveness and independence from the admins, especially now that certain &quot;controversial&quot; sub are apparently on the chopping block.</p>

<p>Or even just making a sticky explaining intentions when those intentions were being decided and asking for community input.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you read my OP, you would learn that I <em>was</em> in the process of announcement our intentions to the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community, as I was under the impression that IW&#39;s potential removal was still weeks away.</p>

<p>I had anticipated my official redditrequest would generate <em>considerable</em> discussion, and that there would be a detailed discussion about it over the following days/weeks.</p>

<p>In addition, we were waiting for the go ahead from the admins, which we only received a few days ago.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are correct, IW sorted that out...but that was <em>over 5 years ago</em>. </p>

<p>IW has been inactive since then, and when he was needed in the same scenario last year he was no where to be found.</p>

<p>Because the admins expressed their displeasure at having to rectify that situation resulting from an inactive top mod, that&#39;s when the dialogue among the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team began in earnest to petition for his removal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This event was shady</p>

<p>This is the normal route for requesting subreddits and it is a markedly <em>public</em> process.</p>

<p><em>That</em> thread is what triggered the &quot;bug&quot; and removed all the mods.</p>

<p>AFAIK, there are two ways to take over an &quot;abandoned&quot; sub and/or remove an inactive top mod.</p>

<p>The first is fairly informal: go to <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a>, make sure all the rules apply to the subreddit you want, and submit your post.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a> FAQ: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The time to process a request may vary depending on the current backlog and workload of the admins. In general a grace period is given to allow inactive moderators ample time to object. There will be times when the admins have other issues which are a higher priority than the posts in this subreddit. Please be patient!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, there&#39;s a second <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/top_mod_removal">more formal process</a> for removing the &quot;top mod&quot; of a sub. </p>

<p>In this scenario, the entire existing mod team must demonstrate a consensus that the top mod needs to be removed for the benefit and well-being of the sub. </p>

<p>In addition, proof must be shown that a good faith attempt was made to contact the moderator in question.</p>

<p>I provided the screenshot of this message to the admins, which included all of these prerequisites. </p>

<p>After about 3 weeks, I was given approval by the admins (which you see in the 1st screenshot) to instead pursue the <em>first</em> option...which was was unexpected.</p>

<p>In this scenario, &quot;There will be times when the admins have other issues which are a higher priority than the posts in this subreddit. Please be patient!&quot;</p>

<p>Since we had already been fairly patient, I was anticipating an even longer wait, and indeed what might prove to be a ridiculously contentious thread (me requesting <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>!).</p>

<p>So I followed the direction from the admins and started an <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a> thread. Because this was the final approval we were waiting for from the admins, I also proceeded to go announce to the sub that the process of removing IW had begun and that folks could weigh in the public <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a> thread.</p>

<p>I assumed this process would take at least a few days.</p>

<p>Instead, we were hit with the aforementioned bug, the request was proceeded immediately, and I went into very confused damage control mode.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve spelled it out really well here, please let me know if I can clear anything else up.</p>

<p>So you had months to speak to the community and just <strong>didn&#39;t</strong> even though you <em>intended</em> to do so. How many sticky threads did you post in those months? Why couldn&#39;t even just one have been what you <em>intended</em> to tell the community?</p>

<p>Also, we genuinely wanted to give IW an actual chance to respond before going &quot;official.&quot;</p>

<p>Hence the 3 month waiting period for IW to respond. We have no ill feelings toward wax, and it was a courtesy to wait as long as we did (3 months wasn&#39;t necessary).</p>

<p>Again, there was no reason to make the announcement until we were <em>sure</em> IW was truly, and for all intents and purposes, permanently AFK. </p>

<p>Once it was clear that IW wouldn&#39;t be responding, and once we finally got the go ahead from the admins, we had planned on making the announcement.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this &quot;bug&quot; occurred along with all the ensuing drama.</p>

<p>I hope this clears things up.</p>

<p>Yes the optics didn&#39;t look great.  But clearly you had no intention of pulling a coup on your fellow mods, and I fully believe your intentions were noble.</p>

<p>I was also impressed by how you handled the endless personal attacks and those reactionary subs who attempted to paint the picture that this sub had lost confidence in your leadership ability. I don&#39;t think I would have been as passive as you were about it, and locking threads is hardly an overreaction.</p>

<p>Anyone who saw a user who hasn&#39;t been active for as a failsafe, or important to this sub, despite not answering the mods calls for help is just not being genuine or sincere.</p>

<p>It was clear to me on day one that all of the other mods supported you, and weren&#39;t in the slightest concerned or upset with you, at least publicly. Kudos to you on your handling of your first major incident in the sub after becoming the top mod.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my original point, time to inform the community about a unilateral action, not to gather opinions about that action. Which, regardless, didn&#39;t happen. They started the process months ago, even if it was a unilateral action they could&#39;ve said &quot;Hey, we&#39;re gonna remove IW if he doesn&#39;t respond in the next 3 months&quot; and people would&#39;ve been satisfied.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Removing the top mod, allowing someone that a large part of the community considers untrustworthy (not necessarily myself, but that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t know AP&#39;s reputation among some of the users here), all without informing the community is people&#39;s problem here. I don&#39;t believe it has been sufficiently answered, unless you consider the answer &quot;Well, we were going to tell you guys but we didn&#39;t&quot; a sufficient answer. </p>

<p>Where do you see that information, because I just re read all of AP&#39;s submissions and nowhere does it mention they voted for a successor, only that they all reached out to IW individually.

<p>And I didn&#39;t say a community vote would&#39;ve been a good idea, what I&#39;ve been saying is when they decided that IW was inactive and they were going to make moves to remove him from the mod list (by reaching out to him, discussing his inactivity), the community should&#39;ve been informed. I&#39;m not saying the community should&#39;ve had a say in the matter, if you&#39;re that against it you have a right to speak on it, but having IW as top mod and no one else was an opinion that was held by many users here, and I have no doubt in my mind the moderation team knew that was true. The reason people are upset is because the moderation team here prides themselves on &quot;transparency&quot; and the last several incidences that have involved the mod team did not have that at all.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about trying to contact them, it&#39;s about transparency, which is what people are upset about. The fact that action was taken behind closed doors towards something that some in this community see as a bad thing is the issue. If an announcement was made, no one could say this looks suspect, and those crying about transparency from the mod team would have nothing to say.</p>

<p>My feelings towards IW as top mod were geared towards hopefulness, as I&#39;ve always hoped we as a community could have regular &quot;elections&quot; held to appoint/remove moderators. My personal opinion about IW being there was that he should&#39;ve been removed, but in an ideal world, it would&#39;ve been where the community feels comfortable relinquishing the control the top mod spot has to someone that they feel they can trust, or at least a majority of them. Based on some of the opinions I see on AP, I don&#39;t feel like the community supports him as much as they should considering the control he gains by being top mod.</p>

<p>I know it really seems I have a bone to pick with AP, but I really don&#39;t have an issue with him. My issue is that I know a large part of this community does, so while this very well may be in the best interests of this subreddit (I don&#39;t think an inactive top mod is a good thing), I also feel that the trust the users put in this moderation team could&#39;ve been increased via more interaction with the community regarding this decision.</p>

<p>I understand that argument, and that seems to be the other side of this discussion. I mean, there&#39;s not really more data to flesh out about it. Either you&#39;re okay with the timeline, or you&#39;re not, and both opinions are just as valid in my opinion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Apologies, I meant when you said it would be a bad idea considering the current climate of the sub, I wholeheartedly agree. I meant more in a perfect world, kind of a pipe dream of mine that I don&#39;t see ever happening considering the state of Reddit as a whole.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Neither do I, but the point I&#39;m trying to make here is in line with the same idea as that. It seems half this sub sees an opportunity to compromise IW as a threat to delegitimize the sub, while the other have sees AP as the threat to delegitimization himself and that IW was the only thing protecting that top mod spot. I personally feel that the second half, those who feel AP is a threat, would have much less of a leg to stand on if an announcement was made, but at the same time I see your point on the IW account&#39;s ability to be compromised if so.</p>

<p>All in all, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re wrong at all. I think both sides of this argument are well founded. </p>

<p>Very true, and I may very well be wrong on the amount of people who have an opinion on this matter, but judging by the scores on these posts that AP has been making on the subject, I think I&#39;m at least close. Seems like a lot of them sit around 50% upvoted.</p>

<p>Very true, I agree on all points, we could&#39;ve seen the &quot;miraculous return&quot; of IW and a slew of Reddit friendly policy, absolutely.</p>

<p>I definitely see the argument here. Maybe I&#39;m being too optimistic about the benefits of transparency, but I still believe, at least as far as unity of this sub, an announcement would&#39;ve helped with the fracturing we&#39;re seeing. </p>

<p>Hard position to be in, and I do not envy the position, but I can&#39;t help but think there would&#39;ve been a way to both inject the community into the discussion without compromising the possibility of that account being compromised/throwing shade at IW. I personally don&#39;t feel that a lot of the flak you get is warranted, but at the same time I feel a lot of this mess could&#39;ve been turned around to increase faith in the moderation team that some in this community direly lack.</p>

<p>I mean, there are maybe two or three moderators I trust. I reached out to one recently about something I felt was happening amongst the community here involving external academia approaching conspiracy theorists about unpopular opinions. I think faith in the mod team is important, and I find it unfortunate that this particular situation is now piling on to reasons as to why other people have no faith in the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods.</p>

<p>I feel like this issue should&#39;ve been looked at as a community issue, not an issue with the moderation team. If IW had been compromised had an announcement been made, I feel confident a lot of people would&#39;ve caught on to that. But, I can&#39;t tell the future, and I can&#39;t rightfully say what would or wouldn&#39;t have happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. A mod that mostly posts political news (in the wrong subreddit no less), asks genuine conspiracy theories to go to another subreddit (which is poorly named, I can&#39;t even recall the name) AND makes the claims in OP. </p>

<p>What could go wrong? Just the marginalization of genuine conspiracies and the dissolution of a strong cohesive community where theories could thrive. </p>

<p>What do we get instead? &quot;Some politician&quot; said &quot;something&quot; in &quot;media&quot;, dozens or even hundreds of times a day. Specially if a genuine conspiracy is taking hold and is being discussed in earnest.</p>

<p>I&#39;d bet good money that r/conspiracy will continue to be marginalized and people who speak up will get banned and removed. Others will be &quot;gently&quot; &quot;persuaded&quot; to go somewhere else so this subreddit can be used to further propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your not wrong, it changed. During the presidential election with pizzag and WikiLeaks tons of people posted the political conspiracies coming out. Around the time they coined fake news and started the Russia collusion/Trump stuff is when the narrative in the sub changed. Older members already didn&#39;t like that typical conspiracy theories were buried, not to mention conspiracy theories (like flat Earth, lizard people, ect) were being used in the media to discredit those wearing &quot;tin foil hats&quot;. However, when the narrative changed, it just became anti Trump. I used to look through controversial for posts. Now it just is what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt it would be good for anyone if someone actually went digging and presenting stuff found.</p>

<p>So instead I will make a prediction.</p>

<p>Not long from now genuine conspiracies (that are not political posts) will be firmly asked to post in other subs. Mods will call it something like &quot;post in the appropriate subreddit for your conspiracy theory. R/conspiracy is for general/daily conspiracies that does not have a specific subreddit.&quot;</p>

<p>Later on mods will start handing out warnings and soon enough bans for &quot;not appropriate subreddit&quot; when posting certain conspiracies (todays example: posting Pizzagate stuff).</p>

<p>Slightly after that, or perhaps at the same time, r/conspiracy will be another MSM location where only narratives of the same are allowed.</p>

<p>Taking bets?</p>

<p>Feel free to peruse <a href="/r/todays_politics/">/r/todays_politics/</a> without fear of being censored in any way, shape or form for your own political posts and feel free to encourage others to do the same. Lets get daily politics and news thereof off of this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This thought process that daily happenings can&#39;t be conspiracies is wrong. I would venture to say most conspiracy theories unravel over months and years.

<p>We need to be able to keep an open mind to all conspiracy theories political and otherwise because in all likelihood they tie together in some manner through the bigger picture. Not everything can be true, but at least here there is awareness. Now we just need to find a way to not bog everything down by tons of political posts or be required to do that elsewhere.</p>

<p>There was also a sticky thread (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9cw9jk/a_dedicated_subreddit_for_nonpolitical_conspiracy/">this thread</a>) asking people to move to that sub to post their conspiracies (that was not politics) - WITH Mod approval! - suggesting political content is a-okay on r/conspiracy.

<p>What does that have to do with anything? Should subs not direct users to similar subs they might be interested in?</p>

<p>The thread specifically says for users to continue posting interesting content to the main conspiracy page. They weren&#39;t asking people to only post on the new sub. This was posted by an ex mod who wanted to get more posts on this new sub, specifically for the woo woo conspiracy stuff. What a great idea. That&#39;ll make it easier for people to see posts on woo woo stuff in their feed. If people did as he directed, there would still be woo woo stuff on the main page, too. You&#39;re making this something it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The fact that people here aren&#39;t buying this narrative you&#39;re pushing shows that they demand evidence over impulsive confirmation of their biases and emotions.</p>

<p>God damn bro, really? The real manipulation on this sub is well documented. It comes from TMOR and obvious liberal shills. For a time we had an influx of T_D posters shoving their bullshit down our throats, but they seem to have gone away. We&#39;re left with the same astroturfing experienced in the rest of the website. Some conspiracy to make <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> more about politics is not part of that.</p>

<p>Since reddit admins are the only one who can see the <em>actual</em> metrics of voting on this site, there&#39;s unfortunately no way to ensure an &quot;open source&quot; vote is &quot;fair.&quot;</p>

A that time vote manipulation was not as prevalent and the current mod team decided to prevent new users from posting because of wait for it.... SHILLS! I have been around on boards long enough to know you dont change rules for shills and like I said vote manipulation as not as apparent. I had faith in the voting system and saw a team of fucking kid nubs shadowbanning and removing posts they liked and as a mod on other conspiracy sites I saw reddits model as unique and raw. I find it odd and funny what has happened here sarahconor did the same as I did. I am not super religious but &quot;when the queen is a whore the ladies in waiting will fornicate.&quot; AO is a shill opp and has done nothing but damage. I dont care about who they are this is an empirical evidence observation. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The same motivation I had when I did it back in the day when sadly no one fucking remembers I was modding this place from day one with IW and AO and other one day after the boston bombing started shadow banning anyone with dissenting response. No reply to this will mean I am still shadowbanned but yes sarahconnor and I talked we did the same thing for the same reason to protect the sub and prevent mods from over modding like i have seen since day one of internet. OLD FAG HERE SORRY I ACTUALLY SEEN ENOUGH TO KNOW SHIT TRIED TO HELP AND WATCHED THIS PLACE GOTO SHIT OVER A DECADE&gt; THE REAL DONBUENO IM OUT FUCK WHY ALL CAPS STILL BAD AT INTERNETS</p>

<p>Your actions were the opposite of what has happened here. You (just like Sarah_Connor) demodded the other mods without warning, to gain personal control of the sub. Conversely, the current mod team have acted according to the rules, with plenty of warning to IW and <strong>in unison</strong> to remove a single, inactive mod.</p>

<p>The current mods want <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to be a forum where conspiracy ideas can be discussed without being drowned out by the anti-conspiracy mob mentality which pervades the rest of reddit.

<p>You answered most of my questions these past few days and although I&#39;m still very suspicious of the mod team I appreciate your effort to communicate and your attempt to communicate in a civilized manner with me. You have two mods however that are doing a terrible job representing the mod team and helping shape the perception (that I have) that you guys have stolen this community and are using it to push some agenda. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="/u/Sabremesh">/u/Sabremesh</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>You should be ashamed of your behavior toward me, and the entire mod team should look to this as a lesson in how NOT to behave toward a member of your own god damn community.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Sabremesh accused me of being a concern troll:  &quot;<strong>Your constant &quot;expressions of concern&quot; about the sub are coming across as disingenuous.&quot;</strong> This was in response to me pointing out that axolotl locked the thread he was saying people were welcome to participate in.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>And then accused me of making things up, which I haven&#39;t, and given me a &quot;final warning&quot; for what I don&#39;t know. Are you going to ban me for being suspicious of you guys? <strong>&quot; The bullshit is coming from you. You clearly know very little about the sub or its moderators, and you&#39;ve been making shit up to fill the gaps. No more warnings.&quot;</strong> No more warnings even though this was my first &quot;warning&quot; for being legitimately concerned. Also when I asked for an example of me making something up, one example, no answer was provided. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>By the way this happened in a post which was removed by the mods. Nobody notified me my post was removed, I just suddenly couldn&#39;t find it. Not sure what Rule 10 is as with the new reddit layout I can&#39;t find the rules. I wonder if Rule 10 is no posts that complain about the moderators?</p>

<p>My first red flag with you was when you responded to me by saying <strong>&quot;Your paranoia and fears are unfounded.&quot;</strong> No explanations, just calling me paranoid and telling me not to worry about it. Then through the comment chains linked above you say things like <strong>you didn&#39;t know you needed to ask the community to remove the top moderator and replace him on your own.</strong> You respond at one point to another person with, <strong>&quot;Reddit is not a democracy, fam.&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>TO THE ENTIRE MOD TEAM: You need to find a way to run this sub without accusing everyone that disagrees with you and your decisions of being a shill or a concern troll. You need to find a way to run this sub that incorporates the community. You can&#39;t have such a leadership shakeup and then go &quot;Whoops, we didn&#39;t know you guys would want to have a say! Oh well, reddit isn&#39;t a democracy anyway!&quot; At the very least, you should have announced a day or a week beforehand that you were going to be removing the top mod and replacing him with a vote taken behind closed doors with the mods being the only ones given a vote. Then you wouldn&#39;t be shocked to find out we would like a voice.</strong> </p>

<p>tbh we were kind of expecting wax to reply. There would be no reason to remove him if he would just literally give any sign of life, and therefore there would be no reason to announce his pending removal to the community. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why we gave him 3 months.</p>

<p>In actuality, he&#39;s had longer than that. When SarahConnor messed up the mod team last year we all immediately reached out to wax. When he stayed silent we resorted to contacting the admins, which simply shouldn&#39;t have been necessary.</p>

<p>So IW has had about a year to respond. That&#39;s way too long when we&#39;re dealing with a constantly evolving and growing sub like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not at all, you have a right to be skeptical.

<p>I know it&#39;s easier too look back and decide on appropriate actions in hindsight, and I&#39;m not trying to come at you personally.

<p>It&#39;s just a major event, and I&#39;ve been around long enough to remember Wax actually being here from time to time, or at least responding to messages, and to see the whole thing go down in this shady way is unfortunate for all parties involved imho.</p>

<p>If you felt the need to: remove wax as top mod; felt transparency was important; felt the mod team only wanted remove him out of utility for the sub; and felt like you wanted to wait for Wax&#39;s response; then I think it&#39;s quite clear that some kind of sticky about &#39;The mod team&#39;s decision to remove wax as top mod&#39; and the decision to &#39;wait 3 months for a response&#39; would have sufficed.</p>

<p>After the 3 months had past, you would then post another sticky with an update stating that you had not heard from Wax, and would be submitting the request.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Top mod should not post or comment on threads on personal bases  . Top mod should only make mega threads , sticky and answer why a thread was locked or post removed . The more personal stuff posted and commented  by top mod (and i think other mods to ) the less impartial  you look . If they want to post have a similar known alt that is known as  alt and threads they comment on and not to be mod by them . </p>

<p>Other mods should keep personal stuff out of posts . I see at least 2 mods on here regular baiting people who they do not agree (one particularly after changes like this acts like a spoilt brat bragging about others lack of power to change things ) .in the past with one mod baiting people into braking rule just to ban them  . </p>

<p>Lets be honest but for a conspiracy  sub you would expect info to be open and mods allocation to open . but this will never happen with secret mod and friends group who make all the decisions and they way changes have been made over the last few years . Lets be honest but its kind of funny how changes and actions   have been made last few years in conspiracy  sub couldnt  be more shady and fit right into a  conspiracy  to control information :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If i see the green title or mod next to a name posting it makes you think about disagreeing with there opinion  as ive seen people ban for almost nothing . If mod position were  voted on then they have earnt the right to post freely as they have met the standard of what people want . What are the rules to become a mod here. What are the rules to stay a mod here . Maybe if the process was more open there would be less worries when things like this happen </p>

A mod becomes a mod, one hopes, because they have a respected voice in the community.  And what&#39;s the point of reddit if not to discuss things?  Seeing a green title reminds me to follow the rules and be respectful rather than spiteful whether I&#39;m responding to a moderator or not.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the yawn part is that all the people removed were okay with the censorship used what we all now can easily identify as concern troll which was that I was some crazy dictator but in reality look at the record I never edited shit or removed anything because wait for it THERE WAS A VOTING SYSTEM and the whole reason these nubs made ridiculous rules was SHILLS and the boston bombing im sorry we were blowing up then what seems more sketchy than an mod removing the ability for anonymousish people posting that was the lifeblood of this place. Could i have been more democratic sure but that would have only led to a bunch of back and forth when in reality at that time we had a system to use and it belonged to the users NOT THE MODS. no regrets I claim old fag and seen shit like that go done on many forums that was my chance to do what i knew was right and save the children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t post here normally, but when I moderated a large subreddit, it took us several years to get illuminatedwax demodded, it took multiple mods from different subreddits communicating constantly to finally get it to happen. The reason for this is if the admins see any activity on the account within the last 3 months (even just logging in) they won&#39;t remove the mod.</p>

<p>What users don&#39;t understand is that IW doesn&#39;t actually do anything, he doesn&#39;t respond to messages or even post, he just logs in every once before the 3 month window so that the admins cant remove him as a mod.</p>

<p>So, why is this a good thing?</p>

<p>IW was/is top moderator on several large subreddits, he has the ability to remove every mod below him/ shut down subreddits. Its not really a great thing for one person to be able completely shut down reddit.</p>

<p>Your experience with demodding illuminatedwax in another sub exactly corroborates what we&#39;ve been saying. IW has completely ignored <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> since early 2013 - no modding, no comments, no modmail, no answering PMs from the rest of the mod team that they should step down due to inactivity.</p>

<p>but are we as a community really that incapable of functioning without mods</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, reddit requires that subs are moderated, <em>especially</em> subs with contentious content like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>The moment reddit admins (aka employees) have to start moderating content on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> (not their job) is the moment they likely decide to simply delete this sub.</p>

<p>A healthy, active moderating team is essential to the future of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

I&#39;m often caught replying to posts that I feel are a bit low-effort, in that I think there can be opportunity to get a little more &quot;scientific&quot; with our conspiracy documentation - as compared to &quot;curated.&quot;   An example would be a simple text post that says &quot;9/11 was done by the old guard in the Freemasons in order to inspire a new war-machine for the future.&quot;  With no links, no archives, no other real meat.  </p>

I find the erasure equally complicit in the matter, had I or anyone interested, been able to get a grip on exactly what those subjects the &quot;shill&quot; is brigading us with, we&#39;d have a much clearer sense of which subjects are organic and which are artificially planted.

    <div class="md"><p>Just have to say, as a 6+ year subscriber to Conspiracy... <strong>It&#39;s ridiculous to me the outrage people continue to have with Axolotl</strong>, after the continued logical explanations and openness about the recent situation... <strong>But also the general outrage toward Axolotl over the past couple years</strong>.  Some of you are acting as if they&#39;re a traitor, when in reality they have been the most constant and steadfast mod and member of this board that I can think of.</p>

<p>To the best of my recollection, I have never once seen Illuminated Wax post a single damn thing, or step in to moderate anything.  Why would ANY sub want a leader THAT invisible and inactive?  What purpose does it serve to hold on to a relic of ancient times, completed devoid of any value?</p>

<p>Axolotl has been a steady contributor FOR YEARS, in the sense of providing thought provoking, well-researched, and meaningful posts, that increased the value of this sub by magnitudes. Sure, there may be some exceptions depending on your political beliefs, but regular posts like the roundtable discussions, or original articles with fascinating research about humanoid-manned airships in late 1800s (if I recall correctly) or 1900s, or counterfeit bearer bonds of ludicrous values and strange design (I believe Axolotl posted my first learnings of that topic)... <strong>Those are the types of things core to this sub!</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s unreal the flak he&#39;s getting, and further unreal how calm, even in his outbursts, he&#39;s been relative to all the shit-slinging, unjustified distrust, obvious brigading and trolling  from outside subs.</p>

<p>Nobody&#39;s perfect, and shit happens, but god damn, some of you people need to relax and do some critical thinking, especially if you haven&#39;t been around here for years.</p>
