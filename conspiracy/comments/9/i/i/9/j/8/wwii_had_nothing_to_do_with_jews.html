       Hitler and the Nazi regime wanted more power, money, and control. They burned their own reichtag in a false flag attack in order to achieve it. Elderly, children, and black people who weren't jews were also killed, because the truth is they were going after everyone and not just the jews that they used as an excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, people who want to harm others will invent any excuse, and listening to them is entirely and completely wrong. As there is no reason to intentionaly harm anyone, because even our enemies deserve justice and a fair trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying that Hitler was after the jews is doing exactly what hitler wants you to do. There is a way of telling history that educates the public correctly, which is to say that 6 million innocent people died due to lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any other way of telling history makes the biggest victim group (in this case the jews) play the victimization card, when in reality it was all about power, money, and control based on lies with a complete disregard to human lives, like it has always been. Telling history while listening to the aggressor leads us to the place where we are today.
      </p>

       Jews need to understand one thing: the messiah has already arrived, and his name is Jesus Christ. He is the instructor: "If you don't have sword, sell your cloak and buy one" (Luke 22:36) because he knew this is the time his followers will be threatened. But at the same time reminded us to defend ourselves wisely (i.e. with the intention of stopping the enemy), because as he profoundly said: "Love your enemies" (Matthew 5:44) as even our enemies deserve love. Christ is the redeemer, the son, the King of kings, and the spirit of the law.

       I feel like it's the best historical documents we have from that time period. No Genesis isn't to be taken as science, but Jesus the man did exist and did have a massive following and it did upset authorities and the message of love and salvation was clearly powerful enough to spread across the world and over millennia. Interpret it how you will, but I think Christ is real and his sacrifice is salvation. If not, at least it's a record of the area in the era

       So your rational thought process tells you there is no God?  How did you reach that conclusion?  How do you know what happens after you die?  I’d love to have your confidence in not knowing.  I’m sure this Jesus fella was written outside of the Bible too.  Meaning there may be some truth to it.

       lol what?  So you can’t do one without the other?  You can LIVE and still wonder about life after death.  In fact it shows our intelligence as a species that we CAN think about it.  The truth is nobody has the answers.  But well done for avoiding every question.

       I dunno what you mean by bullshit.  I really think Jesus’ teachings are good for the world.  I do agree it is man made though, but in that case God goes beyond man made religion and that’s what I’m interested in. But to say everything is bullshit is dumb because nobody knows.

       It's pretty fair to say it's bullshit because none of it makes sense or is realistic, i.e. walking on water, people living until 200 some 900. certain things in the bible are easily disproven with basic science. now, with that being said, I don't thing it's bad as philosophy. my problem is that the book and it's followers claim that it has a connection to the creator of the entire universe. I don't buy that part.

       i can see where you're coming from.  i'm conflicted because there are parts of the bible that read like pure fiction, noah's ark, but then again i look deeper and i think that some of the miraculous stories could be analogies for something else.  i dunno, maybe people weren't very good at explaining shit back then.  they didn't have the knowledge we have today, thanks to science, and maybe the way they wrote it was the only way they knew...

       science is great but sometimes people /atheists  can be annoying and preachy with it, much the same as bible -bashers, relying too heavily upon science as the answer to all life's questions.  i think science can only go so far but there is still that huge question of why and nobody can answer it.  it's so intriguing. that's why i don't fully understand atheism.  that's why my beliefs are
       <em>
        beyond
       </em>
       christianity and the bible, bc that
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       written by man but it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       have some truth and the new testament esp is good foundations for civil countries to live on.  i think.  and since reading about Jesus i've definitely felt more connected to the universe and asking the
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       , so i think that connection does exist...just in different ways

       If you say "WWII had everything to do with jews", you create victimization groups that will start behaving paraoid, like the state of israel of 1947.

       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)">
        First used to refer to speakers of a common language and then to denote national affiliations, by the 17th century the term racebegan to refer to physical (phenotypical) traits. Modern scholarship regards race as a social construct, that is, a symbolic identity created to establish some cultural meaning. While partially based on physical similarities within groups, race is not an inherent physical or biological quality.

       Just because race is a social construct, it doesn't mean it can anything. Otherwise, americans are a race because they are united by their history, Italians are a race because they are united by their language, Christians are a race because they are united by their beliefs, and woman are a race because they are united by the way they are diverse from men.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that's retarded. Gender, nationality, culture, and religion are defined terms already. Race was invented to group individuals that share observable traits that HAVEN'T been defined.

       That's false. The bible is about everything in life: wisdom, understanding and knowledge. You can connect everything in life to it. Specially to a moment where 6 million people died. That you don't like it, that's a different story.

       The British Empire was bumping up against the Russian Empire in Afghanistan and Tibet. The Brits used the Japs to attack Russia in 1907, the Japs won the Russo-Japanese war and this triggered the first Russian Revolution. In WW1, Germany was attacking Russia, and had Lenin sent into Russia by train, but the train car was sealed so there was no way for Germany to give Lenin any instructions (ha, ha, ha), and this lead to the 2nd Revolution, Civil War and the further weakening of Russia. But, Russia pulled out of the war, and Germany lost, so a draw in a sense. WW2 was the rematch, and Russia was severely bloodied, but not beaten. Germany became more a part of the West as a payback for its role. Then, Churchill showed up in Missouri to tell us about iron curtains, and suddenly Russia is a "threat" to the US! This is the Cold War and finally Russia was defeated in 1991.

       Propaganda. They wanted an ethnostate, and they weren't looking to kill anyone just because they were different. The Holocaust is a hoax. Victors write history, and what we have been taught about the National Socialists is a steaming pile of bullshit.

       In 1933 when war was declared on Germany, and with the Jewish trade embargoes being put in place started to hurt a growing German economy. Then factor into that, the former German citizens who had been annexed by Poland/Russia etc. by a treaty at the end of WWI, one that the other party countries did not stick to the terms of. 
 These citizens left behind were being killed and harassed by the "Judea War" against Germany.. Hitler begged for outside help, England and France both turned a blind eye to German Citizens being murdered..
  Hitler called for a special vote of the citizens of Germany, asking if they wanted to help the families left in the annexed areas.. the vote passed with a high margin..
 After Hilter invaded Poland.. he begged for peace over 12 times with England/ France rejecting every one..
      </p>
      <p>
       But of course with England and the Zionist leaders already a party to the Balfour Agreement.. no way that would happen.. In fact. England was promised that if they rejected it, America would enter the war and again, once defeated German spoils would be divided up..
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to ask yourself, If what you said above was true, about hating all races.. why then were so many Jewish/Black/Indian/Arab etc volunteering and allowed to join the German Army?

       I didn't said that they were hating all races. What I said is that it doesn't matter the reason why they hate you, because hating any person is wrong doesn't matter who you are ("love your enemies" Matthew).
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, people who want to hurt you will find any excuse to do it: "Because you're a jew, because you're black, because you're a man, because you're a woman".

       Listening to them only creates victimization groups, which goes to my main point of showing the reason why the state of israel of 1947 (mostly jews) behaves with such paranoia and impunity.

       The Jews had enslaved Germany in debt. That is the entire reason Germans and Jews boycotted each other, which rose tensions and eventually led to war. Plus the fact that Germany had land taken from them in the previous world war that they wanted back.

       I didn't said that they were hating all races. What I said is that it doesn't matter the reason why they hate you, because hating any person is wrong doesn't matter who you are ("love your enemies" Matthew).

       As I said, people who want to hurt you will find any excuse to do it: "Because you're a jew, because you're black, because you're a man, because you're a woman".

       Listening to them only creates victimization groups, which goes to my main point of showing the reason why the state of israel of 1947 (mostly jews) behaves with such paranoia and impunity.

       It's pretty fair to say it's bullshit because none of it makes sense or is realistic, i.e. walking on water, people living until 200 some 900. certain things in the bible are easily disproven with basic science. now, with that being said, I don't thing it's bad as philosophy. my problem is that the book and it's followers claim that it has a connection to the creator of the entire universe. I don't buy that part.
