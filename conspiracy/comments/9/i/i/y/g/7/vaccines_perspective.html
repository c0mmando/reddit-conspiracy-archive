        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I saw a post here that asked us to take a critical view of vaccines. The question was simple, how would you feel if vaccines did cause autism, or are the leading cause of cancer, diabetes, chronic illnesses.  Unfortunately, the answers I saw were appalling because nobody could do it, nobody could entertain the idea that this is even possible, this is on a conspiracy board where every major event from 9/11 to the moon landing is questioned as to it&#39;s legitimacy yet nobody could even comment on this being a reality.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. -Aristotle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I want to re propose this question to you all, how would you actually feel if vaccines were as dangerous as many believe them to be? Would you feel angry? Sad? How would you fight the industry? Your child has started showing signs of a vaccine injury, what would you do? </p>

<p>I want you to actually <strong>believe</strong> just for a moment that these things are true and think and tell others how you would deal with it, or if you&#39;d just roll over and get your next vaccine, no questions asked.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s not a doubt in my mind that vaccines cause problems for a lot of people.  There was something posted on another sub a couple weeks back that stated that the CDC has known since approximately 1989 that there is a huge segment of the population that, upon receiving vaccinations, will develop mitochondrial damage.  Upon receiving MORE vaccinations, autism can develop in those people.  I believe that vaccines also cause auto-immune conditions.  There is BIG money in vaccinations, so we will never get  the truth from the government, the CDC, or anyone else.  I looked at my children&#39;s vaccination records the other night.  My daughter was born in 1988, my son in 1991.  My daughter received 17 vaccinations by the time she was in high school, my son 21.  I believe the vaccination schedule now has infants/children receiving upwards of 70 vaccinations by the time they reach high school.  And no one sees a problem with that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a response I posted to someone on another thread. </p>

<p>No because it wasn&#39;t as bad in the early years. It is not necessarily the vaccines themselves individually that are the issue. It is the fact that when I had my vaccines 30 years ago I received about 12 total vaccines in my first 5 years of life spread out throughout that time. Thst wasn&#39;t the exact schedule at the time but my mom intelligently decided to spread my shots out even though the schedule back then was significantly lower than it is now. NowS babies ONE MONTH OLD TO FIFTEEN MONTHS OLD receive over 26+ vaccines. That is the issue. There are too many shots given at one time, too early and too consistently in such a short time frame. I&#39;m not against vaccines completely. I am against a &quot;for-profit&quot; government agency spending 4 billion dollars on vaccines from big pharma while holding several patents on vaccines. I am against dick pills having stricter regulations and safety protocols than the vaccines we give our babies. I&#39;m against the CDC saying it&#39;s about public safety first when in fact profits come first. I&#39;m against 26+ vaccines given to babies in the US in less than 1 year and half when other countries with &quot;healthier&quot; babies give 15 or even 12 vaccines in the same time period. I&#39;m against the CDC not giving any good reason as to why they refuse to do a study on vaccinated children vs unvaccinated children even though private public funding has been offered to cover the cost. I&#39;m against using outdated technology and adjuvants for our vaccines when we could easily use part of the 715 billion dollar military budget to start creating new technology that would be safer and healthier for our children. These are our children and they deserve our very best and we arent coming close to doing that.</p>

<p>This is what needs to happen. </p>

<ol>
<li>Increase vaccine safety regulations ( right now, dick pills are more strictly regulated than vaccines are) THERE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NO REASON NOT TO MAKE VACCINES THAT WE GIVE TO OUR CHILDREN THE MOST HEAVILY REGULATED &quot;MEDICINE&quot; IN THE WORLD AND TO SAY OTHERWISE IS BULLSHIT. </li>
</ol>

<p>2a.Perform real studies by independent 3rd party on vaccinated vs nonvaccinated children using the gold standard randomized double blind placebo controlled study because well these are children and they deserve our very best </p>

<p>2b. Keep the study, the scientist involved and the participants secret until end of study so no one can be bought. This has still yet to happen and in fact the cdc plain old refused to do it even though private funding was offered. Nothing to see here folks.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Vaccines should be produced and manufactured by a true non-profit organization. Not a for-profit government organization like the CDC who spends 4billion dollars a year on vaccines from big pharma and who holds a large amount of patents on vaccines. Big pharma should not be allowed to produce vaccines.</p></li>
<li><p>26-40 vaccines given to children in the U.S between 1 month old to 15 months old is extremely excessive and damaging to their immune system and brain and is significantly higher than the schedule of vaccines given by other countries (12-15 vaccines like part of the Netherlands) who have significantly healthier children than the U.S. I wonder why they have healthier children?</p></li>
<li><p>Completely kill any lobbying for more vaccines. Yes big pharma has actual lobbyist that push for more and more unnecessary vaccines.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>6.Make vaccines about health and not money</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Take at least 100 billion away from the completely unnecessary U.S military budget of 717 billion dollars and invest that in new up to date technology for vaccines, create a new delivery system, one without aluminum adjuvants and completely get rid of our outdated dangerous vaccine technology.</p></li>
<li><p>Go after all of the big pharma companies that have willingly and knowingly poisoned our children and adults with their tainted vaccines over and over again.</p></li>
<li><p>Dismantle the specialized court for vaccine injury </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This should not even be up for discussion. These things should already be in place and the fact that they are not shows how shady and shitty all the people involved in vaccinations are. We have no issue spending billions on military and trillions and trillions on war but when it comes to real studies and vaccination safety we are greedy and wayyyyyy too lax. It&#39;s disgusting and disturbing.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also read that it is estimated that less than 1% of adverse vaccine reactions are reported to VAERS.  Most doctors and nurses don&#39;t know about it, and the ones who do are afraid to use it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing I am questioning is why is there so much effort put in the anti-vaccine movement. I have an idea some of it is promoted by the ag chemical producers to distract from their own products. </p>

<p>The rise in autism is more closely aligned with the introduction of the GMO to be sprayed with Round-Up than with vaccines.

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you&#39;re just straight up denying vaccines cause harm instead of looking at it from how I asked.  I just want you to pretend vaccines are bad even if that goes against what you believe, view them from how that &quot;anti-vaxxer&quot; would, find the worst possible thing in them and how would you deal with it? You might find them more understandable, you don&#39;t have to actually believe it, it&#39;s just to assess and view them through a new perspective.  </p>

<p>This is a critical thinking test, not a way to prove/disprove vaccines.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Always happy to see people starting conversations on even the most “taboo” (in the mainstream at least) subjects.</p>

<p>Instead of answering your question however, I just want to point out the overwhelming opposition to even talking about the subject. It seems like, especially on mainstream Reddit, people rip on “anti-vaxxers” all the time while I see absolutely nobody advocating against the use of vaccines. I never questioned vaccines until I saw the overwhelming hatred and intolerance for even talking about the possibility of harmful side effects. (To be clear, I don’t have a position either way) </p>

<p>It seems like there is a coordinated effort to suppress these kinds of conversations and it has made me very skeptical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure, honestly the majority of &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; are just ex-vaxxers who have been ostracized from the community for daring to question their <del>god</del> science.  These people ask questions, bring books and articles and studies to their doctors and are met with nothing but hostility when they are curious and simply wish to understand the medicine they are injecting their day 1 old baby with, who wouldn&#39;t want to research that? </p>

<p>I personally attribute the rise of &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; to pro-vaxxers, their hostility and hatred towards anyone who so much as believes in an alternative, delayed, or even selective vaccine schedule.  If you were researching the science and asked the experts and were attacked and called a crazy lunatic and being called a child killer would you say &quot;Oh yeah, you&#39;re right I&#39;m a child killer, I better stop&quot;, no you&#39;d tell them to fuck off and dig your heels in further.  </p>

<p>I think a lot of the vitriol comes from the fact that Vaccines have removed several vicious diseases from humanity that we have seen the resurgence of, because of Anti-vaxxers. Measles, didn&#39;t break out 10 years ago. I also have no doubt that there may have been .001% of the population that was affected by a vaccine that caused some form of &quot;X&quot; because their anti-bodies responded in a &quot;different-than-usual&quot; fashion.  </p>

<p>Take a look into the relationship of vaccine adjuvants and the epidemic of peanut allergies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I read a great article on this awhile back, but cannot put my finger on it atm.  However, the logic is solid.  Apparently peanut oil was used as an adjuvant in vaccines in the 1980s.  It is also scientifically known that introducing certain proteins intravenously can cause a person to have an allergy to that protein.  </p>

<p>So, think about the quality assurance processes of nearly 40 years ago and the probability that the peanut oil used in vaccines may have not had ALL of the proteins scrubbed/filtered from them.  All it takes is for one rogue protein introduced into the bloodstream and BOOM, there&#39;s no going back.  </p>

<p>So, is there a connection?  I absolutely believe so.</p>

<p>&quot;Summary: Numerous studies have demonstrated that food proteins contained in vaccines/injections induce food allergy. The IOM’s authoritative report has concluded the same. Allergen quantities in vaccines are unregulated. Today kids are more atopic. C-section births bias the newborn’s immune system towards IgE synthesis due to sub-optimal gut microbiome [19]. C-section birth rates have gone up 50% in the last few decades. The vaccine schedule has increased the number of vaccine shots to 30-40 and up to five vaccines are simultaneously administered to children. Vaccines also contain adjuvants such as aluminum compounds and pertussis toxin that bias towards IgE synthesis. Given these conditions, the predictable and observed outcome is a food allergy epidemic.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m surprised you had no response and that I missed it. This is the only sub with a large audience that won’t ban you for posting nih and bmj research articles questioning safety and recommendations for vaccines.  It’s like subs like medicine, science, news are all monitored for any content discussing vaccine information, whether well supported or not and banning the OP that is posting. </p>

<p>Frankly there is a lot wrong with vaccines and the organizations that produce and regulate them at this time. One of the biggest is the knee jerk reaction to hide and deny the possibility of risk and harm to the point that ppl are being told outright lies by healthcare professionals.  There is a lot at stake if everyday ppl figure out they have been kept in the dark about known harm by trusted health professionals, and the desperation to stop it comes out as delusional extreme vitriol calling for the death (death!) of anyone bringing it up. </p>

<p>Just think about it.  What other topic creates this disproportionate backlash?  Any health professionals who bring up issues are quickly professionally destroyed. Bill Gates recently ‘bought’ the prestigious Cochrane Collaboration and ppl began to be fired and resign. </p>

<p>If anything this behavior and history of industry corruption should make everyone wary and more suspicious. What are they hiding?  Let me tell you: A LOT.  And it’s easy to find if you start digging. They just count on everybody being so trusting and obedient, as programmed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t critical thinking... this is an appeal to base instincts.  Discussing evidence or theories on any subject can be productive, but this just attempts to make someone feel a negative response and associate it in support of what you believe.  This is how you control a mob.  Aristotle is suggesting you remove feeling and take a clear headed look at something without jumping to a conclusion.</p>
