       I’ve heard this theory a few times. The parents tried to cover it up, either he strangled her or hit her over the head with a flashlight and the mom put her in the basement. There’s a really good Netflix original called Casting JonBenet hag explores different theories!

       There are actually a couple of subs dedicated to that case.

       The only thing I get hung up on is how morbid they went, if that theory is what really happened (the brother accidentally killed her because she was eating his pineapple) I mean, they put rope around her neck, I believe she was found in her underwear, it’s just so morbid!

       Casting JB is okay but is more about the media circus and lasting obsession with the case that followed
      </p>
      <p>
       I also recommend “The Case of: JonBenet Ramsey” aired in 2016. There’s a lot of iffiness about a lot of it but the forensics are combed over in detail by world-renowned experts Werner Spitz and Dr Henry Lee and they come to some very solid conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me after following the case for years I think there’s no doubt it was a coverup by the parents (that ransom note tho, come the fuck onnn), it’s just a matter of who did it and whether it was intentional. As far as general theory goes what sold me on the “Burke did it” angle was his bizarre interview with the ch

       The brother was under the age of criminal responsibility too.  So even if he did it on purpose, all the staging and coverup by the family was more or less unnecessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could definitely see a scenario where the family ultimately admitted to covering up for the brother, but since he wasn't old enough to be responsible they just swept everything under the rug because the family had been through enough already.

       I have walked in on my kids fighting pretty aggressively a few times - and I have been amazed at the things I've seen them do to each other that haven't resulted in major injuries.  The idea that a 9 year old child could lash out so severely that he could fatally injure a 6 year old isn't really that far outside of the realm of possibility.

       Jonbenet Ramsey was lured outside her house by black hat gov operatives who used the norad santa tracker to convince her to come outside her home to meet santa. She was ransomed for the exact amount of money that her father had recently received as a bonus (300k~) -ive commented this many times.

       Right.......just the bonus amount alone could significantly narrow down the suspect list; only so many people could have known how ,UCD it was for.....that’s not something people generally brag about.

       I think it goes a bit further than her brother.  The family were involved for sure.  I think there may be something to do with selling her off to an elite sex ring.  Like Maddie.  But it went wrong.  I’ll find some links and post them on here later :)

       My mom used to be friends with a woman that claimed her husband worked on the case. She always said that the mother found out that the father was raping the JonBenet and one day snapped, decided to take a swing at him with a golf club, hit her (JB) instead, kiling her almost instantly, panicked, then pony and dog show ensued.

       If you like reading, there's a really good book by Joyce Carol Oates called My Sister, My Love, published in 2008. It's a fictionalized version of the JBR story but it's what got me interested in the case. She writes it from the brother's POV. At that time I'd never considered the brother did it, and it really wasn't a popular theory in 2008 (afaik) but she did a damn good job convincing me it was him, and I've thought so ever since. Imo, it was an absolutely  brilliant idea, and she does an amazing job, she sounds 100% believable as a kid on the periphery of a narcissistic, self absorbed family.

       There was an old man who looked like Santa who she knew that she believed was Santa that said he had a special present for her on Christmas. She knew him so it's highly possible she wouldn't think twice about him being in the house believing hes Santa.
