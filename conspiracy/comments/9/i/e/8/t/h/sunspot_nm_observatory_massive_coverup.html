       Does anyone think a massive cover up is happening? A lot of the official reasoning doesn't make sense? They say its because of janitor was possibly trading child pornography. So they close down the whole observatory and evacuate nearby homes AND the post office. Doesn't make sense? Anyone has any conspiracy theories?

       Yep. Child porn makes people not want to question anything. Found an article about the "janitor" talking about a "serial Killer" in the area. FBI says its because his laptop was missing  and started acting weird when they knew FBI was onto him. BUT they also state the reason Local law enforcement and media weren't let in on the reason behind the closure was to to tip off the suspect. As if evacuating the area, bringing in blackhawks, and sealing off the area wasn't enough to let the suspect know something was up. Plus the crew working on the towers?
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think the janitor saw something he wasn't supposed to. Who else would be the one to accidentally stumble upon something?

       Custodial staff have benind the scenes access to almost literally everything - and some even have pretty high-level clearance.  I can spend $1,000 on a single ticket to a Toronto Maple Leafs game and not be allowed to get anywhere near the players, the locker room, or the coaches offices, but the guy with a "Scotiabank Arena" polo shirt and navy blue work uniform pants who makes $31,000 per year is in there multiple times a day.

       Here in the US we have a janitor making 26k who has complete access to the radiology store room here at the hospital.  We have layers upon layers of security for who has access and who can transport and accept the rad controls and isotopes and other rad supplies.  I got there and stumbled in to him cleaning the trash and mopping the floor.  I had to take rad safety classes and get bonded, but this guy making 13ish an hour has complete, unregulated, after hours access.

       Apparently he had said a 'serial killer was on the loose and he was going to execute people' (I'm paraphrasing), that specific string of words doesn't sit right. Executioners, execute. Serial killers, kill or murder.

       Did y’all see the guy whose live-streamed going in there? Showing some left an X-Files DVD in the trash in the view of a window. Either the people live streaming SOMEHOW got into the locked facility OR while evacuating an employee left it there IN VIEW trying to tip off the public. Hoping someone would see it.

       Yup everyone who challenges your opinion is either a bot or a gov. Shill. I’m actually an AI bot. Lol it’s not “shaming” conspiracy theorists, just logically pointing out a DVD in a trash can is hardly evidence of an alien conspiracy

       Did you actually watch the video? it was sitting ontop of an empty can in what appeared to be a lab or  office space of some kind. It was extremely out of place. That doesn't mean it was there for the reasons people in this thread are suggesting but if you actually watched the video you would be forced to agree that it was extremely strange.

       I imagine that with the false flags (and their REAL damage) that if in fact the child porn janitor theory is true, and that the janitor did threaten potential violence or the incidence of such (claiming random but inevitable) that to close down the town with the observatory is reasonable - but to do all that and yet have not charged anyone, in specific, the janitor who they intimate it distills down to - not THAT is WEIRD in my book.

       I think it’s more the circumstances. For instance, when there is someone dangerous on the loose they tell people to shelter in place. I’ve never once seen them tell people to evacuate. (I could be wrong though.) secondly, they say the didn’t tell the media because they didn’t want to tip him off. But they closed down a whole area and brought in helicopters. PRETTY sure he would’ve known by now. ALSO since when is local law enforcement kept in the dark about someone who is accused of trading child porn? Wouldn’t they local LE want to KNOW who to look out for? Just in case he dude tried to skip town?

       "Him" could be us, in a metaphorical sense - the people who are tracking and researching strange news like this (the conspiracy community). They know the conspiracy community is obsessed with Pizzagate and such, which is a problem they'd rather not have, so they call us the janitor, slap a CP label on this thing and drop an X-Files DVD on top of the trash can to troll everyone further. It probably has nothing to do with a janitor or CP, but that's the stuff they wanted to put in your head.

       All of it is super logical to me. I can even believe no one has been charged - the cop in Dallas was just charged today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The part I get hung up on is we were promised "footage." Footage of what? The no action on the sun? Why would footage be relevent here? God knows we don't want to see what human garbage sends around on the internet.

       The USPS spokesperson is also an interesting component. He's been referred to as both Rod Spurgeon and Rod Sturgeon in news stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidently Spurgeon was aware in advance of the closure:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.kvia.com/news/top-stories/closure-of-national-solar-observatory-remains-shrouded-in-mystery/793035021">
        https://www.kvia.com/news/top-stories/closure-of-national-solar-observatory-remains-shrouded-in-mystery/793035021
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Spurgeon also reported authorities walked in without warning and told people to evacuate without being told why. He called the situation strange:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1219922/nm-solar-observatory-closed-authorities-mum.html">
        https://www.abqjournal.com/1219922/nm-solar-observatory-closed-authorities-mum.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The one consistency is Spurgeon stated he did not know who ordered the evacuation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story linked in the comment you replied to goes a whole different direction and says the USPS was closed for other reasons that had nothing to do with the observatory. Neither the reasons or the spokesperson were specified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could be a simple matter of shoddy modern "journalism" with total disregard for basic fact checking in the rush to report first.  Or outright scripted reality journalism.  (It sounds nicer than made up).
      </p>
      <p>
       The USPS lists their current New Mexico media contact as Peter Hass. He is associated with 5 of the 8 officisl 2018 USPS news releases for the region;  the remaining 3 are associated with Spurgeon:
      </p>
      <p>
       9/6/18 Service Suspended for Sunspot, NM Post Office
      </p>
      <p>
       9/7/18 Emergency Suspension for Mescalero Post Office for flooding. Closed until further notice. (Story is linked to a bad date of 3/30/18 on the USPS site).
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't find any flood stories for the area from 07/27 to 9/7.  The next flood warning is listed as issued by the Mescalero Apache tribe on 9/19. Mescalero is 38 miles north of Sunspot. Keep that  number in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/18/18 Sunspot Post Office Reopens
      </p>

       Spurgeon referenced in stories outside the USPS site in September:
      </p>
      <p>
       9/7/18 Postmaster in Yuma, AZ being placed on paid leave and escorted off the premises by postal employees. No information provided regarding why. Yuma is 38 miles west of  Sunspot.

      <p>
       09/13/18  USPS honors first responders stamps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spurgeon had a wild September. Also: new stamps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just sharing the info I found with you guys with my only real conclusion being I hate the horrible fact checking in today's me-first journalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine Spurgeon as being the cleaner from Pulp Fiction. :) "Pretty please. With sugar on top. Clean the f*cking car."

       I noticed that too. Only the local stations reported on the actual closing. It wasn’t until it was about to reopen that bigger stations picked up on it. Obvious media black out/ gag order. Interestingly enough, if you do a. Google search, most headlines say “Observatory closed NOT aliens despite conspiracies...” or something along those lines. But hardly any articles of the whole story will show up.

       A lot of CP has been hit with embedded tracers so they can locate where the perp is. The Fbi ran the biggest CP network as an op... They also did this by making isis videos to distribute to find computers to monitor or locate cells... I bet that an enemy has used this to get into computers. Maybe the janitor ran these through the federal computer thus having them shut down everything on the federal network to do forensics on it. So it just looks like another perv lowlife while being a major data breach, or federal officials were trading CP out of there in a large scale?

       Sometimes I wonder if the story by the guys in black is in reality true but from a synchronicity standpoint something is happening.  The best way I can explain it is the incident is a manifestation of something we don't understand but maybe they do.  They tell the story of the reality manifestation (child porn) but they don't tell the mystery of why it really happened and what happened behind the scene...like an American Gods kind of thing. It is kind of like how some people will see repeating numbers and connect it with something in their life.  This is synchronicity at its most basic level.  Hard to explain...anway just throwing darts in the dark.

       Nice reply but I beg to differ. If we are that sensitive towards information that's because of they way we're constantly lied to. We are able to handle information and no, I don't want to be ignorant

       I'm with you.  The only reason I said this is because I have considered things to the point of making me insane to the point of death.  It is not an impossibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am pissed too.  I am so pissed that I have a hard time not imploding from it.  I suppose I am trying to mitigate my anger by hoping for redemption. But, I do understand your position.  Maybe the idea that we can't handle it is wrong.  Or maybe some of us could but others could not.  All minds are not equal and there are some among us that are extremely sensitive and want very simple things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do feel that revealing an absolute mindfuck to the public as an absolute truth could be more detrimental than you can imagine but that is just my opinion. Try to imagine something so insane that it is stupid to the point of ridiculousness.  Something that would make people feel as if they were meaningless.  That in reality, there is no meaning and everything is just the product of a single mind split into a million pieces endlessly chasing and trying to find a pointless rolling stone through time.

       Again, I bear no shame to say that I'm 100% okay with being meaningless, which we all are. The mere illusions of Humans being a miracle of life, intelligence and protected by some kind of above-all entity are the reasons why people would go batshit crazy about such revelations. They think they matter but they don't, and that's fine. Morals and religion makes us think that way but there's no truth to it, it's all in our heads. They're also the reason why people are playing the deaf game so well too

       Cool man.  I feel like I can handle it too because I imagined it in my head and I imagined some pretty awfully stupid reasons, lol.  Where there are lies there is a web and eventually the web comes undone or somebody tries to hide while they burn it all down and come back after no one knows what happened.  Kind of like the fall of rome I suppose.  I hope you find what you are looking for and keep sharing with us that want to know too.

       It's crazy how information is being driven. Everytime something big happens, we ALWYAYS go through the same steps : original information mixed with different narratives, sometimes awkward details revealed and then denied, then never talked about again. A few days pass without anyone seemingly knowing anything new and then BAM, official narrative flooding the internet, news channels etc. This narrative usually comes with a jab at conspiracy theories and has this happy ending feeling to it.

       I imagine that with the false flags (and their REAL damage) that if in fact the child porn janitor theory is true, and that the janitor did threaten potential violence or the incidence of such (claiming random but inevitable) that to close down the town with the observatory is reasonable - but to do all that and yet have not charged anyone, in specific, the janitor who they intimate it distills down to - not THAT is WEIRD in my book.
