<p>My question (and i am no Trump supporter and i never liked Hillary either) who in the DNC do you think MAY of leaked these emails. Because Russia had nothing to do w/ it. I  say this because they have showed me NOTHING in-regards to ANY sort of solid proof.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think he was the one but who was the reporter (?) that died in a firey car crash? There was some grainy video showing his car catching fire (inside of it?) as it went barreling down the street and crashed. Killing him of course. That wasn&#39;t SR was it?

    <div class="md"><p>There are holes in the official story too. For instance, the 17 intelligence agencies that claim Russia hacked the election point to the fact that somewhere in guccifers data a Cyrillic keyboard was used. If I am a Russian intelligence agent trying to hack the US election, I would make sure not to use a keyboard with the Russian alphabet. It stinks of planted evidence that the us public too dumb to anaylze critically.</p>

<p>Saying the Russians did it is a familiar Boogeyman that covers the tracks of the DNC. You yourself are saying not to believe the leaks because they were tampered. Perfect cover-up of you ask me. </p>

<p>Say the DNC &#39;leak&#39; was intentional. They release enough info to show that Clinton and the DNC conspired against Sanders.

<p>Americans think there&#39;s just 2 sides, left and right. That&#39;s wrong. The real measure is between those that have, and those that don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Clinton isn&#39;t left wing. She&#39;s a warmongering professional politician who knows where she gets her money.</p>

<p>Her job was to insure that she got the nomination, then blow the finish and let Trump in. The media can talk about him doing stupid shit endlessly. If she&#39;d gotten in, the media would have been playing defense and there&#39;d be way too much heat on her. </p>

<p>With Trump in, the media doesn&#39;t even have to try and cover anything up. They can just run the rumour mill and real news gets buried under the torrent of tabloid bullshit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think he was the one but who was the reporter (?) that died in a firey car crash? There was some grainy video showing his car catching fire (inside of it?) as it went barreling down the street and crashed. Killing him of course. That wasn&#39;t SR was it?
