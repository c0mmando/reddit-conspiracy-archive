        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi all. I&#39;ve read this board for years but don&#39;t really post as I don&#39;t know a lot about most things discussed: I prefer just to read and learn.</p>

<p>I read a post the other day about weather modification and found it fascinating. I&#39;d always assumed that weather modification was a conspiracy theory. Until I started reading the other day, I had no idea that it was openly &#39;a thing.&#39; </p>

<p>A couple of things really struck me when I started looking into it:</p>

<p>1) Apparently, weather modification as a weapon was outlawed. However, I was really struck by the theory that weather modification could be used to fight secret wars that the public wouldn&#39;t even know about. This is quite a leap but it just made me speculate about the heatwave that we had in Britain this summer, especially during tensions with Russia. That&#39;s not really me saying that I think it&#39;s true.... Just a musing.</p>

<p>2) There seems to be quite a bit in the history of weather modification where scientists were actively trying to warm the Arctic. This seems crazy now! This could link to one part where they managed to damage 4% of the ozone layer. It sounds like climate change could be less about what individuals do and more about people messing around with weather.</p>

<p>I should be clear that I&#39;ve only read one article so far but it&#39;s the first thing that&#39;s really made me sit up and think &quot;I need to know more.&quot; If anyone has any thoughts or links to good reading on this, I&#39;d be interested. </p>

<p>&#39;cloud seeding&#39; would amount to a &#39;weather modification&#39;, and also perhaps efforts to mitigate climate change</p>

<p>i&#39;ve heard of something called HAARP, which, apparently is an unofficial programme run by the american government which modifies weather</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In case anyone still doubts this is a thing.</p>

<p><a href="http://cwcb.state.co.us/water-management/water-projects-programs/Pages/PermitProgram.aspx">The State of Colorado has a website about its &quot;weather modification program&quot;, telling &quot;cloud seeding contractors&quot; how to apply for permits.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://cwcb.state.co.us/water-management/water-projects-programs/Pages/%C2%ADWeatherModificationProgram.aspx">Here</a> is the weather modification program&#39;s main page.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Colorado has conducted weather modification operations and research since the 1950s, and a program to permit weather modification has existed since 1972. After the significant drought starting in early 2000, many new WM permits have been developed. Colorado is a strategic state with the headwaters of eight major river basins, and downstream states are reliant on the snowpack and stream flow generated in Colorado</p>

<p><strong>What Is Weather Modification?</strong> Cloud seeding is the primary weather modification activity recognized by the State of Colorado. Cloud seeding is the process of burning silver iodide through an ice nucleus generator that is carried up into the clouds to stimulate the precipitation process. There are many types of weather modification, including ground-based snowpack augmentation, airplane-based snowpack augmentation, airplane rain augmentation, hail suppression and hail cannons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think weather manipulation plays a role in climate change, however the most likely reason is there are at least 7B people on this planet who create a net footprint on the earth. If suddenly oil companies ceased to exist, do you guys think climate change would be this noticeable? If everyone lived like the Native Americans, our ozone wouldn&#39;t be destroyed.  </p>

<p>Convenience is great. It&#39;s nice to be able to walk in a store and buy whatever you want to eat. But think of the damage done to the enviroment by farming for the masses. Tractors naturally polluting the air and then the logistics of transporting those goods to major cities. Not sure if it&#39;s an unpopular opinion here but while the elites have some responsibility, it&#39;s up to the individual to make the right choices for our planet. We COULD drive 5 minutes to buy some takeout everyday and then just chilling at home, or we could walk the 45 minutes roundtrip, get some excercise that Americans sorely need and emit no pollution. (I mean if you were planning to jog for 30 minutes, why not do it before you get food?)  </p>

<p>While I dont doubt the capabilities of weather manipulation, I think the solution is less blaming those in power and more doing what the individual can. If you are able to walk/bike to work or school why dont you? (Cars are convenient). Why mass produce plastics when wooden utensils are reusable and supplement the earth when it&#39;s no longer usable? More importantly, why do humans continue to purchase these products? (Convenience). The world is lazy now, and I dont mean to offend those who are actually making a difference. Our ancestors were willing to die for their beliefs, all our generation does is complain with little action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does seem this way, I notice they tend to do it alot before the setting sun.<br/>
My best guess is they are blocking uv/infrared radation in a attempt to fight global warming. If they can bounce most of that stuff out before it can get in our atmosphere, it would work.<br/>
Thats why the weather modification that op is talking about is great to show people that its not a conspiracy theory, what they are doing, and creating rain are two different things I think. </p>

<p>They are either  fighting global warming, or their hiding something. If your religious, you might know the part in the bible where it says mankind will see some signs in the sky. </p>
