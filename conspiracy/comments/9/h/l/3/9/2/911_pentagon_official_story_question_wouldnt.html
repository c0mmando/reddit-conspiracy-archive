    <div class="md"><p>This video <em>always</em> comes up during this discussion. Freeze it at 0.53 and note the thickness of the concrete wall and compare that to the length of the the F4. </p>

<p>The F4 phantom is close to sixty feet long which makes the concrete wall considerably over 10 feet thick. Whats more, according to the video, the test wall was &quot;designed to move and absorb energy&quot;. </p>

<p>Obviously this makes it a poor analogue for the Pentagon walls. They were nowhere 10 feet thick, and moreover pierced every few meters with large windows. This video, while interesting, unfortunately does not illuminate anything on the topic of what would happen if a 757 hit the Pentagon. </p>

<p>Not saying a plane didn&#39;t hit the Pentagon mind you. Just debunking this video. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;m all for the fact 9/11 is a joke but ffs can we please get this straight? Planes do not make plane shaped holes because the wings are designed to fold in on impact. Why? Because where is the fuel? Exactly. We don&#39;t live in cartoon land.</p>

<p>The planes made a plane shaped hole in the twin towers which is highly suspect because that&#39;s not how planes are made. Literally the entire wingspan created a hole when they won&#39;t would crush and fold. I&#39;ve had friends who worked for British aerospace and I&#39;m downvoted everytime I say this despite this information being available.</p>
