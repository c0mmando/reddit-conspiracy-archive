       I’ve started to go hardcore mode studying for the ACT and the only thing I’ve used the internet for is for occasional memes, and the r/act subreddit, along with an online class
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve only been doing this for a week or two and it’s insane how self absorbed and sheeplike people are. I go to school and see everyone on Snapchat, Instagram, etc and all they care about is sex and themselves. None of them want to become a great person that changes anything at all, they’re just hooked on temporary pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you guys know the pull to refresh function was originally implemented by Facebook because they realized it had the same psychological effects of pulling a slot machine. And that they changed the notification icon from blue to red because it makes it seem more urgent in the back of our heads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite Starbucks being an insanely liberal organization, it seems like it’s the only place I can visit at 8-9pm and see people genuinely talking to each other or studying for school.

       There’s literally a market/focus on every thinkable thing in the world, but they’re dropping out. And even if there was something that they weren’t able to study, I’d say probably one in ten million won’t even try to make it a thing, they’ll just wait for someone else to

       I can, which is why I’m preparing. I’m studying 3+ hours a day until October 27th for this test simply because even if I don’t improve I won’t hate myself thinking I never tried later on.

       Is it weird to be this way? I’ve literally only ever wanted one type of job since I was 5. Is it that hard for people to find something they’re passionate about?

       It’s also the time where our brains is passing through a development stage which will only end when you are about 25, and you are also overflowing with chemicals.

       I have a few really close friends, along with myself who can’t even use the “it’s our body” excuse because we fucking own our body, at least I do. I’d probably get a lot more pleasure playing video games three hours a day but instead I replaced that with studying because I’m motivated to get a better score, get into (hopefully) my dream college, and then get a job in the field I love.

       Reading and Crit thinking are the hardest parts to study for. You either have it or you don't. Make sure you've got your maths covered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Standardized tests are largely BS anyways, but a good ACT score will help you work towards scholarships and apps for worth schools. Look into the SAT if you don't do as well as you'd like on the ACT.

       The average ACT score is a 20.8, and I got a 28
That’s somewhere between the top 88% and 93% out of everyone who took it, in other words I’m in the top 7-12%
      </p>
      <p>
       SAT average is 1060, and I got a 1210
I’m only in the top ~17% for the SAT but if I retook I’d probably be higher up
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the official ACT-SAT correspondence chart, my 28 on the ACT is the equivalent of a 1310 on the SAT

       Not really, I have a good sob story for college entrance essays. I could get into most mediocre colleges if I wanted but the reason I’m studying is to get at least a 32, which would put me at the 98th percentile, anything above a 32 is 99th percentile

       36 is basically a free admission ticket to whatever college you want

       Well last year only 2,760 people, 0.136% of test takers scored a 36, so yeah pretty much. Colleges need to look diverse but they also need good stats. That’s why if you’re a minority vs a white person and both have mediocre scores, the minority is gonna get in. But if you’re white and have a 36, they’re gonna take you before they take a minority with a 29-32ish

       One thing you could do just for yourself, is leave your smart phone at home. Disengage from needing the thing everywhere you go every minute of the day. Doing this leaves you face to face with real reality and the world that happening all around you. It's much easier to engage when your primary instrument of distraction is no longer in your pocket. Doing this, you will notice others who are off the sauce and also engaged in more personal interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everytime I mention to people who are annoyed by mobile tech/surveillance to leave their smart phones at home and enjoy, I get downvoted all to hell. Persecuted really.

       There is life outside of mobile tech, it can be done! ;)

       Whst confuses me is, I used to be a sheep then I smoked weed and got 'woke' but then I see most sheeps snoke weed and has no effect on them other than laugh and have munchies. No deep thoughts at all. Weed along with  One Piece saved me from suicide but the sheeps Ive witnessed in my uni or even some of my inner circle friends have no deeo thought or a self realisation about themselves or the world. Its just giggling and munching. Sometimes I feel like weed is wasted on those type of people, I may sound like an elitest saying this but if weed save me from suicide then it should give tou a profound meaning to your existence instead of just one dimenaionally thinking and living up the weed stereotypw from the 50s.

       Everyone’s different but I think a lot of it has to do with the stereotype. I don’t think if we gave weed to someone who’s never heard of it, that they would be hungry and eating a ton. I think people do it to be a part of the stereotype, but then after the first or second time they associate it with weed and do it every time. Maybe that’s just me though

       Everyone is different and will react differently. For some people it brings them further from their true self by shrouding it, for others it opens them up when they let it. I'm not a fan of calling people sheep for not being self-aware, it's condescending, and the ego is a strong force we all have to learn to become aware of on our own. As Steve Hyde put it: Your high is a reflection of your state of mind man.

       Completely agree with your sentiments and would also like to add that Fortnite is addictive as fuck. Like the feeling I get when I have amassed the perfect combination of weapons, then I get killed in a stupid way is exactly how I feel at the casino when I win big, keep gambling, then lose. Huge rush then its back to baseline, repeat.
