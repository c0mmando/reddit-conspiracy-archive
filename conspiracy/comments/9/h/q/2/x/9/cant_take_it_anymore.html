    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP, have you ever tried binaural beats, there&#39;s a bunch of different ones, stress/anxiety relief ones might help you</p>

<p>they all have various styles, some are more musical, some more sounds of nature, some others are pure tone, find one that you like that is comfortable to you</p>

<p>pure tone: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9LPPWymt7E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9LPPWymt7E</a></p>

<p>calming musical: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkM-FjfN6Mc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkM-FjfN6Mc</a></p>

<p>Just throwing the idea your way, it works for some, doesn&#39;t for other, but I think that&#39;s mainly finding the one that works for you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what your living situation is but maybe living at home with the parents would help with the stress. You would be paying probably cheaper rent then if you were on your own plus you’ll be helping your parents out. This is a huge thing today in that nursing homes and senior living is through the roof. Plus this helps your parents because then they don’t need to hire a nurse or medical personnel to take care of them. I’m not saying you should have to be there slave just nice that the option is there. How many people are so happy to be independent and living on their own but yet miss their families and would kill for the chance to go visit them whenever they can or be there at the drop of a hat to help them? A lot of people. Yet society tells us everyone should be kicked out of the house at 18 or 20 and have their own car their own house their own family everything. Do what’s right in your heart and stop listening to what other people say when it comes to what you should do with your life. Even if you think what I say is bullshit. You are not alone though dude a lot of people are feeling this way. It’s just because the world is falling apart. We can rebuild it into something better though if we want to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have my own house and my own family. it just doesn&#39;t seem i can never get ahead either. and i can&#39;t quit my job because it is the career i have been working for. so to make any changes to my life i will be making changes to 3 other people&#39;s life too. ever since i had my son i have been doing it for him. but it all seems to much in this society i have to use up every ounce of brain power to keep things straight and people all around me are constantly asking for help. i have a pretty good job, great son, great wife, but all my time, my money, and energy have been used to make their lives happier, but when i try to take time for myself i get shamed for being a lazy asshole and i am never right too. always an asshole when i correct people, and always not doing anything right. </p>

<p>this might come off as a rant but i feel like this is happening to a lot of people too and not just me.</p>

The more you do the more you open yourself up to people and you will realize your family really loves you.</p>
