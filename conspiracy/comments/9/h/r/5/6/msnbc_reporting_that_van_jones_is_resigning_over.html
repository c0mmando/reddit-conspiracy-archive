       What's to explain? When debris weighing thousands of tons falls on an office building floor, that floor is going to collapse, and it's going to offer minimal resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, in plain English, is an explanation of how the fires triggered the collapse, and why the floors pancaked so easily (
       <a href="http://www.science-writing.org/id29.html">
        source
       </a>
       ):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The most consequential designs that were not included in the Twin Towers were sufficient fire-suppression systems and fireproofing. Even though the towers were built to withstand the impact of a jetliner, they were not designed to withstand and remain standing during a fire of such great magnitude. The jet-fuel fire caused by the impact was impossible to contain in the Twin Towers. The World Trade Center had not been designed to fight hydrocarbon fires of such magnitude and high temperature – up to 1500 degrees Celsius. The fire-suppression system consisted of water sprinklers that were useless because water, at this temperature, would vaporize almost instantly. Instead, these fires had to be fought with chemical foam, which the Towers lacked (Ashley 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fireproofing system in the Towers was also insufficient. First, the Towers were lightweight because of their extensive use of steel and were devoid of masonry or concrete which made them difficult to insulate from the fire. Second, a more sophisticated fireproofing system could have been incorporated during the building process. Most of the supports and trusses could have been coated with extra fire proofing material (Ashley 2001). Third, the World Trade Center incorporated a novel, yet very flammable, elevator system (Wilkinson 2002). The engineers worried that, without masonry, the conventional elevator shafts would buckle and collapse with the intense air pressure exerted by the high speed elevators. To solve this problem the engineers used a drywall/plaster system fixed to a reinforced steel core; this made the shafts more flexible though much more flammable (Wilkinson 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Another design shortcoming that made the ensuing fire even more destructive was the use of weak floor trusses which spanned abnormally long distances (Ashley 2001). In the Twin Towers the steel trusses spanned nearly sixty feet without any support and were only four inches thick (Federal Emergency Management Agency 2002). The extremely high-temperature fire heated the relatively thin floor rapidly, making the floor almost flexible because it lost most of its rigidity and consequently buckled. Since the floor buckled, the extra support needed to come from the remaining exterior perimeter columns, but many had been destroyed by the planes’ initial impact. But those columns also depended on the core steel columns for support, but these columns were being subjected to extremely harsh conditions of the fire and were failing themselves. The exterior columns began to buckle onto the floor which buckled on the floor beneath and started a gigantic domino effect of the plunging stories. So, in effect, the fire caused all structural supports to weaken and fail within the Twin Towers.

       Now maybe you'd like to provide a
       <em>
        GOOD

       explanation as to why the Bush administration framed the Taliban government and Osama bin Laden for the crime, when their motive was to provide a pretext for invading Iraq and toppling Saddam Hussein. Remember that they tried to frame Hussein, but had somehow neglected to manufacture a paper trail that led to him. Please don't brush over any important details.

       No. When thousands of tons falls on thousands of tons of reinforced steal. And at the rate it falls, you have to actively fool yourself into thinking so many floors can collapse that fast.

       I guess from now on, if you want to demolish a building, just blow some of the top floors and then it will take out the rest of the structure pancake style. You'll never see that happen anywhere because it defies Newtonian physics.

       I hesitate to say this but the hydraulic apparatus that pushed out the walls can be thought of as the floor trusses bowing in the WTC, (naturally from heat/pressure).

       Notice the location of the demolished floors are at the very middle of the building, while WTC damage was closer to the top. The demolition of WTC1 and WTC2 is much more sophisticated, involving explosions to the main structure before blasting out from top to bottom the entire buildings.  The planes crashing into the building did not take out the same portion or have as great of a dameging effect to the overall structure of WTC1 and WTC2 as the explosions to the center of the building in the video you posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video you posted is only good for showing that there have been demolitions in the past that involved blowing out higher parts of a structure.

       You said it already about the video you posted: "Its not a parallel to the WTC..."

        Improvements to Structural Models
The ANSYS and LS-DYNA structural models are highly rigorous to capture complex failure mechanisms. NIST’suse of these FEA models is advancing the state-of-the-art of computational analysis, in terms of software and hardware. Significant improvements made to the structural models include:
-Identified and incorporated possible failure mechanisms:
-Bolt shear, weld fracture, tearoutand block shear failures in connection plates or angles, beam/girder walk-off of a bearing seat, and shear stud failure
-Lateral torsionalbuckling of beams and buckling of columns
-Developed (1) 18 types of user-defined break elements for the ANSYS model on floors 8 to 14, and (2) 31 types of connection sub-models for the LSDYNA model.
-Each break element contained multiple failure mechanisms, which were modeled using beam elements, contact elements, nonlinear springs, and rigid links, for:
-3 types of shear connections for beam-to-beam framing
-7 types of bearing connections for girders framing into columns
-1 type of shear stud connection between the steel beams and concrete slab
-To include connections (1) a total of 12,866 elements were addedto the ANSYS model, and (2) 13,920 connection sub-models were added to both ends of all floor beams and girders inthe LSDYNA model from floor 4 to the roof.
-The addition of connections and identified failure beam/column failure mechanisms greatly increased computational demand, slowing down the analysis when a large number of break elements failed.
-The level of detail in the models was optimized to maintain sufficient modeling fidelity, adequately capture failure mechanisms, and minimize computational times.

       I don't know if you're getting the gist of what I am asking for.  I didn't ask for a stress/strain model of the heat load initialization. I asked for a good pancake collapse model and visualization (see thread higher up).  Just one.  Strike 2!

       I don't know if your getting what I'm saying.  I provided you the visualization for tower 7, and linked you to a discussion of the WTC 1+2 models, which included reasons for and against its existence/release.  I also provided you the link to request the model from NIST itself.  At this point there is nothing more I can provide.  It seems rather incredulous to dismiss NIST'S findings based on this one point of contention.  I understand you're going to argue, if they had nothing to hide why not just release it or some other variation, that however does not negate the fact they have released all the modeling data, and numerical outputs.  It seems to me to be a red herring/causal dismissal/minimization of NIST'S findings.

       Face it.  NIST itself could not provide a clear side-by-side comparison of the conclusion that it itself made from its own analysis.  The whole point of the analysis was to answer the question of why the buildings collapsed, not why they fell one story.  They did a great job at building a case of a one story collapse, but when it came time to come through with meat of the argument--the definitive proof of their conclusion--the thing that made that day so horrific, they copped out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's because they tried this analysis and learned that it could not happen the way they say it did.  You have searched, and have found nothing to prove what I asked for.  And the reason I asked is because I know that it does not exist, because it cannot exist.  Any pancake collapse model of the WTC will prove that the towers cannot fall the speed they did without the floors being somehow weaked or their supports being removed from beneath them. Keep looking.  Any model you find true to physics will show the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a whole world of information out there not originating from the NIST, and the best come from just a few physics and engineering text books.

       Pancake theory was the inital hypothesis NIST tested.  It failed hypothesos testing.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        NIST’s findings do not support the “pancake theory” of collapse, which is premised on a progressive failure of the floor systems in the WTC towers (the composite floor system—that connected the core columns and the perimeter columns—consisted of a grid of steel “trusses” integrated with a concrete slab; see diagram below). Instead, the NIST investigation showed conclusively that the failure of the inwardly bowed perimeter columns initiated collapse and that the occurrence of this inward bowing required the sagging floors to remain connected to the columns and pull the columns inwards. Thus, the floors did not fail progressively to cause a pancaking phenomenon.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So at this point your argument is basically NIST is lying (literally about 1000 people), and your evidence to support that assertion/idea is they do not have a video of their collapse model?  If thats what you think then really there is nothing more to discuss, because nothing I am going to tell you will change your viewpoint.  I would recommend that you fill out a

       No.  I did my own conservation of momentum simulation, with multiple floors falling and stacking, gaining speed during the fall, losing speed gaining mass.  My simulation assumed no resistance whatsoever, and the final collapse time was nearly the time it took for the towers to actually collapse in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was a simulation with conservative estimates (i.e. no beams)  I could only guess at this point what it should have really been like using any sort of dampening constants thrown into the mix, but even the slightest dampening has a great effect on the total collapse duration.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanted you and people like you to try and find a good model out there that supports the pancake hypothesis, and the thing is, it's not out there because it does not, and cannot exist.  I already knew that because the math shows it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't like how the media portrays the Truth movement or "Truthers" in general.  The fact is, most people who support the findings as NIST reported them have never even once attempted to try to do the math themselves.  If you are capable of doing it (ie. you have a Physics or Engineering background), I invite you to write and run a crude model yourself using something like MATLAB. Velocities, accelerations, and positions are easy to plot can calculate.  And successive floor impacts are easy to model using loops.  Give it a shot.  That's the only way you'd really ever be convinced.

       I'll watch these videos, but I'll ask you the question.. are you sure they didn't leave out important details? In addition, Bazant and Zhou's work is constantly brought up as the seemingly end all be all the scientific work on the subject.  Their work was "published" on Sept 13, 2001 and an update something like Sept. 28, 2001.  I really don't think that's much of enough time for true scientific scrutiny but their peers (which often takes weeks for writing, sending, receiving, reading, analyzing, working through, writing a response, and sending off the publisher, then them sending off the the original author.  It's a long dirty process, and somehow I don't think this paper went through all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition..... do you actually think that Bazant and  Zhou's paper is a GOOD paper?  It deals mostly with generalities-- not with the specific building full of references to it's specific architecture.  You have to have a keen and discerning eye to be an effective peer reviewer, and for the respect and weight this paper has been given over the years, this paper doesn't seem to have been tested by that kind of scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll look at the other's too, in addition to the video, but I have to maintain that I will be watching with a discerning eye because most videos of this type often gloss over the important details while intimidating their audience through details of other parts that aren't as important.  Keep that in mind, and you'll start to notice yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way then, if NIST doesn't support a progressive pancake collapse, what do they support?

       Cyince... this video sucks.  Seriously, all he does in it is talk about "models" in generalities, then talks about some people making wrong "scale models" in generalities (because they don't consider property scaling in their dimensional analysis...or do any dimensional analysis).  He shows a basic concervation of momentum step (which is the only good part.. that's why I did) but doesn't even go on and show what his conclusions are when he tries to run it iteratively all the way down!

       Didn't you catch this?  It's the classic runaround.  He then equates the argument of Truth movement to one of "energy beams" or something like that, then they run out of town.

       No.  I did my own conservation of momentum simulation, with multiple floors falling and stacking, gaining speed during the fall, losing speed gaining mass.  My simulation assumed no resistance whatsoever, and the final collapse time was nearly the time it took for the towers to actually collapse in real life.

       That was a simulation with conservative estimates (i.e. no beams)  I could only guess at this point what it should have really been like using any sort of dampening constants thrown into the mix, but even the slightest dampening has a great effect on the total collapse duration.

       I just wanted you and people like you to try and find a good model out there that supports the pancake hypothesis, and the thing is, it's not out there because it does not, and cannot exist.  I already knew that because the math shows it.

       I just don't like how the media portrays the Truth movement or "Truthers" in general.  The fact is, most people who support the findings as NIST reported them have never even once attempted to try to do the math themselves.  If you are capable of doing it (ie. you have a Physics or Engineering background), I invite you to write and run a crude model yourself using something like MATLAB. Velocities, accelerations, and positions are easy to plot can calculate.  And successive floor impacts are easy to model using loops.  Give it a shot.  That's the only way you'd really ever be convinced.
