Q,

Did NASA fake the moon landings?  Have we been to the moon since then?  Are there secret space programs?  Is this why the Space Force was created?
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3094804
False, moon landings are real.
Programs exist that are outside of public domain.
Q
i wonder where this will go ?
if it goes to &quot;the galatic federation&quot; i think im just gonna go smoke weed or some shit</p>

<p>Well the number of events that all had to happen in precisely the way and sequence that they each happened and at precisely the right time for them to happen and the odds against them all happening in just that way in order for this living world of ours to exist are such that you would need as many universes as there are stars and planets in this universe in order to ever find another one just like it. </p>

<p>You want to examine the possibility of &quot;life&quot; elsewhere then you really need to understand just what it is that made it possible on this world and recognise that if even one of countless factors hadn&#39;t happened in precisely the way that it did then there wouldn&#39;t have been any life on this world, either.

Change only one of those facts or events or the sequence in which any of them took place and no life of any kind would have been possible.</p>

<p>Scientists have speculated about the possibility of life being based on some other chemical rationale besides the way it is structured here on Earth and have consistently come up empty. The chemistry simply doesn&#39;t work without ALL of the conditions that come with our planet including and especially it&#39;s magnetic field.</p>

<p>As for your amino acids in space, they are necessary for physical life as we know it, OUR type of life, you know? The kind you are <em>arguing against</em> and that sort of life isn&#39;t very likely anywhere else but here, I&#39;m afraid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but it takes more than merely water and those other bodies are either too close to some Sun or too far away from one or else it&#39;s the wrong kind of Sun and on and on. </p>

<p>Amongst all of the suns, our own is a rare and unusual one as well as presently being in a stage that is conducive to life on our planet alone in this system, which it wasn&#39;t always and won&#39;t always be. </p>

<p>Like I said you have a myriad of critical factors like the Earth&#39;s tilted axis and the fact that it rotates on an orbit that is only mildly elliptical keeping the Earth at a fairly consistent and safe distance from our Sun throughout. All of which are absolutely critical and vitally necessary in sustaining the life that exists here. </p>

<p>The exact sequence of events in the life of the Earth&#39;s and it&#39;s evolution were what allowed the atmosphere to be and become what it is and the life on this planet both interacts with and maintains that atmosphere&#39;s equilibrium.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The precise balance of elements and conditions that exist on THIS planet at THIS time in THIS galaxy in THIS Universe are not to be found anywhere else in it. Is that so difficult for you to understand? </p>

<p>Do you have any idea of the complex conditions and history surrounding the formation of the Earth as we understand it and that by all rights <em>it shouldn&#39;t exist</em> but nevertheless does?</p>

<p>There are around 700 quintillion planets in the universe, but the Earth is quite strictly one of a kind amongst them all.</p>

<p>The Astrophysicist Erik Zackrisson at Uppsala University in Sweden came up with this staggering figure... (a 7 followed by 20 zeros) with the aid of a computer model that simulated the universe‚Äôs evolution from the Big Bang to the present. </p>

<p>His model combined all of information known about exoplanets in the Milky Way with our understanding of the early universe and the laws of physics to recreate the past 13.8 billion years.</p>

<p>In doing so, he found that the Earth appears to have been dealt an extremely lucky hand. In a galaxy like the Milky Way, for instance, most of the planets Zackrisson‚Äôs model generated were all very different from the Earth. They were all generally larger, and roughly three billion years older and as such highly unlikely to support any life at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The word is &quot;philosophical&quot; rather than religious and the question of existence as well as the possibility of life existing elsewhere were philosophical questions long before science with it&#39;s own highly restricted and limited view of things was determined to find some purely materialistic take of it&#39;s own on them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still a long way from having shed the archaic notions of Newton&#39;s imaginary model of the Universe or pursuing answers to those questions as if the one we live in is just like it. It isn&#39;t and never was, and making assumptions based solely on numbers no matter how infinite they are is patently ridiculous. </p>

<p>If there&#39;s one then there must be another that is virtually identical when absolutely everything in the entire Universe conspires against that idea in every way it is possible to do that? I don&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>We have in this peculiar little world of ours the only conditions that don&#39;t simply support &quot;life&quot; but countless millions of entirely different forms of it that we haven&#39;t even begun to catalogue, much less study or analyze even the smallest fraction of all those &quot;alien&quot; life-forms. </p>

<p>Moreover our planet&#39;s &quot;chemistry set&quot;, if it can be called that is virtually a full and complete one to allow for all of that incredible diversity of life-forms to not simply exist but exist as ones that can&#39;t exist without an equally incredible number of others that must also exist right along with them that are all intrinsically bound-up and totally dependent on one another for their individual survival. That&#39;s the only &quot;life&quot; and kind of life that we know of or are aware of.</p>

<p>Sure anyone can &quot;imagine&quot; some other life-form, outside of those existing in our own world but not some other way it could work or be successful given that a similar host of others that are all just as radically different from anything we know that would all be just as vitally necessary to facilitate it. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t even begin to imagine the totality or fathom the complexity of how life exists and functions right here on our own planet much less speculate about how some entirely other or different arrangement could conceivably exist much less succeed in some other place in the Universe or ignore just how remarkably placed and positioned we just happen to be that all of that was possible.</p>

<p>Like I said you have a myriad of critical factors like the Earth&#39;s tilted axis and the fact that it rotates on an orbit that is only mildly elliptical keeping the Earth at a fairly consistent and safe distance from our Sun throughout. All of which are absolutely critical and vitally necessary in sustaining the life that exists here. </p>

<p>The exact sequence of events in the life of the Earth&#39;s and it&#39;s evolution were what allowed the atmosphere to be and become what it is and the life on this planet both interacts with and maintains that atmosphere&#39;s equilibrium.</p>
