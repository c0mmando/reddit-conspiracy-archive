        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello there.</p>

<p>I am an academician, and for the past few years, I have been having issues within the medical field due to the knowledge corruption and blatant avoidance and violent refutations of some doctors on certain topics. I feel like I need to analyze these not only for my own health, but also for my patients&#39; and friends&#39; too. This community is my best chance at obtaining some truth.</p>

<p>I had seen dozens of vaccine study results on this sub 12-18 months ago, and but I cannot find most of them anymore. I would appreciate if you shared them if you have them saved (something I should have done) or have links easily available to you. I am looking for the vaccine research, experiments, data, articles (regarding thimerosal and aluminum toxicity), which are being supressed and under-ruged by the academics and pharma.</p>

<p>I would like to see their findings on the toxicity of these heavy metals in kidneys, liver, heart, and the brain. Most studies I can find are about neurotoxicity only (autism and alzheimer causation) but I want to see the data on other organs too- if possible.</p>

<p>I already read the vaccinepapers website, and mercuryproject website. So any other websites or just singular data of independent studies are most welcome.</p>

<p>Thank you so much in advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Additional info: I started getting really irritated when I talked to a few doctors of infectious diseases, and neurologists (all my seniors- half of them assistant professors in their 50s). When I brought up the mercury toxicity, they immediately smirked and told me that it&#39;s nonsense. So I asked them if they can share the replicated and peer-reviewed vaccine safety data done in the country (not going to take other countries&#39; word for it), or at least direct me to the source (a book, some published articles, conference power points even) and none of them provided me with any proof.</p>

<p>I clearly remember asking one of them: &quot;So, you just trusted the safety of 6 vaccines- which you import from other countries- but no scientist in our own country tried to replicate some simple thimerosal toxicity in in vitro experiments to confirm those claims.&quot;</p>

<p>To the neurologist I asked if he ever studied neurological effects of ethyl/methyl mercury on the brain, toxicity symptoms, and if has he ever read any articles on high aluminum levels and mercury accumulation found in brains (recalling autopsy reports of autistic children and alzheimer patients); his answer was: &quot;We don&#39;t have the time to read so many new studies, especially not autopsy findings. We barely have free time for ourselves and our families after our shifts. I have never heard of mercury or aluminum toxicity causing neurological issues other than direct mercury poisoning, and I never had a single patient like that.&quot;</p>

<p>Their answers activated red alerts in my mind; how can a practicing doctor tell me that they don&#39;t read such studies regarding their fields because they barely have time for themselves after work? These conversations confirmed that most doctors go through their medical lives by only what they were taught as university students, and  treat their patients based on only their in-clinic experiences, and their professors&#39; directions when they are clueless.</p>

<p>Thus, I have known for a while now that at least 75% of the doctors stopped studying their own field and only focus on getting through their days at the hospitals/clinics with their outdated knowledge.</p>

<p>This shouldn&#39;t be taken lightly; a dozen doctors in different fields failed to provide me with vaccine safety data after telling me that vaccines are harmless (regarding adjuvants and heavy metals). They all simply refused to give me, their student, the scientific proof; not only because they disliked me, but because they have never seen the safety data themselves! They simply say: &quot;I have my diplomas and degrees, so just believe me when I claim this but I don&#39;t share with you the proof that enabled me to make this safety claim with such certainty in the first place.&quot;</p>

<p>This is outrageous...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if you are aware that thimerosal has been substituted with similarly toxic aluminum n most vaccines in US, Canada and some other countries. However, I do have an odd comment in a Wikileaks email quoting when this toxicity was first reported. </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-em">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-em</a></p>

<p>“We found out that the Thimeresol would be toxic down to – not grams, not mg’s, not mcgs, but nano grams – parts per billion – which was almost unbelieveable. This was published in the American Journal Medical Society, in the New York Academy Sciences and in the Journal For the Chemical Speciality Manufactures Association and it didn’t make wave, there wasn’t even a ripple – no one seemed to care.” – Dr Frank P Engley PhD – Blue Ribbon Panel Member 1948 AMA meeting regarding Thimeresol’s concerns.”</p>

<p>This is a study I found recently that casually reports that the Pertussis vaccine is known to be ineffective and that those vaccinated are unknowingly transmitting it to those around them bec they have no symptoms. It is still recommended. The implications... ppl are exposing infants and immunosuppressed but they are still instructed to receive an ineffective vaccine with a long list of risks. I was banned from r/medicine for posting it. </p>

<p><a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-015-0382-8">https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-015-0382-8</a>
Pertussis ineffective and evidence of  asymptomatic transmission by those vaccinated.  </p>

<p>This study was suppressed and researchers harassed (from Italy).  They found all vaccines from all manufacturers were contaminated. No response from industry or medical field.  Incidentally, China recently had similar incident and it was in world news, company was dealt with by gov. </p>

<p>The following is cringeworthy. </p>

<p>“This 4250% increase in fetal deaths was known to the CDC and did not trigger any reparative action. We have a committee comprised of pharmaceutically-invested “experts” telling doctors what to do with their patients. The transparency of the no-citizen-left-behind agenda is never more apparent than in the fact that you can engage this potentially lethal medical intervention (yes, death is a known and documented potential side effect) at your local pharmacy. Long gone are the days of informed consent.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>—Dr Stephanie Seneff YouTube (mit scientist)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These physicians are questioning WHO’s management of adverse reaction reporting in that it obfuscates link to vaccines. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.moneylife.in/article/new-guidelines-from-who-put-childrens-life-at-risk-paediatricians/54601.html">https://www.moneylife.in/article/new-guidelines-from-who-put-childrens-life-at-risk-paediatricians/54601.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>”Under WHO&#39;s revised manual on AEFI (Adverse Events Following Immunization), only those adverse reactions observed during clinical trials of a vaccine, should be classified as vaccine related.  All new serious adverse reactions including deaths seen during post-marketing of the vaccine should be considered as &#39;coincidental&#39; or &#39;unclassifiable&#39;, and the vaccine should not be blamed.”</p>

<p>”The WHO has also changed the definition of &quot;causal association,&quot; the doctors say. Under the revised guidelines, if there is an alternate explanation for the adverse event, or another factor is involved, causative association with vaccine should not be made. &quot;In other words, if after vaccination, a child with an underlying congenital heart disease develops cardiac failure, it would not be considered causally related to the vaccine.&quot;”</p>

<p>”The revised classification by WHO &quot;is a major step backward for patient safety,&quot; the authors say, adding, &quot;This could embolden vaccine manufacturers to be more reckless with regard to adverse reactions.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would recommend these ppl</p>

<p>Dr Stephanie Seneff (on YouTube, but also publications)  is an mit researcher who has been analyzing the VAER’s data (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting).  She also made the association between glyphosate (herbicide in food chain) and risk of autism. </p>

<p>Also on You tube, the vaxxed series has interviews with families who have vaccine injured children, but also, they interview physicians who have looked into concerns and may speak to what the physicians you are encountering may be thinking. </p>

<p>There is a physician in California —Robert Sears, he has been prosecuted for trying to provide vaccines in a safer timetable. He looked at aluminum in IV fluids given to preemies, initially. His father was also a physician (pediatrician) and was known for parent guidelines. </p>

<p>There have been NIH researchers and Cochrane Researchers who have questioned the cdc’s bias in interpreting studies and the recommendations they have made.  Recently (ongoing) Cochrane received a donation from Bill Gates and has changed their evidence based approach. A long time board member was fired and 4 others resigned. One of the issues: HPV improper/incomplete clinical studies. </p>

<p>Will get links and plug them in so check back. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/48-2000-Proceedings-Mercury.pdf">This one</a> is just nuts.  The infamous Verstraaten study, which showed an <strong>enormous</strong> relative risk of 7.6 (760%) of thimerosal exposed children developing autism compared to controls.  And somehow these CDC shills went on to deny any link.  Thank god another senior CDC scientist, William Thompson, had the courage to blow the whistle on these goons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s great for people like us, though.  The majority of our society is filled with militant pro-vax people who don&#39;t have the first clue about the scientific literature on vaccines.  Quoting a couple of these studies shuts them up pretty fast.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I saw an interview with someone who published a similar study on the neurotoxic effects of aluminum in vaccines.  This study was a gamechanger, it would uproot the whole industry.  Except.. it didn&#39;t, it was published and met with silence from academics and the industry.  The scientific evidence is mounting against this industry and their tactic is to downplay and ignore, they&#39;ve already brainwashed all the gullible fools who are too ignorant to read a study, anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Despite being in the academy, I had never seen anything related to vaccine injuries or the dangers of their ingredients. I remember reading these for the first time on a few obscure blogs and reddit, when I was in my 3rd year as a student at my university, while randomly websurfing.</p>

<p>What activated my &#39;bullshit radar&#39; was when I asked my lecturers about these adjuvant findings, they never took me to their faculty room, opened some drawers, and showed me dozens of vaccine safety studies. Every time I inquired them about proof, they told me the manufacturers of the vaccines showed the heads of Ministry of Health those proofs, and that&#39;s enough for me to stop worrying.</p>

<p>Do we not have our own minds which can be used to decide whether those safety studies are valid, and the right to see those claimed proofs? Where are they? I am in my 30s now, and I still haven&#39;t seen a single replicated and peer-reviewed deep pathological examination or long-term developmental observation on a vaccine safety experiment group.</p>

<p>This is less about the studies but the conflicts of interest, I&#39;ve learned that the studies are not even the biggest issue, it&#39;s the political side of vaccines.  Why are the same people who are given a button to say &quot;Is this vaccine safe for market use? Yes/no&quot; allowed to  have a financial stake in the same vaccine, might as well relabel the button &quot;Do you want to earn millions of dollars? Yes/no&quot;</p>

<p>This is Wakefield&#39;s paper, it&#39;s not proof but it was considered so dangerous the CDC had to commit scientific fraud to silence this and a whistle blower came out proving it.  </p>

<p>Make sure to check documentaries like Vaxxed, vaccination the hidden truth</p>

<p>Check out a bunch of youtube channels, they can give you good insight on where to look for more detailed science.  </p>

<p>The highwire with Del Bigtree, he made vaxxed and was previously on the doctors, he covers a lot of stories going on about current vaccine issues, he also filed the foia request that revealed HHS hasn&#39;t sent any vaccine safety reports in the past 30 years.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes me happy seeing people like you questioning their peers, asking for data and proof.  Yet they can&#39;t back anything up, none of the experts have even heard of people like William Thompson, why do we care what the experts have to say if they don&#39;t know about these people or the controversies? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/94dxck/institute_of_medicine_reports_1991_1994_and_2011/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/94dxck/institute_of_medicine_reports_1991_1994_and_2011/</a></p>

<p>The institute of medicine did a report in 2011, 153/158 of the adverse reactions either accepted a relationship or <strong>had no data</strong>, imagine that, your doctor is giving you a product where 97% of the adverse reactions are unstudied, would you take that product? Most people would ask &quot;Are you being given a bonus to give me this product?&quot; they will answer &quot;yes&quot; as vaccines give bonuses per person but also by meeting target goals which can range from tens of thousands of dollars for small clinics to hundreds of thousands of dollars for big hospitals, thats a financial conflict of interest.  </p>

<p><strong>Your doctor is giving you an unstudied product and they are being paid extra to give you</strong> and if you have a reaction you cannot sue them.  Instead of doing the reasonable thing and calling your doctor a disgusting monster of a human being, you let him give that product to your baby! </p>

<p>I don&#39;t hate doctors, I hate doctors that don&#39;t do their job, it&#39;s their job to know about the products they are giving and if they aren&#39;t questioning it they are just as bad as the industry since they are receiving blood money.  </p>

<p>In the congressional video I posted, Dr. Boyle is representing the CDC and half of her answers are &quot;I am not an expert, I don&#39;t know&quot; like bitch what the fuck, you are here to represent the CDC, if you are the best they have to show the world how am I supposed to feel about the rest of your organization if you cannot answer simple questions like Posey: &quot;has the cdc compared vaccinated with unvaccinated?&quot; Boyle: &quot;We looked at Thimerosal and stuff&quot; Posey: &quot;Are you fucking deaf? Vaccinated vs unvaccinated, Yes/no&quot; To which she responded &quot;no&quot; it was stalling for time obviously because he was limited to 5 minutes of questioning, the less she speaks the better for her.  </p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: &quot;This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... &quot;I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 207: &quot;The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.</p>

<p>Dr. Brent, pg. 229 &quot;we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: &quot;that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: &quot;just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired.
