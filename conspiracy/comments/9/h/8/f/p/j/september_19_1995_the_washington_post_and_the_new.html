       As a 17 year old sophomore at Harvard, he and fellow student  participants,  were asked to write essays detailing their personal   beliefs and aspirations.  Supposedly the essays were turned over to an  anonymous attorney,  who  would later session vehemently and abusingly,  confront and belittle Kaczinsky, using the content of his essays against  him. Kaczinsky endured 200 hours of this  psychological torment, which  were filmed and repeatedly played back to him, while electrodes   monitored his physiological reactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sorry i have been trying to Post this, with a good picture of Kaczinsky all morning, as opposed to the one taken during the perp walk, without success. The procedure for posting images and links is confusing and requires a reversion to the Old Reddit to even come close to complying. Frankly, i am never going to try an add content to this sub reddit ever again.

       Yeah man, reddit is fucking garbage, like everything else that leftists run. I only use old reddit. The new one takes 10x as many clicks to get do the same thing. I guess I'm the only person that uses a laptop instead of stupid phone.

       I'm curious as to why you're bringing this up now? It's a fascinating story that highlights the dangers of intelligence agencies, so I understand if you just wanted to share it. Something makes me think you have more information to share.

       I think what the media has deemed "the alt-right" is doing a lot of good in letting people know that we have a problem and it needs fixed. We have a long way to go, but I feel we are at the beginning of their movement, not the end. The best way in today's society is just to get on social media and vlog away.

       You write music that is so good that people can't help but want to hear it and play it on the radio, and then you put your ideas into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are listening though, and some are even seeking. The problem is that most are afraid to be singled out, and are waiting for someone else to lead. Personally I gave up trying to lead a hores to water only to not have it drink, and I focus only on my sphere of influence.

       I am a little confused about the extent of his involvement in these experiments. Kaczynski recently wrote a letter in response to the Manhunter series downplaying the impact and saying his participation involved the completion of a bunch of questionnaires and around 30 mins face to face. However in previous correspondence, such as that detailed in the Atlantic article from 2000 linked below, he seems to have hinted at more extensive involvement. I know that Ted had grave concerns around being perceived as "mentally incompetent", and can see the advantage of mainstream publications pushing a "broken" narrative for him as a way of discrediting his ideas. I'm not sure what to think.

       Regardless of the extent of the experiment without his informed consent, i am not sure that how reliable a victim's characterization of their abuse really is;, especially whenthey go on to victimize other innocent people and their families.

       I believe it's very much the latter. Ted is very...image conscious? Everything is calculated and meticulously procured when it comes to putting his ideas forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's stressed on many occasion the importance of letting his ideas speak for themselves and should be thought about without any preconceived notions. Mixed with his narcissistic personality, there's no doubt in my mind that he's downplaying his involvement in these "therapy" sessions in an effort to attract more people to his ideas.

       While I agree with your assessment...why are you done posting here? I can see your post. Self posts just don't get karma.

       Soooo unless you were just whoring for karma; what does it matter?

       Karma's cool but there will always be people with more Karma and there will always be people with less Karma. That's the only rule of Karma i can figure out. Good stuff gets voted down and bad stuff gets voted up, so it is nonsensical except for that one rule.
But, to answer your question I can't figure out how to post images and links on this sub-reddit. So, what's the point for me of posting anything at all.
