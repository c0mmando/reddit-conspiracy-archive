<p>That&#39;s one of the first &#39;diss tracks&#39; recorded. It was made by BDP in 1987.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_Wars">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_Wars</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s what they were arguing about, is over who truly started hip hop.</p>

<p>and then a year later, BDP member Scott LaRock got murdered and BDP switched from fronting to making music critical of the gang problem.</p>

<p>KRS-One is a legend for creating intellectual, socially positive hip hop.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/jxyYP_bS_6s">https://youtu.be/jxyYP_bS_6s</a></p>

<p>Hip Hop was a counterculture music style started by poor urban kids. The music and the message in the music was coming from young people growing up in the environment. The politics and values in the music is specific to people from that environment.</p>

<p>In the late 80s, rap went corporate. Big labels jumped in and suddenly the music went from the streets to boardrooms and studios, eventually going to MTV and the suburban mainstream market.</p>

<p>The new audience of suburban predominately white fans jumped on board and since then, rap has been the best selling mainstream music genre.</p>

<p>Rap is barely &#39;street&#39; nowadays.</p>

<p>Even by the time Eminem came out, the genre had been tainted by the new gangster ethos that the new consumer market loved even though the image is completely toxic to urban kids.</p>

<p>The gangster image has done nothing positive for black people in the US. The image itself was just a rehashed version of 70s blaxploitation stereotypes used to market to white youth who love the images media portrays.</p>

<p>With Eminem, he&#39;s a useful corporate tool. He was &#39;discovered&#39; by Jimmy Iovine and Dr Dre. Eminem is a good rapper. I actually like his music. I think the content is a joke but he&#39;s still talented.</p>

<p>Eminem works as a &#39;bridge&#39; for white fans who lack the &#39;street cred&#39; and makes it fine for them to be into the music/image.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny because I know a bunch of young white rappers who grew up on Eminem. They all have like 1 token black friend who gives them self assurance that they&#39;re &#39;allowed&#39; to make rap music.</p>

<p>Some of them are good rappers too but all the content is all about the same cheesy bullshit. Guns, weed, beefs, brand name garbage, etc...</p>

<p>It&#39;s so boring.</p>

<p>All of these &#39;beefs&#39; are nothing more than marketing really. Even the original east coast vs west coast thing was nothing more than an industry gimmick to get new MTV fans interested in rap soap opera.</p>

<p>Now you got all these young fans watching this stuff on instagram and snapchat like 50s housewives watching their &#39;shows&#39;.</p>

<p>There&#39;s really nothing &#39;real&#39; about mainstream rap. Interscope is owned by Universal Music which is one of the big 3 record labels. Between Universal, Warner, and Sony, almost the entire record industry is controlled. They own a ton of smaller sub labels so it seems like there&#39;s more competition but really, there&#39;s not.</p>

<p>That Machine Gun Kelly kid is signed to Universal and Sony. Of course this bullshit &#39;feud&#39; is a marketing job. They talk about it on Entertainment Tonight and a million other mainstream tabloid entertainment sites.</p>

<p>If you want real hip hop, listen to stuff like Public Enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tupac and those guys were all fairly young teenagers, early 20s and were being encouraged by the new mainstream money and fame. Should check out Tupac&#39;s last interview after he got out of jail. While he looked like a gangster, that wasn&#39;t him and he pretty much recanted the label.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-tupac-qa-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-tupac-qa-story.html</a></p>

<p>Gangsters aren&#39;t exactly good people. They aren&#39;t necessarily bad either but the entire culture is fairly toxic. It&#39;s a byproduct of economic disparity and broken communities.</p>

<p>Back in the late 80s, the gang war got national attention. Instead of fixing the problem, Hollywood and the &#39;system&#39; glorified the problem and just made it seem cool. You wind up with like 12 year olds talking about &#39;shooting bitches to get their money&#39;.</p>

<p>NWA weren&#39;t gangsters. Eazy just sold weed and while him and Ren hung out around gangsters, they weren&#39;t affiliated. Neither Dre or Ice Cube were even close to being gangsters. The movie CB4 is closer to their reality than the Straight Outa Compton movie.</p>

<p>Their entire image was coached by Jerry Heller who made them intentionally controversial because they had to be more over the top than Public Enemy.</p>

<p>Guys like ICE T were proto gangster. NWA was gangster rap 1.0. Tupac would be like gangster rap 1.5.</p>

<p>The second generation ones actually did have gangster roots to a degree but mostly it was just the image and a lot of it was bullshit designed to entertain white teenagers who loved the image and had the spare cash to buy all the accessories associated to the image. Look at spinning rims. The entire tuner car trend developed due to gangster rap. A lot of stuff did. Sneakerheads, etc...</p>

<p>Stupid ass teenagers spending hundreds of dollars buying shoes made by sweatshop workers and sold at a premium. All of this stuff is derivative of the corporate appropriation of a true counterculture genre that was trying to do the exact opposite of what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like some hip-hop but I don&#39;t have an encyclopedic knowledge, but off the top of my head, there&#39;s Common, Talib Kweli and Mos Def who all have songs that speak out against the rap you&#39;re talking about. They are pretty mainstream so I&#39;m sure there people who can offer up other names.</p>

<p>Most mainstream music has always had idiotic lyrics and subject matter. Bands like Kiss and The Doors had lyrics about their penis (Jim Morrison nearly ruining &quot;The End&quot; with the line &quot;ride the snake, the snake is long&quot; etc. Bands that are supposedly great lyrically like The Smiths also have some awful lines like &quot;let me get my hands on your mammary glands&quot;. If you&#39;re talking about artists being arrogant then there&#39;s tons of examples from bands like The Stone Roses and their song &quot;I am the Resurrection&quot; or Manic Street Preachers &quot;U Love Us!</p>

<p>There&#39;s good and band music in all genres, I don&#39;t think hip-hop is alone in having questionable lyrics</p>

<p>Another thought- while the podcast is pretty much a disinformation factory Those Conspiracy Guys have a Tupac and Biggie episode that questions the popular narrative of their murders. </p>

<p>I like hip hop but as a middle class white person it&#39;s easy to see the gangster posturing as farce, but I feel the damage those tropes have caused to urban kids can&#39;t be underestimated. It&#39;s a whole genre that directly encourages behavior that reinforces poverty- shootings, selling drugs, and fucking hoes. I&#39;d need to see some evidence before I call it a conspiracy to keep blacks down though.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always believed that most of the rap &quot;beefs&quot; were designed to boost album sales, but I also think that it is done at a high level.</p>

<p>Tupac and Biggie were friends at some point.  Did that friendship devolve into hatred?  Maybe.  Everything was fucked up back then.  NWA imploded, Snoop/Dre ended their bromance, East Coast/West Coast shit was toxic.  So yeah, perhaps record labels pushed Tupac &amp; Biggie to rap about each other, use it to boost album sales, and make more out of the beef than what it was.  That shit started to influence other people though, and I believe at the end of the day, that&#39;s what got Tupac and Biggie killed.  Their beef was &quot;real&quot; to people who listened to the music, thugs that did run the streets, and built that East/West hatred to the point that they were ready to start slinging bullets for their cause.</p>

<p>After Tupac/Biggie, rap kind of fell into a lull.  They didn&#39;t have a big beef to keep pushing albums.  Along came Eminem, who signed with Dr. Dre, and then rap had the golden boy willing to trash anyone for money.  He starts off doing songs with Limp Bizcuit, then he&#39;s dissing them.  Early on, he&#39;s name dropping Kid Rock, and feuding with Insane Clown Posse, who also released several diss tracks in response.</p>

<p>Eminem is incredibly talented.  He was a white kid that rapped about white problems.  That was the next evolution of rap music.  White kids were already buying up rap albums, so they put someone out there they were willing to spend money on.  Suddenly, instead of rapping about gangs, crack-cocaine, and getting shot, we had a kid rapping about shrooms, date rape, frat guys, hating parents, and all the things white kids could identify with.</p>

<p>That became a prosperous time for rap.  Dre/Snoop ended their beef because there was more money in working together.  Feuds went crazy.  Eminem was dissing, people were biting.  Was the record label in on that?  Hell yes.  They pushed him to make those albums and write those songs.  Diss tracks and feuds generate interest.</p>

<p>Then another lull came.  Eminem had done his time as rap&#39;s angry kid and wanted to make some serious music.  He had good songs, got some pop tracks played on the radio, and then he released Rival, which was basically him rapping with a bunch of other people, making what he had found success with in recent time.  None of them were as good as his songs with Rhianna.  Mainstream tore it apart.  It sold, but not like his previous albums.</p>

<p>So, Eminem was pushed back a little bit.  His music wasn&#39;t that valuable to radio stations or record executives because he wasn&#39;t creating controversy anymore.  Kamikaze was Eminem giving in to the record executives and returning to his roots.  He was no longer the angry kid of rap, instead he had morphed into the angry dad, and it worked great.  Eminem didn&#39;t care who bit on his diss tracks, he just needed SOMEONE to bite.</p>

<p>MGK saw the opportunity, and worked with his label to respond.  Eminem, instead of waiting to put out an album, finally had what his record executives wanted -- a hook on their line.  That was the money they were after.  So, he quickly put Killshot together and posted it online so he could keep the fight going.  Trading punches sells albums.</p>

<p>Now, everyone is all hyped up about the Eminem/MGK feud.  Rap starts making headlines again.  Were Eminem and MGK in it from the beginning?  Who knows.  The record executives certainly knew what they were doing though, and they pushed the narrative.  They got the story into the headlines.  Guess what?  It&#39;s working.  Eminem is topping the charts.  MGK&#39;s song was #1 on iTunes.  Killshot was the fastest YouTube video to blow up in history.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t have to be MGK.  The bait was out there.  Any rapper could have grabbed it.  Hell, he even dangled some fruit out there for D12, and snapped a line at Cypress Hill.  The feuds are safer now.  They don&#39;t have legions of fans willing to die/kill for the cause like Tupac and Biggie.  They can safely destroy each other verbally and put all that money in the bank instead of dodging bullets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t realize they were both under Interscope Records. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was staged. I thought Eminem had a similar beef with Everlast back in the day and they each made a couple of songs about one another. I could have sworn I heard in an interview with Everlast that it was just for fun. I&#39;ll look for that clip. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can definitely see this being a tactic. I remember this hit me a while ago when I was in high school. This is especially relevant because it’s hip hop related. I remember watching 106th and park. Kanye West and 50 cent both had albums coming out September 11. If Kanye sold more than 50, 50 would quit writing. I told myself that it’s genius fabricating your own beef. They both sold ALOT of records. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it&#39;s fake and the biggest problem to this is what its created. You have s fake scenario made to be real, people believe it&#39;s real and are 100% invested in their side. We&#39;re talking about music here!! If people get this crazy over two rappers, imagine what else is staged and manipulated lol. Trump vs Clinton imo. </p>

<p>Dangerous thing that people are so blind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The history of East Coast and West coast beef is kinda complicated tho. This was egged on by the mainstream media yes, BUT it&#39;s roots are in cultural/regional snobbery. So it all wasn&#39;t manufactured, the msm just exploited it. </p>

<p>Also 2Pac beef with Biggie was over him getting shot in quad studios. Apparently 2pac was running his mouth against some big time hood and got shot over it.  Biggie wanted no part in that so he stayed out of it. This pissed Pac off, and that&#39;s how that beef started. So again it&#39;s a case of genuine conflict exploited by the entertainment news media. </p>

<p>This MGK and Eminem beef on the other hand is definitely fabricated tho 😂 </p>
