       Fentanyl was initially synthesized decades ago. What spurred the recent mass production and influx from China? Why did Fentanyl flood the market (in the midst of an already overwhelming non-synthetic opioid crisis)?

       The country’s drug of choice reflects the era’s culture and mood. It tends to be like a pendulum from heroin and downers to uppers like cocaine and more recently MDMA (big in the 90s, then again with Molly about ten years ago).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fentanyl craze is a reflection of the major opiate phase we are in. So many people are addicted with huge tolerances that dealers have been cutting the dope with fentanyl so the customers stop complaining about how “weak this shit is”. It’s really a vicious cycle because fentanyl has an even shorter half life than heroin.

       There seems to be a lot of home grown US operations as well especially in the shroom area.  Tons of psychedelic research chemicals. I don't ever take L/acid anymore due to the amount that often aren't what they advertise.  There are also a lot of mdma products like methyl one so unless you got a test kit or know a manufacturer you really need to be careful of what you are consuming.

       It is far safer to run an underground lab producing kilos of fent, than a field of opium poppy producing the same. Fent requires only a few people with some smarts and the base components. Poppy requires lots of remote land, laborers, time, and a lab is still needed in the end. At the end of the day a kilo of fent is going to be far more valuable than a kilo of impure heroin.

       Plus if you need to cross a border or move it through security, a substance 50-100x more potent means you need to move a LOT less of it.  Less people, less resources, less risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing I don't get is why the people making fentanyl haven't come up with a reliable way of diluting to "really good" heroin strength or producing tablets at expected tablet strengths.  It seems counter-productive to business to have lots of people die and draw so much negative attention.

       This is exactly what I've read elsewhere. Easier smuggling and transportation. Isn't the major issue with fentanyl that people don't know it's in whatever they're taking or aren't aware of the concentration differences? It's used for sedation fairly routinely, but it's in tiny concentrations.

       Therapeutic doses are measured in micrograms.  The potency per unit mass is so high that you can't cut it using the kinds of dry bulk methods that work with heroin.  You can't cut it with lactose on a mirror with a playing card and wind up with anything like a safe cut.  Some doses are maybe OK, some toxic, and some empty owing to the potency and size of the particles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing that it's probably really difficult to make a powdered fentanyl at "safe" doses owning to its potency.  You probably can with specialist equipment grind it to micro-meter scale chunks, but I'd wager these are prone to clumping with any kind of ambient humidity.  I'm sure somebody makes a machine that can do this, but it costs a zillion dollars and requires a clean room and advanced training.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect a "safe" powder would require some kind of chemistry magic to dilute it in a solvent and then blend it with a binding agent and then evaporating the solvent.  The solvent allows you to dilute it to reasonable doses and the binding agent allows you to wind up with a larger particle size that allows you to work with it at reasonable volumes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not the kind of chemistry that lends itself to the kitchen counter retail drug trade.

       Exactly.  The fentanyl overdoses are a direct result of prohibition driving up the cost of pure heroin and prescription pills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solving the opiod crisis is very simple:
      </p>
      <p>
       - Give adults unrestricted access to pure opiod products.  Bring back opium dens and treat it the same as alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
       - Spend billions of treatment and education instead of enforcement.

       The labs producing fentanyl aren't well-known for being scrupulous, and don't express any care for the user or the product outside of handling it with plenty of PPE. Chinese labs don't really dilute anything and they know all of it's being exported so they couldn't give a damn less about its safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       The distributors, on the other hand, should take every precaution necessary to distribute reliable doses throughout some sort of medium, but that makes them even more responsible for a user's death if and when it happens, as it would be sold at a specific, assured quantity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be sold in solution, but since it's transdermally active, a spill could mean certain death if not tended to immediately. People are stupid so I wouldn't trust anybody with an aqueous solution of a transdermally-active drug (like pure nicotine).

       the fent market is satellite of the main heroin market plus allows users to migrate between depending on their purchasing power.  No matter how bad you make fent look, by virtue of its existence it only helps the heroin trade look good.  why assume they aren't the same pushers?   The way alcohol is treated in usa, one million die yearly, I can't imagine an improvement of statistics if usa treated herion like alcohol.  Im a believer in the concept of consumer-physician approved  alcohol licenses.

       There are tons of properly dosed fentanyl pressed oxy's, you just dont hear about them because nobody dies. If one out of 10 batches is dosed incorrectly that is still a shit ton of overdoses.

       True that. U.S. would be way too hard to take down from the outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       But tensions have risen over the last few years and it is concerning:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        China knows that in the case of an armed conflict, the U.S. would simply blockade China from the entire Pacific, essentially strangling China's economy
       </li>
       <li>
        In response china creates satellite guided missile defense system (nicknamed
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DF-21">
         carrier killers
        </a>
        )
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        U.S. tests

         anti-satellite defense system
        </a>
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        China plays war games with Russia
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Not to mention all the economic and cyber aggression.
Makes me think that Trump was put in office (hand selected like every other potus) because he may just be the perfect type of asshole to stand up to china.

       Go back to the early 1900's and learn the actual business model of big Pharma and schools. Look at the Franklin Institute. If you cannot see whats going on with Fentanyl or spice from China, you have a lot of work to do.

       OP was asking for theories. Instead of adopting condescension and insinuating he's dumb for not seeing, give him glasses to see with. Be a friend. We should all be comrades on this sub, because we all have a sense that things are not as they seem. There was a post recently relating to these points.

       Ok, I didn't mean to be a dick. Just do the work. The early 1900 set forth into motion social engineering programs regarding M.D. protocol or standardization, they put the schools together and MONSANTO among others made the drugs. The program was to treat, not cure, and sell drugs. The drugs would treat symptoms and kill you in other ways. Including by whats called a nocebo. Nocebo is the opposite of placebo. Its a mind virus that turns your body on it self to execute the orders on the insert know as 'side effects'. I know , because I did the work. Look at the Opium history. That shit was potent and they said , hey wait, save that dope, we can run countries with it. And they are. Marijuana would make it ALL go away, but they are not done engineering it to kill you yet, or control ALL the crops like MONSANTO with the seed patents to own your crop too. So Study MONSANTO, its a great footprint , protocol , business model to fuck your world up with , because your living inside of it. No MONSATAN, not SUPERFUND. Whats a SUPERFUND?   see how this works. Its very simple. Use Crunchbase.com too, you'll uncover enough to be sick for a few weeks, then you'll regroup and continue, and after a few months you'll know it all too.

       You forgot the vital part of the Monsanto group. TRUMP is a puppet of the Monsanto corporation. MAGA actually stands for Monsanto And Google Alliance and their goal is to mislead the public by forcing Mr. Trump to pretend to regulate the Big Pharma but in reality, they are going to thrive and will continue to unnecessarily prescribe highly addictive drugs to the population in return for huge profits and toxify our land for short term profits.

       Hot showers, plenty of water and whatever exercise you can muster the will for will make you feel better. Otherwise, yeah- 24 more hours and you’ll be over the worst of it. By the end of the weekend you’ll be back to baseline. Take it as a valuable lesson.

       Yeah keep with it. A four week spree will leave you feeling a bit rough but it’s so much worse if you get back on the train for years before hopping off.

       Population control/ kill the junkies. Source? Former good friend was high up in the RC scene. Oh and synthetic cannabinoids were made deadly to get pot legalized, by straying big pharma away from testing synthetic derivatives of thc for medical use. None of this shit is accidental.

       Well that it was some "super shady shit goin on at the top of the chain" and that they basically wanted junkies dead. And as for the synthetic pot one, they felt it was an ultimate greater good. Fucker had his girlfriend strung on synth cannabinoids, piece of shit... Used her as a ginny pig
