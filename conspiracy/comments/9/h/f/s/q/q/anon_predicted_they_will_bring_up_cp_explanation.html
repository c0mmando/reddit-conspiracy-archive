    <div class="md"><p>My view, and just mine so far, is that the janitor&#39;s laptop full of CP was what kicked the investigation off first but when reviewing the server information, the Feds found the link to the Chinese spy ring watching the White Plains site and moved to shut down both operations.  No idea if they were linked or not, but I doubt they were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t actually write in riddles, I write as if you&#39;re capable of making the logic leaps I&#39;ve done.  That&#39;s a weakness on my part, I admit, but I had thought that these leaps were fairly simple to make.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Simply put, there really isn&#39;t a controlled opposition so much as one department, or rather at least one department, is using an actual investigation into child porn as a smoke screen to allow them to roll up an espionage ring centered on the observatory.    </p>

<p>I suspect that the FBI, as well as the DIA, NSA, and possibly even other agencies, are involved with the espionage ring investigation and are using the FBI&#39;s child porn investigation as a means to explain why they&#39;re doing such a thorough sweep of the area.  This fits the details about there being a &quot;national security&quot; risk better than any theory we have at the present.  The reason I discount the idea that this site discovered proof of alien life is because of the type of observatory it is, since solar observatories don&#39;t have the same type of capabilities that traditional stellar observatories do.  It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not open to the idea, but rather that I don&#39;t think this observatory is suited for that type of observation.  </p>

<p>Understand now what I was talking about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, actually I didn&#39;t say anything about controlled opposition, that was u/Absurvatory.  </p>

<p>That you can&#39;t seem to follow a simple thought process and obviously lack any kind of attention to detail has nothing to do with any perceived snark on my part previous to this post.  I&#39;ll fully admit that I&#39;m getting a bit bored with leading you by the hand through the logic, but you continue to fail to understand or even pay attention, so that&#39;s a natural reaction to someone wasting my time.  Either grow up and pay attention to what&#39;s going on or don&#39;t be surprised when you&#39;re treated like a child.  </p>

<p>That decision rests with you, not me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or, may be what they found on the laptop is something else entirely?</p>

<p>That 
Chinese hacking&quot; meme is about as silly as anything I&#39;ve seen to date. Claims made obviously by those and for those who have no clue how state hacking may work. </p>

<p>As to what was actually found on the laptop, I still think it was one of those &quot;glitches&quot; in the simulation that happen now and then. Except this time it might have been a tad too obvious.</p>

<p>I still love the imagery of the telescope&#39;s capture of [part of] the sun suddenly reverting to a grid, unmistakebly. I like this one better than a nice round dark hole suddenly popping up in the middle of the sun. The grid would play better as a movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, this is just an image that&#39;s a favorite of mine from the days of Star Trek. If you recall the holodeck, there was once an episode I vaguely recall when something went wrong with the holodeck program and suddenly it was just the &quot;grid&quot; visible, laid out like floor tiles.</p>

<p>Not saying this is how the simulation of which we may all be part works (jury still out on that one) but the image of a &quot;grid&quot; that underlies our entire observable universe is kind of fun to contemplate.</p>

<p>My guess is that works something like fractals and/or multihedron geometric patterns, if at all. Throw in some music and color and it&#39;s a world.</p>

<p>PS I got books to recommend from actual astrophysicists if you are interested. The readable versions, of course. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not everyone and everything is a pedo. Just those who are rich and powerful. Which is backed up by an almost endless stream of evidence. This is of course done on purpose because the easiest way to control others is by popularizing something the regular public would burn you alive for, and use it to hold over their head as some kind of initiation rite into the group. Secondly by doing it in a way that is inherently crazy/spooky/unusual you can make anyone who tries to leak activity out to be some kind of crazy person. You have these get together&#39;s/&quot;rituals&quot; seem like some kind of satanic cult, which the general public knows to ignore claims of, so anyone who&#39;s trying to stop all the child rape/torture/murder etc... fall on deaf ears.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the use of various accusations which permanently destroy someone&#39;s reputation or are almost impossible to defend against due to our corrupt biased court system i/e rape, pedophilia, etc... If you want someone to shut up and go away all you really have to do is accuse them of pedophilia or worse by setting them up with child porn which is a well known tactic in espionage. It&#39;s not hard to do at all as all you have to do is get access to their computer(s)/electronic devices and put it on it. Then you claim evidence of them having child porn after which the police will absolutely get warrants which ultimately result in finding the planted evidence. They will be treated as guilty instantly and no one will listen to their pleas of innocence. It&#39;s easy to set it up to make it basically impossible to defend against in a court of law if it even ever makes it considering the prevalence of being murdered while in jail/prison. You would have to catch someone trying to break into your house/computers etc... on video or even just record your every single moment to prove you never downloaded/obtained such an item. Which is almost impossible to do due to having it setup to lose power/internet which would cut off your connection unless you have backups.</p>

<p>100% with you there, it&#39;s an insanely powerful blackmail technique.  I don&#39;t know for certain if &#39;they&#39; actually do it, but the theory is terrifyingly sound.  The idea of &quot;<em>do this or we show the public</em>&quot; has destroyed plenty of people before.  Some people go so far as to kill themselves rather than face life after exposure like that.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even really have to prove anything these days anyway.  Just accusing someone of rape/CP or the likes and their career is instantly over and reputation completely destroyed.  Even if they go to court afterwards and win, it&#39;s too late, the damage is done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more of &quot;everyone does this to get into the group, don&#39;t you want to be one of us?&quot; then they film it or get evidence and basically say &quot;now remember if you try to fuck us you&#39;ll be fucking yourself&quot;. In rape/CP cases the courts are so against men it&#39;s insane. They don&#39;t even have to have evidence of any of it, the accusation alone is enough most of the time as they basically pressure you into taking a plea deal or you face life in jail. Someone from your past came come up and say you did something to them 30 years ago and it&#39;s taken as fact. No idea how all of that got so bad but most likely is tied to the stranger danger, all men rape, all men will try to touch your child, all men are sex hungry monsters, etc... mentality that is so popular in our culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends if you trust NASA on this:</p>

<p>&quot;the prominence is situated below a tunnel-shape feature called a filament channel. &quot;When you look at it from the edge of the sun, what you actually see is a spherical object. You&#39;re actually looking down the tunnel. And this tunnel sits up top of the filament&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking down a tunnel? Even as it moves away from the sun? Hmmm...not buying it. That explanation doesn&#39;t make much sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks very strange, kind of like a drop of water hanging onto a surface, reluctant to let go.</p>

<p>The explanation is a bit.. hard to believe for me, and here is why.</p>

<p>1.) it looks and behaves differently than all the other solar prominences I&#39;ve watched (because of this I watched a bunch of gifs of them).</p>

<p>2.) &gt;But why is the prominence dark? Gurman explained that all the light in the SDO images is the same color — a specific wavelength that is emitted by iron atoms that have been ionized 13 times, known as Fe XIV. The dark filament seen in the images (the refueling UFO&#39;s &quot;tether,&quot; according to YouTube users) is a part of the prominence that happens to absorb light of this color, making it appear dark. &quot;The absorption is typically seen in lines such as Fe XIV only in the thinnest, densest parts of the prominence, which is here seen edge-on as it rotates over the solar limb,&quot;</p>

<p>Okay, but there is a frontal bulk to this phenomena that is clearly very large, but is equally dark.  So I am left questioning that explanation.  Furthermore the sun is covered with prominences in that original gif, and we can see that literally none of them look remotely like the one we are discussing.</p>

<p>3.)  The behavior in terms of movement seems weird.  The attaching filament is clearly <em>very</em> thin, relatively speaking, and yet the &quot;burst&quot; (as described in the explanation) seems to do nothing for quite some time.  Then suddenly it pulls away, and then seems to .... accelerate?  Why would it accelerate after detaching, wouldn&#39;t it only slow down after the moment of detaching, due to gravity?</p>

<p>4.)  The bulk of this phenomena is clearly <em>very</em> well defined in terms of shape, and does not disburse throughout the entire gif.  It rigidly holds it&#39;s shape.  Unlike every single other prominence.  So why does that happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spot on.</p>

<p>I replied to my own comment earlier questioning NASA&#39;s explanation because I&#39;m not buying it either.</p>

<p>After seeing this and noting it happened in 2012, I wanted to see if I could find ANY similar phenomenon with imagery of filaments, prominence and solar mass ejections. Nothing looks even remotely close to this one.</p>

<p>There was also that satellite footage where NASA captured the moon eclipsing the sun twice in different directions within a short time span. They explained that as retrograde motion, which makes sense. But after seeing that 2012 footage, I&#39;m keeping open the possibility that double eclipse might have been caused by something else.</p>

<p>Then finally you have the weird story about FBI shutting down Sunspot observatory due to the janitor having child porn? Come one now...something fishy is afoot! Maybe it&#39;s all connected, maybe not, but I&#39;m left wondering since there isn&#39;t an ideal explanation for these things.</p>

Then I did some digging. <a href="https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/img/dailymov/2012/03/08/20120308_1024_0193.mp4">This</a> is from 3 days earlier. You can see the prominence in the bottom left starting to form. But wait, you can also see another prominence form and detach (all in one day) at the top right. It also appears spherical like the original GIF. So, IDK, I&#39;m going to go back to the depressing opinion that the original GIF is a natural phenomena instead of a giant sunsucking spaceship. Solar prominences are massive, though. They&#39;re neat I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lets say some 3 letter agency had to shut this down.  they knew people would spaz out about it.  so they need an excuse.   </p>

<p>they know extremely well that sites like 4chan are a direct way to drop info - so they give 4chan exactly what they want.  they know the site is heavily against pedos/cheese pizza so they create an explanation that would appease 4chan (and the like) to cover their own tracks.  </p>

<p>the shutting down of the other observatories and the solar observing satellite are all we need to know.  i emailed one of the ressearchers at sunspot - absolutely clueless to what happened.</p>
