       This seems the obvious thing to do if Mueller is a crock, he could easily reopen the 911 investigation, find Mueller had obstructed justice and fire him...

       It sucks that Trump supporters don't challenge it and believe q saying it's coming... It's not going to happen even though Trump promised all Americans he would do it. I'd like to see us all, regardless of party preference, to ask this from him in good faith. Is he really a maverick, or just another face for the rulers. I'd be less critical of the poor being butt fucked if we got this.

       We're basically just waiting to see the real evidence like everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, we are convinced that Q and POTUS are working together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many are convinced that they are working in our interests, but the core of this group will turn on Q and Trump on a dime if we have good reason to believe that isn't the case. We aren't zealous blind followers, and I encourage everyone here to question everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrary to your claim that Trump supporters don't challenge and just believe, we came to the conclusion that Q is legit by endlessly scrutinizing his posts and researching what they had to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, we have good reason to believe that something explosive will be contained within the 20 pg FISA declassification.  If that isn't the case, then Q will be more or less dead, and I doubt Trump will win another election. I'm not really sure what will happen, and I am weary that this whole thing will backfire. But Q has been an incredible source for the last 10 months for anyone who was willing to pay attention.

       Q is honestly just getting trump peeps to sleep on the Sept 28 Palestine peace buy out. When Obama did JCPOA and made American firms that illegally seized Iran's money because a few bad men, it was blasted and so controversial. Now Trump is hiding the Israel sell out. Shows you who trumps daddy is and a lot of Trump supporters hate Israel's leadership but have been quiet because they trust trump. If this was Obama, it would be nutssss

       Trump is going to use the 9/11 information just as it looks like hes going to be outed for the treasonous fraud that he is and he will use that to take complete control and then the NWO plan will be put into full motion. Trump is the little horn from the book of Daniel

       Honest question, as im not in the Trump club. Did people really vote for him based on the fact that they thought he would open an investigation into 9/21?

       9/21? A lot probably did. A lot probably voted for him because they know 9/11 was a lie also.

       So your moral system says two people who seemingly love each other and are faithful is less preferable than a serial adulterer and literal illegal immigrant (can’t work on a tourist visa) because you’d prefer to picture one couple in your head more because of how their parts match up. Good to know!

       Yep. Most people with newborn children at home are off spending money to have sex with women who aren’t their childrens’ mother(s) instead of spending time with or caring for the child.

       Are you serious? I honestly don’t care who he stuck his dick into or when but you can’t claim he’s a devoted/caring/whatever word you want to use family man given the clear evidence to the contrary.

       If he does it and the new investigation concludes that the first investigation was wrong and the CIA or mossad or someone else did it, all the people who believe the first investigation won't believe this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there are the people who hate Trump and won't believe anything he says or does simply because it's Trump.

       A new 9/11 investigation would be pointless.  People made up their minds long ago, and nothing is going to change them.

       Trump said his mission, as the political outsider, was to upend “the establishment”. Whether that’s the Intelligence Community, political elite, Mainstream news, didn’t matter to him; no one was safe, or so he said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reopening the investigation would be perhaps his opportunity to blow the lid on everything, or at least present the public with the right questions. Did everyone think that “the establishment” (which both R’s and D’s have bemoaned for decades as a political buzzword) would be disrupted quietly? Was Trump suggesting that he could infiltrate and shut it down by his lonesome? Americans plead for revolution, but no one seems to be willing to stop talking bullshit and take a swing. If there were more political factions, i think civil war would likely break out. However, that doesn’t benefit Trump or anyone that may be pulling the strings (not yet, at least), or else he’d be keeping his promises, right?

       People cannot argue with hard evidence though. So if there is something that's been swept under the rug that gets brought into the light, it could be an entirely different story.

       Also, dumb people have been conditioned to believe the official 9/11 narrative. They can be conditioned in the other direction if need be. Sheep are easily led.

       Replace the name "Trump" in your comment with "Bill Clinton."  Your comment is MORE factual with "Bill Clinton" because Trump hasn't been in office for "4 years" as you claim.  Not to mention, actual impeachment.

       You aren't objective if you can't understand that the scandal you speak of was created by his opponents. How can you be 'anyone but Hillary' yet take the side of those who have been proven to be working on her behalf.

       I barely supported Trump going into election. My support for him blossomed when it was clear they were engaged in a soft coup detat to remove him starting with the bogus recounts and electoral college scheme. This is a coup against the voters as much as it is against Trump on Hillary Clinton's behalf.

       trump said they were going to release damaging info on hillary days before the tt meeting.

       Yes, they did play a role in the Trump Tower meeting trying to entrap Trump. Nothing he did there was illegal and no worse than Hillary Clinton paying a British spy to produce intel to use to justify an investigation into Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       What politicians show you that they 'care about the people'? That is a ridiculous demand. Regardless, Trump has avoided more wars, clamped down on illegal immigration, lowered everyone's taxes, and promoted job growth in this country. Things are better now than they were under Obama or Bush.

       He didn't collude. He talked to an activist/lobbyist not a foreign agent like Hillary Clinton openly did.

       The Steele Dossier was paid by Hillary Clinton's campaign and was used as a source to spy on Trump. This is the height of government corruption using the FBI to attack political opponents.

       They've set a tentative date of Sept 28 for Israel's offer that'll lead to annexing the west bank. No body in America is talking about it, but it's literally how Hitler got Poland. Offer a shit deal. When the opposition balks at such a shit deal, you invade and act like you offered peace and were met with hostility...

       Messianic jews in the Likudniks and through Chabad-Lubavitch have it pushed In hopes to bring about the Jewish messiah. It's crazy to search kushners Chabad connection and how it connects to putin and Netanyahu. If you research Chabad more, they are jewish pagan mystic group connecting wicca, mythraism, and other pagan philosophy.

       When you look back in history, situations like this can bubble for years and then explode with activity, but we are stuck in a short term feedback loop mindset. That being said, you are right to point out that he should re-open the 9/11 investigation.

       The easy answer is "Trump doesn't really care about x" where "x" is whatever thing he's promised to look into/fix/get rid of/etc. I personally don't believe he's a puppet, he just says whatever thing he needs to do to look good in the moment, but has once that moment's gone he's off onto the next thing.
