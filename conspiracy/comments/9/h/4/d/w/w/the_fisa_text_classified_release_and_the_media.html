        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I could be wrong, but it seems to me that Trump calling for the release of the classified documents and texts in the run up to the Russian investigation is huge. The biggest story going right now. Bigger, by far, than the Kavanaugh story. (the White House statement - <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-34/">https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-34/</a>)</p>

<p>With the Democratic leadership opposing it, it&#39;s even bigger. (<a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/7/pelosi-schumer-schiff-warner-write-letter-to-odni-director-coats-on-national-security-risk-of-widely-releasing-classified-documents-to-house-and-senate-intelligence-committee-members">https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/7/pelosi-schumer-schiff-warner-write-letter-to-odni-director-coats-on-national-security-risk-of-widely-releasing-classified-documents-to-house-and-senate-intelligence-committee-members</a>)</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not being covered. At all.</p>

<p>Drudge doesn&#39;t mention any of the story on his page.
It&#39;s missing from CNN.
Washington Post has a negative story below the fold on their digital front page (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/trumps-declassification-order-rewards-allies-strategy-of-sidestepping-congress/2018/09/18/7655c196-b839-11e8-a2c5-3187f427e253_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/trumps-declassification-order-rewards-allies-strategy-of-sidestepping-congress/2018/09/18/7655c196-b839-11e8-a2c5-3187f427e253_story.html</a>)
New York Times is silent.
Fox News has an opinion piece on it (<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/09/18/gregg-jarrett-if-rod-rosenstein-defies-trumps-order-to-declassify-documents-should-be-fired.html">http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/09/18/gregg-jarrett-if-rod-rosenstein-defies-trumps-order-to-declassify-documents-should-be-fired.html</a>). </p>

<p>That&#39;s it. </p>

<p>Out of the big news places, that&#39;s the coverage. </p>

<p>Am I wrong in thinking this may be one of the biggest stories of our time? The fact that the Dems oppose the release make me think that even more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct. This is the first in the series of falling dominoes. The information from this declassification will likely lead to evidence of sedition and treason. Obama used FISA and the cooperation of FVEYS (primarily  British GCHQ) to spy on a presidential candidate.  The testimonies from this will point to U1 and further power abuses by Congress and the Senate. I will be watching closely as this unravels.
Enjoy the show! üçø </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP listed several things that were all completely misleading, flat out lying. While making several demonstrably incorrect statements, he very dramatically tried to stir up peoples emotions.</p>

<p>When someone commented with the correct information, he sloppily tried to twist and change what he said instead of acknowledging of even just ignoring it. His edit doesnt even make sense until you scroll to this exchange. And so, many will continue to not learn the actual story. His response also indicates he knew he was being misleading.</p>

<p>He <em>was</em> talking about ‚Äúbelow the fold‚Äù.. the <em>one time</em> in which he actually stated it, with the washington post. He cared first and foremost about creating fear. And he hugely undermined the actual topic at hand.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope he eventually declassifies everything. At this point he probably declassifies what supports the narrative that the FISA warrant were almost unsubstantiated. There&#39;s some parts in the 32 pages that are not relevant here, and could be a national security concern (like details on russian activities). But overall, I think a full declassification is better for the US than non-transparancy, so I really hope they go the full monty here.</p>

<p>Well, they&#39;re not really in isolation. <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4614708/Carter-Page-FISA-Application.pdf">see for yourself</a>. The bits that are declassified are the bits about the Steele dossier (Source #1) and it&#39;s corroboration as well as the role of Page in the Trump campaign. That&#39;s the relevant part to Trump.</p>

<p>It depends, but we can&#39;t know without seeing the full unredacted documents. If I&#39;m looking at WHAT he wants to declassify, it seems to be only the relevant things, which would keep damage to any running investigation minimal but would expose either Schiff or Nunes. However, from the redacted document it&#39;s very hard to tell, so again, we can only decide that when we get to see the full document.</p>

<p>I disagree here. This declassifies just about all of the PC from the warrant. If the PC is flawed, then a lot of what Mueller has will fall through because of the &#39;fruit of the poisonous tree&#39; doctrine.</p>

<p>Why would this HELP him this election?   </p>

<p>If they release it<br/>
* and the majority of the country is legitimately worried about him<br/>
* and this FISA application was built on actual evidence<br/>
this would only make him look bad and encourage people<br/>
* to only vote democrat. 
* to encourage democratic leaders to impeach  </p>

<p>If they don&#39;t release it<br/>
* and the majority of the country is legitimately worried about him<br/>
* ~~and this FISA application was built on actual evidence ~~ <strong>irrelevant</strong><br/>
this would only make democrats look bad and encourage people<br/>

<p>This couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. A portion of the population is wholly against anything he does regardless of positive or negative context and vice versa. The majority of the country considers itself independent. Independents who lean right are still likely to vote right but they are also capable of switching their vote in a scenario like this.</p>

<p>Trump doesn&#39;t understand that, though. He thinks that more than 50% of the country loves him and will vote for him regardless when that number is much closer to 30%. In fact, when you factor in old school Republicans who hate the guy, and they do exist, the number of his base gets closer to ~20%. If you consider yourself a Democrat, give or take a few outliers, then you fall into 30% of the country who hates Trump, leaving 40% of the voters who could go either way. I personally feel it is safe to assume that more than half of that 40% will vote against Trump because no sane, rational person can look at the facts and behavior and not find it laughably disgusting. </p>

<p>But, as mentioned above, a good portion of Independents still lean right. This is why u/ramalamadingdongs isn&#39;t wrong in saying that releasing the documents is bad for Trump. People who lean right have a chance to see objective evidence of wrongdoing by people who surrounded Trump during the campaign. When that information becomes more clear and everything else is taken into consideration, it makes the right leaning independent reconsider and (hopefully) vote left.</p>

<p>TLDR Trump is hurting himself by doing this, but he&#39;s too stupid to realize it. Even with information redacted, the visible information is only being viewed as a positive for Trump by people who already love Trump. He just thinks more of those people exist when, in reality, they are the minority.</p>

<p>This is the biggest nonsense I have ever heard. It makes me very angry to hear it. The dems are the ones who used FISA to spy on a presidential candidate. It&#39;s an abomination and democrats don&#39;t give a shit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So in this case the key wording to me (and I am not a lawyer) is this:</p>

<p>[Office of Intelligence] further confirmed that the [Foreign Surveillance Court] considered the Page warrant applications based upon written submissions and did not hold any hearings.</p>

<p>Hearings aren&#39;t necessarily required if the written submissions were plenty of evidence. At least that would be my limited understanding.</p>

<p>Frankly the FISA court is shadowy and my understanding of the legal requirements and proper protocol is limited.</p>

<p>However, like I said I am interested in a hypothetical approach not to debate the incomplete public record of what did or did not happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now that I have answered your question, please put the shoe on the other food. Should all allegations be trusted? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all you didn&#39;t answer my question, do you think presidential candidates should be immune to possible investigation?</p>

<p>Second, are you talking about hypothetical allegations or the actual case? If there is hypothetical evidence that a presidential candidate is working with a foreign power I would want that investigated despite the potential conflict.</p>

<p>This statement isn&#39;t confusing; I&#39;m not saying the basics are confusing I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t know what legally constitutes evidence and what is normal precedence or if anything exceptional was done in the FISA court.</p>

<p>As far as Loretta Lynch is concerned, why would anyone not expect the acting attorney general to sign off on a warrant?

<p>This is the opposite of that. You are now saying it is a scandal because they properly masked people in the FISA warrant. Because they didn&#39;t name Hillary Clinton and the campaign as helping pay for the dossier it is void. Despite it being listed as a political source.</p>

<p>Because that would directly feed into the narrative Trump was spinning that the election was rigged. Obama went to the congressional Republicans and McConnell said he would spin it as interference if Obama tried anything.</p>

<p>&quot;‚ÄúThe Obama folks did not want any public statement they made about what the Russians were doing to look partisan,‚Äù Isikoff said, ‚Äúbecause they were afraid that Trump would use it for political effect. So their idea was, ‚ÄòWell, if we can get Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan to sign on to a bipartisan statement, that might cushion the White House from any attacks made by Trump that Obama was trying to tilt the election in favor of Hillary Clinton.‚Äô‚Äù</p>

<p>McConnell refused to sign the joint statement, leaving Obama out on his own.&quot;</p>

<p>Manafort is the first guilty flipper Mueller has snagged, and the first person who was actually present at the Trump Tower meeting (we&#39;ve seen his notes, remember he took a note of a number which coincidentally lines up with the brokerage fee on the rosneft sale, but I digress...)</p>

<p>So, time will tell. This is still early days for any special prosecutor in history remember. How long was Ken Starr?</p>

<p>Please have a look at these</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks like Mueller had bigger messes to clean than Carter or Manafort. He spent the last year of position firing top FBI people investigation the Collusion case. Perhaps Mueller had bigger problems while on the surface prosecuting people for taxes and bank Fraud. Manafort was foreign agent, that was no secret since he worked for Podesta Group.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Government lawyers have a long and successful history of pushing back in national security prosecutions to prevent the disclosure of those applications to defendants, said David Laufman, who ran the Justice Department&#39;s counterintelligence unit before launching a private law practice earlier this year.</p>

<p>&quot;The president&#39;s declassification order ‚Äî especially because it is transparently motivated by partisan political considerations ‚Äî will likely make it harder for prosecutors to maintain that winning record because some judges will be more skeptical of the government&#39;s arguments that disclosure would do serious harm to U.S national security,&quot; Laufman said.</p>

<p>FISC, like most of &quot;national security&quot; apparatus, is detrimental to any notion of an open society, so if nothing else comes of this, the prospect of future sunlight on this secret court would be a good thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is this downvoted? Yahoo News journalist Isikoff himself said that he was astonished to see that his article was quoted in the FISA application because it was based on the same document (the Steele dossier) the FBI already had. To quote a press report of something the FBI already has in order to create the impression that there is more, independent evidence (and perhaps in order not to have to mention the Steele dossier directly) is certainly a questionable way to obtain a FISA warrant.<br/>
This has been discussed here:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7v3xij/yahoo_news_journalist_isikoff_stunned_his_article/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7v3xij/yahoo_news_journalist_isikoff_stunned_his_article/</a>  </p>

<p>Now, of course, this in old news, but I think it is certainly worth finding more about it, and the release of additional documents related to these events could be important.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The eighth paragraph:</p>

<p>a) Steele was suspended and then terminated as an FBI source for what the FBI defines as the most serious of violations -- an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his relationship with the FBI in an October 30, 2016, Mother Jones article by David Corn. Steele should have been terminated for his previous undisclosed contacts with Yahoo and other outlets in September -- before the Page application was submitted to the FISC in October -- but Steele improperly concealed from and lied to the FBI about those contacts.</p>

<p>That is accurate. The ninth paragraph:</p>

<p>b) Steele&#39;s numerous encounters with the media violated the cardinal rule of source handling -- maintaining confidentiality -- and demonstrated that Steele had become a less than reliable source for the FBI.</p>

<p>That is accurate. In the initial FISA application, the FBI argued that Steele had not leaked to the media. In later applications, the bureau admitted Steele had leaked but maintained that he was still credible because he only leaked after providing the dossier allegations.</p>

<p>The tenth paragraph:</p>

<p>3) Before and after Steele was terminated as a source, he maintained contact with DOJ via then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, a senior DOJ official who worked closely with Deputy Attorneys General Yates and later Rosenstein. Shortly after the election, the FBI began interviewing Ohr, documenting his communications with Steele. For example, in September 2016, Steele admitted to Ohr his feelings against then-candidate Trump when Steele said he &quot;was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.&quot; This clear evidence of Steele&#39;s bias was recorded by Ohr at the time and subsequently in official FBI files -- but not reflected in any of the Page FISA applications.</p>

<p>That is accurate. The eleventh paragraph:</p>

<p>a) During this same time period, Ohr&#39;s wife was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation of opposition research on Trump. Ohr later provided the FBI with all of his wife&#39;s opposition research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign via Fusion GPS. The Ohrs&#39; relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably concealed from the FISC.</p>

<p>That is accurate, although one could argue whether the information here was really required for the FISA application; also, the &quot;inexplicably concealed&quot; reference is the opinion of the House committee.</p>

<p>The twelfth paragraph:</p>

<p>4) According to the head of the counterintelligence division, Assistant Director Bill Priestap, corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its &quot;infancy&quot; at the time of the initial Page FISA application. After Steele was terminated, a source validation report conducted by an independent unit within FBI assessed Steele&#39;s reporting as only minimally corroborated. Yet, in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump on a summary of the Steele dossier, even though it was -- according to his June 2017 testimony -- &quot;salacious and unverified.&quot; While the FISA application relied on Steele&#39;s past record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters, it ignored or concealed his anti-Trump financial and ideological motivations. Furthermore, Deputy Director McCabe testified before the Committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information.</p>

<p>That is accurate. The thirteenth, and final, paragraph:</p>

<p>5) The Page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos, but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page and Papadopoulos. The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok. Strzok was reassigned by the Special Counsel&#39;s Office to FBI Human Resources for improper text messages with his mistress, FBI Attorney Lisa Page (no known relation to Carter Page), where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton, whom Strzok had also investigated. The Strzok/Lisa Page texts also reflect extensive discussions about the investigation, orchestrating leaks to the media, and include a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an &quot;insurance&quot; policy against President Trump&#39;s election.</p>

<p>The irony of all of this, is that in order for the FBI to verify the information provided to them by Steele, they would have needed to verify the sources Steele used to gather his information. Using Steele as a reliable source and therefore accepting the dossier as admissible evidence is not adequate considering he lied to the FBI about his media contacts, and secondly, the SOURCE of the information needs to be vetted and verified, not Steele. This is basic shit and the FISA court completely failed. </p>

<p>Here is what I&#39;m talking about. It was the Papadopoulos investigation that became the Mueller investigation.</p>

<p>This is contradicted by Schiff&#39;s counter memo that states it was outlined what happened with Steele. It gets us right back to the tit-for-tat that is happening because we don&#39;t have the actual unredacted information.</p>

<p>How do you know this is the proper procedure for this? I am legitimately asking do you know the actual requirements for seeking a FISA warrant and how and/or what must be disclosed?</p>

<p>Note: I am not a fan of secret courts just that you are acting like you know exactly how they work is confusing to me.</p>

<p>Verifying Steele is not verifying the information he compiled. </p>

<p>Simply saying that Steele is credible because they had worked with him before sure as hell doesn&#39;t cut it because the FBI had fired him for his misconduct.</p>

<p>The INFORMATION and SOURCES must be verified, not Steele. Steele&#39;s credibility is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Steele&#39;s bias is absolutely relevant considering the fact that the FBI never verified the actual sources and instead leaned on Steele&#39;s credibility, which turned out he had zero. It matters because Nellie Ohr worked for the same company as Steele, and Nellie Ohrs husband Bruce continued communication with Steele even after he was fired for lying to the FBI.</p>

<p>The problem with the Papadopoulos angle is Papadopoulos is now speaking, and he was told by Misfud about Russia having dirt on Hillary.</p>

<p>The FBI claims Papadopoulos telling Downer this information is what initiated the investigation.</p>

<p>This is insane. Why would a Trump staffer telling an Australian diplomat that he was told Russia had dirt on Hillary be cited as reason to start an investigation of the Trump campaign? Did he commit a crime?</p>

<p>The reason this claim is rediculous is because the FBI already knew her emails had been hacked by Chinese.</p>

<p>Ok, I can understand how this could be a problem but isn&#39;t the proper course to investigate if it DID cause a problem?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem with the Papadopoulos angle is Papadopoulos is now speaking, and he was told by Misfud about Russia having dirt on Hillary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It started the investigation that doesn&#39;t mean it is strictly about him at this time. In what way is his talking now cause a problem? He agreed to be cooperative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI claims Papadopoulos telling Downer this information is what initiated the investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes that is the story as I understand it too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is insane. Why would a Trump staffer telling an Australian diplomat that he was told Russia had dirt on Hillary be cited as reason to start an investigation of the Trump campaign? Did he commit a crime?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He allegedly tried to arrange meetings between campaign officials and Russian officials for dirt on a political rival. This is breaks campaign law. He also lied to the FBI. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason this claim is rediculous is because the FBI already knew her emails had been hacked by Chinese.</p>

<p><a href="https://truepundit.com/fbis-comey-covered-up-china-hack-of-hillarys-emails-concealing-intel-from-congress-months-before-election-then-fbi-destroyed-the-evidence/">https://truepundit.com/fbis-comey-covered-up-china-hack-of-hillarys-emails-concealing-intel-from-congress-months-before-election-then-fbi-destroyed-the-evidence/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if this claim, that is based on anonymous sources (something everyone is quick to defend Trump with), is true. That doesn&#39;t mean Russia didn&#39;t do the same thing.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know enough about the Lenovo situation and it seems like, again, it is almost entirely based off anonymous sources.</p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<p>&quot;What Comey ‚Äî and top brass at FBI ‚Äî did do was conceal that information for five months leading up to the Nov. 2016 presidential election. The FBI likewise did not investigate the national security breach either or refer the case to the NSA or CIA, <strong>FBI sources said.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>So we already know there is an internal war happening in the FBI and that they leak stories to the press to help their own internal wars.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not discounting the story, but there is little evidence for it just anonymous reports. What is there shows it is possible as Lenovo had spyware on it and her lawyer apparently used Lenovo. However, that doesn&#39;t preclude the Russia hack even if it did happen/</p>

<p>No, they say ok we will need to speak to this witness and verify his testimony in terms of corroborating information that puts him in a position to witness the murder.</p>

<p>The reason this is ironic and it apparently went over your head is the FBI relied on Steele&#39;s credibility alone to accept the allegations in the dossier, when Steele shredded his own credibility by lying to the FBI about his media contacts. HELLO??!</p>

<p>You should probably check that out.</p>

<p>You saying Papadopoulos tried to set up meetings with Russia for dirt on a political rival being illegal is what really cracks me up.</p>

<p>Trying to set up a meeting with Russia isn&#39;t illegal. </p>

<p>The meeting never happened. There are no thought police yet.</p>

<p>The reason this is hilarious to me, is because the DNC and Hillary campaign PAID fusion GPS, who used Steele to get dirt on Trump.</p>

<p>Do you know who Steele&#39;s sources were?</p>

<p>One ‚Äúsource‚Äù cited in the Fusion GPS document is a ‚Äúsenior Russian Foreign Ministry figure‚Äù ‚Äì meaning an individual who purportedly served in the Russian Foreign Ministry at the time the dossier was produced. If the source is not fabricated, he or she may still be serving in the Russian government. Another quoted ‚Äúsource‚Äù was ‚Äúa former top-level intelligence officer still active inside the Kremlin.‚Äù</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI had used Carter Page previously to arrest Russians. </p>

<p>The FBI knew damn well who Carter Page was, as they had used him as an informant previously. They used him as an informant to arrest a couple Russians who they set up in a sting operation to try and turn Page into a Russian spy.</p>

<p>Kinda interesting that Carter Page, the guy who the FISA was targeting for his potential Russian ties, was used by the FBI as an informant to actually arrest Russians, is a free man right now, and Mueller has never interviewed the guy.</p>

<p>Page was under surveillance before the FISA? </p>

<p>I have not heard that before, anywhere...</p>

<p>FISA warrants are not like other warrants...the FISA court requires all other avenues for intelligence gathering to be exhausted before granting surveillance....other intel gathering would include a personal interview........</p>

<p>To make the claim that his credibility as an investigator is not placed into question by lying and being fired by FBI is....odd...</p>

<p>The question of how Russia got dirt on Hillary isn&#39;t relevant, and there is no evidence they were actively trying to work with the Trump campaign. </p>

<p>The FBI stated way back that it was highly likely that others had hacked Hillary&#39;s emails. </p>

<p>Its not illegal to obtain information about the opposing candidate. It is however illegal to use a law firm to hide payments to a political group to fabricate allegations against a political opponent, and then use the fabricated information as a means to obtain a FISA warrant that allows you to conduct surveillance on a political opponent. Which is the reason the text messages between Strozk and Page are important. Strozk told Page they would stop Trumps election and that they have an insurance policy. So yeah its highly unprofessional and suspect. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The government is said to have applied for more surveillance on Page at some point in January or February 2017, and then again in late April or May 2017, and again in July or August ‚Äî with the latter applications approved by newly sworn-in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. (Rosenstein is special counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs boss and ultimately oversees the investigation that Trump hopes to discredit.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/us/politics/rod-rosenstein-carter-page-secret-memo.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/us/politics/rod-rosenstein-carter-page-secret-memo.html</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That isn&#39;t what the above article says:</p>

<p>&quot;To obtain the warrant involving Mr. Page, the government needed to show probable cause that he was acting as an agent of Russia. Once investigators get approval from the Justice Department for a warrant, prosecutors take it to a surveillance court judge, who decides whether to approve it.&quot;</p>

<p>This is my problem I am not an expert in FISC procedure and if it was handled legally or not. No offense, but I don&#39;t believe you are either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The question of how Russia got dirt on Hillary isn&#39;t relevant, and there is no evidence they were actively trying to work with the Trump campaign. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have no hard evidence yet that doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist. That is the whole point of the investigation. It is entirely relevant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To make the claim that his credibility as an investigator is not placed into question by lying and being fired by FBI is....odd...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also don&#39;t have the exact information shown to the FISA court so we are both kinda relying on whichever spin we prefer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI stated way back that it was highly likely that others had hacked Hillary&#39;s emails. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they did not state it was highly likely; in fact they said the exact opposite.</p>

<p>&quot;FBI and Justice Department officials have said publicly that there was no evidence Clinton‚Äôs server was hacked by a foreign power. Former FBI Director James Comey said at a July 2016 news conference that the FBI did not find direct evidence that the sever had been successfully hacked though he also acknowledged that, ‚Äúgiven the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved,‚Äù it would have been unlikely for the bureau to find such direct evidence.</p>

<p>A June report from the Justice Department‚Äôs inspector general on the FBI‚Äôs handling of the Clinton investigation said FBI specialists did not find evidence that the server had been hacked, with one forensics agent saying he felt ‚Äúfairly confident that there wasn‚Äôt an intrusion.‚Äù&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Except the Page case started AFTER he left the campaign. How does surveilling from the FBI on someone that used to work on the campaign (and according to Trump wasn&#39;t actually a part of the campaign) turn into spying on political rivals?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hich is the reason the text messages between Strozk and Page are important. Strozk told Page they would stop Trumps election and that they have an insurance policy. So yeah its highly unprofessional and suspect. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree it is unprofessional just because they used official FBI phones which recorded them. Are you honestly suggesting FBI agents aren&#39;t allowed to have political opinions or share them with others?</p>

<p>The OIG investigated Strozk and found no wrong doing on his part. You are grasping at straws with no evidence. Sure if he did try to stop Trump directly for political reasons that is bad and deserves to be treated as a crime. However, there is no evidence of such behavior beyond words in a private text.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you paying any attention to real facts at all?  Apparently not.  There has been zero corruption by Trump.  Mueller has said Trump is not under investigation.  Believe me, with all the leaking from Meuller‚Äôs team, if Trump was doing anything illegal, we would have heard about it by now.  It‚Äôs time for you all to wake up or the next few months are going to be very painful for you.</p>

<p>why? They only had evidence Russia was meddling not what Trump did or did not.</p>

<p>They jeopordized the integrity of the election.</p>

<p>Anything they did would jeopardize it. I agree doing nothing was a poor choice but it was the gamble they took.</p>

<p>The American people want Trump to be President.</p>

<p>Well enough to that he won.</p>

<p>Clearly but irrelevant to the discussion at hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The eighth paragraph:</p>

<p>a) Steele was suspended and then terminated as an FBI source for what the FBI defines as the most serious of violations -- an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his relationship with the FBI in an October 30, 2016, Mother Jones article by David Corn. Steele should have been terminated for his previous undisclosed contacts with Yahoo and other outlets in September -- before the Page application was submitted to the FISC in October -- but Steele improperly concealed from and lied to the FBI about those contacts.</p>

<p>That is accurate. The ninth paragraph:</p>

<p>b) Steele&#39;s numerous encounters with the media violated the cardinal rule of source handling -- maintaining confidentiality -- and demonstrated that Steele had become a less than reliable source for the FBI.</p>

<p>That is accurate. In the initial FISA application, the FBI argued that Steele had not leaked to the media. In later applications, the bureau admitted Steele had leaked but maintained that he was still credible because he only leaked after providing the dossier allegations.</p>

<p>The tenth paragraph:</p>

<p>3) Before and after Steele was terminated as a source, he maintained contact with DOJ via then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, a senior DOJ official who worked closely with Deputy Attorneys General Yates and later Rosenstein. Shortly after the election, the FBI began interviewing Ohr, documenting his communications with Steele. For example, in September 2016, Steele admitted to Ohr his feelings against then-candidate Trump when Steele said he &quot;was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.&quot; This clear evidence of Steele&#39;s bias was recorded by Ohr at the time and subsequently in official FBI files -- but not reflected in any of the Page FISA applications.</p>

<p>That is accurate. The eleventh paragraph:</p>

<p>a) During this same time period, Ohr&#39;s wife was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation of opposition research on Trump. Ohr later provided the FBI with all of his wife&#39;s opposition research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign via Fusion GPS. The Ohrs&#39; relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably concealed from the FISC.</p>

<p>That is accurate, although one could argue whether the information here was really required for the FISA application; also, the &quot;inexplicably concealed&quot; reference is the opinion of the House committee.</p>

<p>The twelfth paragraph:</p>

<p>4) According to the head of the counterintelligence division, Assistant Director Bill Priestap, corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its &quot;infancy&quot; at the time of the initial Page FISA application. After Steele was terminated, a source validation report conducted by an independent unit within FBI assessed Steele&#39;s reporting as only minimally corroborated. Yet, in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump on a summary of the Steele dossier, even though it was -- according to his June 2017 testimony -- &quot;salacious and unverified.&quot; While the FISA application relied on Steele&#39;s past record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters, it ignored or concealed his anti-Trump financial and ideological motivations. Furthermore, Deputy Director McCabe testified before the Committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information.</p>

<p>That is accurate. The thirteenth, and final, paragraph:</p>

<p>5) The Page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos, but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page and Papadopoulos. The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok. Strzok was reassigned by the Special Counsel&#39;s Office to FBI Human Resources for improper text messages with his mistress, FBI Attorney Lisa Page (no known relation to Carter Page), where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton, whom Strzok had also investigated. The Strzok/Lisa Page texts also reflect extensive discussions about the investigation, orchestrating leaks to the media, and include a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an &quot;insurance&quot; policy against President Trump&#39;s election.</p>

<p>The irony of all of this, is that in order for the FBI to verify the information provided to them by Steele, they would have needed to verify the sources Steele used to gather his information. Using Steele as a reliable source and therefore accepting the dossier as admissible evidence is not adequate considering he lied to the FBI about his media contacts, and secondly, the SOURCE of the information needs to be vetted and verified, not Steele. This is basic shit and the FISA court completely failed. </p>
