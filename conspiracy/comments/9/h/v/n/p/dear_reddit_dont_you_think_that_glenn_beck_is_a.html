       Yes.  Fox hired him to do a politically correct version of alex jones stuff and he's lifting his material wholesale and it contradicts everything he did before that.  He's a neocon.  I think they're doing it to try and keep the patriot movement types from breaking away from the neoconservative party in that their disgruntled numbers are growing and it would really hose the neconservative party if a libertarian branch broke away.

       Yeah, I think it's actually two different sets of nuts though.  Fox news generally appeals to the palin people who are the more authoritarian christian zionist types.  Those types would go the way of the bircher guys if they don't feel loved anywhere but the internet.  He's actually trying to manage a very complex task.  I don't think he's up to it.  It's too easy to see through, though I have no idea why ron paul and rand paul go on there and lend legitimacy to what he's doing.  I guess if they're just trying to reach people with their ideas they really don't care how they do it.

       O'Reilly, Olbermann, Matthews, Maddow, Hannity, Limbaugh, Beck, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you can call them news anchors, pundits, journalists, intellectuals, idiots or douche bags, you have to call them what they are first and foremost:
      </p>
      <p>
       Actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       They might have had they're philosophical and political stances before joining MSM showbiz, but they rose to the top by joining the great bandwagon of partisan politics.  Limbaugh, Hannity, Beck, and O'Reilly stood right behind the neocons during the Bush era, selling widespread corruption and denouncing their political opponents as weak pussy liberals that want the terrorist to defeat the US. The new puppet, Obama comes along, so now they call him a fascist tyrant, when he's merely expanding the policies of rendition and constant warfare that the Neocons accelerated under Bush.  Olbermann, Maddow, and Matthews are now propped up on the podium calling opposition to Obama racists extremists, while occasionally being critical of Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember when and why I stopped watching professional wrestling. I wasn't that big of a fan, I had watched it for almost a year.  I thought Stone Cold Steve Austin was kind of a bad ass because he drank tons of beer and was the number one anti establishment wrestler.  I don't remember when it was, maybe like eight years ago, the writers for WWF decided to make Steve Austin join Vince McMann.  That's when I gave up on WWF, when the number one bad ass became a douche bag.  Well, I gave up on Olbermann right when he decided to bend over for Obama. Olbermann, Matthews, etc., are actors just like Stone Cold Steve Austin, and they'll transform their character and approach for ratings. Except sometimes, it might back fire.

       They're all strawmen. Beck is a little more obvious to spot. The rest of the strawmen on other networks respond to Beck's hijacking of conspiracy theories in an attempt to discredit the people who believe them. The strawmen have been in high gear lately, because of the anger shown by the American people at the town halls, and because of the internet and websites like this. They've lost control of the discourse because their version of reality is looking less and less... realistic.

       I believe I saw something the other day, where CNN or MSNBC hosts were referring to the secessionist movements as "tenthers" following the "truther", "birther" and "deather" memes they're so fond of trotting out. I find that very honest of the media, revealing openly what amendments they do or don't like, its not as if we didn't know which ones they like anyways.

       Glenn Beck is an ex rodeo clown.  Rodeo clowns step in front of angry charging beasts and lead them away from so that people who are in danger of being trampled can get away.  Is this any different than what he's doing now?  Which begs the question, which cowboy is he leading the bull away from?

       That, or they see conspiracies are popular in the mainstream, so they are trying to tap into that and make partisan politics appeal to conspiracy theorist.  That is, Obama is the NWO, and Republican's will save you from them.

       This is why paranoia is so perfect, so indestructible. No matter what happens you can fit it into a paranoic scenario. So either Beck is correct or he is working for "them". Everything either fits or is made to look like it does not fit.

       Yeah, I think it's actually two different sets of nuts though.  Fox news generally appeals to the palin people who are the more authoritarian christian zionist types.  Those types would go the way of the bircher guys if they don't feel loved anywhere but the internet.  He's actually trying to manage a very complex task.  I don't think he's up to it.  It's too easy to see through, though I have no idea why ron paul and rand paul go on there and lend legitimacy to what he's doing.  I guess if they're just trying to reach people with their ideas they really don't care how they do it.
