        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me start with where I stand on Q. Only because I feel like if I don&#39;t then somebody will accuse me of being some &quot;crazy Q cultist.&quot; I&#39;ve lurked on /pol/ for a while and I&#39;ve seen LARPs come and go. In the beginning I believed that Q was just a LARP, but even at the beginning it was already one of the most complex and compelling I&#39;d seen. I chose to believe it was a LARP for the same reason many claim they do now. Its vague, doesn&#39;t seem to really mean anything, missed predictions etc. EVEN THOUGH I believed it was a LARP, I considered it a good thing. It doesn&#39;t matter if Q was real or not, he was serving redpills left and right. He was waking people up. </p>

<p>Anyways as time went on I started to believe Q more and more. (Not believing the MSM narrative that is the international satanic pedo ring run by clinton) but believing the fact that Q isn&#39;t a LARP. After seeing proof after proof and seeing how things are playing on the political stage lately; it really does seem to all line up.</p>

<p>The point of this post is not to prove Q though.</p>

<p><strong>Point is..</strong></p>

<p>Lately, I&#39;ve seen more and more people saying Q is just some crazy conspiracy, and people say this in r/conspiracy!! Most comments that I&#39;ve seen that are anti-Q, in a sense, cite &quot;zero-evidence&quot; or that its just plain stupid. People don&#39;t seem to care that despite whether or not Q is &quot;real&quot;, he is waking people up and making them aware of corruption, wherever it may be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hitler didn&#39;t &quot;screw&quot; over the USSR. The USSR planned a Western Europe invasion for late 1940 but delayed it to July 41 because of Germany&#39;s unexpected success vs. France/UK. Hitler just started Operation Babarossa 1-2 weeks earlier than Stalin&#39;s planned move.</p>

<p>There is some highly interesting secret tape recording of Hitler meeting Mannerheim, the leader of Finland, in 1942, where they talk about the military situation on the East front and how surprised the german military was about the armament preparation. Everybody who isn&#39;t aware of that should listen to this historical document.</p>

<p>This global war was planned by all kinds of countries for different reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don’t think the other countries already know our dirt?  See, that’s what’s with the Q crowd—they think they know something no one else knows. If Q was real, don’t you think the alphabets would be all over it?</p>

<p>This is at least the third iteration of Q. This new Q is different from all the others and wants us to go to war with other countries. The first one only wanted Hillary et al her cabal. Now that we realize it isn’t coming to fruition, the new Q group needs to have something that keeps us coming back(and paying $$$ for it like Pampletanon and his group). Talking about global politics and secrets is something that they’ll continue to monetize until enough people realize that Q is only in it for the money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. Well, that&#39;s fair. You&#39;ve certainly made a good effort so I commend you for that !! Did you see the initial lists of sealed indictments that went out at a rate of about 5,500 per month thru August ?? Many of those guilty parties have been to trial &amp; are now serving their sentences. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a place to follow the trials, but I can&#39;t think of it right now. I&#39;ll try to look it up. Its in a Qdrop somewhere.  I understand Grand Juries are being assembled in the U.S. &amp; Military Tribunals at Gitmo for military crimes, Sedition &amp; Treason. </p>

<p>Since you already know a lot, you might enjoy WarDrummer on YouTube who reads the decodes of SerialBrain2, an excellent Anon. Also, Neon Revolt is good, another Anon. Personally, I like X22Report - Political &amp; Geopolitical. He&#39;s more my speed &amp; gives good explanations of WHY things are being done the way they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the sealed indictments were a huge issue initially.  Then I saw a post from someone who was high on the government’s legal side who completely dispelled those rumors. He used a lot of real-life examples and indisputable proof that seemed to make a lot more sense than someone who couldn’t even access the private White House Xmas party. But boy, he could post a lot of public access ones. </p>

<p>But that was from the second iteration of Q. We’re now on at least the third and they’re focused on something far more sinister than why Micro started the LARP. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on who your audience is. Qanon is not intended for other military intelligence. It is intended for what is called &quot;normies&quot; - common ordinary people who want to know what is going on &amp; why. </p>

<p>It is an intermediate language which still requires a bit of decoding - depending on how long you&#39;ve been following Q. Personally, I find it both fascinating &amp; frustrating - depending on the drop. </p>

<p>You’re trying to tell me that it’s too complicated for the intelligence community, but simple enough that someone who has no clue how the IC works, operates, or talks can figure out the nitty gritty of the IC? That is mind boggling in how nonsensical that explanation is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying at all. I&#39;m saying that you, as a member of military intelligence, are capable of understanding much more complicated communications - things us normal people wouldn&#39;t have a clue about. In a way, you don&#39;t need Q because possibly you are getting the progress reports directly from MI.</p>

<p>Similar to me, an RN, where discussing medical issues with an EMT would be easy to do, but difficult with someone who has no medical knowledge at all. In this instance, I would need to use much different language than with the EMT.</p>

<p>Q is not trying to share the nitty gritty of the IC with Patriots. He (she/they) is trying to communicate progress being made in Draining the Swamp to the common ordinary American citizen which he cannot do on MSM because they are owned by a member of the Deep State cabal &amp; won&#39;t allow it. So how else can he communicate all that is being accomplished ?? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s a loaded question...
I like vaccinations that help protect us from nasty diseases like measles, whooping cough, chickenpox, diptheria, tetanus, etc. I had them, my children had them &amp; my grandchildren have had them. So far we don&#39;t have any autism showing up.  </p>

<p>But I must say, I happened to accompany my daughter-in-law when she took their 3rd child to get shots at  around 4 months. They gave that poor baby 2 shots in each of her thighs &amp; I thought it was totally inhumane. </p>

<p>Why in the world would you want all those nasty illnesses to enter such a tiny body at the same time ??? The immune system must go into hyper-drive. I just dont think that is healthy. </p>

<p>So while I support vaccinations, I firmly believe that they should be more spread out in their administration. I&#39;ve heard this may be a factor in autism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So he chooses a site known for gore and child pornography? Sounds like a real winner. Meanwhile he’s supposedly posting about eliminating IC resources, which are used extensively by military intel, such as satellites and networks, which would severely damage all abilities to conduct intelligence collection. Not to mention his supposed destruction of FVEY’s capabilities, one of the most critical intelligence agreements the US is a part of. If any of this were true it would be the single most devastating thing to occur to the IC, it would weaken our ability to collect on foreign adversary’s in order to keep the US safe, and would prompt a counter intelligence effort unheard of in the world.</p>

<p>And yet he continues to post while having horrible security, how many times has he had his trip code compromised? 4, 6 times? Yet somehow he evades counter intelligence investigators.</p>

<p>Q is a fraud, nothing he says sounds like anything military related, just someone pretending to sound like they’re military and “in the know”. The only reason I actually care about his cult is because it will probably end up like pizza gate, with someone attempting to harm innocent people.</p>

<p>There was already a guy who tried to block the Hoover Dam after the OIG report predictably ended up being a washout for the “qult”, what’s next before people start seeing it as the joke it is? Actual deaths?</p>

<p>I have faith in God that He will bless all their efforts &amp; bring about a strong, free &amp; wonderful nation for all of us to enjoy. I&#39;ve seen what happens to Socialist countries... They are not free. I&#39;ve seen what happens to Communist countries... They are slaves. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen what happens to open border countries... They are victims of hordes of invaders who cannot find enough jobs to support themselves &amp; have brought pain &amp; suffering to the countries they have invaded. I don&#39;t want that here.

They have been handed lies after lies after lies - MSM being the absolute worst culprit. </p>

<p>I understand that - I was there until 2015 - when I had my eyes opened rather abruptly &amp; spent several months in pretty miserable depression thinking it was too late to do anything about it - our wonderful country was lost...</p>

<p>And then came Donald Trump in 2016. I wasn&#39;t a fan to start with - but I became a fan in time when I saw all that he was planning to do for our country. The light of Hope started to burn brightly in my heart &amp; I worked really hard to get him elected. </p>

<p>He never ceases to amaze me with all that he&#39;s been able to accomplish in such a short time - in spite of being treated more disrespectfully than I&#39;ve ever seen any President treated. I absolutely LOVE Q !! I know it will eventually end, but I will be very sad on that day...</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<p>Q has never claimed to be better than anyone
Q has never expressed a desire for acknowledgement or loyalty
People who trust Q, rarely trust him blindly. They trust the multiple proofs that Q has provided.</p>

<p>On the topic of it being a cult:
Cult leaders don’t hide their identity (at least to their followers) 
Cults tend to promise secret knowledge (Q doesn’t keep anything a secret, there is no invite only section to following Q)</p>

<p>Not to mention that it’s honestly a very bad comparison. The point of Christianity is not to wait. To say there is a point, is to completely miss the point. And you’re saying we’re in the same mess. How is the world the same as it was 2000 years ago.</p>

<p>This is a little different because for one, it’s now. And two, at this point you can start seeing correlation between Qs posts and the news.</p>

<p>Without the Q psyop do you actually expect a higher awareness and more &quot;change&quot; pushed the whatever formless and disorganised &quot;truth&quot; movement? I don&#39;t buy that argument at all. Without Q far less people would actually consider looking into certain topics.</p>

<p>Q is obviously a Psyop by a group closely connected to the administration/military but it&#39;s far too premature to decide what the objective<em>s</em> and target<em>s</em> audience are. Any information/disinformation coming from them isn&#39;t necessarily always meant for the normal population itself but for selective group(s) inside the US government and foreign nations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are they?  I don&#39;t know as much about their religion as the more Western ones.</p>

<p>Christians are the least powerful major religion and they do not have a &quot;wait for savior&quot; mindset.  It&#39;s the only major religion to espouse the power and divinity of each and every individual, here and now.  It is not the Christian mindset that permeates our society, its Catholic (and to a lessor extent Jewish).  They are the sustaining force(s) of the wait for savior mindset you reference.</p>

<p>otherwise yea I totally agree on the sentiment of your post(s);  wait for savior leaves us dead and poor.  However, I totally disagree this sentiment stems from Christianity.</p>

<p>The short version is Christian sentiments threatened Roman power, so they created a religion to merge the nascent Christian energy with the existing Saturn/Jupiter worship (which itself is just a skin for the pagan/polytheistic global religion).</p>

<p>Nothing in the... very little in the Catholic faith shares that early Christian energy.  Long sonorous masses, incense and censors, cardinals with fish hats, barriers to divinty, power structure, none of that is Christian.</p>

<p>I think all religion is a stupid fairy tale for stupid people but correct me if I&#39;m wrong: Didn&#39;t Jesus Christ pre-date Christianity? If so then he was not a savior. He was the con man who made up his religion which then took 300 years of borrowing and adapting other religion&#39;s holidays to form Christianity. Amirite?</p>

<p>Not many people bother to dig into the drops. I also find it fun that Q just held a Q/A and remarked that ET&#39;s exist and are the highest classification. Also noted that the moon landings did happen.</p>

<p>I highly recommend everyone to look at it yoursef and decide. Something so truthful that generates as much fear and backlash in not only the mainstream media, but also Reddit in the way of censoring Q dedicated boards speaks volumes to the truth Q brings forward as more people pay attention. The cabal fears this and fears unity. Just today another Q sub was banned (q_drops) after going public today.

    <div class="md"><p>President Trump has been acknowledging people with &quot;Q&quot; signs or &quot;Q&quot; shirts at his Rallies ever since the last Florida Rally. At the end of the Rally he points directly at them &amp; does his 👍🏼 sign. I was at a Rally near Delaware, Ohio &amp; saw him do it with my own eyes. That&#39;s more than enough for me.</p>

<p>In addition, I have been following Qanon every day since Feb,2018 - 8 months - &amp; so far I haven&#39;t noted any discrepancies or untruths. Naturally, I am as anxious for President Trump to acknowledge &quot;Q&quot; openly &amp; reveal who &quot;Q&quot; is, as much as everyone else is. </p>

<p>But Q states that The Plan has been pre-programed as far back as 2013 &amp; must occur in a particular sequence due to national security. I can accept that &amp; wait it out. </p>

<p>Almost every day since Feb. some type of progress has been made to free our national from the clutches of the Deep State cabal. 
*First, Pres.Trump established his cabinet. 
*Then in order to save the children ASAP, AG Sessions got busy producing sealed indictments for people engaging in pedophilia &amp; child sex trafficking. 
*Then in order to defuse the N.Korea situation, Pres.Trump got busy there &amp; released NoKo from the clutches of the D.S.resulting in a near miraculous outcome for both NoKo &amp; SoKo.</p>

<p>As soon as all the sealed indictments were issued related to children, then AG Sessions started to issue sealed indictments on those who had committed political infractions against our country. Appropriately, McShame was the first to go. </p>

<p>All the while, Pres.Trump has been reducing regulations putting a stranglehold on production &amp; new enterprises. Also, he lowered individual &amp; corporate taxes to stimulate the economy, get businesses hiring again &amp; enticing companies to move back to the U.S. </p>

<p>In the meantime, Pres.Trump has needed a way to communicate details of the whole process of draining the swamp to the American people. It needed to be a platform he could control. 8 Change was perfect. Then 4 Chan was necessary - still good. </p>

<p>But common ordinary people would have trouble understanding military coding &amp; communications. So &quot;middle-men&quot; (or Anons) became necessary to &quot;translate&quot; military-speak.</p>

<p>Thus you have the President of the United States &amp; the Military Intelligence he works closely with everyone single day able to communicate information AHEAD OF TIME so Americans could be awake &amp; aware of what is coming. </p>

<p>Why in the world any red-blooded American who loves their country &amp; appreciates the freedom we still enjoy, would refuse to take advantage of this opportunity... I just cant fathom...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. They have. I guess they had threatening calls prior to a rally so they decided it was necessary to ban Q shirts. But I was at a rally in Delaware, Ohio in August &amp; a guy snuck in a large folded up Q under his shirt. As the rally was ending, he held it up real high &amp; President Trump acknowledged it by pointing directly at it &amp; doing his 👍🏼 motion. I saw it plainly with my own eyes. </p>

<p>Naturally, the DS wants to scare people into down-playing Q. It is the method Q &amp; Pres.Trump are using to communicate with the American people about what is being accomplished.

<p>If trump needed a platform where he could work with military advisors to speak directly to the American people, why would he or his team use 4/8chan when they can just use any other means available? That doesn’t make sense. If the president wanted to say “I’m working on taking down the deep state ‘cabal’ and associated pedophile rings,” he could easily do that via any number of channels including the whitehouse website and his own twitter - both dependable and controlled assets by the president and his teams. </p>

<p>The fact that you and your ilk buy into this Q LARP shit is pretty telling, no different that fervent religiosity or cult-like behaviors with group phrases and beliefs - WWG1WGA, “enjoy the ride,” “trust the plan,” and all the rest of the bullshit are literally markers of a cult. </p>

<p>Further, why would the president announce plans ahead of time when it would give perceived enemies time to regroup and replan? That also doesn’t make sense. If I wanted to pull one over on my enemies, I sure as fuck wouldn’t be publicly announcing what I’m doing. Let’s consider an example of a highly effective attack on an unsuspecting enemy: Mueller says nothing publicly, doesn’t make his next moves or plans known, and executed upon unsuspecting  filth with surgical precision. That’s how a leader does things, not some cunt LARPing on the chans pushing and pulling all you gullible idiots around by your noses. </p>

<p>The entire basis of your perspective is inherently flawed, nothing makes sense the way you think it does. </p>

<p>Reality works differently to the fantasy q created.</p>

There is still a side of me that thinks Q is merely something to keep patriots inactive and preoccupied. Enough bits of truth to keep them involved in the riddles, but out of the actual &quot;show&quot;. 
It&#39;s being for conservatives what big government means to liberals:  A protective watchdog. A savior. Something to do the work so we don&#39;t have to think and act critically. Smells like another move of a pawn to me.</p>

<p>That said. I would love to believe there was going to be &quot;evidence&quot; that changed the world and ushered in a wave of Justice and Doom&#39; for all corruptors.... but shit, that is just so fucking romantic, I need to see some proverbial titties before I jump in bed with reckless abandon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest issue with Q that I have isn&#39;t with how most of predictions turn out to be completely worthless or that he drops &quot;breadcrumbs&quot; so that his followers can just interpret them however they want and claim Q was right, but rather it&#39;s exactly the sort of stuff that this post is praising him for. It&#39;s this subset of Q followers that irks me the most, those that know that most of the stuff he says probably true but still follow him anyway because &quot;he&#39;s waking people up&quot;. 
Q&#39;s not &quot;redpilling&quot; or waking anyone up. He exists to actively praise and support <strong>the dominant party in the United States government</strong> while also promoting the idea that it&#39;s fighting an evil force in order to make Republicans, more specifically Trump, look like the underdog and the good guy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they don&#39;t have any special clearance. 
1) For one thing, they have been doing Q since it started in October,2017. I started in February, 2018. So they have longer experience on their side.
2) They have a computer &amp; I have only my phone. So they have greater research capacity than I do.
3) They are much better at finding things on the internet. I&#39;m barely trainable. But for 73, I manage &amp; actually have continued to slowly improve over the 3 years I have had FB.</p>

<p>If you elect to not pay insurance then you get charged a higher premium at times. Which is fair</p>

<p>Large, large majority of things he has claimed didn&#39;t come true. </p>

<p>Hes been caught many times photoshopping pictures.</p>

<p>He has also planted many excuses in his follower&#39;s heads for when his predictions fail such as &quot;trust the plan&quot;, &quot;Disinformation is necessary&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>He has soo many followers because he tells people what they want to hear. For example: The <em>totally real</em> video of hillary molesting or killing a kid thats on the internet, MCcain dying because of a secret military tribunal, etc.</p>

<p>In one case, a person&#39;s reputation, life work &amp; even their very life can be affected by the other person falsely accusing them. You can&#39;t have such a very important issue based on her said/she said. You need solid proof - hard evidence - like a rape kit showing a DNA match, accompanied by a police report, accompanied by a corroborating testimony by a friend. </p>

<p>In the other case, we are talking about a Plan being carried out. We need to hear about the plan before it begins, while it is unfolding &amp; when it is completed. </p>

<p>At each step of the way we are evaluating - is this realistic ? Believable ? Legitimate ? Progressing ?  Accomplishing its purpose ? Each step becomes a proof. </p>

<p>At the very end we say, &quot;The Plan is completed &amp; it was or was not successful. Or we say, &quot;The Plan was not completed.&quot; Details are important all along the way because an alternate Plan is always a possibility. </p>

<p>In Q&#39;s instance The Plan is just unfolding. So far what has been accomplished has been 100% successful. There are 3 movies - or you could say 3 acts to the Play.

    <div class="md"><p>World wars I and 2 were LARPS. THE Great Depression was a LARP.   All three were real. Q is a LARP but real too...  I read recently that not often, but it happens, the bloodlines that rule will fight with each other, though rare.   But Q and the Liberals powers are, in the end, on the same side, which is against us, I believe... Kind of like a family squabble and we all have nothing to do with it.  Q says enjoy the movie.  Wut?  Talking about our lives like we are in a movie. Chilling. Q says it is a 3 year plan...  Long time to wait and see...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will admit tho.  Q posting the exact time of McCain&#39;s death to the minute troubled me.  I had to check for myself so I dug up the &quot;hands up&quot; post and the official hospital time of death.  Perfect match ran it through time converter both ways.  MST to EST and vice versa.  How someone can know that 30 days in advance is a tad bit spooky.  With odds of (24×60) 1440 I would have never left Vegas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didnt predict mccains death tho</p>

<p>They made that up</p>

<p>He made a post (out of many) that HAPPENED to be at the 28th minute of a separate hour</p>

<p>Thats a real stretch to claim he &quot;predicted&quot; anything</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... I guess the best thing we can say is &quot;Time Will Tell.&quot; Personally, I have been a Q-watcher for the past 8 months &amp; have yet to find anything wrong or bad with it. I don&#39;t always understand everything, but I do believe it is Military Intelligence working closely with President Trump. </p>

<p>I appreciate the info I do understand which has helped me be confident in what they are accomplishing. I like knowing why before it happens. Just like everyone else, I wish they could go public, but for now this is best since it is for national security.</p>

<p>For added clarity, I watch X22Report, Praying Medic, Blessed To Teach &amp; SpaceShot76 on YouTube.</p>

I have a right to mine. I believe that every day, improvements are being made in our country. I praise God that He has given us President Trump who is very brave &amp; is leading our country to be the Great land it needs to be with Liberty &amp; Justice for all...🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe God did allow President Trump to win. I&#39;m not defending his &quot;locker room&quot; talk, but we all know men do talk this way - but that doesn&#39;t make it right. He said himself, he was ashamed of what he said. I guess we all make mistakes, Right ??</p>

<p>President Trump became a man-of-faith several years ago &amp; has changed his ways. He does everything he can to preserve our religion liberty &amp; to foster our legal system which is based on Biblical principles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are they?  I don&#39;t know as much about their religion as the more Western ones.</p>

<p>Christians are the least powerful major religion and they do not have a &quot;wait for savior&quot; mindset.  It&#39;s the only major religion to espouse the power and divinity of each and every individual, here and now.  It is not the Christian mindset that permeates our society, its Catholic (and to a lessor extent Jewish).  They are the sustaining force(s) of the wait for savior mindset you reference.</p>

<p>otherwise yea I totally agree on the sentiment of your post(s);  wait for savior leaves us dead and poor.  However, I totally disagree this sentiment stems from Christianity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, your &quot;established media whose face you can see&quot; is owned by &amp; is being manipulated by Deep State operatives who give the alphabet news outlets their talking points every morning at 4 AM. In other words the MSM is now functioning more like a Communist nation where only 1 narrative is allowed. Listen to all the station some time. They are ALL talking about the same thing.</p>

<p>Even more disconcerning is what they are NOT talking about &amp; that is all the GOOD that President Trump is accomplishing. That&#39;s why we have Qanon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are entitled to your opinion &amp; I&#39;m entitled to mine. So far its still a free country. Its not my job to convince you of anything. Its your job to check it out for yourself &amp; come to your own conclusions. You have a lot more experience in the area of Military Intelligence than I do, so you can discern that better than I can. </p>

<p>I have to trust that the MI that claims to be Q &amp; claims to be working closely with President Trump actually are &amp; are capable of competing this Plan. In fact, I&#39;m banking on it. I&#39;m praying for it. I&#39;m attempting to red pill others with the info I have learned from Q in the past 8 months. </p>

<p>I have faith in God that He will bless all their efforts &amp; bring about a strong, free &amp; wonderful nation for all of us to enjoy. I&#39;ve seen what happens to Socialist countries... They are not free. I&#39;ve seen what happens to Communist countries... They are slaves. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen what happens to open border countries... They are victims of hordes of invaders who cannot find enough jobs to support themselves &amp; have brought pain &amp; suffering to the countries they have invaded. I don&#39;t want that here. I want my children &amp; grandchildren to live in the wonderful country I have lived in &amp; continue to enjoy all the freedom we have had for some 246 years. </p>
