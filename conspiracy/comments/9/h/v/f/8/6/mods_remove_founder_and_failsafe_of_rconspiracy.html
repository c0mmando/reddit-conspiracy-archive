       u/illuminatedwax founded this sub 10 years ago and was removed by reddit admins last night, as per request of the other mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would the mods care to explain what damage was being done by u/illuminatedwax, to warrant such a drastic move? What fueled you to campaign the site admins to remove him, considering his inactivity had zero effect on your ability to properly moderate this place?
      </p>
      <p>
       And where has the stickied
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9hmhps/announcement_top_mod_uilluminatedwax_has_been/">
        announcement
       </a>
       gone, u/axolotl_peyotl?
      </p>
      <p>
       One would think you would leave news like this up for at least...one full day?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, it's been replaced by an unrelated post that reads like reddit damage control, by a mod who is already suspected of being tasked with damage control of no less than 112 (one hundred and twelve) different subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has subreddit coup written all over it. Please convince the users here otherwise...

       ...what does that have to do with the price of tea in China? He could sell his account whether it was active or not. What kind of straw man argument is that? That is literally almost changing the subject entirely as a response to a question. WTF is even going on in your head to make a response like that. Honestly makes the whole thing seem worse.

       All good. jcp just threatened me earlier, which is strange for me, he picked my single comment out of hundreds echoing the same sentiment and not a single other. Then I get your response on this, just seemed suss on my late to the party no views comment. Nothing personal. Soz and I wish you the best.

       Seems like ultimately a good move. Is it a change? Certainly. Is it radical? To an extent yes. But this basically just codifies a situation that already existed. And IW wasn't all "good" in that sense. His account could also have been used by bad actors to purge the entire mod crew (or portions of it) for bad reasons.

       I try and lightning rod TuMoR so hard but they don't take my bait.  Frustrating.  I'm much older than the online demo, certainly the Reddit demo, and fear that disconnect is not allowing me to properly troll the trolls.  Dang kids too slick for me

       Not many people can troll trolls and at the end of the day it's pretty pointless other than a good laugh. Nothing more. Don't even bother imo. Life lessons can be learned but you can also become the darkness in which you are fighting. Stay in the light Hippy :)

       You're misinformed. The
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mod team operates by consensus - all the mods have one vote, and any mod decision can be overturned by a modteam majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top mod position occupies a "primus inter pares" position, but it has now been established by
       <strong>
        precedent
       </strong>
       that their power is nominal. The removal of illuminatedwax and SC by the rest of the mod team shows that the top mod of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       cannot act against, or stand in the way of the majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       So under no account is any mod entitled to unilaterally "pull rank" and demod another - there would have be virtual unanimity in the mod team to justify a demodding. SC tried to demod the rest of the team, and it backfired on him spectacularly.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it happens, with AP now elevated as top mod, it's the first time in 5 years that we have an established, active and trusted user nominally heading the sub.

       Well, I don't think SC or Fly agreed with you on that, given what happened, and I also think Sarah was entirely justified in firing y'all.  At least Sarah wanted to get rid of bad actors on the mod team;  you guys allow mods who are part of TMoR / ShareBlue.    And consensus is an awful way to rule, just ends up in half ass compromises.  This place was a lot better under SC than it is currently.
      </p>

       You've  had your coup, now you're consolidating your power.  You don't want the founder to come back, find out you've taken over his sub, and boot you.  Fine, whatever, but at least be honest.  IW wasn't in any way a problem, he was a threat to the new government's authority.

       You're talking from a position of ignorance. SC was an absentee mod for a long time, just like wax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before your time, but if you do some research you will see that SC made a weird announcement some years ago that he was being "investigated by the FBI" and would be going quiet for a time. Then radio silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast-forward a couple of years and SC (or whoever was now controlling the SC account) re-emerged out of the blue and after a few weeks demodded the rest of the team without warning. Not surprisingly, the other mods decided this was bullshit and fought back, because
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       I'm not saying that Sarah and Fly were perfect, because they were not.  I'm saying I trusted that they were genuine conspiracy theorists and not spooks / shills.  That, to me, is a more important qualification than any other.
      </p>

       That is in no way rule 10.  I'm speaking about shills in the abstract, not accusing any person of being a shill.

       Yes.  I'm not on the mod team last I checked.

       A bit.  But the thing is, I don't care in the slightest about SC's personal life.  I've never in my life claimed to be "plugged in".

       It also doesn't solve anything by banning, or threatening to ban, anyone who even mentions the existence of shills. In fact, it makes it much worse because the shills know you've got their back, when it's forbidden to even suggest they're here.

       Play stupid games win stupid prizes is an idiom.  Maybe an aphorism.  Not a euphemism. If indeed you're using it as a euphemism we're back to my question.  What harsh truth are you hiding by using a "euphemism?"

       I'm sure you know more about the whole situation than me, but do you really think he is "out of the game"? Same goes for Flytape, DronePuppet, putin_loves_cats, and all of the other accounts who tried to influence this subreddit one way or another and were banned for it. Do you really think people who put that much time and effort into one subreddit are just going to go away quietly when they get banned? I seriously doubt it.

       Voat is ugly for a reason, they don‚Äôt want indoctrinated normies who squeal at the sight of bad words. Once you get past the initial disgust and learn to ignore/not be bothered by the use of the no-no words you‚Äôll find there are very active, friendly, tight nit communities that are quite non-political.

       I don't know, I've looked through more than once and most of what I could was shallow shitposting by people pleased that they're allowed to write bad words somewhere on the internet. I'd still have to come to reddit to participate in communities that interest me as basic subs like vegan &amp; tv shows don't exist on voat.

       I was one of a bunch of Mods on a sub WAY-BACK in the early 2000's (Yay for "E-Z Board") ... people suck when they suddenly come back to a website after years away, we had a mod "take" a website domain and generally split an entire community.  It sucked.

       KIA had an incident earlier this year where their founder, who had also been inactive for a few years, attempted to shut down the sub because it was no longer 'his vision'. He had been compromised and the mods of KIA had to appeal to the admins to have him removed. Inactive founders are dangerous. If they're not active in the community, they could come back compromised.

       Don't be ridiculous. It is one of the most trafficked sites on the internet. Reddit does  not rely only on outsourced mods to maintain that type of control. From a marketing perspective, they want to maintain that  illusion, and the one that they are some small, good guy company. Also, mod positions that are held by users have been exposed as being up for sale in the past. Do you think multi-billion dollar companies don't have their hooks in here to manage PR through mods?

       I'm sure there are compromised mods, thats what I alluded to by saying they aren't paid in a direct way. Regardless, I am just saying how the site "works". you can make any claims to about to what degree that system is compromised all you want. Not an argument I'm making.

       We went through the process for the admins to remove an inactive mod. After that was complete, they removed everyone, then added AP back to invite us all back. This was a total clusterfuck. There was no simple way to restore the original order of seniority. So we asked for their assistance again to restore the original order, minus wax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of me wonders if they handled it this way to prompt posts and drama like this. Just another way to fracture the community and erode any trust we may have had with our users.

       Is there something about removing the lead mod/founder that would make them have to do it that way? I hear about mods stepping down or being removed but hadn't considered that they're probably usually not the heads. just curious if you know or if the admins mentioned it

       They didn't explain it to me, and another mod handled the request to assist us with restoring the order through PMs. There is the possibility there was a special consideration since he was the board owner. But if a top mod can remove themselves without breaking anything, and they can, then I see no obvious reason why they had to do it this way.

       huh TY, it does seem a little odd in terms of how they went about it- I think someone said it was more or less a surprise also?

       It was a surprise to anyone not privy to modmail I suppose. But we started the process a few months ago. I have been a mod here for a couple years now, and a member of the community for like 6yrs, and I have literally never seen wax interact with the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       We saw that acct as a kind of sword of damocles. If some malicious group got control of it, we wouldn't even be able to tell if it was the original user. And this is a pretty heavily trafficked and controversial space, it was worrisome to work under this unknown potential threat. You remember that reddit acct hack a month or so ago? That reinforced the idea that we needed to get out from under this. This isn't even considering if a rogue admin decided to take control of the account and use it to screw up our board. This decision wasn't made lightly, and it is the first time we as a team worked nearly unanimously together on anything. It was a great team building exercise.
      </p>

       My half joking pet theory was that user was an IC owned r/con firewall, to ensure that they could nuke the sub if we got ahold of anything really dangerous around here. I was curious to see if the admins would even permit us to remove him.

       I'm a bit analog... an admin is a Reddit employee/rep and a mod is a sub-reddit manager, more or less?
      </p>
      <p>
       So the mods of r/con had to interact with an admin of Reddit Corporate?

       Yes! I often forget that not everyone knows this..."admins" are paid reddit employees and "moderators" are volunteer who aren't associated with reddit inc.

      <p>
       This is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last time we needed help from the now-removed top mod, he wasn't active (and hasn't been for years), so we had to go directly to Reddit Corporate (which they don't like...they prefer the moderators to take care of their own subs).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because having an inactive top moderator would require
       <em>
        further
       </em>
       admin involvement, we unanimously decided to have him removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only the reddit admins can remove the
       <em>
        top
       </em>
       moderator in a sub.

       I was a bit horrified the other day to find out that other conspiracy subs shared moderators with the Q subs. I understand the overlap, but I don't feel a mod can claim to be impartial when they're in charge of controlling a sub that had rules against trump criticism or questioning.

       not really that crazy to have crossover imo i never subscribed to the Q shit but it originated in this sub for reddit discussions before creating their own. Makes sense the community would ask
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       mods to help mod their new community based on a conspiracy.

       So you disagree with taking a subject and simplifying it to get a point a cross? Oh thats nice I don‚Äôt care.

       Yes it was. I've been here every day since the Boston bombing. This sub has always had a libertarian/conservative leaning stance and leftists have perpetually brigaded it because of it's positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       First it was conspiratard and not it's top minds.  The brigaders subscribe and become everyday posters. They're always leftists wanting to shit on the constitution.

       I wish real liberals would get their shitty people under control. I see the right calling out their shitty people all of the time, but lefties always stick with each other.

       Since u/spez steadily sucks the dick of the right/altright/etc, i dojbt the left has as much impact as folks think...on reddit at least. In reality, right and left are the same entity. Elitists that are richer than rich and dont give a fuck about a single one of us.

       Do you differentiate your right and left hand as separate  entities? Does your left and right brain have separate personalities? Because thats how you sound to me. If you take a step back the control is obvious. The left and right work together...literally in your face AND under the table...Also this sub was compromised way before the Boston bombing witchhunt.

       Yep. Its really funny. They will always try to bait you by purposefully mistaking your opinion and calling you either left or right. If you take the bait you will then passionately express your views just so they can bait you some more. Its literally professional trolling.

       I assure you they don‚Äôt care what you are distracted by, as long as you are distracted. They want you as heavily consumed by the system as possible. You can do or believe anything you want just stay in the system and don‚Äôt cause too much trouble. They dont care what you believe or what you know, Because at the end of the day nobody is going to do anything about it. That being said aliens aren‚Äôt allowed to come here and interact with humans so they usually don‚Äôt. Thats all I‚Äôm going to say.

       Before the election there was a lot less accounts strictly promoting their agenda. A lot less YouTube level bullshit like this. No one cares about how you feel about trump or me.

       It‚Äôs people picking a political hill to die on and arguing anonymously to muddy the discussions so literally nothing gets resolved.

       I‚Äôm talking about a giant influx of month old accounts with strong political views and zero ability to hold a discussion right around 2016. I didn‚Äôt say it was new. I am saying there was a noticeable shift in how discussions went. Censoring things on reddit has always existed but it‚Äôs more and more noticeable everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those people are still here astroturfing. The voting count on this sub specifically drastically changed around 2016. There wasn‚Äôt a lot of 50/50 bullshit. It was 70/30 with a discussion involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       It‚Äôs like politicians realized the power of the internet extremely late in the game and now we are 2-3 years into each side imploding on itself because they didn‚Äôt realize we could view their browser history. Like we couldn‚Äôt watch videos of them holding different positions ten years ago. So many people are out here just wanting to be right but by the time they win the fight they forgot what they were even debating.

       Which "side" is controlling it though? There's a certain t_d undertone in a lot of posts here but at the same time many anti conservative talking points make it to the front page. It's been super political since the election which explains the many downvotes. Bi-partisan issues still get a high upvote percentage.

       Doesn't matter who voted them in, the right holds a majority in 2 out of the 3 branches of our government, and with he potential confirmation of Kavanaugh, could hold a majority in all three.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I forgot Fox News is totally not impactful in our national discourse and doesn't have the presidents ear and the Koch Brothers, Mercers, and DeVos/Prince families are having no say in our direction as a country.

       you cite right wing majority in our government as if right wingers are using that power to seize more power for themselves when they are doing the opposite by cutting regulations and lowering taxes. when leftist get a majority they start imposing new laws and raising taxes and setting up a rigged system for their corrupt buddies. and are you seriously triyng to cite fox news as "influential" when literally every since other station is left wing and you know it. doesnt it alarm you that right wingers only have one subreddit and one tv station in an ocean of lefties? your argument is completely disingenuous if you think you can ignore the existence of  every media company in the world while pointing your finger at fox news.

       first examples that come to mind are Title 2 NN laws and the CFPB, both attempts by leftists to set up systems of government power for themselves and their cronies, that have little oversight and dont answer to the people or to congress.

       I think the scope of this needs to be narrowed as it is devolving into a bunch of generalized talking points.  So, I'll put this forth and if anyone wants to argue it, please let me know why you disagree:
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is a progressive site that is run by a progressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that was the original point as to why some people think there's a conspiracy to drive an agenda in this sub.  So if Reddit admins are taking some actions in this sub, it's likely driven by the left.
      </p>

       We can leave the other stuff out of this conversation yes?

       I guess from my understanding of the actions in this sub (removing a mod), it doesnt seem to be reddit administration doing this, rather this subs other mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I agree, Reddit is a progressive leaning site (not that they have an agenda, but that the majority of users skew that way) and I appreciate you not using charged terms such as leftists lefties, and a cabal to describe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think in a capitalist society, people with money on either side will seek power and try to use this power to influence society.  To say it is only one side and the other is free from it is disingenuous. (not saying you're doing this, only referencing my reason for trying to broaden the conversation after the other previous comment seemed to want to limit it)

       Politicians and money run our capitalist styled democracy.  I am not saying the left has no one who does this, or has no aspirations of having influence.  I am simply pushing back against your original comment and charged language which says the right doesn't have power and influence and doesn't seek power and it's only "the lefties".

       Fox, and Robert Murdoch? Also Chick Fil A was in the news recently because its owner donates to activist causes. I'm proving your point by showing that right wingers do control media and global corporations? Because I included some right wingers whose corporations are only in America? You know there are left wing folks who own corporations who are only in america, does that mean that your statement was wrong? The right wing controls all branches of the united states government, and they control one of the largest and most influential news and media outlets in the country, not to mention that local news is dominated by the sinclair group which is massively right wing, and people like you still want to come around like you're some put upon minority. Also did you just try to insult me by calling me a nerd? For real? Are you an 80's bully?

       you are clueless, you keep citing sinclair and murdoch and fox and chik fila a with complete ignorance that they hold a tiny amount of the market share and have far less influence than left wing groups do. also winning an election isnt a power grab, why do you keep citing the results of the election as if it doesnt represent the will of the people?

       there are 6 big media companies, fox is 1 of them, without even checking, do you really think fox has a majority market share? have you seriously never thought about this before? you can look up the number of primetime viewers easily.

       Thanks for the suggestion. I looked up those numbers, Fox has the most. So thank you for helping me to see that right wing media controls a disproportionate amount of of american media. news corp also owns the largest newspaper in america, which is also right wing organization and owns fox. So between the two they have more media control than any other media company. Crazy, no wonder they won the elections.

       wew you took that bait easily, thanks for pasting in the top google result for "is fox the most watched news channel?". did you forget to add up the numbers of the other stations buddy? just CNN + MSNBC have more viewers than Fox, and if we go down the line adding up the rest of the left wing stations, that gap only gets wider and wider.

       they don't have a majority. they have (1,485,000) viewers, which is only a few hundred thousand more viewers than the next most viewed news show, MSNBC at (1,007,000), which is distinctly left leaning. next is CNN at (711,000), which is exactly what I said, and my source is the same website you used.

       Winning an election is a successful power grab by the electoral process. Those people got voted in by broadcasting their message and ideology across the country via MEDIA and then they won. If the MEDIA is controlled by left wing groups as you claim then they are completely incompetent.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is actually going on here is that right wing media has convinced their consumers (including yourself) that they are a plucky group of grassroots resistance who only by the grace of god have managed to win a small amount of power from these here baby killing libtards in recent years. When in reality this country has swung right and left in pretty equal measure historically and right now we are in a left wing social environment while being in a right wing economical environment. You partisanship is tiring, and your projection and delusion are depressing.

       go on and explain why you wouldn't think reddit is a left wing website then, is it the existence of a handful of right wing subs in an ocean of left wing subs? is it perhaps the frontpage being covered with obvious shill subreddits supporting leftist causes? (the_mueller, bluemidterm, fuckthealtright, etc etc etc).  Maybe you haven't noticed that many many subreddits have had notable moderators replaced around the elections. help me out here buddy, show me some of your insight that makes you think this sub isnt controlled by leftists

       The fact that you think you‚Äôre on a winning side is exactly the problem. They have you thinking your fellow human is a ‚Äúcucklibtard who cant accept reality‚Äù. That‚Äôs just another redditor and when your little team comes off as condescending confrontational assholes it really dilutes your ability to convey any message at all.
      </p>

       Like your point is literally LOL FUCK THE LEFT. That‚Äôs why we have an orange cheeto as POTUS. A room full of people who just wanted to ‚Äúwin‚Äù but they have no idea what the fuck they are winning. That‚Äôs why we currently have an unqualified celebrity running shit right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is if you aren‚Äôt part of old money or rich as fuck you are a pawn in someone else‚Äôs game. They are playing 99% of society like a fiddle. Arguing about shit like skin color and political party is petty and pointless yet most of the internet is made up of exactly this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You‚Äôre just one of the easily manipulated pawns who can spend their entire lives thinking they are fighting for something when they are just arguing for the arguments sake. Leftist aren‚Äôt delusional. You thinking their is a right side and a wrong side with no middle ground is delusional .

       The word "leftist" used to apply to people like Fidel Castro and the Sandinistas. Today, it means anyone who doesn't tow the Republican line. Snapples kept saying that the government is run by Republicans because the people voted for them. FYI, this is entirely false.
      </p>
      <p>
       As everyone knows, DJT lost the vote by nearly three million, but he got into the WH.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans lost the Senate by eight figures, but they control it.
      </p>

       Republicans were about tied in the House, but they hold a solid majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, there's the Supreme Court. Neil Gorsuch is there because Republicans judicially activated a new "rule" in 2016 to keep a president from getting any consideration for a nominee. Then, Mitch McConnell changed the Senate rules to get Neil Gorsuch in. As a result, Republicans held the SCOTUS majority for a 47th year straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the entire government is controlled by the minority party.

       Cmon now. I see the heavy influence of left on Reddit as well but that stems from the average user base not so much mod influence. I dont believe you have nearly as many consevartives on here as you do liberal keyboard warriors which plays a huge role on content over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to find the internal and external variables that push liberals to this outlet at such high groves would be interesting in camparision to the vairables present in conservatives lives.

       yep, been here since pre-2012, the 2016 election changed everything and this place was a different spot overnight.

       Reddit is now just another variant of InfoWars and AboveTopSecret.... chock full of disinformation and planted idiots, with the intent of trying to recapture the attention of those who have shunned the MSM. The 2016 election is when [they] finally decided it was worth the $$$ to take control of this place, and nothing has changed since.

       Long time lurker.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be heavily surprised if the majority of mods (probably all) here are not on payrole for their reddit activity. 
This sub compared to 5 years ago is a complete joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much stuff is posted which is more like news and the OP going look at this bad thing. Like all the US political crap, yes we know trump is a pudding and hilary eats babies, its not news. Its just the same information as other subs but trying to appear a bit radical and edgy to cater to the flocks of wannabes that are here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Years back you would hear about weird and wonderful conspiracies on a daily basis from aliens to holofractal universes. You could have a civil discussion on any topic. You would occasionally have someone who appeared a legit insider and it would get everyone excited for days with some juicy info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the insiders are on the admin and mod teams. They divide to control, derail, instigate above all never let a proper discussion occur without polarising and derailing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now its butthurts and bots and paid shills all screaming for attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only come here to see what agenda the shills and mods are pushing as that in itself is interesting. That and a feeling of nostalgia of what this community once was.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you imagine a subverive communist guerilla camp. Thats what this sub used to feel like. Today its fake and wrong. Like disney tried to turn it into a ride. Sure there are all the features you expect but its all plastic and fibreglass and the guards are all looking at you funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is no longer a community. It is an exhibit and compared to years gone by, its fake trashy and rather boring.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is 'their' territory, it was lost to the wrong side years back.

       It should also be added that there is a fake consensus using alts that permeates the sub.  The names change and rotate, about every couple of months new "friends" are introduced, but they act as "friends" and make much hay out of "alternative scientific theories".

      <p>
       What actions would the mods be paid for exactly? The mod log is public, you can literally see everything posted here, removed or not. The biggest detractors to this sub are left leaning contingents that attack the mods for allowing "hate speech", e.g. anything they happen to disagree with.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So much stuff is posted which is more like news and the OP going look at this bad thing. Like all the US political crap, yes we know trump is a pudding and hilary eats babies, its not news. Its just the same information as other subs but trying to appear a bit radical and edgy to cater to the flocks of wannabes that are here.

        Years back you would hear about weird and wonderful conspiracies on a daily basis from aliens to holofractal universes. You could have a civil discussion on any topic.

       or
       <a href="/r/aleister">

       What should the mods do about that? Would you prefer they just remove the content that you don't want to see?

       <p>
        If you imagine a subverive communist guerilla camp. Thats what this sub used to feel like. Today its fake and wrong. Like disney tried to turn it into a ride. Sure there are all the features you expect but its all plastic and fibreglass and the guards are all looking at you funny.

       Totally agree. In my early Reddit days I was subscribed to both here and to r/skeptic. I eventually unsubbed from the skeptic subreddit because their discussions were ironically, but maybe not surprisingly, super close-minded and it was a huge circle jerk. Here was not like that, people‚Äôs ideas were considered and discussed without vitriol and accusations of shilling if you didn‚Äôt agree with the hive mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I‚Äôve unsubscribed here countless times, but keep coming back just to see if maybe the community has finally shifted back away from the same kind of toxic environment that made me leave in the first place. It was even more apparent during the 2016 election where this whole subreddit felt like a t_d clone. There‚Äôs no real discussion anymore and it‚Äôs infested with propaganda pushers and shills and people accusing others of being shills whenever they question whatever the narrative of the day is.

       Flytape threw a hissy fit and resigned.

      <p>
       James Cole Pardon staged a coup with Flytape after the admins warned him and was given the boot.
      </p>
      <p>
       People always try to say that there was this big mod shakeup, because all mods were removed as part of the coup and readded, so they look new and i's easy to sell. Its complete fiction however, only those two mods left, it was with ample cause and it's all a matter of public record.

       Ok, but you're spreading lies. A bunch of mods weren't replaced, one mod resigned and one was removed by admins after a coup attempt.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, it makes little sense to focusing on the timing as suspicious when the timing was dictated by the mods who were themselves ousted and stepped down. JCP and Flytape dictating the timing on this, them not being mods any more was the result of their moves and they timed them themselves.

       Reddit has to resort to admins (dictators) interfering in a totally biased and selective way, because the r/conspiracy mods have been too good, and thus are able to deflect the usual subversion process.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet almost every other large sub has inactive founders that aren't purged. This is selective enforcement. Admins seem to have a bias in their enforcement of vaguely worded rules.

      <p>
       Personally I think it‚Äôs hilarious. They‚Äôve invested so much time and energy into co-opting this conspiracy sub, and now that they finally have control, all the users they sought to influence have stopped coming. All of their efforts to control the discourse are in vain, so like the angry children they are, they‚Äôll shut it down out of spite.

       In the end no one will care, just like the Digg exodus, real conversation will find a new home and the shills will be slow to follow.

       Truth. I used to love it here a few years ago when we can talk shit about Obama's drone strikes and possible false flags. If I wanted a sub to praise our president and hate on jews I'd subscribe to the_donald. Make r/conspiracy great again!

       Oh, stop it. It's observably true here. The worst comments get moderated, but it's still possible to glean community attitudes to Jews. The two replies to this post, and their votes, are a recent example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9guhkg/accusing_jews_of_criminality_and_subversion/e67g2x8/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you Ceddit the rest of that thread, you'll also be able to see the moderated comments calling for gassing etc.

       Hate does not come from nothing, does it?  Jews around the world approve of Israel, almost entirely.  I sound as if I am dealing in absolutes, so I will subtract from my criticism people like Sydney Blumenthal and professor Finkelstein.  If you don't like my opinion or world view on what I think of Israelis or jewish people in general, I don't really care?  How about that.  I will not be shamed or silenced into approving of the scum that run our government, media, banking, military...  so there you go.

       The_Donald does praise the president.  The_Donald is NOT anti-Semitic.   I do wonder why this sub allows anti-semitism.  Sometimes there are genuine and  informative posts and replies regarding Jews.  Sometimes there is blatant anti-semitism.

       How is an inactive account a "failsafe"?  Sounds like it could work both ways.  An inactive account can't participate and may very well be a hindrance for the process here.

       I'm not sure why everyone is going to bat for a guy who hasn't been here in years.  He clearly doesn't care anymore.

      <p>
       One mod removed the guy who created this whole sub, removed all of the mods off the sub and then ‚Äúre-added the mods‚Äù effectively making himself the top mod.

       It sounds like he kicked out the creator and any sane mod, and kept the mods with the bad agenda.

       This is incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       About three months ago, the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mod team petitioned the admins to have the "top" mod in the sub removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This mod hadn't actually written a comment in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       for
       <em>
        5
       </em>
       years and was an inactive account.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sudden "respect" and passion for wax is very disingenuous. He never has been an active member/participant of this community, and indeed the last time we needed his help he couldn't be reached and we had to go to the admins instead (they get annoyed by this).
      </p>
      <p>
       After 3 months, our request was finally granted. However, the admin in charge of this made a mistake, and
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the mods were removed and I was reinstated (I was the requestor).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because having just
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       mod active in a 700+ sub is a bad idea even for 24 hours, the night this happened I added back the half a dozen or so mods that happened to be awake and active so they could help out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the "order" of the mod team is important, and because it would be very difficult to invite back everyone the way it was before this mistake, we enlisted the help of the admins again.
      </p>
      <p>
       They apologized for the error and inconvenience, and immediately restored the team in the proper order.

       This couldn't be further from the mark, and I hope I've made things clearer.

       5 year lurker here...fucking love all of you.
Take a step back and look at the world we live in.
This problem is not exclusive to Con.
This has become the new way of society- stitched lipped or be socially downvoted to oblivion.
In this hyperpolitical world something as fun to talk about as the Mandela Effect turns into ‚Äúwhy did you pick the BERNSTEIN Bears to use as something you thought was weird? Was it the color of their fucking fur‚Äù
Speech that is offensive to even .01% of the population is now ‚Äúhate‚Äù and you will grouped into the racist/bigot/vaginahathatingnazi club.
After TGA went down I knew that Q crowd would fall back here. And ultimately this sub would be sunk as that sub was because of it (love ya patriots but I just can‚Äôt hop on your train even as a devout conspiracy theorist.)
The double standard of acceptability and freedom of thought and speech is apparent when you compare to a sub like TMOR. Anything outside of the spoon fed narrative is now unacceptable, and unfortunately those closed minds in control can and will shut it all down. 
I guess we‚Äôll all end up meeting somewhere else to discuss Parallel universes and Tesla at some point. Keep it real ladies and gents.

       The crusade to marginalize r/conspiracy by 2 mods (1 mentioned already, the other one is a throw away account) is proceeding.

      <p>
       They mostly post political junk, try to steer conversations, and add rules that if we call them out of their shit, we get banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       User of this sub should know you have been duped (and I have been trying to say so for a while, and I have been attacked, ridiculed, called a shill and a censor supporter.... When the facto f the matter is exactly the opposite.

       The political stuff isn't a complete distraction. The lies our politicians make, the deals they cut with foriegn countries and shady companies, the unconstitutional laws they pass still have hold over aspects of our lives. It doesn't matter how red pilled you are, they still work together to steal and damage.

       There just shouldn't be any talk of Trump trying to drain the swamp or Bernie bein the guy...both sides are bought out. The outliers of the political realm aren't even talked about.

       Even after Pao and the election, the smaller subs could keep my attention. That isn't even the case anymore. The organic content flow is what gave these websites their magic. And nothing has been done to preserve, or filter out the rubbish.

       The mods stay relatively silent on issues like these because they don't have a need or have a will to respond. This in itself makes for a poor subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But.. we are na√Øve to expect some randoms (mods) out there to provide servant based ethical moderation.

       Eventually this subreddit will be labelled alt-right and pro-nazi because it dares to expose the wrong doings of the democratic party and the deep state. Even with undenialable proof it will be considered Trump/Russia sponsored propaganda.  Im starting to consider Reddit in the same category as Google, Twitter, Apple, Wapo, Huffpost &amp; NYT.

       I came to r/conspiracy over 11 years ago as a refugee from digg, a site as many of you well know ended in disaster when traitor admins obtained positions of power solely to stop the conveyance of truth.  reddit is about to meet that same fate and I believe it's seriously time to find a new home that's free of this needless BullShit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subs glory days a far behind us now. It's a shell of what it used to be...I'm completely disgusted with these new sniveling shit mods who ban perfectly good posts from long time contributing members...but stand back and purposefully allow these posts to be destroyed by outside brigading forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods use the rules to attack good subscribers...I wouldn't be surprised if they infiltrated their way in here from TMOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been visiting here less and less often...traitor mods have taken shits all over it. To all you mods who were a part of this..,FUCK YOU.

       Yep, I'll be leaving soon. I have to admit, it feels good to go find a place with greener pastures and fresh air. Adios, amigos.

       I have a question. Why does the moderation staff have a private subreddit in which they discuss things we as public users of conspiracy aren't privy to? It's called r/conspiracy_conclave. And it's stated goal is 'for the betterment of

       I‚Äôm not sure how to fully put this down into words, because it seems that there has already been a divide between what is happening, and what is *really, actually * happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the only way I can put it down into words is through my anger at those who fail to see the reality around them, even if it were to be smashed straight into their own face...
      </p>
      <p>
       To start, we have to discuss that oh-so-dangerous ‚Äòconspiracy‚Äô Q anon. It‚Äôs abhorrent that, despite everyone saying it is a larp or an elaborate theory based in fiction, Reddit has decided to wipe the entire site clean of it‚Äôs presence and, as it seems, interfere in orbiting subs like this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       LARPS don‚Äôt get a site-wide snuffing.
      </p>
      <p>
       LARPS don‚Äôt get the time of day on the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       LARPS don‚Äôt get front row seat at presidential rallies.
      </p>
      <p>
       LARPS don‚Äôt fuel an effort to gag entire subs by relation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Q has done each and every one.
      </p>
      <p>
       People, we are at war. Most don‚Äôt even know it, as it‚Äôs not a bullets and bombs form of war. It‚Äôs an information war. ‚ÄúThe resistance won‚Äôt be televised.‚Äù No, it won‚Äôt. The news is comp‚Äôd. They‚Äôre owned by the same clowns who are implicated in serious crimes, so it is of no doubt that the integrity of the main players in MSM (CNN, FOX, MSNBN, NBC, NYT, WP, AP, CBS, etc...) is nonexistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, and I try not to even mumble his name because it causes such a polarity shift in a conversation, but Trump isn‚Äôt who the media is portraying him to be. His actions, one among them being the Q operation, behind the scenes and almost never covered by the press (I wonder why...) are deadly and detrimental to those who seek to keep us stupid and complacent. His character assassination is completely by design, so as to discredit his work as President.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could list the achievements, like jobs or economy numbers, but what is most important is his absolutely merciless approach to crimes against humanity and children. Thousands upon thousands of human trafficking arrests, crimes against children, etc....damn near pushing 50x the normal average amount of sealed court actions (like indictments!).
      </p>
      <p>
       ‚ÄúYeah, well...the proof is in the pudding. Where‚Äôs your proof?‚Äù Look around you. Entire sites are destroying whatever they can to crush the people‚Äôs voices. If Reddit‚Äôs censorship‚Äôs don‚Äôt wake you up to the reality around you, then I truly can‚Äôt help you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit, I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôve tried posting actual evidences to people. I‚Äôve posted injustices. No matter what, there will always be those who see Q or the reality around them as false and ‚Äòhate Trump at ALL costs‚Äô as their apparent goal in life. Mark my words: we may not make it out of this one, fellas. I can see a bleak, horrible future, and the fact that we are slipping into it so scarily
       <em>
        easily
       </em>
       fucking terrifies me. I can only hope that whatever forces are acting against the voices of We The People are going to go down before society as we know it collapses into another era of sheeple work-until-you-die life. Damn it people! Fight! Vote! Call everyone you know. Text them if you‚Äôre uncomfortable. Talk about Q. Spread what you can NOW before, like Reddit here, you are unable to elsewhere. It‚Äôs getting down to the wire, folks. Please do your part in texting your contact list. Something simple, like ‚ÄúThis Q anon thing might just on to something.‚Äù Something to rally even the normies.

       In the defense of the mods..  All it takes for this sub to go down is for one bad actor to purchase or crack wax's account information.  With all the other subs getting snuffed out, I don't see the harm in taking some extra precautions.  I'm sure if Wax cared enough to object he'd be right in here Reeeeing along with everybody else.

       Voat is ugly for a reason, they don‚Äôt want indoctrinated normies who squeal at the sight of bad words. Once you get past the initial disgust and learn to ignore/not be bothered by the use of the no-no words you‚Äôll find there are very active, friendly, tight nit communities that are quite non-political.

       Fox, and Robert Murdoch? Also Chick Fil A was in the news recently because its owner donates to activist causes. I'm proving your point by showing that right wingers do control media and global corporations? Because I included some right wingers whose corporations are only in America? You know there are left wing folks who own corporations who are only in america, does that mean that your statement was wrong? The right wing controls all branches of the united states government, and they control one of the largest and most influential news and media outlets in the country, not to mention that local news is dominated by the sinclair group which is massively right wing, and people like you still want to come around like you're some put upon minority. Also did you just try to insult me by calling me a nerd? For real? Are you an 80's bully?
