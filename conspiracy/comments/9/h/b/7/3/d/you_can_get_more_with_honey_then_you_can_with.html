       I woke up on the 10th anniversary of 9/11, I was 26-years-old and had already served in the United States Marine Corps.  I was a true believer and would have defended my existing worldview without reverse, but I hadn’t been woken up yet and was operating strictly on my 12 years of public school programming that was significantly reinforced by the Marines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I often see many who have woken up being judgmental of those who still cannot see.  My brother in law is awake but is a prick in his delivery to people who are unfamiliar or are resistant and likes to call them names, like “sheeple.”
      </p>
      <p>
       We have all been there because we’re all victims of the same systems of command and control starting when we’re babies.  Kind of hard to judge an unwitting victim or one suffering from denial, again, because we all have been there and felt those powerful emotions as we woke up and accepted the new reality of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just try to be mindful of the Golden Rule, please, it really can take us far — particularly in the type of emotionally heated and heavy stuff we get into here.

       This correlates with hating on military members as well. I woke up about half way through my 6 year contract with the Army and still get shit on for even joining. People are shitty and think they’re better than everyone else just because they see the world a different way. We don’t have the answers for everything, these topics are called conspiracies for a reason. Let’s all be open minded and accepting.

       Several of my friends will absolutely refuse to ever watch or read anything related to a conspiracy of any type whatsoever.
Unless...
They watch it on their own for example on 60 minutes, or some other well established news show that their wife is willing to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       An example I have been researching conspiracy theories for 3 decades and my buddy who has heard everything in the book from me and dismissed it all will message our group and say...
      </p>
      <p>
       "You won't believe this segment on 60 minutes I saw about insider trading within Congress man, it will blow your mind"
 Or
"Man the FDA is corrupt the approved all these things in our food etc.."
      </p>
      <p>
       The key is they have to feel like they discovered it. 
Now I just play along and say "
wow you mean that many people have been in on a massive conspiracy regarding our food?"
      </p>
      <p>
       A personal favorite I like to genuinely get people's opinion about is asking if they believe WMDs in Iraq was a conspiracy theory. Just asking that simple question can really bring out different answers and responses.

       I got into archiving a little bit and saved thousands of news articles that are the sources for many conspiracies, like MK-Ultra from the NY Times for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I refrain from rejecting the media altogether because if one ever watches a Congressional hearing one will observe Senators &amp; Representatives citing a news article and having it recorded in the Congressional record.  Furthermore, many intelligence professionals have spoken about the bulk of intelligence being open source, which is what we can see should we be so inclined to look for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though having sources like media or even primary documents from the government itself won’t convince everybody, which is okay, but it is effective with many I have experienced, including myself.  Paul Thompson’s 9/11 timeline helped me tremendously when I initially started researching 9/11 for that very reason — all media, government documents and published books including award winners.

       The other thing to remember is that you don’t have to make anyone believe anything, just provide them with some starting information that they can draw on when the time comes. They may not believe anything about government corruption or election rigging, but will remember that someone told them about it when it eventually becomes mainstream knowledge. This will at least soften the blow for people and make transition easier.

       Many people are resistant to new ideas when they feel it's being "pushed" upon them. Some of them need to be eased into things, or given the tools/seeds so that they can begin their own awakening.

       Facts and logic are ruthless on their own, as something is either factual/logical or it isn’t.  Being kind when speaking or showing CT material is not being soft, it’s being pragmatic, and besides it takes far more energy (particularly the negative stuff) to be a prick about things than being relatable through shared experiences, which is IMO the most successful route to take with someone when introducing idea bombs.

       Not all of us, no.  I don’t try to harsh on anyone at the personal level with insults like calling them stupid, but I will chime in when something doesn’t make sense to me or I think what is being argued is provably false, which I expect in return because it is standard in debate when arguments are presented.

       It's usually the newly redpilled. People who switch worldviews on
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       --religion, diet, politics, etc--are usually insufferable. As time goes on they become more comfortable (and thus secure) in their views that they mellow out... but yeah, they can be obnoxious during those initial phases.

       It's an awful attitude and mirrors elitist thinking. Elitists think of those below them as sheep to be managed because they know the truth of how things work and the sheep don't. Bernay's Propaganda provides a great intro to this line of thinking.

       At the end of the day actions matter more than thoughts. If we're all 'awake' but we work 9-5, pay rent or buy a house, and do mostly 'normal things' but maybe we wear different clothes, go to punk shows, or watch conspiracy videos instead of Disney, are we really any different than the so-called 'sheep'?

       It's just like when I was going to Christian camps and they were trying to teach us how to witness to people. They were trying to get us to do impersonal scripted witnessing to complete strangers but that's not how it works if you want to try to change somebody's mind. It's about building personal relationships and having people see over time what you're talking about. Paradigm shifts are not something you can just make people have.

       I don’t think there is a total universal approach that can work with everybody but I’d start with being empathetic and sympathetic and then determine how they generally view things and how they want to proceed with the information because I could just refer to sources or I could answer questions as the material is covered, whatever is comfortable for the individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, personally, it was getting into primary documents &amp; empirical evidence (like videos &amp; pictures) that sealed the deal for me, which I found relatively easy but where I needed assistance is the honed analysis from veterans of this stuff to help alleviate the onslaught of complex emotions and states of mind, like paranoia for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often because of social stigmas or our own self-judgments and norms we don’t like to admit to being paranoid but it is common among us at first for a while because how could it not be given the implications?
