        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-09-21 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/AssuredlyAThrowAway.html">AssuredlyAThrowAway</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As some who have been following the subreddit today may have noticed, a post on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Fuckthealtright/comments/9hlhsx/why_did_that_well_researched_post_about_t_d/">/r/fuckthealtright explaining Russian propaganda efforts was deleted last evening.</a> </p>

<p>The disappearance of that post caused a large degree of speculation around reddit today, in particular directed at the admins (as moderators of <a href="/r/fuckthealtright">/r/fuckthealtright</a> had been openly speculating/implying that the post had been removed by the reddit adminisators).</p>

<p>This in turn lead to a post on <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a> which reached #1 on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> with over 40,000 upvotes in only a few short hours with the following title;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/9hqzb5/rfuckthealtright_mod_made_a_detailed_post_of_his/">r/fuckthealtright mod made a detailed post of his research into Russian propaganda and T_D: It&#39;s highly upvoted and even guilded, but gets removed by admins, and the account is deleted. Users are confused, and call bullshit om the admin&#39;s reason for removal, and speculate why it why it was removed.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A similar post, placing blame on the reddit administrators, was also made to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and is currently #1 on this very subreddit with the following title;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9hrlvt/post_detailing_russian_astroturfing_on_t_d/">Post detailing Russian astroturfing on T_D removed by admins, post text hardcoded as spam</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both of the above titles play up the removal of the post by the admins with the intention of inducing a Streisand effect, which is exactly how this website should respond to an incident involving admin censorship.</p>

<p>However, it was then quite strange to see the original OP of the russian propaganda post leave the following comment in the SRD thread confirming the administrators of reddit did not remove the post in question, nor were any of his accounts banned or suspended;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nIvVxUh.png">Burning my last alt to defend an old internet friend, sodypop.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nIvVxUh.png">I deleted /u/DivestTrump. I also deleted two default mod accounts (I left a third in good hands), three century club accounts and a handful of others. All said, I think the reddit economy lost a couple million karma, a decade of gold and one disgruntled user (don&#39;t worry, they kept the money from the gold). Shortly, I will delete this account as well.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nIvVxUh.png">To clear up some conspiracies:</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nIvVxUh.png">* The Russians didn&#39;t kill me.</a>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/nIvVxUh.png">* The admins didn&#39;t kill me.</a>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/nIvVxUh.png">* I have not been recruited nor abducted by a three letter agency.</a>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/nIvVxUh.png">* /u/sodypop is 100% correct (and also a nice person). The admins neither removed my post nor had anything to do with my account deletion.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nIvVxUh.png">The admins put forth a genuine effort regarding the domains I alerted them to. They&#39;re just not very good at it if a dummy like me using publicly available data can find it before them. Furthermore, if a week isn&#39;t enough time to track whatever it is they&#39;re tracking, they&#39;re not doing something right. In their defense, this is likely due to their retention policy. More privacy for you means more privacy for Russian agents. I pissed off spez and other admins by releasing the info when I did. I asked when I could make it public and they said a couple days, so I waited a couple days. I think the confusion was I used my main account (now deleted) to alert them and discuss and they were blindsided that I was also /u/DivestTrump, so they may have expected something else when I said I wanted to take it public. I figured they could see my alts, but apparently, they never bothered to check. I feel releasing the info publicly was the right thing to do. The admins tend to release things framed in a way that is beneficial to them, so beating them to the punch was critical. Also, the midterms are coming and I wanted the information out in time for it to matter. Lastly, I do commend them on their responsiveness. I sent an email to spez, KeyserSosa and a member of the anti-evil team on a Friday evening and had a response in under an hour. No other site would do that. After that, things got ugly. </a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nIvVxUh.png">When I made my post, the admins were caught off guard. Spez gave me a brief &#39;I&#39;m not mad, I&#39;m disappointed&#39; response. He seemed like he genuinely wanted to do a thorough dive on the reports and I cut that short. Remember that the sites were on reddit for over a year. So, sorry spez, but I don&#39;t feel that bad. I&#39;m one guy that barely knows python and you have dozens of full time software engineers. </a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nIvVxUh.png">As for why I deleted my accounts, I&#39;m just done with this. The trolls win reddit. I&#39;m not interested in spending my time getting doxxed, death threats, brigades, witch hunts and general reddit vitriol for no good reason. I report a death threat and get a response TWO WEEKS later? Fuck that noise. I find propaganda and get a passive aggressive post about me? Fuck that noise too.</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nIvVxUh.png">Fuck The_Donald.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nIvVxUh.png">I&#39;m out. </a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/9hqzb5/rfuckthealtright_mod_made_a_detailed_post_of_his/e6e4dzf/">Permalink to comment</a>, and <a href="http://archive.li/gWN5l">archive of comment for posterity</a>.</p>

<p>While it is most certainly understandable that someone in the position of the OP might delete the account used to post their research following threats and such, reddit provides the ability to delete one&#39;s account while also leaving up posts and comments which had been made by that account while it was active.</p>

<p>In that regard, I am inclined to suggest that OP (after protracted discussions with the admins, which he felt resulted in inadequate action on their part in relation to his research) deleted his own post, stayed intentionally silent (while also having his co-mods from <a href="/r/fuckthealtright">/r/fuckthealtright</a> speculate as to admin involvement in the deletion of the post), and then only clarified the reality of the situation after a Streisand had occurred <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZGjYhJO.png">(the post blaming the reddit admins for the deletion is still at #5 on /r/all at this very moment)</a> in order to bring more attention to the post (knowing full well his co-mods from <a href="/r/fuckthealtright">/r/fuckthealtright</a> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Fuckthealtright/comments/9hlhsx/why_did_that_well_researched_post_about_t_d/e6cw46z/">had made an archive of the material</a>).</p>

<p>I am inclined to believe this was done to trick the reddit userbase into believing the post had been censored, in order to drive more attention to the research based on a false pretense.</p>

<p>While I can understand that those involved in such a tactic may have been doing so with noble intentions, countering nefarious propaganda by way of cognitive manipulation undermines the very integrity those individuals are seeking to instill as a moral maxim on this platform.</p>

<p>In that regard, I suppose if nefarious groups are looking for insights as to how to manipulate reddit they were just given quite the blueprint :(.</p>

<p>TL;DR- User deleted his own post, stayed conspicuously silent until after a Streisand had occurred, and the post incorrectly blaming the admins for the removal is now near the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.</p>

<p>My suggestion in this post is that the deletion of the post (not the account) was done intentionally to cause a faux-Streisand effect (even though the OP knew full well the admins had not removed his comment). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s confusing me as well.  The only thing downvotes do is lower the exposure a post gets. Why do people not want what OP says to be seen? </p>

<p>The way upvotes/downvotes should be used in my opinion: downvote things that are not relevant, not things you don&#39;t like or disagree with. You should upvote things you think are wrong as the increase of exposure will also increase the number of responses. If the post/comment is wrong then the replies will explain why/how it is wrong. Downvotes just make it look like you are afraid of people seeing the information you vote down. This also increases the echo chambers we see everywhere on Reddit. </p>

<p>Obviously this way of thinking only applies to subreddits designed for discussion not like an art or music sub. </p>

<p>Just my two cents. I could have probably worded this better but I hope I got my point across clearly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% spot on OP. Manufactured outrage to draw attention to the substance of the post (which wasn&#39;t that strong or groundbreaking to begin with) I will leave an earlier rebuttal to the actual substance of this post:</p>

<p>The substance of the original post is somewhat true but the impact on anything on Reddit besides r/t_d is marginal. It is true Russian botnets and spambots run a few websites that just copy/paste articles from bigger, legitimate right wing websites but these websites have little traction and may get an article or 2 to the front page but thats it. Not really a groundbreaking earthshattering conspiracy, most of it is to garner ad revenue and that&#39;s pretty much it. Not to mention many websites from these &quot;trollfarms&quot; target left wing communities as well. I&#39;ts not like r/t_d mods are getting paychecks from Putin like you make it out to be. Do you want to know why sometimes articles from those sites get upvoted? Because they are pro trump and the average user doesn&#39;t care about the background of the website they are reading it on. Your not uncovering watergate here OP relax.</p>

<p>Moreover we should not glance over the fact that there is rampant astroturfing in the flagship subreddits of r/politics r/worldnews and many other major subreddits from billionaire funded outfits like Correct The Record, Shareblue and Moveon.org <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9hsdj6/rosenstein_suggested_he_secretly_record_trump_and/e6e44fq/">Example</a>. Lets also not ignore the fact that (problematic) subreddits admins dont like, like r/greatawkening get shut down the moment they gain any traction by paid trolls and shills who blanket the subreddit in threats and other rule breaking posts.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t people like you do this much digging and research into something useful like how much the United States influences Israeli elections through media and financial outlets?</p>

<p>*Update: This move to ban r/t_d and other right wing subreddits is being empowered by the SPLC <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9gnado/splc_pushing_to_get_t_d_banned_from_reddit/">Details Here</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>who is brigading this sub and downvoting you?  srd? notice they aren&#39;t saying anything- just downvoting heavy in this thread.</p>

<p>The TD sub is fake opposition.  It&#39;s not run by russians, it&#39;s run by israelis in the US who came from the soviet union.  It&#39;s the same group that runs the tard sub, the antispam subs and the organized the sinking of digg because of the grassroots ron paul campaign activity on there.</p>

<p>SPLC makes money by promoting the concept of hate groups.  I&#39;ve personally found fake hategroups promoted on their site.  They didn&#39;t exist- they had a website full of images pulled from a kkk movie, that they were pretending was a hate rally that they held, and the SPLC publicized the shit out of it and probably got a lot of donations, which they promptly moved offshore.  They used to be a honest group that protected the civil rights of african americans and underprivileged ethnic groups in the US, but potok brought in his adl-esque agenda and turned it into a profit center focused on calling people antisemites.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll also say that while i appreciate the kind of research that was done in the original post- it does&#39;t make sense that Mueller&#39;s number one putin-bot enemy would affiliate his agitprop troll with his linkedin account.  That concept is too hilarious to take seriously.  It&#39;s shenanigans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Had been discussing this a bit in another thread, but in short;</p>

<p>There are two kind of spam filter removals; the first kind will only remove the post, but allow it to be approved by moderators -<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9hfn9j/the_donald_is_actively_promoting_russian/">(as occurred yesterday when we were able to approve the post in question on /r/conspiracy)</a></p>

<p>A second kind of spam filter removal (which is used quite rarely in my experience) prevents the post from being approved by moderators (the post will simply go back into the spam filter).</p>

<p>It is possible yesterday the links within the post were only subject to the first filter, and then moved to the second stage filter after admins determined they posed a serious threat to reddit or its userbase. </p>

<p>Although I am the first one to criticize the admins, I can understand why they need to keep the details as to that system of filters hidden from those who are trying to abuse the reddit system (in particular hostile state actors and such). </p>

<p>The only reason this post was made today was the 40,000 upvote post on <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a> which blamed the admins for a deletion the user themselves confirmed was the result of a deletion by that user- <a href="https://i.imgur.com/nIvVxUh.png">https://i.imgur.com/nIvVxUh.png</a></p>

<p>In that way, as I said in the op regarding the use of this kind of fake Streisand;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While I can understand that those involved in such a tactic may have been doing so with noble intentions, countering nefarious propaganda by way of cognitive manipulation undermines the very integrity those individuals are seeking to instill as a moral maxim on this platform.</p>

<p>The more reasonable possibility is that OP made their post, got death threats or sizzling threats,l ( as it usually happens when someone comes out strongly against T_D or T_D related subs), had enough and went fuck this shit and deleted everything. Mods saw the post disappear, asked each other if they had done it. Once everyone said it wasn&#39;t them, the next logical step was that someone else removes the post which would indicate the admins.</p>

<p>Post was made blaming the admins.</p>

<p>Admin made their statement but the blame post had already gained steam and was going on on its own.</p>

<p>Actually the comment would have rendered to the mods as still visible if it were removed by the admins (it would be highlighted in red with a [removed] tag when viewing the submission from a mod account).</p>

<p>When a user deletes their own submission/comment it will render as [deleted] to mods and users alike.</p>

<p>divesttrump has personally said from their high profile alt accounts the admins did not delete their account or the thread. Indeed, divesttrump praised the admins and said they had responded to his research in one hour when he originally gave it to them. divesttrump said they deleted the post and all their account because of harassment and because they are tired of reddit for various reasons. </p>

<p>That may be a hard reason for you to understand. It&#39;s easy for me as I have seen the sheer number of  crazy and foul comments that come from a high profile, front page post, and mine was no where near as controversial.  I have also spent time researching a post only to have some people respond with ad hominem personal attacks, as opposed to challenging the data or position. It is very discouraging to see the worst of people.</p>

Indeed, divesttrump praised the admins and said they had responded to his research in one hour when he originally gave it to them. divesttrump said they deleted the post and all their account because of harassment and because they are tired of reddit for various reasons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right that wasn&#39;t the critique I laid out in the OP; the critique was that the OP stayed silent for 12 hours as a post with 40,000 upvotes (which falsely placed blame on the admins) was #1 on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, and apparently only spoke up because sodypop was his friend).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why its so difficult for you to understand the potential for both viewpoints to be true; OP&#39;s research was most certainly legitimate and worthy of further attention (which is why we manually approved it on this subreddit 2 days ago) and I have no doubt that the user did receive threats (as many of us do on this website), but the disingenuous tactic of faking a Stresisand undermines the very core of that research (opposing cognitive manipulation).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s pretty clear the user knew their co-mods from fuckthealtright had placed blame on the admins as a way to drive more attention to the deleted submission (as they were in the backroom slack channels and such due to being a default mod on other accounts).</p>

<p>It&#39;s really not that difficult to see what occurred here, but I can understand why some want to ignore the manipulation due to what they feel to be the importance of the research done by u/divesttrump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the evidence is included in the post by way of multiple posts (including those made by <a href="/u/DivestTrump">/u/DivestTrump</a>&#39;s co-mods at fuckthealtright) placing blame on the admins for a deletion they knew to be the result of user action (as those mods know full well how to check the mod log to confirm an admin removal vs a user deletion).</p>

<p>That behavior was further confirmed by way of the OP deleting their post rather than just their account, as reddit accounts can be deleted without removing the content of one&#39;s previous comments/submissions those comments/submissions would remain, but with [deleted] displayed as the user).  </p>

<p>At its core, that research was quite important (and I know the OP had spent many months compiling their data and such) but engaging in that kind of manipulation (even if the OP felt they were acting in a &quot;benevolent manner&quot;) undermines autonomy and, in turn, the very principle of the work in question (rightfully condemning nefarious propaganda on reddit).</p>

<p>Well sure, that&#39;s fair; however I don&#39;t think that rules out hermeneutical reconstruction (as to the intent of a given author) entirely.</p>

<p>Also its not so much about hating spez as it is using tactics of cognitive manipulation to drive attention (&quot;light a fire under their butts&quot; as you say). </p>

<p>There&#39;s an argument to be had, without question, as to the legitimacy of appropriating the tactics of propaganda for benevolent ends (I would call such a view &quot;Beneovlent Bernaysism&quot;); but veiling those tactics to advance one&#39;s work, without disclosing that behavior, seems to me to undermine autonomy in a way that is quite dangerous (in particular in the wrong hands).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. I live in Russia as an American. Master&#39;s in Eurasian studies so perhaps I can provide some insight to your misguided assumptions. Survival is one of the main goals if any country, I think that basic tenet can be agreed upon any rational human. It&#39;s rational for a country to act in the best interest of themselves. What does Russia gain by choosing one side? They won&#39;t get compliant from us, so what do they get? More false promises and more of NATO eating into it&#39;s sphere of influence. Russia has learned that trusting the u.s. is detrimental and puts their survival at risk. By &quot;sowing chaos&quot; you can fight the u.s. by using their own weapons. They can weaken the u.s. without firing a single bullet or launching a single bomb. The only evidence the public has of Russian interference is the Russian group utilizing Facebook to create memes. Why would they create memes which supported Hillary, BLM, Democrats? Because it pissed the fuck out of the right. Now you have two strong blocs at each other&#39;s throats. Russia is accomplishing their goal. It&#39;s quite obvious when you remove the rhetoric and highlight the evidence, but there&#39;s been so much rhetoric and false or misleading information, nobody knows what is true and false. Russia has played us like a fiddle</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously who the fuck makes death threats over a reddit post? I would really be interested in seeing these supposed threats. I have a hunch what is often reported as a death threat is probably not. I only ever see people claiming they were made and never posting the actual threats.  </p>

<p>Case in point the OP states admins were &quot;threatened with violence&quot; then quotes &quot;add it to the pile. Traitors do not end well.&quot;. That&#39;s not a threat of violence in my book. Maybe my bar for what constitutes a threat is different than most people. Just seems like useless hyperbole to me.</p>

Guys, there is no First Amendment bullshit going on here.

Stop pretending there is some kind of community ownership of this site. You are a guest here and can be removed at any time for any reason. There is no conspiracy, it&#39;s a business and business people don&#39;t want shitheads shitting up the place with piles of shit. Go to TOR social media sites or start some co-op site without administration if you don&#39;t like it.

<p>The more likely explanation, in my judgement, is that the initial user deleted all accounts and comments as stated for the reasons stated. Others then wrongly speculated that this was admin action, resulting in the spreading of misinformation. </p>

<p>Others are rightly calling you out for stickying this post, considering that the conspiracy you endorse is problematic, and it seems to be an effort to discredit/detract/distract from the content of that other post (even if the content is not nearly as damning as many seem to think). </p>

<p>Also, it might be worth noting that there are some notably absurd pro-russia views in this sub (not to say that being pro-russia is absurd, but that the manner in which such views are expressed and defended is often very clearly divorced from reality) including frequent use of russian propaganda sources that - based on a quick google search - may have direct ties to the kremlin (<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=russia-insider.com&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;t=all">russia-insider</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_Insider">one</a> and the always popular <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=zerohedge.com&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;t=all">zerohedge</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Hedge">another</a>. Curiously, zerohedge and russia-insider have a direct <a href="https://russia-insider.com/en/zerohedge-0">relationship</a>). Perhaps this makes the distraction effort more understandable...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not altogether common in this sub for someone to have a claim challenged and then respond in a manner that fits the challenge, rather than angrily shutting down dialogue entirely. So I appreciate your response. </p>

<p>To clarify your view, then:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>after protracted discussions with the admins, which he felt resulted in inadequate action on their part in relation to his research</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>OP wanted to induce a streisand effect in order to raise awareness of his post and thereby put pressure on admins. </p></li>
<li><p>OP succeeded. After successfully inducing a streisand effect, pressure was placed on the admins.</p></li>
<li><p>(ad hoc) OP was friends with an admin and didn&#39;t want such pressure to be placed on the admins as it was harmful</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In order to avoid outright contradiction in your account (between point 1 and 3), you will have to find some way to clarify what sort of pressure OP wanted, and what sort of pressure OP obtained. What &quot;harm&quot; was being caused by the pressure that was obtained, and how this deviated from the pressure OP wanted. What the nature of the &quot;friendship&quot; was such that OP would be so concerned about that harm. Only then would your ad hoc attempt to patch over the weakness in your initial post be adequate (not that conspiracies/accounts require absolute knowledge of all details, but that they require sufficient explanation to avoid apparent contradiction). </p>

<p>I believe OP removed the original after getting death threats. Your theory is not incoherent but the way it is conducted deteriogates the reputation of this sub. The OP also removed it in the time of most traction stiffling it&#39;s exposure. </p>

<p>In the end even if this was a publicity stunt the implications of the information are more far reaching in terms of conspiracy theories and should be stickied instead.</p>

<p>If this guy deleted his post to try to draw more attention then he just wants to push justification to censor T_D. Which will add fuel to the fire justifying right-wing people to play as the new &#39;Jews&#39; on how the left is censoring them.

    <div class="md"><p>who is brigading this sub and downvoting you?  srd? notice they aren&#39;t saying anything- just downvoting heavy in this thread.</p>

<p>The TD sub is fake opposition.  It&#39;s not run by russians, it&#39;s run by israelis in the US who came from the soviet union.  It&#39;s the same group that runs the tard sub, the antispam subs and the organized the sinking of digg because of the grassroots ron paul campaign activity on there.</p>

<p>SPLC makes money by promoting the concept of hate groups.  I&#39;ve personally found fake hategroups promoted on their site.  They didn&#39;t exist- they had a website full of images pulled from a kkk movie, that they were pretending was a hate rally that they held, and the SPLC publicized the shit out of it and probably got a lot of donations, which they promptly moved offshore.  They used to be a honest group that protected the civil rights of african americans and underprivileged ethnic groups in the US, but potok brought in his adl-esque agenda and turned it into a profit center focused on calling people antisemites.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll also say that while i appreciate the kind of research that was done in the original post- it does&#39;t make sense that Mueller&#39;s number one putin-bot enemy would affiliate his agitprop troll with his linkedin account.  That concept is too hilarious to take seriously.  It&#39;s shenanigans. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to ask if they were mistaken, but I know full well any mod would know the difference (as one can be suspended for reapproving an admin removed post and, thus, must know what those removals look like on the backend). </p>
