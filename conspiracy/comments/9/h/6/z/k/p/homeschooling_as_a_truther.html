        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I home school 4 of my kids because the school district hasn&#39;t been able to keep them safe. (many long stories).  About 3yrs ago a friend opened my eyes with the $20 million dollar club/celebrity sacrifice videos and since then I inhale everything conspiracy related.</p>

<p>Question is my kids are 13, 11, 7 &amp; 6.  I wanted to create a curriculum starting with the 13 families, banking system, common signs in media, pedo symbols, etc. My fear is they will become the laughing stock of the neighbor kids and someone will call CPS on their kooky mom.  I think it&#39;s important for them to realize that society, media, politics isn&#39;t want it claims to be. I&#39;ve tried a couple of topics with my older kids and it opened up hours of conversation (more than any other topic).  Do you think it&#39;s too early to expose them to to the &quot;truth&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His answer was really good! You can separate your &quot;lessons&quot; between practical subjects, and theoretical subjects.<br/>
To me you should teach them literally, how to learn, how to use their critical thinking.  Do not be afraid to expose anyone to the truth, of course little bit of HOW to speak and when is a must. BUT NEVER hide what you believe is truth.   </p>

<p>So yeah, go deep with em in whanever subject of &quot;conspiracy&quot; you deem important, find good books, read with em. Let &#39;em also search, and share with you their discoveries! Like, make some quests and let them work together to improve their team skills also! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely it is way to early to expose your kids to any of these awful things you mentioned.  I&#39;m kind of speechless that you would want your children to know about these things at such an early age.  I don&#39;t think&#39;s it&#39;s the parents job to teach them about your &quot;truths&quot;, but more importantly teach them how to critically think all information that&#39;s provided to them.  I think it&#39;s important to teach them that news media, and the government often lie to protect their own interests, and how that is wrong, and telling the truth is always, always the best course of action.  </p>

<p>If you teach them how to properly sniff out bullshit, and how to discern the truth in the face of an increasingly untruthful world, then you&#39;ve done your part.  Exposing them to your &quot;truths&quot; at such a young age will absolutely destroy their innocence.  They need to find this out on their own, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I would trim it down to age appropriate material, but I&#39;m not seeing the difference between me teaching these topics and the school district teaching forced diversity, transgender topics or the sex ed curriculum that now has a &quot;self love&quot; chapter would do any different to destroy their innocence? Children are their target market and kids are abducted at their ages.</p>

<p>I do want to open the doors for more critical thinking.  After spending 2 weeks discussing the Revolutionary War and seeing blank stares as compared to when I discussed that our founding fathers were Freemasons and the symbols we still see today was kind of refreshing.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely commend you for noticing that our public schools are teaching evil, and your pulling them out of that mess.  My mother saw the same thing, and pulled me and my brother out at an early age and home schooled us for a time, then placed in a Christian private school.  </p>

<p>I wish I had the determination and sticktoitivness to home school my kids, however I can at the moment afford to have them in a private school where they aren&#39;t exposed to the evil which you described.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s definitely room to teach them that there are bad people in this world that might look to harm them, that&#39;s important.  </p>

<p>At the end of the day, they are your kids, and you have the finally say in what you teach them.  As a parent myself, I would just want to keep their innocence as long as possible. </p>

<p>Two problems here... How would an 11 year old know who Britney and Xtina are? I know they are recent to you and me but they arent exactly as in the limelight anymore, your 11 year old has never known them to be superstars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they know who both of them are, they are still pop stars with at least 20+ years of career behind them.

    <div class="md"><p>100% agree. I literally cannot grasp how anyone else can think otherwise. It&#39;s selfish and harmful - I wonder how hard it is for the average home schooled guy to get a girlfriend let alone a date - you&#39;re depriving them of the socialization that leads us to know how to act around people in our society. I swear at that point you&#39;re NURTURING autism. </p>

<p>&quot;I get a lesson plan and I just teach my son!&quot; - oh...didn&#39;t realize because you&#39;re a parent you got a degree in teaching all of the subjects you learn in school.</p>

<p>&quot;I bring them to the park so they can socialize still, and they have play dates!!&quot; - so you schedule and organize their fun instead of allowing them to make friends, plans, and fun organically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nowhere in my comment did I tell you to let them be abused by strangers. </p>

<p>The school systems are far from perfect, the pupils and teachers both are also far from perfect. But there are valuable lessons to be learnt through the school years that if they don&#39;t, leaves them far far behind their counterparts if you or they have any hope for a somewhat normal life in this society.  </p>

<p>Sometimes those lessons come from bad situations, from being on the receiving end of someone else&#39;s bad mood or hatred. Having the teacher pick on you or exclude you for unfair reasons. </p>

<p>It is not impossible to let your children have those school years and time in school, while also imparting your personal lessons at home. Giving them the best of both worlds so to speak, while also letting them see some of the bad in the world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just try not to fuck them up too much. Unlike many others in the thread, I am not against homeschooling - but remember that most conspiracy content online is designed to get $$$CLICKS$$$ and is mostly exaggerated and misinterpreted as such. It&#39;s like chinese telephone, only you get paid in clicks and likes and patreon subscriptions if you distort the message enough to prey on peoples lack of power in this world and their sense that it is stacked against them (because it is).</p>

<p>In closing, I will suggest adding Robert Anton Wilson&#39;s <em>Illuminatus!</em> trilogy to the literature reading list for the older ones. It&#39;s a cult classic of the 70s counterculture (and modern conspiracy theory is an outgrowth of that counterculture).</p>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t add it to their reading list, you should check it out... that book changed my (and many other conspiracy theorists) worldview forever. Also made me an optimist!</p>
