       I home school 4 of my kids because the school district hasn't been able to keep them safe. (many long stories).  About 3yrs ago a friend opened my eyes with the $20 million dollar club/celebrity sacrifice videos and since then I inhale everything conspiracy related.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question is my kids are 13, 11, 7 &amp; 6.  I wanted to create a curriculum starting with the 13 families, banking system, common signs in media, pedo symbols, etc. My fear is they will become the laughing stock of the neighbor kids and someone will call CPS on their kooky mom.  I think it's important for them to realize that society, media, politics isn't want it claims to be. I've tried a couple of topics with my older kids and it opened up hours of conversation (more than any other topic).  Do you think it's too early to expose them to to the "truth"?

       I'm a parent myself, and raising a pup isn't easy, so why complicate their life and relationships with others with heavy material. This is adult material you want to talk to them about.

       His answer was really good! You can separate your "lessons" between practical subjects, and theoretical subjects.
       <br/>
       To me you should teach them literally, how to learn, how to use their critical thinking.  Do not be afraid to expose anyone to the truth, of course little bit of HOW to speak and when is a must. BUT NEVER hide what you believe is truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, go deep with em in whanever subject of "conspiracy" you deem important, find good books, read with em. Let 'em also search, and share with you their discoveries! Like, make some quests and let them work together to improve their team skills also!

       Absolutely it is way to early to expose your kids to any of these awful things you mentioned.  I'm kind of speechless that you would want your children to know about these things at such an early age.  I don't think's it's the parents job to teach them about your "truths", but more importantly teach them how to critically think all information that's provided to them.  I think it's important to teach them that news media, and the government often lie to protect their own interests, and how that is wrong, and telling the truth is always, always the best course of action.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you teach them how to properly sniff out bullshit, and how to discern the truth in the face of an increasingly untruthful world, then you've done your part.  Exposing them to your "truths" at such a young age will absolutely destroy their innocence.  They need to find this out on their own, in my opinion.

       Of course I would trim it down to age appropriate material, but I'm not seeing the difference between me teaching these topics and the school district teaching forced diversity, transgender topics or the sex ed curriculum that now has a "self love" chapter would do any different to destroy their innocence? Children are their target market and kids are abducted at their ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do want to open the doors for more critical thinking.  After spending 2 weeks discussing the Revolutionary War and seeing blank stares as compared to when I discussed that our founding fathers were Freemasons and the symbols we still see today was kind of refreshing.

       I absolutely commend you for noticing that our public schools are teaching evil, and your pulling them out of that mess.  My mother saw the same thing, and pulled me and my brother out at an early age and home schooled us for a time, then placed in a Christian private school.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I had the determination and sticktoitivness to home school my kids, however I can at the moment afford to have them in a private school where they aren't exposed to the evil which you described.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's definitely room to teach them that there are bad people in this world that might look to harm them, that's important.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, they are your kids, and you have the finally say in what you teach them.  As a parent myself, I would just want to keep their innocence as long as possible.

       Two problems here... How would an 11 year old know who Britney and Xtina are? I know they are recent to you and me but they arent exactly as in the limelight anymore, your 11 year old has never known them to be superstars.

       Also if you are so into keeping your kids away from societal conditioning why do they watch so much TV?

       Of course they know who both of them are, they are still pop stars with at least 20+ years of career behind them. Also, both were Mouseketeers which is what we were discussing.  I don't keep them away from social conditioning, I let them experience everything that their peers do. I just want to make them aware of what is being pushed at them.

       It's definitely not for everyone.  My mother tried, and failed.  It was the most terrible experience for me, for just that reason, I couldn't socialize with my peers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't call it child abuse though.  Most states require homeschoolers to take efficiency tests to ensure they're being at least taught the basics to weed out parents who aren't doing the basic job.

       Chd abuse because you're sheltering your kids from their peers to the point they'll likely have lifelong problems socializing.  As far as the education content in the public system that's secondary to the social skills kids learn.

       100% agree. I literally cannot grasp how anyone else can think otherwise. It's selfish and harmful - I wonder how hard it is for the average home schooled guy to get a girlfriend let alone a date - you're depriving them of the socialization that leads us to know how to act around people in our society. I swear at that point you're NURTURING autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I get a lesson plan and I just teach my son!" - oh...didn't realize because you're a parent you got a degree in teaching all of the subjects you learn in school.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I bring them to the park so they can socialize still, and they have play dates!!" - so you schedule and organize their fun instead of allowing them to make friends, plans, and fun organically.

       I agree with others here that the subject is adult material. Did you let them believe in Santa Claus? Whether-or-not you did, it is an indicator that the child will choose themselves when they are ready for "the truth".

       Same for adults; one snaps-out-of-it when they are ready. Make or buy all your kids green goggles. Wear them while suggesting they live "in an Emerald City". Don't you believe??

       Both of my parents were conspiracy theorists and preppers. From an early age we were taught to always look beyond what you are told and to keep looking for the truth. My father was more, shall I say radical then my mother and has never trusted a word the government has said. He was the most instrumental in making sure we were taught survival skills, reading between the lines of dialog your given and so on and so forth. I personally have no regrets to how I was raised and do not feel like my childhood was stolen ect. I appreciate my parents for teaching me to always be vigilant and to find the truth so to speak. My father always says that it's never to early to gain knowledge and that knowledge is power that nobody can take away. This is just my opinion though.

       What you are doing to your children in a modern society is akin to child abuse, by homeschooling them you are setting them up for years of unnecessary hardship &amp; difficulties.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do realize they won't be well enough equipped to deal with 90% of the adult world around them when they are out of the home and by themselves don't you? Look at what the Mormons, the Amish do, that's a version of what you're doing, those poor kids.

       So I should let them be abused by complete strangers that I'm telling them that it's okay to trust?  How is homeschooling child abuse? Because they're learning in a loving environment that encourages creative thinking?  How are my kids not equipped to deal with the outside world?  Because they don't sit for 8hrs taking a test that no one will ever ask you about in the adult world?  Guess I missed something.

       The school systems are far from perfect, the pupils and teachers both are also far from perfect. But there are valuable lessons to be learnt through the school years that if they don't, leaves them far far behind their counterparts if you or they have any hope for a somewhat normal life in this society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes those lessons come from bad situations, from being on the receiving end of someone else's bad mood or hatred. Having the teacher pick on you or exclude you for unfair reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not impossible to let your children have those school years and time in school, while also imparting your personal lessons at home. Giving them the best of both worlds so to speak, while also letting them see some of the bad in the world.

       I just think they're too young and aren't ready at that age to properly put that kind of information in perspective. The whole ball of wax might even have negative psychological effects on them.

       A little here and there is fine. Say maybe, "well a lobbyist is a person who's job it is to bribe Congress for corporations". Stuff like that. Just my opinion of course.

       OP please don't do this to your children. Let them learn official history first, and then come to their own conclusions. What you are suggesting is the functional equivalent of forcing religion onto them. You may have seen enough to "believe" in all the conspiracy theories but that is no different than someone "believing" in a sky father that wants your money.

       What exactly is "official history" ?  I guess it's based on the backer of who produces the text books. I don't believe, I question, and that's what I'm hoping my kids will be able to do for themselves in the future.

       And what about when your kids grow up and start to question the narrative you fed them? What if you become "an agent of the cabal" (or its equivalent) in their worldview? You are right to question everything... and you should question whether the conspiracy content you "inhale" is accurate or just another lie. You say that you've been doing this for 3 years... well, take it from someone who's been doing it for 15, many many many people will take you for a ride.

       Might I suggest combining the two curriculums? "Here is what is taught about history in schools. Here is an alternative reading of the causes and purposes of those events. Here are quality sources for both. Not websites. Not youtube videos. Books written by quality researchers with cited sources".

       Just try not to fuck them up too much. Unlike many others in the thread, I am not against homeschooling - but remember that most conspiracy content online is designed to get $$$CLICKS$$$ and is mostly exaggerated and misinterpreted as such. It's like chinese telephone, only you get paid in clicks and likes and patreon subscriptions if you distort the message enough to prey on peoples lack of power in this world and their sense that it is stacked against them (because it is).
      </p>
      <p>
       In closing, I will suggest adding Robert Anton Wilson's
       <em>
        Illuminatus!
       </em>
       trilogy to the literature reading list for the older ones. It's a cult classic of the 70s counterculture (and modern conspiracy theory is an outgrowth of that counterculture).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you don't add it to their reading list, you should check it out... that book changed my (and many other conspiracy theorists) worldview forever. Also made me an optimist!

       Stick to a standard curriculum with their schooling. They'll pick up the conspiracy stuff on the side just from living with you, and they'll be less hostile towards it if they understand it as your personal beliefs outside of the rubric of education.

       If you must do this, teach them the ‘normal stuff’ before anything else. They need to go out into the ‘normal’ world, that’s what’s important. Conspiracy can be a side project that opens the mind, but it won’t get them a job

       It may be overwhelming to realize they face such evil. You will have to be very calm and hopeful as you bring up simple things like media bias. I remember parents commenting kids were learning from pewdie pie (?) that the media was deceptive.  That may be a less threatening way to expose it, from their own age group.

       After scouring the internet and dark web I have yet to find this legendary video people speak of. We have videos of UFO's everywhere, so why is a video of celebrities sacrificing people so hard to find? Or is this just the conspiracy that a lot of celebrities have had family members die. Like every human being alive. Or are all your relatives immortal, and where can I get this immortality?

       Two problems here... How would an 11 year old know who Britney and Xtina are? I know they are recent to you and me but they arent exactly as in the limelight anymore, your 11 year old has never known them to be superstars.

       Also if you are so into keeping your kids away from societal conditioning why do they watch so much TV?

       What exactly is "official history" ?  I guess it's based on the backer of who produces the text books. I don't believe, I question, and that's what I'm hoping my kids will be able to do for themselves in the future.
