Meaning our country can&#39;t pay back the loan because the amount owed is more than the amount of money printed. A privately owned bank, screwing over the west. How the west has allowed this to continue for 100 years is a bit mindblowing.</p>

<p>exposing the fed (30min) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrwbgdtbdXE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrwbgdtbdXE</a></p>

<p>Assume the is no money in existence in this hypothetical. the Federal Reserve (owned by the Rothschilds) prints $1 and the US government gives the Fed a $1 bond. This bond collects interest. So if the US pays back the $1 it still owes the interest. The only way to pay this is to get the Fed to print more money which also collects interest. TLDR: there is more debt than there is money and it is literally impossible to pay off all the debt in the world. </p>

<p>This gives the Rothschilds control over every country with a central bank. At any time they want they can destroy a countries economy. So far politicians avoid this by doing whatever the Rothschilds want them to. </p>

<p>Countries that don&#39;t have a central bank or don&#39;t fall in line are dealt with. in 2000 their were 7 countries without a central bank: Afghanistan(dealt with), Iraq(dealt with), Sudan(dealt with), Libya(dealt with), Cuba, North Korea, Iran. 3 to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exceptionally concise and helpful. Thanks so much for taking the time to explain.</p>

<p>It begs the question: why did anyone go for this in the first place? Were the original founding fathers being enriched by the Rothschilds and thus complicit in establishing the system? Surely. If you watch the Money Masters documentary though, it quotes Jefferson, Adams, Lincoln, etc. as being expressly against central banking - at least in word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To understand the depth of the problem you’d have to start from the beginning from the Bank of Amsterdam, the origins of fractional-reserve banking. </p>

<p>Back in Amsterdam during the late 1500’s to early 1600’s, there were goldsmiths from whom people would buy gold and people would also store their gold at these workplaces, and in order to confirm that the gold was theirs, they were given paper receits, in turn these paper receits were worth the amount of the gold they had stored. The clever early bankers/goldsmiths soon figured out that they could create more paper receits than the amount of gold they had in storage and thus they could loan out great amounts of money which they didn’t have and charge interest on it which esentially created money out of thin air for them, and thus, fractional reserve banking was created. 
This led to other banks being created such as the Central Bank of England which rose after the English Civil War when Oliver Cromwell betrayed King Charles I and beheaded him but he had been funded in this civil war by international money lenders, one of them being Menasseh Ben Israel who had lended Cromwell the amount he needed to the british treasury which was £1,250,000 on certain conditions, one of these conditions being that Jews would be allowed to resettle in England again since 1290 (when Kind Edward I had expulsed them from England for coin clipping which was High Treason against the crown at that time) and thus Jews resettled in England again after 350 years and other condition was to sign the charter for the Central Bank of England, which was signed and created and operates to this day.
So in essence, Oliver Cromwell sold out the crown to foreign money lenders who occupied one of the key societal positions in his nation and pretty much ruled as they wished. Soon after, Amschel Mayer Rothschild, the father of the Rothschild dynasty, sent his sons around the world to do financial work as he had ordered, one of his sons, Nathan Mayer Rothschild, was sent to England to operate with the Central Bank.
From there on it is a long history of the banks intruding on wars and funding different wars here and there and creating drama and diversion around Europe because of their immense financial gains and power.</p>

<p>All of this happened because people were too stupid and occupied with war and conflict that they didn’t realize the person infront of them was robbing them the entire them, it is a shame but to clarify, I do by no means imply that <strong>all</strong> Jews are connected to this or support any anti-Jewish sentiment, I am merely speaking of the Historical facts and genesis of the Rothschild dynasty. </p>
