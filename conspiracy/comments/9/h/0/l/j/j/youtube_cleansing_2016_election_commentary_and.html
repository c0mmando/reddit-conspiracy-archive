       I've really noticed lately how the top results in most of my searches on Google and YouTube are dominated by  CNN, and other top Corporate Media sites. You have to dive deep to find anything that doesn't fit the narrative.

       If you Google any recent event or controversial statement every single time you will find Snopes as the top result, despite having only an Alexa rank in the 1800s. Even worse if you Google things like "who fact checks snopes", which results in three pages of Snopes articles before seeing a single other website.

       Google is manipulating the search results, just compare the results to Bing which is far more in line with website rankings and accuracy.

       Eh, I’m from Michigan and voted for Sanders. I still don’t get this conspiracy, because Bernie lost without superdelegates. He needed like 65% or so in CA to even tie it up, and he got nowhere close. He lost because a majority of CA democrats are closer to socially liberal republicans than most people think.
      </p>
      <p>
       The superdelegates make the numbers misleading, but the people voted for Clinton, for whatever reason.

       It is certainly not clear that Bernie Sanders would have won a majority of pledged delegates. But a major factor is, in my view, that most media almost completely refused to report about him before the first primaries (the blackout against Bernie Sanders). At that time, he had little name recognition, and that probably played a significant role. Then, the number of debates the DNC agreed to was unusually small (and one was at the time of a football game in Iowa). That seems to have been a deliberate strategy by the DNC and the Clinton Campaign (which effectively controlled the DNC).
       <br/>
       After Sanders had won some primaries, he could not be ignored, any more, by the media, of course, but the leaked e-mails still show that the DNC, in favor of the Clinton campaign used their influence. Towards the end, the strategy was to pretend quickly that it was already over (which it was, when superdelegates are taken into account, but pretending it was already over probably further hurt Sanders' chances of getting a majority of pledged delegates).

       There are reports about voter fraud in different states, but the evidence is not clear.

        But a major factor is, in my view, that most media almost completely refused to report about him before the first primaries (the blackout against Bernie Sanders). At that time, he had little name recognition, and that probably played a significant role.

       Eh, maybe it's my location, but I knew of him long before. Facebook just recently reminded me of a post where I said a year before the election something like "Man, if Bernie runs next year I might have to volunteer for once"

        Then, the number of debates the DNC agreed to was unusually small (and one was at the time of a football game in Iowa). That seems to have been a deliberate strategy by the DNC and the Clinton Campaign (which effectively controlled the DNC).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Actually, lets break that claim down.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in 2008 there were
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_debates_and_forums,_2008">
        21 Debates
       </a>
       , but with 8 candidates, and 9 debates after the field narrowed down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, in 2016 there were
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_debates_and_forums,_2016">
        10 Debates
       </a>
       , with only 4 candidates (one was canceled).
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, in 2016
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_presidential_debates_and_forums,_2016">
        The GOP had only 12 debates
       </a>
       , but with 17 candidates.
      </p>
      <p>
       So statistically, I wouldn't call that 'unusually small'.

       Again, my experience is different from my location, but Bernie was still getting promoted pretty regularly in Michigan. The image of Clinton coming here (In 'Beer City USA' at the time) and pouring herself a beer that was like 90% foam became a joke that was constantly posted, even on some of the local news stations.

      <p>
       To be fair, after Clinton won the entire south (which is a completely different discussion - why states that never go blue hold so much weight in picking the dem candidate), it
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       practically over. The only thing that could save Bernie's campaign was a landslide in CA. I stayed up all night watching that, and that loss not only killed any chance of him statistically winning, but was a major upset with how bad the margin was.

       I think the only relevant ones were potential fuckery at the caucuses, but in the end caucuses are inaccurate garbage anyway that we would be better completely getting rid of.

       So funny cause I read these chances. At work on election day, there were dice out(games), so I took one and told a coworker "Trump has a 33% chance. If its 1 or 2, he wins."

      <p>
       I rolled and it was 1. My coworker and I just exchanged ominous looks.

       I always assumed there must be sites out there archiving every Youtube video that ever existed (and things like that). I'm actually disturbed that there aren't. How will historians know how bad things really were if it is being cleansed from the record?
