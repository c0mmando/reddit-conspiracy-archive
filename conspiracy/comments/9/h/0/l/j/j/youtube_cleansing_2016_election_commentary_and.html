    <div class="md"><p>It is certainly not clear that Bernie Sanders would have won a majority of pledged delegates. But a major factor is, in my view, that most media almost completely refused to report about him before the first primaries (the blackout against Bernie Sanders). At that time, he had little name recognition, and that probably played a significant role. Then, the number of debates the DNC agreed to was unusually small (and one was at the time of a football game in Iowa). That seems to have been a deliberate strategy by the DNC and the Clinton Campaign (which effectively controlled the DNC).<br/>
After Sanders had won some primaries, he could not be ignored, any more, by the media, of course, but the leaked e-mails still show that the DNC, in favor of the Clinton campaign used their influence. Towards the end, the strategy was to pretend quickly that it was already over (which it was, when superdelegates are taken into account, but pretending it was already over probably further hurt Sanders&#39; chances of getting a majority of pledged delegates).<br/>
There are reports about voter fraud in different states, but the evidence is not clear.</p>

<p>Eh, maybe it&#39;s my location, but I knew of him long before. Facebook just recently reminded me of a post where I said a year before the election something like &quot;Man, if Bernie runs next year I might have to volunteer for once&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually, lets break that claim down. </p>

<p>So in 2008 there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_debates_and_forums,_2008">21 Debates</a>, but with 8 candidates, and 9 debates after the field narrowed down.  </p>

<p>Then, in 2016 there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_debates_and_forums,_2016">10 Debates</a>, with only 4 candidates (one was canceled).</p>

<p>At the same time, in 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_presidential_debates_and_forums,_2016">The GOP had only 12 debates</a>, but with 17 candidates. </p>

<p>So statistically, I wouldn&#39;t call that &#39;unusually small&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After Sanders had won some primaries, he could not be ignored, any more, by the media, of course, but the leaked e-mails still show that the DNC,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, my experience is different from my location, but Bernie was still getting promoted pretty regularly in Michigan. The image of Clinton coming here (In &#39;Beer City USA&#39; at the time) and pouring herself a beer that was like 90% foam became a joke that was constantly posted, even on some of the local news stations. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Towards the end, the strategy was to pretend quickly that it was already over (which it was, when superdelegates are taken into account, but pretending it was already over probably further hurt Sanders&#39; chances of getting a majority of pledged delegates).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be fair, after Clinton won the entire south (which is a completely different discussion - why states that never go blue hold so much weight in picking the dem candidate), it <em>was</em> practically over. The only thing that could save Bernie&#39;s campaign was a landslide in CA. I stayed up all night watching that, and that loss not only killed any chance of him statistically winning, but was a major upset with how bad the margin was. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are reports about voter fraud in different states, but the evidence is not clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the only relevant ones were potential fuckery at the caucuses, but in the end caucuses are inaccurate garbage anyway that we would be better completely getting rid of. </p>
