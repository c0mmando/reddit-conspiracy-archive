       First Up: Carter Page still isn't charged with anything by The Mueller Squad. Also:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ‘Carter Page Is a Very Unlikely GOP Hero’
President Trump and House Republicans are declassifying documents to allege the campaign aide was spied on by Hillary Clinton partisans, but the FBI had been investigating Page’s ties to Russian intelligence for years.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So he could have easily been sought out and sent to Trump to justify FISA spying. More here:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Second: Stefan Halper is a Spy as well:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        James B. Comey, whom Mr. Trump fired as FBI director in May 2017, tweeted a defense of using a human source. Mr. Halper’s role was approved under Mr. Comey’s watch.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr. Halper is a longtime Republican-connected scholar who has performed classified work for the U.S. intelligence community and is tied to Britain’s spy service, MI6, through former director Richard Dearlove. They are partners in the intelligence consultancy Cambridge Security Initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr. Halper, who opposed Mr. Trump’s election and endorsed Mrs. Clinton, targeted at least two Trump volunteers: Carter Page and George Papadopoulos.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Third: Feds send their own spy (Henry Greenberg) "Russian" to Entrap Roger Stone by offering to sell him Hillary's Emails, which Roger Stone admitted being contacted, but denied the Spy
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Still, Caputo is not worried that he may have perjured himself before Congress—he believes Greenberg was acting as an FBI informant when he approached the campaign, and that the bureau should have to answer for its use of human sources during the election. Hours after the Post story broke, Caputo’s spokeswoman sent out a press release touting his exposure of “another FBI informant.”
       </p>
       <p>
        ” Greenberg, who appears to have assisted the FBI between 2008-2012, was charged in Los Angeles in 1994 with assault with a deadly weapon, according to records obtained by the Post.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Fourth: Trump Juniors Meeting with the Russian Lawyer was Entrapment

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Russian lawyer who penetrated Donald Trump’s inner circle was initially cleared into the United States by the Justice Department under “extraordinary circumstances” before she embarked on a lobbying campaign last year that ensnared the president’s eldest son, members of Congress, journalists and State Department officials, according to court and Justice Department documents and interviews.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The meeting with the Russian Lawyer, doesnt break any laws:

       </a>
      </p>

       Most importantly, Why Hasn't Mueller contacted Russian Lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya?

       </p>
       <p>
        Bruce Ohr's wife, the Russophile former CIA employee Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS and actually helped compile the now infamous Steele dossier.

      <p>
       This is all proof that Trump's Camp was actively getting Entrapped By DeepState/FBI sent spies, agents, Russian connections, and on and on. Strzok also leaked to the Media to create a Narrative in order to justify FISA:

       The left really need to come clean on this one. It's OK to hate Trump, but any real liberal should be horrified by this scandal.

       That's pretty broad. I would say that liberals think anyone supporting Donald Trump is absolutely a moron. Then again, those people are by definition not conservative financially and are socially regressive. One liberal's opinion.

       It sounds like he surrounded himself by criminals or people who acted criminal, based on the indictments and warrant for surveillance, but no one spied on Donald Trump.

       I don't think anyone thought they'd need any help to keep him from office. Surely it was a shock to everyone otherwise the msm wouldn't have been saying HRC would win.

       In theory, I agree. That said, it can't be a handful of pages from the whole lengthy document. FISA is a bitch. I'm sure there's good and bad being done. Shouldn't they release the whole FISA warrant if they're releasing any of it?

       "The Guardian has learned that the FBI applied for a warrant from the foreign intelligence surveillance (FISA) court over the summer in order to monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials. The FISA court turned down the application, asking FBI counter-intelligence investigators to narrow its focus. According to one report, the FBI was finally granted a warrant in October, but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation."
      </p>
      <p>
       The didn't want Trump's name on the warrant, that would look bad. So they just went after people on his campaign. Either way, you're able to look for dirt. Guess what? It's been two years and we have flavorless nothing burgers.

       Must have missed all the felonies his team has been pleading guilty to. Literally, his campaign manager who Gingrich said helped the team immensely. From what I can tell, it's a pretty giant burger and they're eating it in incremental bites from the outside in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also says that they turned down the application. So, the deep state isn't as deep as previously thought? The FBI says they had irregular contacts with Russia and we've found an incredible amount of contacts with Russia. Which part of this is supposed to give me pause for their reasoning?
      </p>
      <p>
       Says the warrant wasn't confirmed nor whether a full investigation took place. Am I reading this all correctly? Because, it seems to offer some non-verified information and your post also says the court clearly has parameters that weren't met in the initial submission and were later met.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't sound like "a nothing burger". It sounds like they initially said they knew people were doing something suspicious, but at least some of it was inference and the court wanted more evidence. They then took the one with more substantial evidence of unusual conduct and got a warrant.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes perfect sense to me. Am I missing or mistating something?

       Have you been paying an iota of attention? Trump's dealings with Russia go way back to when he couldn't get loans from US banks. He has likely been laundering money through real estate for decades. They absolutely interfered in the election. It's a matter or how and who was involved. Doesn't mean collusion, but a lot of fuckery and clearly not on the up and up

       What is your interpretation of interfering in elections? That statement makes it seem like they hacked the voting booth, but as far as I know they only bought some ads on facebook and used bots to spread disinformation, which seems mild compared to what the US does to other nations.

       What are you talking about spied on Trump? That is not based in fact. Releasing impartial documents to cherry pick the parts that stand up your insane conspiracy theories does not qualify as the whole truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has been a shady piece of shit for decades, all well documented - in same cases fucking recorded, and you all laud him as some clean as a whistle brilliant king maker. He's really good at taking something of value, stripping that, and walking away without penalty. Otherwise, criminal who wants to be king and now that they are looking into his past he is trying anything he can to squirm away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I don't think they hacked voting machines, but they did hack both the rnc and dnc and only one side's emails have been leaked. That's interesting information, imo. They also attacked senators and Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you comparing what another company does to us in an election to what we've done in the past? Tbh, it's your fucking country and you shouldn't want any interference - regardless of the beneficiary. Sure, it's hypocritical, but also we can prevent and punish it here AND stop interfering elsewhere.

       Dude, have you even read one thing on the news in the last ~two years?! There was literally a FISA warrant which allowed the FBI to spy on the Trump campaign. Look up “FISA warrant” on google and you can fave a litany of evidence. There have been multiple convictions which all stemmed from this warrant. It isn’t secret at all.

       They actually aren’t different things. The FISA warrant named Carter Page and that allowed the FBI the ability to gather intel on anyone connected with him. This is all common knowledge to anyone familiar with the situation.

       The warrant gave the FBI the ability to gather intel on literally anyone who Carter Page talked to, and was something like 2-3 degrees removed. Do you really think that once Page left the Trump campaign that he was completely cut off from all communication with anyone on the Trump team? Please tell me that’s not your argument. All it would take is literally one phone call from anyone on Trump’s team to Page and the FBI would have access to the entire Trump team. That’s how the secret warrant worked. We can argue the meaning of the word “spied” or the difference between “spying” and “surveillance” but you can’t really argue that the FBI was gathering information on Trump and his team. There’s a 2 year investigation on going as we speak that centers around said information. Petiole think Trump will go to jail at the end of it. I don’t see how you can argue this.

        Have you been paying an iota of attention? Trump's dealings with Russia go way back to when he couldn't get loans from US banks.

      <p>
       Trump has dealings, investments, and cooperation with Businessmen all over the world, it's what International Real Estate investors do. One of the Russian Oligarchs who helped Trump do a Paegent in Russia and talk about a Trump tower there, also is invested with Robert De Niro in restaurants, and invested with other famous people all over the world in various investments.
      </p>
      <p>
       None if this was ever a problem for anyone anywhere until the Deep State Entrapment started, and none of it was ever illegal, or else De Niro would not be allowed as well, and still isn't illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can literally, as an American, travel to Russia, find a business partner there or investor, and operate an international business legally as well as run for office legally

       As long as the debts are tied to the business and whoever is running it, debts are being paid on time, and nothing illegal is being done, then I am not worried, ESPECIALLY now that everything is under a microscope

       Like I said, he's under a microscope, so I'm not worried. What worries me 10,000 more than Russia is that we are slaves of Zionist Geopolitics and the Saudi owned Petro-Dollar. Israel + Saudi Arabia has much more control over us than Russia can only dream of having. In fact, I'm banned from T_D for bringing up these truths there

       We've not seen any of his taxes. Many of his property sales are to Russians or shell companies. I would not be concerned if we knew anything about the financials. Trump's business is also private, so they don't release their financials. Basically, you and I agree but you're also just taking him at his word while I'm asking for any shred of evidence. Lots of bad looks on his behalf and disclosing his financials would eliminate a lot of his woes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the latter part, I don't know the best answer there. Perhaps we should invest in renewable energy very heavily and ween ourselves off of oil. That, however, is not the current Republican strategy. Democrats aren't great at it either.

       Renewables will take a long time to reach a point where we can get away from the Saudis. Still, then we have the Zionist occupation issue, and you don't get away from that by producing more oil. That's a massive problem and why we have endless invasions and destabilization in the Middle East, as well as the Fiat/Federal reserve issue. We are getting destabilized financially via this monetary system which endlessly causes inflation while wages stagnate causing a self destruction of the middle class and America as a whole

Of course he has buildings with his name on it, but assets vs liabilities are unknown and I can't look at his taxes or his companies balance sheet.

       I mean whether he's worth 100 million or a few billion, doesn't matter to me. I am happy with some of the moves Trump is doing, tariff renegotiations, steel plants opened back up in the U.S. , N.K. meetings, economy and my 401k and stock investments doing great.

      <p>
       But I'm not happy about key people in his cabinet, Zionists, the witch hunt, NeoCons, Session recusing, connections to elitists and so on, I say this as an independent who voted for Obama.

      <p>
       Im getting 10k there is nothing illegal done in his businesses because it's not worth the risk vs reward at the level he's at. That has nothing to do with taking him for his word, it's just me betting on using logic, having my own business, personally running for a pretty big political position in my city, having people fund me for said position, and having worked for others with their own businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just from these things alone, it's literally not worth doing anything illegal anymore like it used to be, just because these days everything ends up coming out one way or another

       On another note, I'm more concerned about big tech and leftist Censorship of conservatives as the biggest current issue facing us in the U.S. even though I myself am not necessarily a conservative, besides financially and spiritually. Article 13 passed in Europe outlawing Memes and there is a massive global push to censorship, this is something all sides should units on to fight against and I think it's a good reason to have unity on at least one topic

       Common practice in real estate, and as a half black half white guy, I also stay away from Black neighborhoods and learned as a child from the black side of my family that it's a goal to get out the hood.

       Yeah this is my whole issue with it. I don’t think it’s necessarily the collusion narrative that was proposed at the beginning of all of this, but I think there has been dealings all the way back to whenever that Miss Universe pageant was in Moscow or before. So many illegal things go on in our government it’s hard to know what they’ll go after and prosecute and what they won’t. Hillary obviously broke some classified information laws, and there are lower level military that are in jail for waaaay less, but it’s just forgotten because she is who she is. Mind blowing.

       Yeah, I agree that there are things overlooked for those in power. The Bush admin is a huge example, as I'm sure many feel the Obama admin is. The private servers during Bush didn't seem to matter, nor the deletion of many more emails. If we're holding people accountable, which I agree we should, we should hold both sides to equal accountability. That said, it should all be based in provable fact.
