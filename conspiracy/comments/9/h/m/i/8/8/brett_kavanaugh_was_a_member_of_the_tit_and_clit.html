Please explain. I think Kavanaugh should be discounted for multiple reasons besides this. The Republicans acting like this is some urgent thing is beyond laughable to me. As Merrick Garland sat there for around a year and Republicans refused to even bring him up for a vote. Shits fucked and I&#39;m sick of Republicans fake whining.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure do. I misspoke about Harvard it was actually Yale. I apologise. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition to DKE, Kavanaugh also belonged to Truth and Courage, one of Yale’s secret societies for seniors. Among some students, the all-male club, which was popular with athletes, was known by the nickname “Tit and Clit.”</p>

<p>Truth and Courage fizzled out of existence in the early 2010s. But since Kavanaugh’s graduation in 1987, DKE’s reputation for mistreating women at Yale has only grown. Yale banned DKE from campus for five years in 2011 after videos circulated of fraternity recruits chanting “no means yes, yes means anal” in front of the University’s Women’s Center.</p>

<p>The accuser has no credibility. She&#39;s doing it for the money and noteriety.  She allegedly was held down and kissed, but was able to get away lol.  She&#39;s such a damn liar, it&#39;s so apparent when she won&#39;t even testify under oath.</p>

<p>Well she has a PhD which is equavslent or higher than a JD, so to say no credibility is odd as she is more highly educated. I&#39;m also confused by your last part, where does the lulz come from? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That never happened. The social issues of the conservatives are largely the same today as they&#39;ve always been. Trump hasn&#39;t changed any of that. If anything, HE moved more conservative to pander to the voter base. </p>

<p>The Democrats are led and voted for by people who have no hangups about sex pretending to care that they do. </p>

<p>Really? The POTUS is a liar, adulterer, sexual creep and cheater who fucks pornstars while his wife is pregnant and then pays them hush money and you are claiming that this is what Republicans always found acceptable?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, there&#39;s still a big group out there, there&#39;s always been some shady and murky shit about the Polanski incident. It was clear since the girl put a book out (where she admits he went for anal was because she <em>lied</em> about being a virgin and wanting to save that for marriage) he was meant to be a fall guy to draw attention away from the <em>rest</em> of the party. (Potentially why the plea deal was suddenly thrown out) Sadly, it worked, and all the cops that could have shed light on the case or exposed others are long gone.</p>

<p>They also successfully cut from the public&#39;s eyes how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/02/charles-manson-linda-kasabian-polanski">Charlie Manson&#39;s crimes</a> were a catalyst for dude&#39;s behaviour, and that the whole thing was a mistake in the first place.</p>

<p>Also: <a href="https://deadline.com/2017/06/samantha-geimer-roman-polanski-victim-defends-director-hearing-1202109259/">she&#39;s been his most long term</a> <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/roman-polanski-victim-samantha-geimer-academy-expulsion-ugly-and-cruel">and strident defender</a> and <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/209543/samantha-geimer-reveals-exchanging-emails-with-rom.html">been penpals since she learned to use a computer.</a> Absolutely <em>nothing</em> is clear cut in that whole bizarre line of events. That entire area in LA is a cesspool. Gonna need a backhoe for all those skeletons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What Men do as HS Students is disgusting, as are the things Women do in HS. For Girls, if they have been sexually abused early in life, they may take the alcohol/drug path which causes poor decisions sexually. For Boys, i don&#39;t know other than they were not taught to respect Girls thus Women in life, drink and we all know Alcohold makes you stupid. We know what goes on in Frat houses/ both sexes responsible for their behavior. So to go back to HS for this is assinine to me. It is so hypocritical ALL the Men on News, Politics are forcing this when i would be my last dollar they DID THE SAME EXACT THING!!!!  Women included! Was or is it right? OF COURSE NOT. People need to learn to respect themselves and ea other to keep from doing these things.</p>
