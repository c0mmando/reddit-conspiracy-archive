       So my question is to people in this sub that will string up anyone they don't agree with as a pedophile, rapist, etc. Why should we just brush this off? Please explain. I think Kavanaugh should be discounted for multiple reasons besides this. The Republicans acting like this is some urgent thing is beyond laughable to me. As Merrick Garland sat there for around a year and Republicans refused to even bring him up for a vote. Shits fucked and I'm sick of Republicans fake whining.

       How about him? He's not in the middle of a confirmation process to be SCOTUS.

       How about Brett Kavanaugh? Dems have lost all credibility with me and I don't even want to get started on pink hat wearing, far left activist, college professors. These people have lost so much credibility with me that, to save time, I have to consider if the

       Sounds like a shitty guy, but none of those things are illegal or really punishable even if proven true. I’m a firm believer in a no victim (person or property) no crime justice system.

       Sure do. I misspoke about Harvard it was actually Yale. I apologise.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In addition to DKE, Kavanaugh also belonged to Truth and Courage, one of Yale’s secret societies for seniors. Among some students, the all-male club, which was popular with athletes, was known by the nickname “Tit and Clit.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Truth and Courage fizzled out of existence in the early 2010s. But since Kavanaugh’s graduation in 1987, DKE’s reputation for mistreating women at Yale has only grown. Yale banned DKE from campus for five years in 2011 after videos circulated of fraternity recruits chanting “no means yes, yes means anal” in front of the University’s Women’s Center.

       The accuser has no credibility. She's doing it for the money and noteriety.  She allegedly was held down and kissed, but was able to get away lol.  She's such a damn liar, it's so apparent when she won't even testify under oath.

       I had no agenda whatsoever in this and hardly have a shit about it, until I found out she works for a big pharma company who manufacturers an abortion drug. That's when I really started caring and making noise about it. When I heard Tucker Carlson and Rush Limbaugh say it was always about abortion, I didn't believe them. Now after this has come out it all makes sense.

       Well she has a PhD which is equavslent or higher than a JD, so to say no credibility is odd as she is more highly educated. I'm also confused by your last part, where does the lulz come from?

       If they actually came up with claims that were falsifiable, then I'd actually respect the attempt. They release all brakes, not realising that what they are doing can be done to them as well. And as these claims are not falsifiable, there's no way to take this to court but there's also no way to defend against it.

       I don't think it should be brushed of, neither do I think ANY person should be condemned without representation or justice. As much as I support the idea sexual assault needs to be challenged, without nuance and basic justice, it's nothing more than a kangaroo court, which is turning the issue into a parody of itself.

       What point? That a mans infidelities in the past aren't as relevant as a government plot to overturn an election?

       You said the GOP was the party of sexual deviancy but failed to provide any examples of their supporting sexual deviancy in terms of policy or agendas.

       Also lmao, Weinstein has been charged and is going to trial. Polanski can't return to the states. People tolerate Allen but they're turning on him. What do Republicans do with alleged pedophiles? Oh yeah, they run them for Senate.

       Eh, there's still a big group out there, there's always been some shady and murky shit about the Polanski incident. It was clear since the girl put a book out (where she admits he went for anal was because she
       <em>
        lied
       </em>
       about being a virgin and wanting to save that for marriage) he was meant to be a fall guy to draw attention away from the
       <em>
        rest
       </em>
       of the party. (Potentially why the plea deal was suddenly thrown out) Sadly, it worked, and all the cops that could have shed light on the case or exposed others are long gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also successfully cut from the public's eyes how

        Charlie Manson's crimes

       were a catalyst for dude's behaviour, and that the whole thing was a mistake in the first place.

       What Men do as HS Students is disgusting, as are the things Women do in HS. For Girls, if they have been sexually abused early in life, they may take the alcohol/drug path which causes poor decisions sexually. For Boys, i don't know other than they were not taught to respect Girls thus Women in life, drink and we all know Alcohold makes you stupid. We know what goes on in Frat houses/ both sexes responsible for their behavior. So to go back to HS for this is assinine to me. It is so hypocritical ALL the Men on News, Politics are forcing this when i would be my last dollar they DID THE SAME EXACT THING!!!!  Women included! Was or is it right? OF COURSE NOT. People need to learn to respect themselves and ea other to keep from doing these things.
