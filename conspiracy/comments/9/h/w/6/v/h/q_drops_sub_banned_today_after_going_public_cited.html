        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For those that werent aware Q_Drops was a invite only sub that surfaced after all the Q subs were shut down weeks ago. Today they went public and not even an hour or less later it was banned for &quot;harrassment&quot;. This is truly silly. </p>

<p>I was there the whole time none stop and there was 0 harrassment and a mod post specifically outlined this and was stickied on the front page. This is blatant censorship as was the desperate banning of greatawakening and other subs (even swamp watch and others) and at this point is equivalent to trying to drown out or stop discussion. Any calls of violence or threats were always removed by mods. The fact TMOR has never been banned for brigading, DOXXing, or manipulating votes, and Q truth seeking subs get sniped for &quot;harrassment&quot; really shows how shitty Reddit is and how controlled and comped the admins are. Reddit is a fucking controlled manipulated shit show and it is so easy to see it. </p>

<p>This is a joke at this point and shows desperation and coordination against Q. Just a few days ago Q hosted a Q/A and confirmed that ET&#39;s are real and are the highest classification. Also confirmed the moon landings did happen. (I&#39;ve heard they saw ET&#39;s around the rim and thus had to film a mock moon landing as the real footage would have shown ET observers) Besides these points, FISA points to corruption and treason and we are only getting started in that regard (51,000 sealed indictments now) I mean when is enough enough. Its funny how desperate and spooked the deep state illuminati cabal is and how they are using all means possible to censor and stop this from coming to the surface. The Great Awakening long prophesized and dreamed about in this sub and other truth seeking forums is finally coming to life and we have so many people threatened and fearful of it. It&#39;s not going to stop and only going to hurt more and more for those who choose to remain unconscious and ignorant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No he didn’t. Omg. If you are even a smidgen aware of global politics, you’d have seen this one coming from miles away. </p>

<p>That’s the thing with Q followers—y’all stretch the truth to fit your agenda. What about the fact that Q(Pamphlet at the time) said that Hillary and McCain would be in Cuba by the end of last year?  You remember the “war” in DC last December that Q talked about one night?  That never happened. There’s some many things that anyone can point to and say that he was wrong....but the Q group is too smart for that. Q openly said he’d lie to you. And everyone kept worshipping this guy. </p>

<p>This is the third iteration of Q. Follow that breadcrumb. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Discounting Q is definitely not the conclusion I was suggesting. He has gone as far as hinting at Merkel being Hitler&#39;s daughter but tows the establishment line on 9/11 it seems and geoengineering. It shows that this is a military operation with set parameters of disclosure... 9/11 disclosure does not appear to be in the cards. Also given that we have arguably become the worlds greatest oil producer and the obvious economic benefits that has it is not likely there will be any public oversight on the Geoengineering programs. It doesnt appear that a transition away from carbon based fuel sources is in the near future so the ops must continue for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My bad. For sure there are area&#39;s off limits. Not sure why as he has gone out there in general (e.g. Merkel - perhaps a message to her if true?) but I guess too far is too far. The geoengineering thing is for sure a big one. I noticed right after Trump won how chemtrails dropped off a cliff. I have seen them for years, thick where I am, and it was pretty much guaranteed to be daily. Why the change? I mean, clearly they didn&#39;t 100% stop. Look into Trump&#39;s family&#39;s past, in particular his uncle, who was responsible for going through Tesla&#39;s documents after his death in order to see if there was anything usable at the time.

<p>Q isn&#39;t a threat. The followers are. The Q subs frequently had comment sections full of posts wishing for violence against elected officials. They wouldn&#39;t even call McCain by name after he passed, although they maintain he was actually executed for treason. Q followers tend to be those already prone to radical, insular belief structures and those are easily radicalized.</p>

<p>What&#39;s bothersome to me is that Q is obviously counter propaganda to the ongoing Russian scandal. The Russian scandal has much more interesting information and evidence to discuss if this were an actual conspiracy sub. Instead the sub is swamped with Q nonsense and whacky supernatural/religious stuff. It&#39;s the same demographic spamming both and it&#39;s a demographic that&#39;s easily misled, tribalized, and radicalized. The fun conspiracy to discuss would be who is most likely to be behind something that has radicalized a non-negligible chunk of the US&#39; permanent underclass and how does that figure in to the aggressive response by Reddit admin</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really?</p>

<p>Q is making up who is doing the trafficking?</p>

<p>Someone claiming to commit acts of violence in the name of Qanon or anything else, need to be investigated fully and evidence to back those claims have not been produced.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just wondering why Laura Silsby was arrested at the Haiti/Dominican Republic and bailed out by Bill Clinton?</p>

<p><a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf</a></p>

<p>Why was Huma Abadein forwarding Hillary emails about Laura Silsby&#39;s organization dating back to 2001?</p>

<p>CNN reported that she had attempted to traffic children out of Haiti before.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/jyO1k">http://archive.is/jyO1k</a></p>

<p>In an email written by Hillary on February 9th, 2010, she discussed with Counselor Cheryl Mills and other attorneys to exam the U.S. Government’s “options” concerning the arrested Americans. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/Clinton_Email_August_Release/C05769780.pdf">https://www.wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/Clinton_Email_August_Release/C05769780.pdf</a></p>

<p>The New York Times stated on February 11th, Jorge Puello, Silsby’s original lawyer, was believed to be leading an international human trafficking ring which involved women and minors. The Harvard Human Rights Journal reported that he was eventually arrested concerning the ring. </p>

<p> The investigation was run by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). Due to Puello’s trafficking network in Central Americans and Haitians, he was wanted in the United States, El Salvador, and Costa Rica.</p>

<p>So then you combine that with some of John Podesta&#39;s emails:</p>

<p>From:<a href="mailto:Luzzatto@aol.com">Luzzatto@aol.com</a> To: <a href="mailto:podesta@ici.org">podesta@ici.org</a>, <a href="mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com">john.podesta@gmail.com</a>  Date: 2009-12-20 16:06 Subject: Fwd: Dupuytren’s Advance Info for John Podesta</p>

<p>Hoping this gets to you from my close friend and fellow-hand-sufferer, Patrick Schmidt. We had a Luzzattopalooza yesterday, with Marisa-Paul-10 month Evie staying with us already while their house gets painted, and Ben-Alex sledding their 3 over to “help” us decorate the tree. When the parents got back to retrieve children, they threw in the towel (and about 19 pieces of winter clothing) to stay for tortellini and an overnight. So, 6 grownups with 2 toddlers and 2 infants spread throughout the house, and sure enough one of those toddlers was rubbing my nose at 5:45……….</p>

<p>Then Tamera Luzzato telling John Podesta</p>

<p>&quot;We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be &gt; Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and &gt; almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in &gt; that pool for sure.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/54545">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/54545</a></p>

<p>Then you realize Luzzato had a website up, (now deleted) that stated:</p>

<p>&quot;Evelyn  is growing up, soon she will be the Queen of the entire US of A, right  now, for a limited time only, you can spend some time with her online, raw and uncut. Take advantage of this now, as in the future she will have the power of life and death over you.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/JGhR6#selection-245.1-245.32">http://archive.is/JGhR6#selection-245.1-245.32</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s an interesting way to describe your step grandchildren. </p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>There have been decades’ worth of documentaries and scattered reports about pedophilia and ritual abuse in elite circles. Corey Feldman, Elijah Wood, et. al discussing it in Hollywood, the “Boy’s Town“allegations in Nebraska outlined in the documentary Conspiracy of Silence, a Jerry Sandusky victim claiming Sandusky was only part of a much larger pedophile ring, rampant human trafficking an sex slavery in Saudi Arabia, a major US ally, through embassies and diplomatic centers in the US, a cover-up acknowledged in the mainstream media regarding pedophilia in the British Parliament, allegations Jimmy Savile was part of a larger Satanic child sex ring involving people in positions of power.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/hubT6i30WDE">https://youtu.be/hubT6i30WDE</a></p>

<p>Then you realize that NXIVM is directly tied to the Clinton&#39;s:</p>

<p>“On March 14 and April 13, records show, more than a dozen contributions poured into Clinton’s coffers from NXIVM, an executive and group-awareness training organization led by Brooklyn-born Keith Raniere, 47. Most were from first-time political donors, each giving the $2,300 maximum. Three of the March and April Clinton pledges came from Raniere’s most high-profile followers: Seagram heiresses Clare and Sara Bronfman, and Pamela Cafritz, daughter of D.C. A-listers Buffy and Bill Cafritz. Hillary isn’t the only Clinton NXIVM officials are attracted to. At least three of them – group President Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters – are members of Bill’s charitable organization, the Clinton Global Initiative. Membership is by invitation only and requires at least a $15,000 donation per person for one year.”  </p>

<p>Below is a member list from the Clinton Global Initiative from 2007.  </p>

<p>You will the recognize names, and it should chill you to the bone. </p>

<p>One name stands out:  Clare Bronfman. Clare was also a part of the NXIVM organization, and she financed the Raniere cult.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/35046616/081-Clinton-s-Global-Initiative-2007-Members-include-ARK-Paul-Bernstein">https://www.scribd.com/document/35046616/081-Clinton-s-Global-Initiative-2007-Members-include-ARK-Paul-Bernstein</a></p>

<p>The Bronfman sisters play a huge role in this story, as they both were associated with Raniere and NXIVM.</p>

<p> Further, this is where I want to bring in Libya, as the Bronfmans are involved in Libya, and do not forget who said, “We came, we saw, he died.”  Hillary Clinton will forever live in my mind with those words ringing loudly in my head. She wanted Libya, and she got Libya. Now sex slavery is rampant there, as war brings homeless children, and homeless children are prey for the sex/slave industry.</p>

<p>However, she plays a much larger role in Libya, as her husband is a new and rising leader there.  This is a huge and shocking story. Remember her sister, Clare sat on the board of the Clinton Global Initiative, and they were both members of the NXIVM organization.  In fact, they financed this organization or cult being the billionaire heirs to the Seagram fortune.</p>

<p>Then you realize that the entire Paul Manafort indictment is related to his time spent working with the Podesta group in Ukraine.</p>

<p>And you then DuckDuckGo: Tony Podesta art collection</p>

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tony+podesta+art+collection&amp;amp;atb=v123-5__&amp;amp;t=cros&amp;amp;ia=web">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tony+podesta+art+collection&amp;amp;atb=v123-5__&amp;amp;t=cros&amp;amp;ia=web</a></p>

<p>And you realize Tony Podesta resigned and they closed down their firm, one that generated $24 million the previous year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/10/podesta-group-last-days-244799">https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/10/podesta-group-last-days-244799</a></p>

<p>So you then start to put all these things together and it all just seems a little too coincidental.
Also McCabe is facing a Grand Jury:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/grand-jury-investigates-andrew-mccabe-2018-9">https://www.businessinsider.com/grand-jury-investigates-andrew-mccabe-2018-9</a></p>

<p>Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told President Donald Trump last week that he isn’t a target of any part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation or the probe into his longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, according to several people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-19/rosenstein-said-to-tell-trump-he-s-not-target-in-mueller-probe">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-19/rosenstein-said-to-tell-trump-he-s-not-target-in-mueller-probe</a></p>

<p>Then Rudy Guiliani stated that Cohen has tapes with hundreds of journalists:</p>

<p><a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/07/29/giuliani-president-trump-has-recordings-of-dozens-of-journalists-discussing-him-with-michael-cohen/comment-page-1/">https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/07/29/giuliani-president-trump-has-recordings-of-dozens-of-journalists-discussing-him-with-michael-cohen/comment-page-1/</a></p>

<p>And the media has seen an unredacted version of the FISA since March 2017.</p>

<p>I hope you understand what that means.</p>

<p>Beyond all that, we now learn through the senators’ memo, and some follow-up reporting, that two longtime Clinton cronies, Cody Shearer and Sidney Blumenthal, fed their own anti-Trump dossier to Steele, through a State Department official, Jonathan Winer. In the fall of 2016, Steele, while working on his Clinton-funded project, reported this Clinton-crony information to the FBI.</p>

<p>Clinton&#39;s own political hitman gave info to Steele to put in the dossier. Hahahaha wow.</p>

<p>Before you call me a raving lunatic, a person on the verge of commiting violence at any moment in order to strike back at the Deep State, expand your thinking.</p>

<p>Do your own research and make up your own mind.</p>

<p>I have 3 kids. </p>

<p>They are not entertaining to old people. </p>

<p>My parents can&#39;t watch all 3 kids for more than a couple hours, because they are not entertaining, they are work.</p>

<p>Around a pool? Are you frickin kidding me man? </p>

<p>You and the others that have responded to me defending this evidence as nothing to see, why are you doing that?</p>

<p>What is your motivation?</p>

<p>What if these children were being abused?</p>

<p>You just don&#39;t give a shit?</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with taking about this and asking for an investigation. </p>

<p>Brett Kavanaugh&#39;s accuser can call for a FBI investigation after 30 years and zero evidence, no crime scene, no emails, no crime reported? </p>

<p>But this, this is definitely nothing guys. Especially considering Hillary&#39;s ties to Bronfman and NXIVM, Laura Silsby in Haiti, the massive fraud that was Haiti. Nothing to see here. Kids as entertainment. Pathetic you are. </p>

<p>Complex explication... Look at pizzagate.

What happens if all the conspiracy talk about the deep government motivated some individual to take a shot at Nancy Pelosi or Dick Cheney whomever the current suspected grand wizard is. The news headlines will be Q conspiracy theorists ok the website reddit just like info wars got painted with the pizza gate conspiracy.

<p>When you bring up the fact that Q is wrong about a lot of things, and Q supporters tell you to &quot;wait and see&quot;, doesn&#39;t that sound like they&#39;re advocating blind acceptance? When all of the available evidence is that McCain, who was 81 years old, died of a brain tumor, but some anonymous source on 8chan INSISTS that he was taken out by a secret military tribunal while failing to actually provide evidence, does that really sound like promoting free thinking?</p>

<p>If I hold any belief and a large amount of baby boomers and/or Christians start agreeing with me, I re-evaluate that belief</p>

<p>As someone who grew up subjected to the Boomer cultural canon I agree this isn&#39;t the worst heuristic. ;)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got more sympathies with Christians now than I used to, though, because it seems to me that the old cliche of people wanting something to believe in is actually true and there are worse things than Christianity. Communism acts a lot like a religion, is gaining traction very quickly in the West, and, in full bloom, can get pretty hairy.</p>

<p>Boomers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t only grow up in an echo chamber. The entirety of their education, culture, and experience was cold war propaganda. As a generalization, they&#39;re completely incapable of critical objective reasoning. Anything they flock to in numbers is guaranteed to be a scam. Also, they weren&#39;t merely asleep at the wheel socially. They were and remain the largest impediment to any sensible social progress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Christians</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sympathetic towards Christians but also wary. They hold a very easily falsified belief system and defend it aggressively. Like boomers, anything that they flock to in numbers and compartmentalize their faith into is very likely a scam.</p>

<p>There&#39;s that cold war propaganda. The kids walking around calling themselves communists these days are typically just democratic socialists at worst. We&#39;ll never see communism in the west.</p>

<p>You underestimate communism. It&#39;s been popular in academia for a long time. Anecdotal, of course, I had a friend say, just the other day, that she&#39;s starting to think communism&#39;s the answer. Seeing Maoist techniques becoming prevalent even in mainstream culture is a warning sign. Yuri Bezmenov&#39;s lectures on communist subversion in general are worth a watch.</p>

<p>This is what I mean by communism being pragmatic. The end goal of communism is authoritarianism. What the authoritarianism looks like it immaterial. Neo-communists like SJWs absolutely fit the goal of sowing divisiion.</p>

<p>One of the things I&#39;ve always found odd about Trump is how little dirt has hit the mainstream about him, despite the press&#39;s antipathy. He&#39;s obviously a pervert and sociopath and you can&#39;t really do the kind of business he&#39;s done without some criminal connections.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m just putting Trump in a historical context, something to compare Trump&#39;s divisiveness with. Obama&#39;s divisiveness was much more subtle though, I&#39;ll give him that. ;)</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve got any links for this I&#39;d be interested in checking them out. It&#39;s definitely possible and fits in Dugin&#39;s polarization strategy. Have you heard of the book &quot;The Perestroika Deception&quot;?</p>

<p>Quite a bit came out about his shady business deals and Russian loans. There were numerous headlines about it. His supporters either didn&#39;t care or had it all filtered through Fox News.

<p>Below is one article. I doubt BLM was entirely astroturfed from the get go, but it was certainly latched onto and signal boosted. The whackiest antics of BLM seem to have been useful idiots unwittingly dancing to the KGB&#39;s tune. Straight out of Dugin. I dig your repertoire, bud.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very weird that those haven&#39;t been leaked. Trump I think is protected by (or a tool of) military intelligence so if he&#39;s compromised then military intelligence may too be compromised.</p>

<p>Ah right... I remember that stuff coming out. I think Russia also organized some rally with Michael Moore too. Sticking your hand in everywhere is, at the least, a good gaslighting strategy. In general, the Democrats association with that whole SJW realm seems bad strategy, but I guess the SJW/BLM association is seen as increasing their appeal to youths/blacks.</p>

<p>I have read it, and I fail to see where you believe it provides immunity to websites for hosting discussions of criminal activity.  I routinely saw posts on GA to the effect of <em>&quot;if arrests don&#39;t start happening soon, it&#39;s time for us to take matters into our own hands&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;we have all the guns, they are sitting ducks in their cities</em>&quot;.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is the response you want to hear, but I would argue that r/antifa and r/militants should be taken down, as well.

<p>I reported several GA posts threatening violence to the Reddit admins, I don&#39;t remember reporting any to the mods... because let&#39;s face it, the mods loved that kind of talk, just like the rest of the sub.</p>

<p>Again... I&#39;ll say it one final time:  If Reddit doesn&#39;t want to be associated with calls for execution of political enemies (GA), or calls for destruction of property (Antifa), or calls for physical violence against the President (Militant), it is 100% their right to give those groups the boot.</p>

<p>Q didn&#39;t exist when that incident happened. You can&#39;t rationally blame it on Q.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Should Democrats be banned from social media?</p>

<p>Q, like Bernie, has never advocated anything other than normie political participation. You&#39;re employing guilt-by-association, a fallacy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Theres more but im not going thru all. But they exhibit all the signs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are misrepresenting the things you claim it checks off.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>&quot;The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader&quot; is, in full, &quot;The group displays excessively zealous <strong>and</strong> unquestioning commitment to its leader and (whether he is alive or dead) <strong>regards his belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as law</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Questioning dissent are discouraged or even punished&quot; is the only valid one.</p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd to claim Q is a cult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Q is a LARP or not is irrelevant. At this point it’s safe to say that if he is a larp, he’s pretty goddamn knowledgeable about the subject matter at hand. He’s amassed a massive following of people (you’re kidding yourself if you think his reach is anywhere less than millions) and he’s telling them to look in places that “they” really don’t want you checking out. There’s a narrative being built and a movie to be played, and Q points out the plot holes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q seems to have an excellent understanding of the surveillance scandal involving the trump campaign, and has consistently been ahead of the curve with that topic. Between that, his accurate predictions (Flynn, SA, NK) and the timing between his posts and trumps tweets and misspellings, I throughly believe there’s more to this story than just a LARP. He’s been very consistent in his topics of conversation, and events seem to be following his “narrative” for lack of a better word very closely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? Tippy Top? If you did real research you’d know Trump has used that phrase before. Every major thing he’s talked about has turned out to be nothing. Nunes memo? Bullshit. IG Report? The day before it dropped he said it was a fake so that when it inevitably turned out to not be the earth shattering event he said it was, just like the nunes memo, month of March, April, and other predictions, he wouldn’t be questioned. But wait there’s more!</p>

<p>When Trump nixed the FISA memo he immediately started damage control. If Q was a high level insider he would’ve known Trump was gonna nix it. Especially since Trump said he nixed it for now “upon counsel from the DOJ”.</p>

<p>The guy is a fraud. And that’s without getting into his more insane stuff like missile launches and Hillary Clinton being arrested, or the supposed torture tape that was supposed to be released... but it’s been almost a year, where is it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with you, here’s my take on it. Pasted from other thread.</p>

<p>This is a psy-op that is playing the horse/carrot trick on the conspiracy/truthers/autists/trump supporters etc. They are dragging the “cause you’d be in jail” on and on and on. “The Happening” is always “just around the corner”, instead of actually paying attention to what is going on politically, they are drawn to small clues that Trump is putting out, but none of the actual important happenings have come to be, none! </p>

<p>I will admit that I find/found it quite interesting, it’s like a thriller, suspenseful, clues are given, research is required. It’s fun, and again, very interesting maybe even plausible. I definitely don’t think the subs should have been banned, that’s ridiculous. </p>

<p>The other thing that really threw me off with Q was the fact that they regurgitated the Mainstream 9/11 narrative. </p>

<p>I’ll keep an open mind, but if none of “the happenings” have happened by early next year, I’ll be 100% convinced it’s nothing but a trick.</p>

<p>With that said, Q, same as the Trump movement got a lot of people questioning things and talking about things that otherwise would have been reserved for the conspiracy forums. So wether or not either of them are legit, maybe the worm is out of the can or whatever and this sparked a mass awakening, it will be interesting to see at what point people either realize they were duped or just fall back in line again, or maybe “the happening” is just around the corner?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has nothing to do with Q per se. It has everything to do with &quot;your either with the left ChiCom Socialists, or your against them&quot;. So you either vote Democrat or your an enemy of the Left.</p>

<p>As for Q, the trail has already been established and its not a military operation with &quot;Q&quot; clearance. Its a small group of Americans who have provoked thought and research. Q proofs are not 100% proof of anything. They&#39;ve been doxxed. Your best bet is to view it as a pro American research project for truth. Inspect what you inspect, its your best bet. Research yourself and stop trusting others. Its a skillset we all desperately need to navigate the current state of affairs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read a bunch of them, they are all open-ended, vague, nonsense. Q is about as believable as John Edwards cold reading, or any other fortune teller/astrologer. There&#39;s a simple psychological trick that has been commonly associated with the circus showman P.T. Barnum, often called the &quot;Barnum,&quot; or &quot;Forer,&quot; effect, where a person makes a statement to a large crowd that somehow seems personal or relatable to individuals within the group because of how they interpret the statement. Q believers have simply been decieved by this exploit in human psychology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump gives a lot of subtle references that he actually is Q.</p>

<p>Q is the 17th letter of the alphabet... last night Q posts a picture in Las Vegas on 8chan 17 seconds before Trump tweets (he was in Las Vegas for a rally)</p>

<p>Trump also invited a radio show host who analyzes Q to the white house. Why the fuck would he do that?</p>

<p>Q posted a few pics from AF1. </p>

<p>People asked Q, in April, when we would have a MOAB. Q responded, &#39;red carpet event&#39; and clarified it as the Emmy awards. Then, whaddya know, trump ordered FISA to be declassified on the night of the emmy awards, the 17th day of September.</p>

<p>R/conspiracy has been overrun with shills. People that talk about Q here have no idea wtf they are talking about and they juggle back and forth between it being a &#39;psyop&#39; or a &#39;LARP&#39;</p>

<p>As someone who has followed Qs posts since the beginning, it is not a LARP. Trump is involved. The purpose of Q is to wake people up to the illegal things done by previous admin and FISC.</p>

Evidently the twitter user was aware of the connections between the harassment and the subreddit, as he <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180817220150/https://www.reddit.com/r/greatawakening/comments/96uvmw/leave_me_alone/">went there directly</a> to ask them to stop, only to get his post removed. All the little details are expanded upon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/985l9y/huge_effortpost_ive_documented_the/">here</a>, although as the sub has been deleted so I&#39;d recommend using it in conjunction with the Wayback Machine (neither removeddit nor ceddit work on deleted subs).</p>

<p>The admins&#39; reasons for doing anything is ultimately just for good pr. If they were serious about getting rid of rule breaking subs, reddit would be a whole different place right now. It&#39;s easier to prove a connection between a deleted sub and a new sub if the new one was created within a week after the old one, than it would be if it was a month or two later. This way, the admins can say &quot;eh, we tried&quot; and focus on more important matters, like making us all go blind via the redesign.</p>

<p>And what about posting Q topics here? Is the Q topic off limits? Crazy stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I&#39;ll bite. Why are they protecting TMOR/tolerating t_d? t_d was just as guilty of spamming that racist Serena comic as MDE or ChadRight, yet when the co-founder&#39;s banwave targeted those subs, t_d was left untouched. Who do you think kept it alive?</p>

<p>I could see &quot;targeting individual users&quot; as targeted harassment, but that&#39;s more of an issue with meta subs in general. TMOR, SRD, drama, SPS, SSS, SRS, etc would be banned under that rule, so it&#39;s clear that&#39;s not the admins&#39; interpretation of it. But doxxing? The only &quot;example&quot; I can find is a claim that they doxxed the CBTS mods, but the only information used was stuff publicly given in an interview.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes me wonder why The_Donald hasn&#39;t been banned yet. Everything related to that sub has been taken down. But the admins let T_D stand. I have a theory. </p>

<p>I believe someone is using it as controlled opposition. Now many people on T_D are real conservatives or libertarians. I&#39;ll admit I post on there all the time as I share a lot of views with some of the posts. But a lot of times I see comments that suggest actions that would hurt us politically and socially with a ton of upvotes. </p>

<p>Now bare with me, I&#39;m just speculating here. I saw an investigation from a far left sub that found numerous Russian websites and owners that are involved with T_D. The Reddit staff deleted the post (allegedly) and still let T_D stand. I&#39;m sure if you look into left leaning subs there will be Russian involvement as well. Not to mention Chinese on BOTH sides.</p>

<p>The American people, left or right, are being played, and played well. They are driving a wedge between the country over the internet, and both sides seem to be missing it because they are so obsessed with catching the other team slippin&#39;. This is the new age of warfare I think. It&#39;s so complex it keeps me up at night. </p>

<p>I promise you I&#39;m trying to be bipartisan. I&#39;m tired of hating fellow Americans. We need to compromise, something the elite/deep state fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The censorship is pretty shoot in the foot stupid. </p>

<p>the so called 51K inditements are BS until they are uncovered. There is no reason something that large needs concealment from the public. Just fucking come out with it already otherwise it&#39;s just pulling everyone&#39;s chain. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had enough of the secrecy, after Q said July would be &quot;no more secrets&quot; and it&#39;s still &quot;trust the plan&quot; bullshit while sheepdogging Likud talking points and herding people to the corrupt as fuck Republicans. for a so called non partisan entity Q certainly is acting like a partisan hack. </p>

<p>Regardless no one or sub should be censored because you don&#39;t agree with them. </p>

This was a joke from the start posting on a Japanese image board to teenagers. I&#39;m lmfao at the concept honestly. Next it became a LARP for teenies and eventually the Boomers, and now a 100% Psyop from foreign actors to fucking enrage psychotic people to further destabilize the country, and you&#39;ve been had and are actively contributing to the demise of the United States. I hope that makes you feel real fucking good, commie.</p>

<p>First read this, but replace references to god with Q... <a href="http://applygodsword.com/signs-of-a-cult-leader/">http://applygodsword.com/signs-of-a-cult-leader/</a></p>

<p>Then read this: <a href="https://www.cultwatch.com/howcultswork.html">https://www.cultwatch.com/howcultswork.html</a> </p>

<p>Seriously, don&#39;t just throw it to the side because it doesn&#39;t fit your narrative. Q followers are opened minded to all information right? If you wont read these then you aren&#39;t actually open minded.</p>

<p>Atleast you admit it.</p>

<p>Let me guess Q is exposing corruption and treason of crooked Hillary and the Democrats right? Nothing Trump or the GOP has verifiably done right? </p>

<p>You act like you&#39;re some enlightened individual on secret information but you are nothing but a Sheep, and its gonna fucking hurt your head when you find out that Trump wasn&#39;t actually working to take down anything but his own presidency because hes such a complete bumbling incompetent idiot.</p>

<p>When you get older you&#39;ll understand these things better, but for now, no one can prove you are wrong and you actually listen. You&#39;ll have to find that out on your own. Good luck, you&#39;ll need it!</p>

<p>Complex explication... Look at pizzagate. A crazy conspirty theory involving a pizza shop and a pedophile ring motivated a guy to enter the establishment with a gun and shoot the place up to protect children. Now apply this to Q.. What happens if all the conspiracy talk about the deep government motivated some individual to take a shot at Nancy Pelosi or Dick Cheney whomever the current suspected grand wizard is. The news headlines will be Q conspiracy theorists ok the website reddit just like info wars got painted with the pizza gate conspiracy. Look how well things are turning out for Alex Jones after that. </p>

<p>Q didn&#39;t exist when that incident happened. You can&#39;t rationally blame it on Q.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Frisco I do blame the Democrats movement for inspiring it.</p>

<p>Should Democrats be banned from social media?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But even if you don&#39;t you can&#39;t deny that the q nonsense ditectly i spired people to arm themselves and take action</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Q, like Bernie, has never advocated anything other than normie political participation. You&#39;re employing guilt-by-association, a fallacy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Theres more but im not going thru all. But they exhibit all the signs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are misrepresenting the things you claim it checks off.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>&quot;The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader&quot; is, in full, &quot;The group displays excessively zealous <strong>and</strong> unquestioning commitment to its leader and (whether he is alive or dead) <strong>regards his belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as law</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Questioning dissent are discouraged or even punished&quot; is the only valid one.</p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd to claim Q is a cult.</p>
