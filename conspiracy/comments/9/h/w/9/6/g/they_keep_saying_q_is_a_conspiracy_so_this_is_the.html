    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re misunderstanding. People have made mistakes with timezones leading to some false &quot;proofs&quot; early on, that is for sure. But that is an archive site, not a screenshot that can be edited. You can follow the link back to the original 8ch post if you want. Then it&#39;s just a matter of checking timezone settings. On <a href="https://qmap.pub">https://qmap.pub</a>, I have confirmed that it displays my local timezone correctly by watching new posts come in real time. Doing the timezone conversion to local time in Arizona, it works out to exactly one calendar month between the post and his official time of death. </p>

<p>Now look at John McCain&#39;s official time of death, 4:28 PM <strong>local time</strong>. Adjusting for timezones, this is precisely 1 month to the minute after Q1706. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;Qanon&quot; or whatever isn&#39;t a &quot;conspiracy&quot;. It&#39;s a LARP.</p>

<p>Since it was obvious that anyone who would support Donald Trump would fall for any bullshit imaginable, a 1990s Italian novel about the Reformation provided the guideline for this psy-op. And dumb shit Republicans and cartoon frog children from 4chan fell for the ruse hook, line and sinker. The &quot;Q&quot; LARP is both hilarious and sad. Some people are really stupid it seems and will double-down on their stupidity no matter how obvious the con-game.</p>

<p>After all, people have to be fairly ignorant to support Trump in the first place. Q was an easy game it seems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He sure does throw in a lot of unnecessary 17&#39;s. Q told us a long time ago that was a signal. The rally on July 31st was particularly strange. Q signs everywhere and Trump used that number repeatedly when any number would have worked just fine to illustrate his point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, he has neither confirmed nor denied Q, officially, anyway. Unofficially, the silence speaks volumes. He even posed for a picture in the oval office with a &quot;top&quot; streamer who exclusively covers Q stuff now. If you watch him at the rallies where there were Q and WWG1WGA signs everywhere, it&#39;s almost like he is toying with it. He&#39;ll point directly to the signs one minute and repeat the number 17 the next. Very strange. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spicer has been out for a <em>long</em> time now.  </p>

<p>I realize it&#39;s possible that is just a coincidence, but coincidences can still be pretty amazing to witness. It&#39;s not like he was just posting about John McCain all day and happened to line one up. He posts about everything under the Sun and just <em>happens</em> to hit the right topic <strong>exactly</strong> one month before McCain returns to the headlines in a big way. It&#39;s also impressive that Q pointed this &quot;coincidence&quot; out so quickly after McCain&#39;s death. The thing about coincidences is they can pop up anywhere. It would be a full time job to comb through his past drops looking for coincidental connections to recent news.</p>

<p>Q is real, if you don&#39;t think HRC, BO and others haven&#39;t personally been in these forums YOU are crazy. They are all scared about what is coming, soon.</p>
