       Yeah but no matter where he is. The white house has interest to not have all of their private discussions broadcast to everyone. It's a huge security risk. I don't believe q because there is no way the federal government would allow that.

       I get you, and that is logical thinking. However, it is the base assumption of the Q fam that because the alphabet agencies screwed up FISA, at some point Military Intelligence was triggered against that domestic threat. The Q Intelligence Dissemination Program, thus born out of the NSA and INSCOM serves at the pleasure of the President.

       Q=Mil Intel, Mil Intel CinC=POTUS, POTUS=Q+.

       This is from early drops (I don't remember which, search some of those terms at qmap.pub). With these assumptions, check your conclusions. Now if you don't hold these assumptions, then you are right.

       You are right. The US Mil is more corrupt than most Q peeps want to believe. Perhaps less so than you think though. Given that Q is Mil Intel Psyop, you can imagine they are biased.

       Ok if q said 911 was an inside job and that we should not support foreign wars, I would believe in him. But q always speaks in the same tech babble you do and all of his messages seem to have the same underlying themes of support for the us abroad that make me think he is an agent for them and not for the people.

Q's patriotic, nationalistic, and exceptionalist bent is, again, due to q being thought up in INSCOM. I hear what you are saying. On the other hand, consider these repetitive messages from Q:
"You, the PEOPLE, have THE POWER.
You, the PEOPLE, just forgot how to PLAY.
TOGETHER you are STRONG.
APART you are weak.
THEY WANT YOU DIVIDED.
THEY WANT RACE WARS.
THEY WANT CLASS WARS.
THEY WANT RELIGIOUS WARS.
THEY WANT POLITICAL WARS."
"WE, THE PEOPLE!
WHERE WE GO ONE, WE GO ALL.
NO ONE PERSON IS ABOVE ANOTHER.
WE, THE PEOPLE, ARE MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.
STAND UP AND DEFEND WHAT YOU KNOW IS RIGHT.
GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA."
"There was a time when, WE, THE PEOPLE, decided our future.
There was a time when, WE, THE PEOPLE, had a voice."
"YOU, THE PEOPLE, HAVE THE POWER.
This movement challenges their ‘forced’ narrative. 
This movement challenges people to not simply trust what is being reported.
Research for yourself.
Think for yourself.
Trust yourself.
This movement is not about one person or a group of people."

       The type that makes the masses feel they have an advocate in the white house, butressed by Q's posts, when in fact hrc's best friend is now the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is easy to type out some populist rhetoric that resonates with people. If hrc said that crap you would know it was bs, But for some reason the  billionaire tan boy from Manhattan gets a pass. "Research" entails not falling for some crass attempt to appeal to emotion.

       First of all, I like your post history. Honestly. Thank you for contributing to the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue that the neocons and globalists are NOT getting what they want out of the US Mil in Syria. That the US Mil is not advocating globalist neocon war. That Wolfowitz and Kristol are not happy campers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honest questions. What were the targets of US v Syria airstrikes #2,3 under Trump. Just because they occurred on Syrian soil does not mean Assad necessarily minded them or even opposed them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Assadists by 2018 are a conglomerate of 100s of local warlords. Were they Iranian targets? Were they rogue CIA targets? Were they HTS targets? Could those three entities (among others) forge local temporary alliances and/or establish DS facilities together? Did US Mil deconflict with Russia AND Syria regarding strikes 2 and 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would give Trump the benefit of the doubt for Strike 1. The world is a messy place and he may have not consolidated power enough by April 2017 to resist striking Syria even if he had intel the Chem attack that month was FF.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know. But I know if Hil+Co won, it would not be only 3 precision strikes in Assadist territory by this point.

       I can't answer your question regarding what the targets were, but I can't help but think any us intervention in Syria will harm Assad's power base and advance the interests of Israel.

       Hrc's biggest backers were the Saudis and Trump continues to support them in the war in Yemen. Soros gave trump a $150 mil mezzanine loan with no interest to build his tower in Chicago. It's the same people with different names. Trump not even a conservative, his tax cut afds $10 trillion to the debt in 10 yrs. Q taking you for a ride bro.

       The Saudis donated to Clinton and us support for them in Yemen shows trump is on their team too.

       Soros is a web of misdirection. Just because he says he is against trump doesn't mean it's true. Billionaires don't give out free money to other billionaires. The fact Soros gave trump an interest free loan should concern everyone. It means he owes him a favor.

       Yes, you most likely are right. Q is a fraud and Drumpf is a corrupt billionaire. Hope for our constitutional Republic and humanity in general is lost. We may as well submit to the ZOG overlords, bicker amongst ourselves endlessly, or remain so superbly idealistic that, though we will not improve the human condition, our shit won't stink.

       Yea, I have indications CIA has revamped hiring and procedures. I think Pompeo may have sorted them out. Haspel is a character. We would cautiously apply the whitehat label despite involvment in the torture program.

       Hillary is in major legal jeapordy. Obama is a former POTUS. Doubtful the arrests will go that high. Strozk, Ohr, Comey, McCabe are goners.

       Not necessarily. Are you attributing claims by the broader movement to Q itself? Or are you finding fault with Q post 1&amp;2. A lot has happened since then. Much has come to pass. Future proves past. NO ONE else was talking about Peter Strozk in December '17. Don't make me pull out the proofs! :)

       Being a military intelligence op, it is quite natural to expect disinformation baked in. Disinfo is real. Disinfo is necessary. If you had WORLD CLASS sigint, would you not observe targets' reactions after Qpost 1&amp;2?

       Some of the program's many goals are:
1. Raise the geopolitical literacy of the citizenry 
2. Communicate in code to certain operators
3. Communicate openly to the enemy
4. Raise morale
5. Strengthen the administration's base
6. Destroy the MSM

       Can you hold multiple contradictory analyses in your mind simultaneously? Do you take everything literally? Read that map again, can you explain what you see. Are quantum computers being utilized?

       Q first used the term “Great Awakening” on the second day of posting, October 29th, 2017, and has used it many times since. On January 8th, 2018, Q first used the phrase, “Where we go one, we go all” (WWG1WGA). Q has used many other phrases, including “Truth belongs to the people”, “The choice to know will ultimately be yours”, “Expand your thinking”, “Dark to light”,  “You are not alone in this fight”, “Good will always defeat evil”, “Future proves past”, "Read the Bible. God Wins", “You are the calm before and during the storm”, and many others. These phrases signal – to the anons that decode, research, and spread the crumbs, and to the public as well – that we can help President Trump fight the Cabal by educating others about what it is that we are fighting. Q reminds anons and the public that this fight’s, “Scope and size [is the] biggest in history”, to “Trust the Plan”, and to “Stay the course.” The Plan to fight the Cabal was initiated by Patriots, and Patriots were, are, and will be helping the President execute it.
       <br/>
       The Great Awakening is not a conspiracy theory or a cult, as those who seek to discredit would like the public to think. It is a sophisticated and coordinated information operation from within President Trump’s administration to enlighten the public about the true state of affairs of the nation and the world, providing vast amounts of information well beyond the scope of this introduction. So vast in fact, that Q has stated, “These, the crumbs, in time, will equate to the biggest drops ever disclosed in our history.” Ultimately an informed public is a key component of Making America Great Again and Keeping America Great. The Declaration of Independence that led to the founding of the great Nation that is the United States of America states that, “Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government” and such is relevant today. We The American People acted in accordance with this ideal by electing President Trump to renew our government, and Q, through the Great Awakening, is enlightening We The People about what the enemies of the people have done, are doing, and will do to fight this historic change. The intensification of attacks against Q, the Great Awakening, We The People, Patriots, the President, and the United States of America is indicative of the ferocious level of resistance to the loss of power and control of those whose deeds and true objectives are being exposed. In order to mitigate the confusion in this time of chaos, Q has asked anons to help be the Calm Before and During The Storm. To this end, Q also asks anons and all those who have been preyed upon, to pray.
God bless the Nations of the World, and God bless a World of Nations.
God bless all Patriots, President Trump, and the United States of America.

       No. Q movement is instrumental in exposing FISA abuse -- it goes beyond the Russia investigation. When you abuse state secrets powers to surveil journalists, judges, laywers, and whistleblowers, etc. (the news today) civil society breaks down. Declass and arrest bad actors in CIA/FBI/DOJ/State etc. The Q movement has been the tip of the spear in demanding prosecutions for spies gone wild.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more...Q said Saudi Arabia &gt; North Korea &gt; Iran &gt; Israel (in that order). There is silent war. Please dig, pray, meme, vote, and when the time comes, get in the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will not get into what we have learned about the Cabal, NXIVM, NK, Red Cross, Vatican, Rothchilds, Payseurs, Crown etc. On the other side of the Q movement is literally a new era for humanity as corrupt power brokers WW enter the [killbox].

       Can't it be beyond politics? Can't we say in America we stand up against abuse of power no matter where it comes from? That's what we say. Why do you not say it. Honestly. I want to break the prism---if it is one side today it is another tomorrrow. Prosecute all sedition and treason appropriately. Constitutional rule requires more public awareness.

       Transnational elite families and organizations control the governments and financiers of the world by means of blackmail and bribery. They fund operations in a pyramid scheme/mafia structure and control most of the world trade of: drugs, weapons, intel, cash, people, organs. The anons have traced every mineral deposit's major stakeholders and investors back worldwide. For some unknown reason, truly wonderful and extremely intelligent individuals, autistic and not, have gathered/are gathering and crowdsourcing a much different dataset than the mainstream media and the narratives continue to diverge. Fisa will bring down the house of cards and begin the period of high-level arrests -- openly -- worldwide. Or it is all made up. But I have watched in realtime something amazing.

       I get that you are trying to spread the message that there are things going on behind the scenes that the public is not privy to. I used to think this whole Q thing was a bunch of wing nuts talking gibberish and calling each other names on 8chan. Welp..it is and it isn't. I can say, it definitely isn't what the media has made it out to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the conspiracy boloney, this is my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       My take is that this is a movement of people who found hope in the form of an anonymous poster who has Q clearance, which is reserved for military communications, (tell me if I'm wrong here). Months ago, info was posted by this Q person/persons and we were given a puzzle to solve and that gave us all a feeling we were part of something bigger. Something that would make us feel like we mattered in this day of the "little guy always getting the shaft". Q gave us information that was posted one day and became fact shortly thereafter. You get enough of those and you start to wonder; What is this Q thing all about?
      </p>
      <p>
       You start to consider the possibility we might be able to make a difference if we all stuck together.  We can research the info we get and find out what is actually happening in our world. Things are changing globally and I think we can all feel it. Clearly things aint pretty!
      </p>
      <p>
       What if we had a chance to be a positive force for change in this world rather than resolve to live in this crappy, out of control society with abuse of power at the top and abuse of each other at the bottom?
      </p>
      <p>
       We just want a better happier world with less bad guys running the show.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Thats maybe what I would start with.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So to be clear, I am not trying to rain on any parade. Me thinks the "map" might be too soon for some who still think we are wing nuts.... However... I will say you are a true patriot! That you for this post, #WWG1WGA!!

       First of all, I like your post history. Honestly. Thank you for contributing to the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue that the neocons and globalists are NOT getting what they want out of the US Mil in Syria. That the US Mil is not advocating globalist neocon war. That Wolfowitz and Kristol are not happy campers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honest questions. What were the targets of US v Syria airstrikes #2,3 under Trump. Just because they occurred on Syrian soil does not mean Assad necessarily minded them or even opposed them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Assadists by 2018 are a conglomerate of 100s of local warlords. Were they Iranian targets? Were they rogue CIA targets? Were they HTS targets? Could those three entities (among others) forge local temporary alliances and/or establish DS facilities together? Did US Mil deconflict with Russia AND Syria regarding strikes 2 and 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would give Trump the benefit of the doubt for Strike 1. The world is a messy place and he may have not consolidated power enough by April 2017 to resist striking Syria even if he had intel the Chem attack that month was FF.

       I do not know. But I know if Hil+Co won, it would not be only 3 precision strikes in Assadist territory by this point.
