<p>In 2007:</p>

<p>Former porn star Daniels claims Trump and Clinton spoke about her race for the Democratic presidential nomination against then-Sen. Barack Obama, and Trump “repeatedly” mentioned “our plan,” <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stormy-daniels-donald-trump-hillary-clinton_us_5ba0c6e1e4b013b0977ee937">Source</a></p>

<p>Given that we know that the <a href="https://observer.com/2016/10/wikileaks-reveals-dnc-elevated-trump-to-help-clinton/">DNC intentionally tried to elevate Trump during the primaries,</a> this could add credibility to the theory that Trump and Clinton were conspiring on a plan where Trump would run and intentionally lose.</p>

<p>Most news articles were just focused on the &quot;toadstool&quot; comment. Who gives a shit? 70 year old men have gross shlongs, that shouldn&#39;t be news to anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &#39;our&#39; in &#39;our plan&#39; isn&#39;t necessarily referring to himself and Clinton. He could have been speaking about himself and anyone else. It was not &quot;secret&quot; just because we don&#39;t know what it was about. Lastly, it&#39;s so vague that to speculate on its significance is a waste of time. I don&#39;t doubt for a second that the affair happened, but these little add on anecdotes really just seem PR-motivated. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it more likely that he was backing HRC in 2007..? It would be very odd for them to be discussing to go into effect eight years after where he&#39;d run and lose, especially if she was still a year of the democratic primaries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This entire thing was orchestrated guys. Obama, Hillary, Trump. Trump has been groomed for this for decades and his supporters have been unknowingly groomed to vote for him decades too. You think it&#39;s an accident he became the leader of the birther movement? That he checks off every single box of the Obama/Hillary hating conservative Christian who thinks they&#39;re the real oppressed ones? All dressed up in a pseduofake Reagan costume. They&#39;ve been conditioned for decades to be scared of some liberal coming in, taking all their guns, instituting socialism, rounding up all the Christians and murdering them,. So what has been the response? Buy as many guns as possible (guns sales ALWAYS go up when a Democrat is in office) and be irrationally against any perceived social benefits or &quot;attacks&quot; on Christianity even going so far as to declare there is a war on Christmas. Then comes Trump to the rescue. A man at 70 years old all of a sudden has these beliefs that he&#39;s claimed to believe the complete opposite before. They&#39;re willing to give him a pass for literally ANYTHING because &quot;it&#39;s better than that damn mooslum and that dyke Hillary&quot;. They are scared to death of not being the top of the social hierarchy anymore and being on the same level as black people or Mexicans. They have been worked up into such a frenzy about America being taken over by some sort of liberal dictator (like they thought Obama was) that they are supporting their own dictator and they are going to use all those guns to fight for him. This was ALL by design. The people who thought they were arming themselves to fight against a tyrannical government have been tricked into being the ones to fight FOR the tyrannical government. This shit is genius when you really think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for sure, i have a very similar gut feeling. thinking about what is gained w trump being president is easy when u know their is not real right and left. but they have everyone so strongly identifying with these illusionary sides, and viscerally hating one another that everybody is already on edge. and whenever that dies down trump says something, the media runs w it, and everybody is back to lashing out on EACH OTHER again.
this is divide and conquer and it&#39;s deeper and more chaotic then i&#39;ve ever been alive to witness.
they&#39;ve even gotten to a lot of the people that would never even consider buying into the political party bullshit. but now, those same people that knew GWB and the republicans were all terrible and inflicted terrible things onto us, are the same people screaming libcuck and brown nosing these assholes? it&#39;s insane to me. when did we ever believe in the red and blue bullshit?
either way, it&#39;s worked like a charm because people have eaten it whole, and a lot are ready to act for it. i just hope the people can figure out a way to come together to get rid of all of these con artists forever, because their game is playing w bigger stakes all the time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to be the doom and gloom guy but this ain&#39;t over by a long shit. We&#39;re in Biblical &quot;end times&quot; era stuff here. Trump is the little horn from the book of Daniel, he might even be the Antichrist who sets himself up in the 3rd temple and declares himself God. Everything is right on track for that to happen but I have a feeling he will get assassinated soon. They&#39;ve built the Q cult up long enough and Trump is right on the precipice of getting exposed for who he really is. In order to cause maximum chaos, you assassinate him before that info gets out so he can still maintain innocence in his supporters eyes and make it a &quot;made for tv&quot; spectacular like 9/11. His supporters go nuts claiming the deep state killed the last hope of America and undoubtedly martial law is enacted and someone takes permanent control of America and my guess is, takes out every single one of his supporters who are fighting back with their guns. Imagine what happens after all that chaos? People will be clamoring to give up their guns and demonize everything associated with Trump. Conservatism, Christianity, capitalism, white males. Trump made the worst aspects of that group show their ugly faces and they became their representation. Their head is going to be cut off and shown to the world as an example. Then with them out of the way, the socialist regime can finally be enacted like they&#39;ve always wanted. Cue the global finical crash and then we all go on a new Bitcoin one world currency on our way to entire bodily enslavement with the advent of 5G and electronic implants that connect us all to the &quot;internet of things&quot;</p>

<p>1776, 1864, 1945, the entire Cold War, Desert Storm, 9/11, now... And that&#39;s just American.</p>

<p>There&#39;s always been an enemy. The truth of the matter is that the average person just wants to live peacefully, but the people in power can&#39;t benefit from that. After every major war, there&#39;s been a period of growth. 1776 lead to exploring the country. 1864 lead to the rebuilding of the south. 1945 lead to the boomers and unions and the growth of the American middle class.</p>

<p>Now we&#39;re in a state of perpetual war, perpetual hate, and perpetual division of the people. The deficit is going up, personal income is going up while the purchasing power of that income is going down. The top needs to crumble, but since they&#39;re solidifying and consolidating power and wealth that&#39;s getting less and less likely without a &quot;dark ages&quot; style turn. Unfortunately, we&#39;re not at that turning point and, likely, won&#39;t be in your or my lifetimes. The upper middle class, who has the power to make change happen, is still happy with their stock returns and growing wealth, and the lower and lower middle class are too poor/powerless to do anything to change that. </p>

<p>This is not mere coincidence. The H symbol is a Jesuit sign and the hourglass is a masonic symbol (what does an hourglass have to do with leaking information?). Both representing the number 8. H is the 8th letter of the alphabet and the hourglass is shaped like an 8 or the infinity symbol. 8 is the number of new beginnings and it is showing up a lot lately.</p>

<p>He&#39;s literally talked about running for president since the early 80s, and been contributing to political campaigns for as long. He did in fact run for President in 2000 (but was clearly a publicity stunt). No one ever took him seriously, but you can find interviews from the 80s, 90s, and 2000&#39;s where he talks about a presidential run, and people ask him what he would do as president, so it&#39;s not like this was just something that came out of the blue the last election.</p>

<p>And while he says whatever the fuck he thinks will be the thing that is most self-serving, there&#39;s not doubt that he believes most of these super right wing conservative ideals. He was calling for the central park 5 to be executed when there was very little evidence against them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is not so far-fetched. There are many reports about Bill Clinton (who, as it seems, used to meet Donald Trump from time to time, they sometimes played golf together) calling Donald Trump for encouraging him to run for president.</p>

<h1>Bill Clinton &#39;casually encouraged&#39; Trump to run for president before 2016 race: book</h1>

<h2>Revealed: Bill Clinton DID encourage golfing pal Donald Trump to run  for president to &#39;roil Republicans&#39; - and DID speak to Loretta Lynch to  help clear Hillary on email scandal</h2>

<h1>Donald Trump talked politics with Bill Clinton weeks before launching 2016 bid</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bill-clinton-called-donald-trump-ahead-of-republicans-2016-launch/2015/08/05/e2b30bb8-3ae3-11e5-b3ac-8a79bc44e5e2_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.573b1555efc2">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bill-clinton-called-donald-trump-ahead-of-republicans-2016-launch/2015/08/05/e2b30bb8-3ae3-11e5-b3ac-8a79bc44e5e2_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.573b1555efc2</a></p>

<p>So, that would fit the idea that there had been such a plan already in 2008.</p>

<p>The main question is what follows from this. The pied piper strategy is known - it certainly makes the Clinton campaign and Democrats look bad, but it is not that astonishing. It is not incompatible with the idea that Clinton and Trump were real political opponents, the Clinton campaign just thought Trump would be a candidate who is particularly easy to win against. But if there was a common plan, could it be that in reality, Trump and Clinton were not real opponents, but two people who secretly worked together and were a part of a common plan of forces who just wanted that one of them wins?</p>

<p>Well no shit, she thought he&#39;d be easier than any other Republican. Their own internal memos explained as much.</p>
