        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yesterday morning I wake up to a email from google saying someone with an &quot; Unknown Device &quot; and gave me the IP address of 35.242.216.1 and when I ran a reverse IP it popped up with a location that is</p>

<p>&quot; NASA Ames Building T-20G
Mountain View, CA 94043 &quot;</p>

<p>Now a friend of mine suggested it could have been a spoof location by swiping the access of their internet to attempt the hack, I find it a little suspect why would they want to hack a GOV agency to hack me. </p>

<p>I assure you any one reading I am not that interesting. The email account they tried to breach illegally was one from almost a decade ago that from what I can tell in the archives was mainly used for Myspace. ( yeah remember that? )</p>

<p>Any way, If anyone cares or this thread picks up and people want proof I have the screen shots I can upload them if anyone finds this interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok this is fucking weird. </p>

<p>I got a call from a buddy yesterday because someone tried to hack into his Gmail. The IP is different but similar and 3 of the tracebacks lead to Moffett Field in Mountain View which is leased by Google <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mercurynews.com/2015/03/31/google-takes-over-aging-moffett-field-and-its-airship-hangars/amp/">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mercurynews.com/2015/03/31/google-takes-over-aging-moffett-field-and-its-airship-hangars/amp/</a>. The 4th location traced back to Ashburn Virginia to a zip code with no addresses. </p>

<p>The longitude and latitude that IP traces to is near a BBQ place in Ashburn. The IP shows up as being a Google ISP, so I searched the BBQ places address to see if Google Fiber is available in the area and it is not. Meaning there is no publicly available Google ISP in the area, and given the fact it’s listed with its own zip code I can only assume it’s like how some buildings in New York or even prisons have their own zip codes for a single building or facility.</p>

<p>Meaning there’s likely an unknown facility with its own zip code that has Google as an ISP as its provider thats potentially not publicly available. That computer system is then probing Gmail accounts to hack into them, and one of Google’s security systems is being triggered reporting Google and this Google ISP location as the source of the hack.</p>

<p>I port scanned the IP and the only thing open was SSH for remote access using some secure encryption. So this isn’t some random web app or server. It’s possible someone is just running this on Google Cloud but there’s no proxy, no VPN, and it’s traceable to a zip code that doesn’t exist and a BBQ place. Also I’m not sure why it would be tracing back to the Moffett Field data center. Most of Google Clouds facilities are located elsewhere.</p>

<p>My original guess was this was civilian, possibly corporate someone with ties to Google, maybe some kind of political operative. Now I don’t know. This could be deeper than that.</p>

<p>The fact I know this is now a coordinated attack is fascinating. My friend believes he’s being targeted for political reasons. I can’t disclose the situation but I can assure you he has reason to believe this and it is serious. </p>

<p>Anyone else who was targeted in this hack have any reason why they might be targeted?</p>

<p>Also if you know someone who has been targeted instruct them to turn on two step authentication to secure their accounts and prevent a second attempt on their accounts. Any IPs or other info you can provide would be useful. </p>

<p>I’m seriously interested in maybe writing about this publicly and seeing if we can figure out wtf is going on.</p>
