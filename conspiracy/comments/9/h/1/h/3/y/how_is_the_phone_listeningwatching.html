       I have an iPhone SE, I bought something at Walgreens tonight and it was on my Instagram ads. I don’t normally buy the item.
The other day I said I liked a child’s cup and it was on my Facebook ads. The obvious answer is get off social media first.
The phone is obviously listening. It isn’t a new concept. But the item I never buy, a cup I compliment, my husband’s searches popping up for my ads? I connected my husband’s searches easily, the other two made me more curious about how this really works.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the apps and services connecting to share this information specifically? So easily? Not that anything should be trusted but what is worse... Open Facebook app? Amazon, debit card? Bank apps? How do they know the specifics? What is the best you can do now to protect your privacy? Are any phones safer than others? How can we protect ourselves now that it’s already this far along? I understand the ability of technology more than the technicalities, any insight or direction is appreciated.

       Facebook is a primary culprit. But please understand that both main manufacturers of smart phones, Google and Apple are capturing user data. Think of everything you ever did on your phone goobled up and stored. Everything google'd, called, texted, gps'd, picture, all of it captured.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your usage and interactions help to create "map" of an individual. Selfies provide facial recognition data, its blatantly obvious. We are at the cusp of biometric capturing via smartphones, with the heavy adoption of fingerprint scanners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think of a giant spider web. You can think of the sinister side or pull down the wool, look at the bright side, and enjoy the convenience this system provides.

       Honestly, does this mean they have everything you’ve ever watched and visited? Porn etc, things you’ve been sent as a joke, every weird ass thing you’ve read, even if it was innocuous - maybe they could turn it around on you? Make you look like the bad guy?  I dunno, my mind speculates and it scares me, they have our fingerprints and everything

       Everything you have said, or input into your phone is accessible to outside entities. They all do it. It's terrible, and I don't think we will stop it. If you want to fool them, just put on loud porn, like I do. My neighbors hate it, but it's my only defense.

       post. Left this kind of response before. PSA basically In any case.

      <p>
       Even if you secure your phone completely. That is easy enough. Faraday cage, a multi player one, and if possible no battery inside. Still nothing you can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to feel just slightly better, keep the cameras covered when not in use. Reusable stickers are great for this. Added bonus maybe, your lens wont get scratched.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone around you is filling in your gap though. Their phones still watch and listen to you, and everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have heard of technologies that use wifi, are a part of wifi, to map a room in great detail. Revealing where all kinds of things are. Things not on camera, or in ear shot. Things that are behind walls that you could only see if you ripped the wall out. "X-ray vision," basically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind you there are all kinds of other sensors in phones. Heart rate monitor, temperature and humidity sensors, highly sensitive gyroscopes, magnetometer, etc. It's a lie detector too basically.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, not only are we constantly being recorded in every way possible. Essentially we are also being interrogated the entire time as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have lived in a grand prison for a long time. This is simply an elaboration on that process.
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice to you all is to be highly mindful of your thoughts, words, and actions. There are so many forces trying to force you to think, and act out certain ways. Enticing you away from thinking critically by keeping you out of rational states. They leverage all manner of physiological manipulation based off of human biology, that takes a great deal of effort to avoid.  Fear, sex, anger, love, etc. Any thing they can do to keep us from thinking, from questioning.

       Thank you for your response. We really do need to guard our heart, mind and soul- more than ever from the invasive. I understand our privacy has been threatened for a very long time. I agree it’s a prison. But I can’t understand, is it just people are unconcerned? Are that many unaware? Do we just not understand the gravity of this? We’re just powerless? I used to cover my camera sometimes. I’m just constantly lulled into the feeling that I’ve already done it for so long/they already know/everyone else does it. But I use the camera, I see these ads and I know that I feel totally sick about it when it’s nonstop and in my face. Is that just me? Our relationships are so screwed too. I know whatever technology they have is only escalating. Do you just try to enjoy? Maybe separate and really live as much as possible? I am glad I’m not someone who posts my schedule on Facebook or anything... but carrying the phone around without FB, is still just as bad at this point, right?

       People are both unconcerned and unaware. They are unconcerned because they think if they are doing wrong they have nothing to fear. Not the case, because everyone's freedom is being infringed and everyone's privacy has being infringed. The noose is slowly tightening around everyone's neck.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time most people are genuinely unaware of how deep this goes, and all the long term implications. In essence what's happening is that your personal life, information, no longer belongs to you, but to multiple various third parties. At any time, any information, can be used against you as blackmail. To stop you from doing something wrong sure, but also to coerce you into doing something wrong. For example, acting as a patsy for some greater nefarious entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to what we can do, it's limited to Faraday cages, pulling batteries, covering cameras. Which at best, is only half the battle. Avoid the web completely whenever, especially non-anonymous web traffic. Stay away from cameras, mics, and any kind of wifi. That's a loosing battle ultimately, unless you go and live in a cave or something extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mindfulness really is the most important part. Always ask you self, why you are having the thoughts you are having. The advertising is subtle and subliminal. Every aspect of the web, and media, is becoming hyper-personalized. To sell to you, sell you to others, and manipulate you. At this point we have to assume that every bit of information you see on a screen or hear, contains a hidden message to coerce our thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       FB, R, I, T, etc. are problems certainly, but they are not the main problem. It's more the people who are using the information gathered from those sources. Those are the groups with the power to really use that information.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a brave new world we live in.

       A weird thing happened today- my parents told me that earlier a man plowed down there mail box and the neighbors going the opposite way down the road. Turned out he had fallen asleep- so I told them that my daughter had called me this morning asking if she should call 911 because the car in front of her was swerving across the center line and the shoulder.  We (parents and I)talked about drunk vs distracted drivers when my 13 yr old said" they're listening" and held her phone up and it was and ad saying" buzzed driving is drunk driving"- weird..

       Go into your settings and look for app permissions, you might find some apps have weird permissions granted. Now dont get me wrong some might look malicious but aren't. But be careful some big apps like flashlight apps and simple shit like that are sometimes owned by shady groups from other countries.

       Did you pay with cash or a card? Did you use a store loyalty card? Have you been making internet searches for the product or something similar? Anyone in your house making those internet searches? Any one of those things is a data point that will be collected and sold to advertisers. You said you don’t normally buy the item, but if you have purchased it in the past then there will be a record of it. If it is something that will run out, like makeup or toothpaste or other items like that, they will try to advertise to you when you are close to running out based off your previous purchases and other people’s.

       My phone was dead at the store but I did use debit and loyalty card. Nobody was searching for it and I don’t normally purchase item (and haven’t there, or anywhere recently). A certain ice cream never purchased and a pregnancy test. There’s no going undetected, I guess.

       Any device that falls in the "voice based services" category is potentially listening. I've had specifically targeted ads show up, no phones or other computer activity. The only thing to be listening is the cable box, and yes, the remote has voice control as an option.
