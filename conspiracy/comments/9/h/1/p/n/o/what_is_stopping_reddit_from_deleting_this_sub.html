<p>This is a fair belief. It hasn&#39;t happened yet though, and by calling for their hangings, the subreddit was breaking the rules.</p>

<p>I mean it&#39;s pretty cut and dry, whether or not you or those on GA feel it was morally justified is completely irrelevant to that fact.</p>

<p>What WAS happening is people were excited for and wanting JUSTICE. Not just a good ol&#39; fashion lynching. That is the narrative push that I see now though. That the &quot;Q&quot; freaks were just wanting a lynchmob!   </p>

<p>Nope that is furthest from the truth. How do I know? I read the sub. I watched in disbelieve as time and time again the crumbs that were dropped (just like on r/conspiracy back in the day) and anon/autists assimilated the info, worked it, and brought up more evidence and questions to ask. You really should look at some of the latest Qdrops the avalanche has been building. The whole mountain top is starting to come down. FISA is just the beginning. It will bring down the house.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad someone here actually admits to not frequenting the GA sub.<br/>
Here is the run down and time line of the GA sub if you would like. It started as an offshoot of this one r/conspiracy. This Sub was overran by shills and bots and the likes during the 2016 election cycle. Those that frequented this sub, like myself, seen the darkness seep in. Also a lot was happening. PizzaGate (I think that was the beginning of the end for r/Con) FBI anon was on the scene giving a ton of info about how corrupt the FBI was and dealing with ignoring HRC&#39;s emails etc. Those topics were shot down.<br/>
Soon after Q came on the scene. At 1st it was interesting because some of the things they were talking about were directly related to FBI anon, but we didn&#39;t see that at the time. There was another board called calm before the storm or CBTS that a lot of people from GA and r/Con had gone to and was the growning platform for Q research related topics. Soon CBTS was banned and shut down. It wasn&#39;t open but for a few weeks. No reason. There were no violations nothing. *Poof*<br/>
Then everyone migrated back to GA. Things were good. Silent it was really all about &quot;The People&quot; us. The little guy. We talked openly, freely, and respectfully. Ideas were shared. Topics were open. Info was shared.<br/>
Then &quot;Q&quot; became a topic after a MAGA rally where the Q sign was front and center at the rally. Then the shills came in. The sub grew fast. Topics started getting modded like crazy people were banned for questioning simple things. Then Q calmed down and the mods got a hold of the shills and knocked them down.</p>

<p>Again things were quiet. Topics were modded very well. No Doxxing going on. No violence happened. It was very much the opposite of what you see any where else.   </p>

<p>Then we got close. The avalanche began to fall, and the FISA docs were going to be declassified. Everyone was excited. BOOM Banned! Then some lameass excuse was made and people, like yourself, latched onto that explanation as fact. I don&#39;t blame you for thinking that. If that is what everyone is saying then it must be true right?   </p>

<p>Nope. Furthest thing from it. It was a nice sub. I learned a lot there about Spirit, God, Truth, Justice, the Constitution, and law. I feel bad for users that did not have the opportunity to experience it. No Cult. Nothing bad. People talking to people not matter race creed status etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the rundown. Genuinely appreciate it. So GA was solid. why do you think it got looped in with all the other subs that got taken down? The FISA docs? Explain more about the FISA stuff. Assuming it’s Also Q related? What was “getting close”. I’m OOTL on the Q stuff as you probably can tell I don’t really buy in and actually thinks it’s a decent troll. However I’m open minded and curious so would love to know more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q was a tough one to stick with for sure. The early stuff was put out to prove when in the future things happened. However, when they say something in Dec that doesn&#39;t happen until July people get cranky and restless.<br/>
This FISA deal is huge. It is the 1st act that will open the eyes of millions around the world. It did me. When you look into it you find out it is everything this sub had talked about for years, and bigger! Corruption at the highest levels of our Govt. Not only that, but it is world wide. It shows how our Govt., aided by other foreign govts (Allies: UK and Aussies) subverted the Constitution and illegally spied on US citizens (4th amendment anyone?) But not only on US Citizens, but a presidential candidate for the opposing party. Say what you want about Trump, but he is our POTUS. The people voted him in office. I didn&#39;t vote for him. I couldn&#39;t stand him in Oct. of 2016. I knew HRC was pure evil though just from this sub and finding out about her background. But the Constitution is the law of the land and our Govt. went around it.<br/>
Then when all of this is declassed it will show how the DOJ, FBI, CIA, and even the executive branch covered it all up.<br/>
Think about it. She wasn&#39;t supposed to lose, and if she did they would frame Trump for &quot;Russian Collusion&quot; and impeach.<br/>
This is a high level overview. IF you want more just ask. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You typed a lot so I feel like I owe you a long response but all I&#39;m really interested in is when are these getting declassified? Like trust me I want to believe but I just need the evidence. </p>

<p>The other thing I keep reminding myself and others is that this whole process is still unfolding. Nixon&#39;s investigation took a really long time. I expect results from the Mueller investigation here soon before the midterms. Time and time again over the last 2-3 years I felt like shit just hit the fan but it just keeps going. I think time will tell. I just think its sad that congress for the most part and obviously the media have been completely wrapped up with the Russia investigation. Meanwhile not a whole is getting done.</p>

<p>I&#39;m excited for time to tell us a lot to be honest. Russia investigation, this whole FISA thing. Not sure when its getting dumped but that will certainly be interesting. Just curious when that&#39;s gonna be. So the whole banning of the subs was in anticipation of the FISA docs getting dumped so we can&#39;t discuss them? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FISA docs are set Trump has done his part for the declas. Now it&#39;s in the hands of the DOJ and FBI. Actually in the hands of Rod Rosenstein. 
He will stall as long as he can. Trump will fire him. Sessions will then be tapped to come in. When that happens things will unfold faster.
Here is the thing with the Deep State. It&#39;s like an onion you have to peel away the many layers, and it will make you cry the whole time doing so.
Mueller&#39;s investigation will never amount to anything. The media is controlled. You have seen documents here talking about Operation Mockingbird right? It&#39;s real. Think about if the US is doing it then other countries like our allies are doing it to right? (Think back to 9/11 when the BBC reported wtc7 fell 45 mins before it did)
Things are coming, but we have been trained that things happen instantly. They don&#39;t. </p>
