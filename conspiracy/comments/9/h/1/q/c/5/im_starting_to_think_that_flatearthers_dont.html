       The flat earth movement was started by the deep state/cabal to dumb down willing Americans unknowingly. Once the they get Americans believing in lies that they spread those people become irrelevant to society.

       what if we have been conditioned to believe the earth is round by the deep state cabal, like nasa an occult organization or disney, an occult organization. And the actual truth is out there and they have to make sure the truth doesn't spread.

       It takes believing the entire science community, government, religious organizations are covering up the truth. It takes believing something, without the why? It basically forces you to have an exestential crisis, which not many people can handle.

       Hard to fathom but curvature is not visable, there are no real pictures of the globe earth.

       I believe the ionosphere, what people can “bounce” radio waves off of, is the dome. Sun and moon are local. The flat earth society itself is a psyop, but the sentiment is not.

       If you look at the research with open eyes it’s a lot more believable than you can even imagine.

       Would you care to make sense of what we're told space is and how it all works with spherical planets then? Try researching both theories and then you can come debate, but obviously you are very ignorant on this subject.

       1st, it’s a means of controlling your reality. Their lies are shaping your understanding of the world, which should be very alarming. 
2nd it is potentially hiding certain areas. If there are additional land masses “past” Antarctica (which were supposedly discovered by admiral Byrd), the globe model 100% hides them. Instead of continuing outward, you just loop back around.

       No one can prove a negative, but you can definitely prove the Earth is round. Here are a number of ways to gather evidence:
      </p>
      <p>
       Sail from a port city with tall buildings, you'll notice that the bottoms of them begin to get progressively less visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversely, view a ship arriving into port and watch the mast appear over the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Launch a weather balloon with a camera, and observe the curvature directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Measure two shadows from an object of a known height that are a known distance apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumnavigate the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at a picture from the ISS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at a picture of the earth taken from the Moon.

       I get what he means, none of us are likely to do any of those things and see for ourselves, but we can listen to the "experts" and what they have to say about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we have a reason to disbelieve them? Not really, but we could have doubts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could they be dishonest and faking it? 100%, but the likelihood that they are is probably far from that number

       Prove it then. If we believe we are being lied to by NASA about space and what the world looks like, then any proof from them is moot. Basically we need evidence from people we can trust, regular people without agendas.

       Hahahahaaaa! Omg, ok, so you're still very ignorant to the scene, well ok then. NASA is given millions of our tax dollars to supposedly show us space, funny things happen when they don't really end up showing us shit for space! They can't even give us a true picture of the Earth. Just do researchers

       I'm familiar with the belief that NASA and its accomplishments are a hoax. I don't buy any of it for a second. But, that pales in comparison to the stupidity that is flat-earth believers. And again, you don't even have to know about space to prove the sphericity of the Earth.

       I gave several examples in another reply, only a couple rely on knowledge of outer space. Here are a few ways someone could gather evidence for a round Earth:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Sail from a port city with tall buildings, you'll notice that the bottoms of them begin to get progressively less visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Conversely, view a ship arriving into port and watch the mast appear over the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Launch a weather balloon with a camera, and observe the curvature directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Measure two shadows from an object of a known height that are a known distance apart. Then calculate the parallax.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Circumnavigate the earth.

       These have been tested again and again with with results leaning toward flat earth or inconclusive. There's a group of scientists who tested all of these in a long documentary and you should check out their findings and tell me what you think.

       Flat-earth believer here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to spot the trolls such as the Flat Earth Society with their 'members all across the globe' joke. They're just here to make FE-ers look stupid, so the majority of people won't bother in researching it for themselves. ("Haha! The world is flat? Haha! yeah I heard that. Some people are really crazy! Haha!")
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm interested in the truth, not to 'win an argument'. I've found that it's difficult to have a conversation (or debate if you will) on the topic, especially online. It often leads to insults and the advice to me to not reproduce. (Which is kinda ironic since I don't see any reason to put my children in this 'amazing' society.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect peoples opinions, ideas and theories about the shape of the earth, but I know when to move out of the 'debate' ("it's a fact, moron!") and let them be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have all the answers regarding the shape of the earth. It's a belief and if it turns out the world is a spinning globe, then I stand corrected. A lot of people are unable to grasp that, but again; it's not about 'winning' something to me, it's about the truth, and I want to know the truth.

       I have probably then bumped into the "wrong" kind of flat earthers, because my experience is just the opposite, conversations / debates lead to insults from the other party.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to start a conversation / debate, then I'd have one suggestion for a topic. I just recently started wondering why am I seeing geostationary satellites at some other altitude than 0deg in an equatorial scale. I live up North around 60N latitude. Realized it is because of my perspective from "up here" compared to say someone from the equator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now reading your comment I thought this is probably one way to calculate the distances to the satellites if we assume stars are really far away, a "stationary" backdrop. Or if we don't assume that, then at least can figure out the relative distances between us, geostat satellites, and the moon for example, and from multiple locations it should be then verifiable if the shape of the Earth must be flat or spherical in order for the numbers to hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my mind, three measurements at the same time towards a certain geostat satellite and the moon should give out a rough estimate of the shape. Two are probably explainable with many shapes.
      </p>
      <p>
       An easy example, if from my point of view the Moon looks to be above the line that geostat satellites make, and from a southern perspective it also looks to be above the satellites, then from that already we can come to some conclusion about their positioning relative to each three points. Then add a third observation and it should fit only one model.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not sure how north or south you need to be to be able to view the geostat satellites reflecting sunlight, so could be this is not that easy if they are not visible from anywhere but north &amp; south, but not for example at hmm say Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though, if they are not visible from there, that too would tell something about from where the sun must be shining from in order for the reflection to show.

       Great subject. I think this can be calculated for both models (globe and flat) since a lot of the calculations are going to be based on the following:
      </p>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <p>
       <em>
        The size of the moon and the distance from earth
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Globe model: the diameter of the moon is +/- 3500km and the distance between the earth and the moon is about 384000km.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat model: the diameter of the moon is +/- 50km and the distance between the earth and the moon is about 4800 km. (I have to admit that I'm not sure about these numbers. Personally I think it's less, but this is another subject to debate. For now I think you'll get the point I'm making that the size and distance is much less than with the globe model.)
      </p>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <p>
       <em>
        Perspective vs not able to see because of a globe model
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Globe model: Let's say the moon floats exactly above Egypt. Then it isn't visible from Greenland but it's still visible in Germany. It's also visible in Kenia but it isn't visible on the South Pole. What happens is that the moon appears biggest in Egypt, and appears smaller in Germany and Kenia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat model: The moon floats exactly above Egypt. Due to perspective and the
       <a href="https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2017/ledlightingc.jpg">
        vanishing point
       </a>
       , the moon is still visible in Germany and Kenia, but it isn't visible in Greenland and on the South Pole, because it's already past the vanishing point.
      </p>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <p>
       <em>
        If the satellite floats straight below the moon and above Egypt, then I think we have the same outcome:
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Globe model: The satellite is smaller and more difficult to see, however it has a light on it so we're able to see it
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       we're close enough. It might not be visible from Germany anymore but it's still visible in a country such as Italy. It also isn't visible in Kenia anymore but it's still visible in South Sudan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat model: Again the vanishing point. Because the satellite is lower, we're unable to see it from Germany and Kenia. It becomes visible again in Italy and South Sudan.
      </p>
      <p>
       For both models: If we have a very long ladder to climb up on, it becomes visible in Germany and Kenia again.
      </p>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <p>
       Does this make any sense? Or am I missing a part of your question? If that's the case, would it be possible for you to provide details of your question with the  description/model above? (Moon above Egypt, Germany, Kenia, etc.)

       I started drawing a picture for both the FE and globe models, but after starting with the globe and coming to a certain point, I started having difficulties understand how I should draw the same in a FE way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if you can help me understand that then we can dig into calculations. I feel we don't need to assume the sizes or distances to be able to figure out distances in relative terms. What I mean with that is that the Moon should be some % of the size of something else, or the distance from a satellite to the Moon should be some % of the distance between the viewers and the satellite. It would still reveal whether the ratios fit a FE model, globe model, or perhaps something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the drawing, which is obviously simple and could be explained without drawing, but thought it'd be helpful so we are speaking of the same things.
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/J6dZNGf.png">
        https://i.imgur.com/J6dZNGf.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       1, 2 and 3 are the viewers, a, b, c, d, e and f are stars, and the diamond in the middle is one satellite. The top left boxes are "views" that each of the viewers would see, though the third one would be upside down in reality, but easier to think this way. The middle one could be in any orientation, but again easier to keep them the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why I stopped there, instead of continuing with the drawing tangents to the surface and measuring angles of each of the dotted lines relative to that "surface" level at each point, was because I started thinking how should I draw especially the viewer num 2 in a FE model.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a FE drawing, I am guessing the orbit, or placement, of geosynchronous satellites (that stay stationary in FE I think) would be a dotted circle above the flat ground. But then, how would viewer num 2 ever see a geosynchronous satellite between him/her and the Moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would imagine that say if 1 represented 60N, 2 represented the equator and 3 60S, then their placement could be like this (keeping them on the same line as they are in the globe drawing, on the same longitude):
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Zl9RYEL.png">
        https://i.imgur.com/Zl9RYEL.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That is drawn directly from above, while the globe one is somewhere from the "side".
      </p>
      <p>
       Where would you place the Moon and the satellite and the stars so that they would produce the same or close enough the same view? I assume the sat and the Moon should be directly above observer num 2, because only that way would the geostationary satellite(s) be over the equator and move in visibility accordingly to how they do on a globe model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously the num 2 observers image is hard to replicate in real life, because satellites are not visible against the brightness of the Moon except for the ISS and that is not on a geosynchronous orbit so not directly comparable. Though in cases where the orbit of the ISS intersects the equator the viewing conditions could be roughly the same, with the difference that it supposedly is much lower than geosynchronous satellites and so the observers 1 and 2 would see it totally different, or in a globe model they wouldn't see it at all due to curvature blocking it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If perspective &amp; vanishing point explains some of these things, I would love to understand more. Where and how would you place the observers, the satellite and the Moon in a FE map?
      </p>
      <p>
       Making this a bit simpler to discuss: on the globe drawing they are on the sate longitude and thus have the same time zones. It's also a midnight at winter solstice. If it was any other date except for that or summer equinox the observer 1 and 3 would not see the satellite and stars to not align like that, but you'd need to tilt the images with the amount the Earth tilt affects it, to the opposite directions from each other. So for example, guy 1 could see the satellite at the bottom left of the Moon and guy 3 would see it at the top right (in reality bottom right as they don't stand on their hands in the southern hemisphere ;)

       I've tried to create the same places based on the available 3D image with the dome. Then I added a screenshot of Google Earth in your image, to dublicate the 'viewers' points.

      <p>
       The satellite and the stars are going to be placed somewhere else compared to your image with the globe model.

       is an image with the 'viewers' in it. Also note the rotation of the face of the moon in this image. We always see the same face of the moon; it doesn't matter if you're in Germany or in Australia. However, in Australia the face is rotated compared to the face being visible in Germany.

       Thanks, makes sense in a way, but there is the problem I had when imagining how to place the stars on the sky. If they are placed on a dome that is rather close, close as in not almost equal to practically infinite distance, the view of the sky would change depending on viewer location.
      </p>
      <p>
       Viewer 1 would see stars (as ordered in the FE drawing) e and f being further away from each other than how viewer 3 would see them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the dome was quite large, for example millions of kilometers from the surface, the parallax would easily be seen from photos of the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       In pics taken from the Earth the stars look the same no matter where the pic is taken from. I am guessing some explanation would be a property of the atmosphere, something that is inside the dome, that bends light.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was rethinking the way I suggested that the relative distances could be calculated and thought it is rather meaningless because getting a geostationary satellite and the Moon in the same picture is next to impossible, even with very sophisticated equipment. Maybe that idea can be dropped, but much could be derived from the angular size of the Moon too. What ever affects the visibility of stars should be affecting the Moon too so still that something is needed I think.

       Do you have any examples (images) that were taken on the same time and in which the moon (and perhaps the place of the satellite) could be seen? Just asking because maybe this is what caused you to question this. It would be great as a reference.
      </p>
      <p>
       How I see it, is that layers 'around' (in or out, I don't know) the dome include stars. You can see it in video's
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFpeM3fxJoQ">
        like this
       </a>
       , where it looks like one giant layer full of stars is rotating around the dome. FYI, I believe that the earth is in the center of a sphere, the 'dome', meaning that the stars also move below the earth, as seen in the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I also believe that some stars and of course the planets (as 'we' call them) are still able to move on their own, inside this dome. They follow a certain path. Also, I don't think planets are xxx times larger than the earth. I think they're quite small, the same as with the size of the sun and moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       How the stars give their light is - I believe - 'the same' as with how (again, I believe) the moon works; they're giving their own light. Just like how lumen work on the indicators of a watch for example, but maybe they're just like little suns. After all, the sun gives its own light as well. Why should the sun be the only one out there that gives its own light? (Asking in general.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting question about the shape of the moon, as it certainly looks like a ball. However, it always has the same face (only flipped) visible from all over the earth. (Australia, USA, etc.) So it
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be a flat disc, but it could also be a ball that doesn't rotate in a 3D movement we know from the 'globe model'.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are lots of things that can be explained for both a flat- and a globe earth. Such as
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EspZtA7C3o">
        this explanation on shadows on a globe
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VVg61Pm.jpg">
        this photo on a flat surface
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There are still questions for me as a FE-er though. As I've said earlier, I don't know everything. For example I should still dive into what causes the moon to have different phases (shapes of light on the moon). Also, why does it turn red sometimes?
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are also things I can't explain on a globe model, such as
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PklViabMHk">

       Originally where the thought came from that one night when I wondered why I see geostat satellites below the equator line (or curve how it looks from my perspective), the line that consists of stars above the equator, and realized it is because of perspective - I am looking from "above", the satellites are quite close, so it will seem like the satellites are "lower" while in reality their orbit is on the equator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it just occurred to me that due to this perspective shift you could measure angles from photos taken at the same time, and from at least three photos with each showing the horizon as reliably as possible (preferably water then), measure the compass heading of the photo (or better to use a common star that is visible in all photos as the reference for heading) and the angle between the horizon and the Moon, and very much like with the shadow measurement you talked about, the measurements can only fit to either a flat surface or a surface that's some other shape.
      </p>
      <p>
       With 2 measurements like in the photo where there's a light and two shadows, you can find a certain light ("Sun") height that will satisfy the exact angles &amp; shadow lengths that would happen on some other shaped surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you have more than two measurements the differences will start to show. If you had a third shadow, their proportions to each other would not be in line with measured shadows from a ball shaped surface. But in case to verify anything with shadows I think you need to know the distance between the sticks / poles, because obviously if you put sticks on a ball, measure the shadows, you can replicate the shadow lengths on a flat surface by selecting a proper placement for the sticks. But if you have to keep the distances the same, then a third measurement will not fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't calculated how far you need to be in order to make some estimates of the Earth shape with that method, but I think the problem would be that while three guys on the Internet could do the measurement, one can say that you can't reliably know the distance between them. We would need to rely on 3rd party values like from GPS. With measuring angles from photos of the Moon on the other hand you could get data that is not from a 3rd party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to the original question - I don't have a photo with all three showing, Earth, Moon and a geostat satellite. I doubt I could except maybe with ones that are spinning and flashing, maybe those rare ones can be caught on a camera under the brightness of the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, as I don't have a pic (or pics) of my own, I googled for photos of the Moon that would've been taken as close to each other in time as possible, and as far away in distance as possible. The recent eclipse was a good source as everyone was pointing their cameras toward the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's from Germany and South Africa (separated vertically a bit and the other photo was rotated to match the other):

       About the water mirror you linked to, I am assuming you mean that it should look curved and the reflection too? I have a feeling that the curvature is just not big enough to show. But that could be calculated, I mean whether it should affect the reflection in a way visible to the eye. That is interesting though, because at first you'd think that the reflection should start "elongating" and "widening" the further you look. Maybe if the sky was full of perfect geometric shapes it would be easier, but have to say that I am not at all sure about this one. Of course as a globe believer, and having witnessed bodies of water that stay very still if it's not windy (Finland is full of lakes), I think it's just not making a observable difference to the reflection.

       You
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       , yes. But until you actually have verified it with your own eyes it remains a belief based in the faith that other people's measurements and recordings are accurate.
       <br/>
       And even then once you have verified something with your own eyes, do you even know if that's true? Our eyes only pick up a small bandwidth of frequencies within the electromagnetic spectrum and due to the lensing effect of our cornea we receive that information upside-down and it's our brain's job to "correct" it to fit the input from our other senses. What we see isn't true reality. It's just a belief of what reality is. It's but a small fraction of what reality is. But I guess that's just semantics and philosophy and this point.

       Yes, that's right. Because I've tested that myself I know that it's true, but because you haven't then you don't know that. You're relying on the experience of others. Your belief happens to be true, but because you haven't directly observed it for yourself it remains a belief of yours.

       I understand what you're saying. To me it's pretty much sure that the world is flat. It makes it a fact for me. However, I can only make it into a guaranteed 100% fact if I've seen it with my own eyes and provide evidence for others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best way for me to prove it as a fact, is when I'm floating at least (let's say) 10000km above the earth, then make a picture with a (preferably huge) camera that isn't going to do fish-eye things. I then must be able to see all of the continents on the image.
      </p>
      <p>
       If 10000km is enough, I'm also going to see that it's a circle, or at least that there's a massive wall of ice or undiscovered land on it. I'm pretty much taking a picture of the UN logo so to speak. But all the continents must be on it. If the earth wasn't flat, then I wouldn't be able to get all the continents in one picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       However... I also need to bring a 'globe-believer' with me who is going to be honest about what we've seen. We both wear camera's which are being livestreamed. (No messing up with the camera, no photoshop, etc.) If it turns out the earth is a globe, then of course I stand corrected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, if both the 'globe-believer' and I can prove that the world is flat, then others would still say that we're lying, the livestream was fake, etc. (And then it's ending up here on r/conspiracy.)

       You can make the experiment yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also how do you explain ships going below the horizon.. ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately you have set up an experiment (50000km above earth etc) that will very likely never happen unless you are a billionaire, but there is no need for such a complicated experiment when simple deductions can prove it as well.

       I'll definitely stand corrected then, but I know what you mean. There will definitely people who will claim that it was fake. (Just like there still are people who you can show the collapsing of WTC7, but they still don't (want to) get it. But that's another subject.)

        I just did the experiment
       </a>
       on a flat surface by using 2 caps of pens (they're exactly the same height) and with a lightbulb that represents the sun, obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the model of the flat earth, the sun is smaller than the earth and is much closer to the earth as well. That's what I tried to demonstrate in

       Ships going below the horizon I think is because they disappear out of what we can see with our eye. You can get a ship 'back' by zooming in.

        First video

       that demonstrates it, but there are more. (WARNING: Sound. Just in case, as it starts at 2:08.)

       You're right about the experiment that isn't doable. However, another 'experiment' would be to fill a transparent box with water. The water should be the same height on the sides and in the center. According to the globe model, water on the sides are less in height compared to the center. If we would scale this transparant box to 100km (again, not doable), then it would be easy to measure if all the heights are the same. (The bigger the box, the better we should see the difference.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But according to this logic, even the water in a cup wouldn't be flat. There'd be a very tiny difference in height between the sides and the center.
      </p>
      <p>
       However... There is this so called
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PklViabMHk">
        mirror of the world
       </a>
       where you can see the reflections of the sky being the exact same in 'the mirror'. If the earth was a globe, these reflections wouldn't be possible, I think.

       Good question. I think it's because of the dome we're in, but I realize this is something that can be explained for both the globe- and the flat earth model.

       They certainly do exist. I met two of them at a dinner I attended with my GF. These two guys were low level executives within the car sales industry.

       One of them was convinced the world was flat... and the second one was pretty damned close to being convinced.

       the original Flat Earth Society was or is a British joke 'organization', for $5 you got a fancy printed membership card. as advertised in the back pages of Private Eye and Punch magazine (think Mad magazine in the US).

       this was back in the 60s 70s  or so.

       Yeah well if it turns out it is a globe after all, then all the FEs will just also say the stream is fake etc.

       Have you seen the explanation by Carl Sagan:

       You can make the experiment yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also how do you explain ships going below the horizon.. ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately you have set up an experiment (50000km above earth etc) that will very likely never happen unless you are a billionaire, but there is no need for such a complicated experiment when simple deductions can prove it as well.
