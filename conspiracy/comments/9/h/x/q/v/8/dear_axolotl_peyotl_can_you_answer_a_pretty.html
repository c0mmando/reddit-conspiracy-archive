       It would be nice if the lead mod would tell the community if there is any pressure or contact about how to run r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it would go a long way in confidence if axolotl_peyotl announced that he would post any contact to manipulate this subby.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure he could lie, and sure it may be a compromised account. but still IMHO this would help.

       It's stupid to ask questions like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you assume that the answer will be truthful.
      </p>
      <p>
       axolotl_peyotl will either:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Not answer, in which case you know nothing; or

         Tell you what you want to hear, in which case you know nothing unless you actually believe the answer to be truthful, in which case... duh!  Do you now what "anonymous" means?  Anonymous means ZERO accountability.

       Obviously the answer is yes. In that announcement thread about illuminatedwax's removal there were numerous people telling him how to do his 'job'.

       Anyone who wants to convince someone of something is lying to themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need to do anything as a human apart from breathing, so why convince someone to do anything else?
      </p>
      <p>
       Free thought and respectful discussion is what every subreddit should strive for, but it is only encouraged on niche subreddits like r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem I have seen is that too often people who want to convince someone of thinking in ONLY one way get too much attention because they confirm other people perceived needs of ONLY thinking in one way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leave us alone, we are talking about thinking, not how to convince anyone of anything... that is what we are trying to avoid becoming victims of.

       Yes I agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should have been more specific.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I think we want to hear is that axolotl_peyotl will post anytime someone tries to influence his decisions about this subby that is not a mod.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then someone could influence a mod and get around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe post if he is ever faced with an or else.
      </p>
      <p>
       So axolotl_peyotl, if you are reading this. The question has changed a little.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you willing to post if you are contacted about how to run this subby, sans mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post if you ever face an "or else" situation from anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think that makes more sense.

       it was posted, but then your reframing of the question made the exact same error. People attempt to influence the mods on how the sub is run hundreds of times a day, I was attempting to draw attention to the fact that your question, even reposed, is not useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to ask if anyone gives input on the running of the sub
       <em>
        that he feels some degree of obligation to follow.
       </em>
       But even then, not really a useful question. If the answer was yes, obviously part of that compulsion would be to answer no to questions such as this.

       I get it, but think about if axolotl_peyotl did say yes. That would blow a lot of people's minds.

      <p>
       Ya know, if he posted that he was offered fifty thousand dollars for the ownership of this subby and posted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then went ahead and publicly took it, I'd say "you go boy". At least we would know exactly what was happening. And it could be that way already.

        Today in Yemen, our military continues to wage this interventionist war alongside Saudi Arabia unauthorized by Congress. The time for crocodile tears and baseless platitudes is over. Enough is enough. The U.S. must end its support for Saudi Arabia and stop waging interventionist wars that increase destruction, death and suffering around the world, drain our resources here at home and threaten our own national security. ~ Tulsi Gabbard

       A while ago some pics were leaked showing some threads in the conclave, which also showed a few of the members - it included people that had been banned numerous times over from this sub.

       So the conclave, which is designed as a place to decide what to do with this sub, includes people banned from this sub... Clearly the criteria for access to it is beyond any logic I can imagine.

       I agree that he's a fraud. Total puppet of Israel. You say no one said he didn't have the right to speak; but a conglomerate of multi billion dollar corporations have conspired to censor him! It's probably all a show using him to then crack down on other more legitimate voices. Millions think AJ is the truth though and when billions and billions and billions of dollars conspire his fans are going to be energized.

       Oh, there's plenty of nasty comments and personal attacks that don't get removed or banned. If you question Shady Hook, Boston Finger Paint Hoax, The Jokeland Shooting, etc, you will be called all kinds of nasty names, and the mods leave that shit up.

       That's right. Sometimes, despite the fact that a lot of posts from regular users reach the front page, most of the comments in those posts are from randoms attacking the poster, the sub and hell even the mods themselves. I can say it because I usually reach the front page and It's just painful to watch...

       The short answer is no.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get
       <em>
        loads
       </em>
       of threatening PMs though...most of them are generic and lambast me for spreading "Russian propaganda" or whatever the trending complaint of the day is against me (and the rest of the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       community).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I've never been pressured by someone with
       <em>
        authority
       </em>
       to do things differently here.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, I'm not "in control" of this sub. The moment I abuse my position and break reddit rules I'm outta here. Sure, my voice has weight, but at this point my greatest asset to this sub (imo) is to absorb the negative energy from anti-conspiracy sentiment on reddit in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to think that the considerable energy spent harassing me will decrease the amount of harassment directed at others. This is more a practical development then anything "noble" on my part.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I can definitely promise full transparency.

       I don't particularly understand that part about not being in control. Surely it isn't against site rules to ban anyone posting in bad faith. As in the people who exclusively post on politics and only come here to shit on every single conspiracy theory.

       I think the risk is just that, you ban folks for crapping on someones ideas just because they are from one particular viewpoint (in this case I assume you mean anyone from the left) without doing the same to all other groups that crap on other ideas it shows bias in your actions as a mod. That should lead to removal from moderation duties and in a sub that is literally a battleground you better believe folks are watching and waiting to point out hypocrisy in moderation.

       Ya know, if he posted that he was offered fifty thousand dollars for the ownership of this subby and posted it.

      <p>
       Then went ahead and publicly took it, I'd say "you go boy". At least we would know exactly what was happening. And it could be that way already.
