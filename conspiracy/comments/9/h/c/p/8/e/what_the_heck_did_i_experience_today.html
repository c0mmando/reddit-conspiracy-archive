        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I do hope this is the right place for this but hear me out. </p>

<p>I usually communicate with my gf using whatsapp. Today we had some connectivity/reception issue and she was cutting out. I finally decided to call her mobile phone and the convo continued there for a while. The she was worried that it&#39;d cost me too much to call her mobile to mobile; mind you this is int&#39;l call to Turkey on TMo. We decided to drop the call and continue on Whatsapp.  At this point, something happened and she didn&#39;t start making sense suddenly, like she was responding in unrelated ways. Then I&#39;ve noticed I actually was hearing out her voice from the convo we had 5 min ago, like a recording.  I stopped talking at this point but the call still goes except she kept on answering to our previous convo. I still could hear my voice from a long distance, but minute.</p>

<p>You may know current stance about the US in Turkey after certain sanctions and the ongoing Robinson incident.  Could it be the Turkish government actually spying on all calls made from the US to Turkey? They accuse of a Turkish clerk in the US and asking for his deportation. They&#39;ve cut more than 100k positions all over Turkey for people with relations to this clerk, many have been imprisoned. So could they just widen their plot and attempt things like this? I&#39;m an ordinary citizen with no links to any of this bs. I&#39;m apolitical but care about the equality and democracy for all.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Being quite adept in all types of technicality, I couldn&#39;t understand what happened. The call dropped after this going on for 2 more minutes. During this time she couldn&#39;t hear me or I could hear her.  Any theories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious shit going down in Turkey--after the CIA-Fetullah Gulen overthrow attempt it seems CIA had Andrew Brunnson working on another overthrow attempt.  Sibel Edmonds (Newsbud) has claimed Andrew Brunson&#39;s wife is a paid CIA asset (I think her source was an article in Turkish media, but, annoyingly, she doesn&#39;t leave links to sources in her videos like James Corbett).  </p>

<p>The intense action in Turkey has also led to (supposedly) shutdowns of power at the Incirlik airbase where the USA flies drones and fighter jets out of into Iraq, Syria and, most likely, Iran.  A couple weeks ago there was news of legal action attempting to shut down the Incirlik airbase while prosecutors collected evidence and were calling for the arrest of US soldiers at Incirlik.  </p>

<p>So yeah--I would definitely recommend just texting instead of phone calls.  Turkish (and US/NATO) spooks are most likely spying on every call (and electronic communication) in/out of Turkey.</p>

<p>She did work in the Turkish language division of the FBI during 9/11, IIRC, so I give her a bit more leeway in not citing sources. </p>

<p>Her diatribe on Cenk of the Young Turks being an asset was hilarious. She basically said he was too stupid and useless for any other job but as a mouthpiece.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might be a recording but also data carrying her voice might be stuck in a loop inside a network in Turkey.</p>

<p>Just to give you heads up, I m Turkish.</p>

<p>The network infrastructure is not bad but it is not good enough to be fair.</p>

<p>It might be her voice data stuck in a loop in a local network(in Turkey) and piggybacked to you before finally clearing it up.</p>

<p>Are in anyway working for U.S government in Turkey ? (No need to answer that) if it is the case,  your call might be very likely be listened by both U.S government and Turkish government.</p>

<p>Also i know for a fact that TR government somehow manage to get encryption keys of whatsup communications. So it is more than possible.</p>

<p>also you can go to r/turkey and ask this question. people there are quite useful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You experienced the rare-ish scenario in which lag/compression issues on one leg of the call had a bad handoff from carrier to carrier. The call disconnecting should have ended the transaction but it it did not and one of the networks then played the buffered audio in error. </p>

<p>This is how all VOIP systems work. This is how all mobile phone networks hand off calls back and forth. </p>

<p>All audio is buffered (recorded briefly) on any digital phone connection. </p>

<p>A line tap on a digital audio communication is seamless in that the audio is recorded and sent to a third-party location that is not in any way associated to either leg of the actual call. If your line was tapped you would have no way of knowing or proving by yourself without the help of the carrier or the entity tapping your line. </p>
