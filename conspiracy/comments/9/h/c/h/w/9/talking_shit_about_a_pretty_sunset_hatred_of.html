       **Talking Shit About a Pretty Sunset**
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to take photos, and I happened to post a photo of some horses in the sunset on social media. I was surprised when I received a comment about how shitty and disgusting horses are - the man who posted the comment argued that horses were pests (and I understand that wild horses are overrunning some of the area I live in). Still, the intention of my photo was just to a post a pretty photo to help people see the beauty in the area around me. Besides, there are probably a million other issues that person should be more concerned about (I live in a really poor area), and I just did not expect that comment. The horses, by the way, were not wild horses. This guy just chose to find something negative about something beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Talking Shit About a Pretty Sunset" is a song I heard by Modest Mouse when I was in high school:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FayTNReU6U4">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FayTNReU6U4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And I feel it represents the modern philosophy of society. This post is not to discourage anybody from complaining or being negative. However, I find that, as a society, we often lack gratitude and appreciation. Nothing is good enough anymore, especially not actual reality (AR).
      </p>
      <p>
       **Reality**
      </p>
      <p>
       Reality is no longer good enough for people - people can no longer see the good and beauty in the world around them. I do not blame them, to an extent, as this world has been corrupted on many levels. Today, though, people would rather do anything but immerse themselves in what is real. There are two layers to this:
      </p>
      <p>
       **The Self** - From our physical bodies to our mental states, it seems that everyone is in a form of escape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, people are literally getting plastic surgery to look like their snapchat selfies:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/9ca4f7c6-d2c3-4e25-862c-03aed9ec1082">
        https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/9ca4f7c6-d2c3-4e25-862c-03aed9ec1082
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Our original selves are no longer good enough, and people do not see beauty in our natural selves anymore. As a woman, even, makeup has become almost absurd. I know makeup is nothing new, but have you heard of contouring? Now we have 11 year old girls contouring their faces to look incredibly different...surreal and even unreal at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can go in so many directions - from porn to plastic surgery, and there is a rise of men who will only sleep with sex dolls:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/11/27/sex-robots-spark-rise-of-men-who-will-only-sleep-with-dolls/">
        https://nypost.com/2017/11/27/sex-robots-spark-rise-of-men-who-will-only-sleep-with-dolls/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       On another level, people want to escape their mind state. More people than ever are on anti-depressants, and the trend just keeps rising:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5072904/">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5072904/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We no longer want to deal with our natural states of mind. By the way, I understand this is a very complex topic, and I am not dismissing those who struggle with depression and need to take medicine. The point, is though, when nearly everyone you know is on some type of pill, there might be something wrong with society.
      </p>
      <p>
       **The Outside World**
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only are we dissastified with ourselves, but now the outside world is no longer good enough. As mentioned earlier, for many, nature is no longer beautiful enough. We have filters to make everything more vibrant and interesting (and as a photographer I am guilty of this at times). We are no longer satisfied with real relationships, and many of us have replaced real life interactions with ANYTHING but real people (porn, video games, sex dolls, you name it). I mean, even teens are not partying anymore; they are on social media:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-teens-arent-partying-anymore/">
        https://www.wired.com/story/why-teens-arent-partying-anymore/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps there are pros and cons to staying in our houses all of the time, and again, I am not really *blaming* anyone. Still, it seems as though people are truly missing out on real life experiences, and they are being "replaced" for situations that aren't "really real." Perhaps we are more safe, but are we more content? Is experience still experience if it simulated? Are relationships still real only through technological means? Are people really happier avoiding the outside world?
      </p>
      <p>
       **Nothing Compares**
      </p>
      <p>
       When reality is not even good enough anymore, what can we appreciate? Nothing in reality can live up to...
      </p>
      <p>
       *...That perfect story line romance in our heads. How many relationships fail because somebody is expecting their relationship to emuulate the movies? Romantic comedies make people unrealistic about relationships.
      </p>
      <p>

        https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3776923/Romantic-comedies-make-us-unrealistic-about-relationships-claim-scientists.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       *...That perfect body in porn. I know it is Reddit and speaking out against porn in any manner may get me downvoted, but the simple fact is that porn can have a pretty detrimental effect on people and their relationships:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/inside-porn-addiction/201408/how-porn-really-affects-relationships">
        https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/inside-porn-addiction/201408/how-porn-really-affects-relationships
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       *...The perfect celebrity with the perfect life. So many people compare their lives to celebrities, and celebrity worship is a real, psychological thing. Here is the wiki article about "celebrity worship syndrome."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_worship_syndrome">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_worship_syndrome
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Many simply live their lives through their favorite celebrities - I mean just read the YouTube comment section whenever you get a chance. Our normal, boring lives can never compare to theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       *...Virtual Reality. While we have not emerged our consciousness with computers yet, it is coming, and Google's AI guru predicts it will happen within 20 years:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/11/10/googles-ai-guru-predicts-humans-and-machines-will-merge-within-20-years/">
        https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/11/10/googles-ai-guru-predicts-humans-and-machines-will-merge-within-20-years/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, the natural reality of the world will be nothing compared to the simulated world we create for ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       **Lack of Gratitude**
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you find this change in society good or not, well that is up to you, but in my mind, it is creating a society where simply nothing is good enough. With social media, we are in a constant state of seeing how things could be better, so we never take the time to see what is actually good. We are literally living through filters every moment - we can filter our pictures, our lives, our emotions, and eventually, our entire reality. We do not even have to have a moment alone with our thoughts anymore (because our thoughts are not as good as Google's, right?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the sunset is not beautiful enough for many anymore. Even the most beautiful woman on the planet gets criticized for wrinkles or cellulite. People can own 10 cars, a mansion, and have everything, but it is never good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are living in a time of excess materialistically, but we are lacking something much deeper. Sure, you can say this has always existed, but my argument is that technology has, in many ways, made things worse. We are living the world through a screen that may filter out the most important part of our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       **The Spiritual World**
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly, we are probably now living in a time where more people than ever have a disbelief in God or anything beyond:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-number-of-americans-with-no-religious-affiliation-is-rising/">
        https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-number-of-americans-with-no-religious-affiliation-is-rising/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       At first glance, this may seem to contradict the thesis of my post. Perhaps people are becoming more "realistic" in the sense they are not going to believe in any "magic sky daddy" or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, is it possible people are simply denying this part of reality, rather than accepting it? What I mean is, are people seeing the world filtered through a lens of dogmatic scientism, where nothing really means anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the material world everyone is so obsessed with is not really...real, but rather, the only thing that truly exists is a soul, spirit, or some other ultimate truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, you do not have to agree with me on this point, but I wonder if people are avoiding seeking something more than themselves. I mean, we are now living in a time where people are so obsessed with themselves, that they are marrying themselves:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/women-marrying-themselves-sologamy">
        https://www.vogue.com/article/women-marrying-themselves-sologamy
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, people would rather worship a robot/artificial intelligence, than a "so-called" God. There is literally a church of Google now:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.thechurchofgoogle.org/">
        https://www.thechurchofgoogle.org/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that I do not blame people for being disillusioned with the modern world, but are they denying their spiritual sides? Are we closing ourselves off? Are people avoiding searching for the truth and "Actual Reality"?
      </p>
      <p>
       **Conclusion**
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a gif on Reddit the other day, where a person was looking at the world through "actual reality" versus "virtual reality." Of course, I cannot find it now, but it was supposed to be funny, as the person was looking through some lens, amazed by the actual world around them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of this post is I feel that nobody is stopping to think. I find it interesting that we are always trying to  "improve" everything, without ever acknowledging some aspects of life are already good, naturally. The sunset is already beautiful. That phone I used to have a few years ago was fine. My 10 year old car that still runs is still okay. Are we literally losing our ability to appreciate anything as it is - perceived "flaws" and all?
      </p>

       It is late, and I am not sure anybody will read this, but I would like to end with a quote:

       I have a theory that the connection to technology will prove to be good. I think that it is a tool of the supernatural to communicate more clearly, and soon we'll see the subtle influencing of life to reach this goal pay off. People will think it's AI but it'll be something much more ancient.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can try testing around with synchronicity in websites to see it. No guarantee you will, as I don't really know much about how it works or if it would even work for everyone. I have noticed people mentioning Google picking up thoughts, I think it's probably the same thing. It's a phenomena that's not isolated to that website, or even the Internet though.

       To me technology is just a tool. It is not "inherently" evil. However, I feel it often gives us the illusion of making society "better" when things maybe were not really that bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other problem is we are not reflecting. Technology is automatically equated with progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it any wonder oday that suicide rates are higher than ever? This is no coincidence. I bet we could probably even make a graph that shows the direct correlation of suicide and rise of tech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, correlation does not automatically mean causation, but it is something to think about

       I think the correlation is more in the wealth of information that it provides, and the larger forum. People can see so easily all the issues with the world, so it can appear quite bleak. They know it can be better, they can dream more easily of a better life. It also doesn't help that bullying migrated to the Internet in spades.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem boils down to how civilization is being run, it's just not suited for people. New systems need to be put in place with the citizens in mind. Technology will ensure the necessity of these new systems when the job count plummets.

       Robots are coming, they're gonna start gobbling up jobs very soon. Corporations will gleefully use them since they don't need to be paid. This obviously will cause a big problem that's gonna need to be addressed with a form of universal basic income. The media really needs to prepare people for it more.

       They've been talking about the rise of automation years, I'm just stating the logical conclusion.

       Why? You know a lot of the stuff you're upset about in your post would be solved by automation taking the burden of many professions? It's that slog people work through that brings about much of the depression, and animosity.
      </p>

       A universal basic income could potentially free up people to pursue their passions. Humans could really focus more on fixing things like the environment.

       Yup but that doesn't devalue what I said at all. What do you think people are trying to escape from? You made this post but you're avoiding the real root of the problem, instead you want to blame technology, and the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course people are going to prefer the Internet, you can pretty much explore it freely with no charges! You want to go across that bridge in the real world? Well get ready for the toll booth, and make sure you got gas!

       That's on the person. If it wasn't this or that it'd just be something else. Some people don't want to face the reality they live in, and I'm saying that society/civilization needs to improve to help these people integrate better.

       Anecdotally, I once had this girlfriend whose dad liked, LIKED, to order stuff off TV so he could then call them up and bitch about the products. That was like his thing; he somehow derived some sort of twisted pleasure out of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck, I think we all like? to complain about things sometimes. Maybe
       <em>
        like
       </em>
       isn't the right phrasing?
      </p>
      <p>
       I love horses - a lot - and natural beauty (let's see the pic!). Any reasonable person with half a heart does. I maybe think what you're describing about about people's dissatisfaction with reality stems from an underlying, perhaps unconscious, realization that what is termed 'reality' is inherently fucked. Maybe it's just unrequited greed, disgruntlement with failed accumulation. Sure, modern society is fucked. The human condition is inherently fucked.  The actual structure of this physical plane is fuct. Maybe all these unhappy campers are sensing the inherently fucked up nature of the sim? Nah, they just like being wieners, are clueless, and couldn't give a fuck about anything that isn't directly benefiting their asses, most likely, dog eat dog &amp; all that. If they ever really woke up to the
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       reality then they would be truly humbled - and grateful for anything the least bit
       <em>
        nice
       </em>
       .

       The want for comfort is outweighing the price of nature. Many trades still rely on human craft. Too bad the scale is tilted. I often find those that work the hardest are the most dehumanized.

       Good read! I agree with quite a lot of points you made. I also feel that a lot of people are depressed today because they are constantly seeing the world crumble around them but are powerless to change anything. Many people want to change things but are hindered because of laws and stupid bullshit. Nothing too big here but take for example my current living situation. I live in an apartment complex and I see that it’s ran by an old lady and very under qualified maintenance guy. My dad, who has some sort of background in maintenance and doing repair work has offered numerous times to help out around here but has been turned down several times from office management. He watched as our complex wasted $3200 trying to hook up four new gas grills and they didn’t even do it right. The fire was seeping out from the grill, licking the electrical work, and gas was leaking from where the grills were hooked up. They didn’t seem to care that they wasted money on it,much less that they  hooked it up wrong. My dad wanted to help but was ultimately turned down for whatever reason. I ended up doing some math one day and realized that if every household inside of my apartment complex just donated $20 a month, we could’ve had new washer and dryer machines within two months and not have to worry about the shitty ones we currently have that have maintenance problems every few months. Why is the world ran like this? People want to do good but are constantly hampered down by evil at every turn. And when you are constantly trying to change the world around you but are told not to or that you can’t, you can lead a very depressed existence. This is currently where I’m at right now in my life and if things continue to gradually declined, I can’t say I’ll be around much longer after I’m 40. Best of luck out there kind soul.

       Geeezuss I hope that isnt true. I mean you seem to have a pretty decent head on your shoulders. Dont leave the planet full of shitheads with no clue...stick around.
BTW I used to say I would have a masters degree and as a reward for doing so would have traveled to Europe by age 35...As well as I would never live to see 30. I am now 45 and "defied" all that haha. Some days just waking grateful has to be enough...

       Hey bud. Unfortunately, your example is all too common in the world today. We need more people like you, who are aware, to help change this fucked up place. Try to let your frustration motivate change for a better world. We'll get there one day or our civilization will collapse.

       I browse this sub very rarely but this post caught my attention. I find myself agreeing with many of the things you said. It seems like we are always running away from what is real. We are always running and running to the next big thing, to the next big thing , to the next big thing. We keep running in the hope of reaching a finishing line. But there is no finishing line. No matter what we have, it's never enough. So we need more and more and more.

       There is a fundamental dissatisfaction in us that cannot be cured by any gifts, no matter how expensive. I don't know what is the cure for this. But I know that this dissatisfaction exists in me too.

       I think this speaks to the poison that is American media, which we continually see examples of on this sub. Combined with a lack of positive role models in secular society and a predatory economy, it's no wonder that we're so lost.

       I just watched that 1980's movie, batteries not included. In one scene it has a artist and his g/f arguing about their apartment. He goes but I like this place and she says, I dont its old and its depressing, and he says.
      </p>
      <p>
       "But this is reality" And she responds with,
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is 1980 something, no one wants to live in reality anymore".
      </p>
      <p>
       That summed that up pretty nicely, I realized it has only gotten worse since then.

       If you can learn to be happy in whatever your situation is right here, right now, you can learn to find true peace anywhere. Things come, things go. Everything is temporary. Embrace the now before it's gone! The more you chase after an ideal, telling yourself "once I get to X
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       I can be happy" the more you make it harder for yourself to actually be happy. Learn to accept and appreciate what the present situation is, whatever it is, and
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       go ahead and pursue something greater. If you pursue your ideal without learning first to appreciate the present then by the time you reach your ideal, not only will you have missed out on being able to appreciate all the small things along the way, but it also won't satisfy you the way you thought it would. You'd get there and love it for a short time, but then once the novelty wears off you'll be thinking "well... what next?"

       I think humans have never appreciated reality, but it's just compounded more now due to technology. But the root emotions are the same:
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       We have always tried to escape reality-with drugs/alcohol/meditation (reaching enlightenment)/concepts of the afterlife.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       We've never been satisfied with the beauty of nature or our technology-so we kept trying to push further and further beyond with new technology. We've always worshipped figures that represented our best selves.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally enjoy the simple shit in life...as long as you can satisfy your basic needs/urges, life will be good. And I'd argue all this crap we've got hasn't actually created a net improvement for life over hundreds of years ago. A caveman got the same joy from "reading" cave paintings or listening to his friend's stories that we get from watching a Netflix show. He might never have had an iPhone, but he got to enjoy the adrenaline rush of hunting and physical games. He also always knew he had a purpose for existence. Maybe there was the threat of saber-tooth tigers, but there wasn't the stress of a shitty job or having to worry about street crime. Now I'm sugarcoating things a bit, but you can probably see where I'm gonig

       I've been thinking about this quite a bit lately. Is it possible our quality of life was actually better before the explosion of growth in  technology? Things sure were simpler. Yes, we had higher mortality rates and more pressure to survive but life was authentic. It seems like most people in the US these days aren't even living a real life. They're all consumed by materialism, social media, and other unnatural phenomena. Some times I think life would be much better as it was 100+ years ago. I've seriously considered creating a sustainable lifestyle as it was in our early history and leaving modern society behind. I think it may lead to a happier and healthier life for me.

       Honestly none of substance but the passing thought I keep having is that something is either happening to the sun or our atmosphere that's altering the natural lights color? Maybe we are being lied to about the sun...not sure but it is weird enough that I have to fight my brain when I notice it maybe once a week.

       This post could make me cry. Beautiful articulation of the malaise that I feel and see around me always. Commisseration matters. I believe part of this syndrome results from everyone feeling they are alone in feeling this way. The media alienates everyone with showing one viewpoint repeated over and again, never showing the growing number of homeless, despairing people.

       I like this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that people are, more and more, living their lives via technology. Social media causes people to act in ways they wouldn't act without it. Just like your example of someone complaining about a nice sun set. Another good example would be people being rude or pretending to be outraged toward strangers. In real life people seldom act so nasty towards each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have thought about all this a few times, but it was not until I had a chance to chat with my father a few months ago and he brought it up. Now this man is almost 70 and he is not very good with tech. Needs help with his phone can't really use a computer etc. Recently he had made a facebook account with the help of my sister and he was using it on his phone. He said he made it so he could interact more with his family because everyone seems to be online all the time. He then told me he wanted my help deleting his facebook. I asked why? He said "because its all fake. Everyone posts everything they do down to the minute and its all just not real. Its things made to look better than they actually are and it makes other feel bad about themselves". Now if this old man could see though all this bullshit after a couple weeks of using it why is it so hard for the rest of us to see it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I still use things like twitter, facebook, and reddit obviously, but not nearly as much as I use to. I moved out to the country a few years back and I spend a lot of time in the outdoors in places with no phone service and its the most liberating feeling in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think tech is great and it can solve a lot of problems, but I also think people need to learn to unplug and just be. I was a kid in the 80s-90s and we didn't have cellphones.... I grew up with an internet that is nothing like what it is now. I know what it was to be without all these things and I wonder what its like to grow up in a world not knowing what it was like before all this information overload.

       I just finished reading a book called "Since Yesterday" its a factual and somewhat dry account of America in the 1930's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously the great depression and prohibition are central topics, but it touches on everything from what music people liked, the sports they played, fashion, popular books/movies, really every aspect of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like history and this book really gives a good perspective by making our contemporary lives and the problems we think we have seem really petty. It also highlights a lot of similarities in the cycles of culture and politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found myself feeling nostalgia for a time before I was even born. Very odd considering how bad things were back then leading into WWII.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even something really simple like tuning into listen to a radio show over just picking a podcast whenever I want seems some how better. In a world of on-demand everything the value of the "things" seems to diminish faster and faster and so we grow ever more hungry for something better and more convenient every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point this all becomes very philosophical in that all this is our nature, but does it have to be this way? Personally I think this is the dawn of trans humanism and these changes are inevitable for better of for worse. That doesn't mean
       <em>
        I

       have to live that way but humanity at large has little choice.

       Going through this post here. Starts off with somebody posting a negative comment about your horse and sunset picture. If somebody's a chump, the problem can be how they're frustrated with their life, more than how there's something wrong about you. So I don't really worry about uptight people too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kept reading this post. How's the world out there these days since the smart phones. I don't have one of them. They seem to like clicking into it all the time. They're like addicts. Then you got the social networking. People go on there, see how their life sucks. What are you going to post, how you're losing? So, they're all grumpy about it. They got no plan to win at the game of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       People love it when things get worse. Well, how do you think it'll be as you get older and your health declines. Things change too with how people treat you. Think of women in their 20's getting attention from boys. That declines as they get older. Lots of those get fouled up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you got the job thing out there. That isn't looking good. Robots 'll be taking over. How about the house prices. It's not a good world out there if you think about the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are pretty grumpy. What do they do to try and feel better. Oh, the distractions.. the smart phone clicking. Anything to get their mind off all this. Used to be the TV. Those who are a fan of sports, can do a lot of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then ya got the things you can ingest or smoke. How about the food. Whatever makes them feel "good" now. They don't care about later. So they can have problem with weight. You see that a lot with the older females. Well, now guys 'll even be less attracted. So what happens then, more grumpy. You see a lot of them with their dog. You know what goes on there behind closed doors. How about pills and who knows what else. All this to try and feel "good" now. Or anything to feel different than reality that sucks. Who cares if you get hungover tomorrow. Or smoke whatever and you know it's not good for your lungs. Then this eating food that tastes good but has bad effects later. Like how about sugar and the teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are people doing all this? Cause their life sucks and they got no plan to win at the game of life and become successful. No power. This is what you got out there.. Most people are like this. No plan, no hope. So what do they do, the distractions, the drugs, alcohol. Don't forget about the coffee all the time because they're burned out from surfing the internet too long instead of sleeping. Buncha junkies with everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the sex impulse. You get the women who like to use that angle to maybe try and get a better man. Why settle for somebody who has less money. Then ya get the loser males who watch porn. It's all buncha losing, all this. Most of these people who can't control whatever other distraction, also have problems with the sex impulse. All of this is to feel more "good" now and who cares about later. So what do you get.. Guys who are burned right out and tired at work all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the road rage out there if you drive. Forget it. In a rush to get home 5 seconds earlier to get to their junkie distractions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then ya get people driving vehicles they can't afford to try and make it look like they're more successful than they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these people in the general public, their lives suck. Even those who get a good salary, they can't figure out the business ideas thing and still have to work. So they're frustrated they can't figure out how to become millionaires. All these people, frustrated cause they're losing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turn on your TV or browse the internet, happy people who have more money than you. Watch gifv's on imgur.. oh fantastic things. Shut it off, you're left with your crappy, empty life. What's gonna happen later in the future, more health problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then in the future, this virtual reality thing. Who knows what's gonna go on. How about if you put on some type of hat thing over your head that interacts with who knows what, your brain waves. Then it'd be like this "dream" world or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point it's like the Matrix movie. But get this.. people will want to tune out from the crappy reality where things have negative aspects. They'll pay money to go into those Matrix movie pods. Well, there ya go, business idea there. Be the guy who brings the Matrix movie to reality but it isn't bad robots doing it to get power from you like a battery. But hey, maybe you could do that too and make some money on the side.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know.. pretty grim out there. But what you wanna do is be one of the people who can figure out how to win at the game. Not sit around being a fan of others. So, gotta shut this off right now and only halfway through reading your post. haha. No time to even re-read the rambling to check for typos. See ya.

       Yup but that doesn't devalue what I said at all. What do you think people are trying to escape from? You made this post but you're avoiding the real root of the problem, instead you want to blame technology, and the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course people are going to prefer the Internet, you can pretty much explore it freely with no charges! You want to go across that bridge in the real world? Well get ready for the toll booth, and make sure you got gas!

       I've been thinking about this quite a bit lately. Is it possible our quality of life was actually better before the explosion of growth in  technology? Things sure were simpler. Yes, we had higher mortality rates and more pressure to survive but life was authentic. It seems like most people in the US these days aren't even living a real life. They're all consumed by materialism, social media, and other unnatural phenomena. Some times I think life would be much better as it was 100+ years ago. I've seriously considered creating a sustainable lifestyle as it was in our early history and leaving modern society behind. I think it may lead to a happier and healthier life for me.
