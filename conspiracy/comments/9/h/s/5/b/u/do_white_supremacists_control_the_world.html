       This is a conspiracy that is often spouted by the left. The Social Justice Warrior, ANTIFA types and black nationalists. The first example they usually bring up is the disproportionate level of police brutality directed at blacks and other minority groups in America. They also cite colonialism as another proof that white Supremacists dominate world politics and have for the last few thousand years. When you bring up affirmative action they say that white women actually benefit the most from it but they never care to provide evidence to prove it. They also bring up America nuking Japan when non-white countries refuse to “play ball” with the white Supremacists. They say that black civilizations in the past were more technologically advanced and more civilized then even the best white countries and cities today and the white Supremacists of the past burned these cities down, destroyed any written evidence of its existence and took the knowledge from these people to build their own stuff.

       I'd never seen this interview before so thank you for posting. I'm not sure he's suggesting there's a conspiracy but rather a systematic approach - developed over years and years - of dealing with people of color. But I can see why you'd see that as a conspiracy.

       I'm unable to view this because apparently I have to be of a certain age to view it. But I'll try and watch later. Still, I think tying all of this to the "left" is a bit of a stretch. But good on you for actually backing up your assertions!

       There's a lot of reason to suspect white supremacists organize infiltration of police departments (both FBI reports and white supremacist recomendations to supporters), as well as plenty of anecdotal evidence over the years of white supremacists being in police departments (albeit in a presumable un-organized capacity).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a few people who claim different ancient africa theories, but they're at least as marginal within the black community as most white conspiracy theorists are in the white community.

       Oh, I don't doubt that some white supremacists have successfully infiltrated police departments/authoritative entities. But I'd say the vast majority of those who engage in police brutality against persons of colors aren't a part of the white supremacist political ideology - they're just plain racist. I think of white supremacy as more of a political orientation but maybe that's inaccurate.

       Yeah, I think I agree with you on how to think of white supremacy, but drawing a line between that and just plain racist is always going to be imprecise, and I don't think there's consistency in the labels in wider world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The inflitration is less to explain why cops beat black people, and more to explain how they keep gettin away with it.  I'm sure there's a decent amount of cops who brutalize non-whites, without being white supremacists or even particularly racists, and just beat who they're told to beat.  White supremacists would be more useful to have around to cover things up and maintain the blue wall of silence.

       I agree. Richard Spencer’s website was banned off the internet. He’s been banned off of multiple payment processors. The CIA even stalked him when he went to Europe. For whatever reason taxpayer dollars were used to do that. The Alt-Right was universally condemned in a resolution signed by every single member of Congress the day after Charlottesville. Paul Nehlen was the favorite to win Paul Ryan’s political seat after he retired but Nehlen lost all his financial backing and support from figures like Steve Bannon after he made some edgy tweets about Israel and “Its ok to be white”.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last person who could even be considered close to being a white supremacist who had political power in this country was David Duke back when he was in the House of Representatives in the early 90’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re right on the mark when you say they are one of the least powerful political ideologies in the world today.

       There's a pretty plausible theory that through ratlines/paperclip/gehlen after ww2 that the US/western deep state, led by the CIA and the US banking/military/industrial complex, was infiltrated by Nazi emigres, and that through the Cold War these ex-Nazis, their allies, and their progeny rose to the top of these institutions while destroying most threats to their power.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not what is oft spouted by the left, though.  Disproportionate police brutality at blacks is due to US institutions descending from explicitly white supremacist ones, along with white supremacists being extremely valuable allies and footsoldiers for the rich during the late cold war (war on drugs).  The idea of structural racism is supposed to address that the racist elements are not due to racist individuals, but rather the purposes the system is set up towards.  Nonetheless, there's some evidence of white supremacists infiltrating police departments.
      </p>
      <p>
       White supremacy as an ideology grew up mostly as a justification for the obvious evils of colonialism, rather than the other way around.  Still, white people did violently conquer most of the world, and plenty of the people who led that charge were white supremacists.  Plenty weren't, and plenty were elitists of some other stripe that makes it hard to distinguish through modern eyes.  When you compare, say, the borders of african states with those of european ones, and the impact on african development that's come from this arbitrary forced heterogeny, its pretty easy to see how powerful racists in the past can still directly impact the situation today.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a good amount of civilization destroyed and then erased by white invasion in the Americas.  How much is unclear, as evidence was destroyed, and they were obviously less technologically advanced than the Europeans in some areas, but there's enough documentation of mass-epidemics, and of iberians burning manuscripts, suppressing indigenous knowledge, and working communities to death.  This was nominally more christian-supremacist than white supremacist, but still fits the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       White supremacists (hopefully) don't control the world, but in large part white people generally do.  Even if they are well-intentioned, their unconscious biases, their (white people who control the world, not all white people) incentives for maintaining their own power, and the racist legacies and institutions they inherit all make it much easier for them to rule the world in a way that disproportionately benefits white people.

       If white Supremacists control the world then why are they discriminated against when it comes to academic admissions at elite universities? Why do they choose to massively import millions of people from other races unlike themselves into their native countries, and allow them to vote in elections, hold public office, and take advantage of public services propped up by the white middle and working class? How come if you look up on google black man murders white man you get a thousand results of the exact opposite thing you were looking for? How come media entities like Vox and CNN report on lies that right wing extremism is responsible for the overwhelming majority of hate driven murders in America and they use shootings during bank robberies to inflate the numbers?
      </p>
      <p>
       Disproportionate police brutality does not occur because of white supremacy. Blacks commit 53% of the homicides in this country but there are still twice as many whites killed by police. Blacks also commit more than 70% of armed robbery crimes according to FBI statistics. When all is said and done the numbers actually prove that police are more hesitant to gun down blacks than whites given the overwhelming overrepresentation of blacks in violent crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       White supremacists do not control the world. Rural manufacturing areas in Europe and America have been devastated over the last 100 years because corporatists have been shipping their production over to Asia. Why would they sell out the white masses in favor of Asian labor if they were white supremacists at the end of the day?

       If you think those statistics are accurate, you've been ignoring all the many cases of cops lying their asses off for the record.  Black crime statistics are inflated because of decades of overpolicing,  as part of an overall system of divestment and control.  The Reagan administration drastically ramping up the severity of the drug war at the same time they were shipping in cocaine in bulk exemplifies this process.  By regularly destroying black communities, white supremacists not only prevent them from accumulating wealth and power, but also create conditions non-racially conducive to violence, desperation, and crime, thus allowing them to blame black communities for the violence inflicted upon them.

       Really, only over the last 40-50 years.  The financiers who benefitted from this were almost uniformly white, this deindustrialization policy hit non-white communities plenty hard as well (you just don't hear as much about it), and lastly one of the major drivers of deindustrialization was the desire to destroy organized labor and the left, in part because they were allied with non-white liberation movements.

      <p>
       Because it gave them the money to defeat their left-wing enemies at home, or the lefties in those foreign countries, and because, particularly with china, trade opening helped pry china off from the international communist movement, preventing it from funding revolutionary movements in the nonwhite world, and hastening the fall of the USSR, another historic patron of nonwhite movements and threat to western white leadership's money.

       Why would white supremacists want to destabilize other white countries though? In World War 2 Germany destroyed the British empire and Britain and America and the Soviet Union destroyed the 3rd Reich. Why would white Supremacists murder other white supremacists on such a massive scale if they wanted to maintain their power over the non-white masses?  We even see examples of this today. Russia is at war with Ukraine and they are at war with America and NATO using proxy armies.

       So decent whites exist and they were able to defeat evil white Supremacists as they gave up some of their exclusive rights and priviliges to help non-whites advance? Wow that sounds like a  hell of an endorsement of the white race. I don’t see too many blacks standing up for the rights of white folks in South Africa. Not too many Saudi Arabians crying out to stop discrimination of blacks in that country.

       Ok fine but why would white Supremacists even allow blacks to use public services and welfare programs in the first place? You’re saying they are completely ok with using the white middle class to pay the expenses of poor, ghettoized whites? If rich whites don’t care about poor and middle class whites wouldn’t it be silly to label them “white supremacists”?

       So FBI crime statistics are a giant lie but white Supremacists still destroyed black communities making them more dangerous to live in? Either FBI crime statistics are correct and black communities are worse off or they are one giant lie and blacks are in fact not uniquely oppressed by white Supremacists as crime and drug use in white communities is just as high. You have to pick one it can’t be both.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not saying there isn’t oppression of blacks im saying white supremacists don’t control the world. They don’t control the media, the banks, Silicon Valley corporations or the Military Industrial Complex over the last 20 years. Jews are the ones that have an overwhelming disproportionate level of power. White supremacists actually have no power on the grand scale of things at this current stage.

       White people conquered the world... most recently.  Dark-skinned races conquered the world a long time ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, India's sacred books say they were conquered by a dark-skinned race from the West.

       The Armenian Genocide was carried out by Turks. The Holocaust was a lie. The pogroms were lies for the most part. The Native American Genocide was real but there is a double standard when it comes to invasions and colonialism. The Arabs invaded and conquered many a European countries and the Chinese have as well. So did the Native Americans there is archaeological evidence of brutal tribal warfare before Europeans ever saw the land. Same with the Aborigines but keep in mind that most of them died from disease because of their weak immune systems. Chinese Communism under Mao was certainly not a white construction.

      <pre><code>William F Buckley was not the only Yale figure connected with the presidential trip to China” (of course referring to the then recent trip to China of President Nixon) “without Yale support. Mao Tse Tung may have never risen from obscurity to command China. Jonathan Spence, professor of Chinese history, was the first to discover Mao Tse Tung’s connection with Yale. The Professor noted “In 1919 Mao, aged 26, was in Changsha, having finished his middle school education, he visited Peking and while there received a serious introduction to communist theory in Leeteuk Charles’ Marxist study group”.

Now, if he was to develop a reputation in socialist circles, he had to find a form to propagate his views. At this crucial point The Student Union of Yale and China invited Mao to take over the editorship of their journal. Mao accepted the position and changed the format of the student magazine. It would now deal with social criticism and current problems and focus on ‘Thought Reorientation’.

       i am not getting your points about the arabs, the chinese and the native americans.  they all invaded europe? and the australian aboriginals did what?
      </p>
      <p>
       lastly, even though you think there was no holocaust, and i wonder what you base that standpoint on (!), i still think the nazis hated and violated the jews and took them against their will to some places where from many never came back..
      </p>
      <p>
       oh and the croatians killed a lot of gypsies and serbs in jasenovac.  do you think that didnt happen as well?

        In fact, 85 to 90% of the foreigners helping the Chinese at the time of the Communist takeover were Jewish. This included the daughter of the founder of the brokerage firm Goldman Sachs, who left the comfort of her Park Avenue home to assist the Chinese.

        “The Revolutionary” tells the story of Southern-born Sidney Rittenberg, the only American that has ever been admitted to the Chinese Communist Party. The Mandarin-speaking Rittenberg, who was initially sent to China by the U.S. Army at the time of Japan’s surrender at the end of World War II, became an influential advisor to Mao Zedong and to the first premier of the People’s Republic of China, Zhou Enlai. His pivotal role at the Broadcast Authority, explaining the Communist Chinese point of view to America, earned him a higher salary than Chairman Mao.

       The Arabs have invaded Europe before many times in fact. Especially Spain. The Chinese have had their fair share of imperialist crimes as well. Social Justice Warriors only whine about white crimes though.

      <p>
       Yes the Nazis imprisoned Jews and killed many for refusing to leave the country. However Jews have done the same to whites. 85% of Soviet Leadership was Jewish when some of the worst crimes against humanity ever took place mostly against white Christians. We also have Israeli imperialism which is very brutal and tyrannical.
