<p>I was just a kid when it happened but the first thing I said to my mom and babysitter was &quot;what movie are you watching?&quot;. The way it was being shown on the news just seemed scripted. Then when I saw it fall I was confused even more with the way it fell.. </p>

<p>My mom is super conservative and went on telling me how &quot;camel fuckers&quot; living in the sand managed to pull this off. We got along even less when I told her it didn&#39;t make sense that they could pull it off lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reposting an old comment of mine describing it:  </p>

<p>14th of February 2015. I was sitting at my window having a smoke when a light caught my eye. A set of three orange orbs of light forming an equilateral triangle (could have been a triangular craft, could have been three orbs in formation - it was too dark to tell if there was anything solid to it) which came slowly over the sky, about ~100-200m high off the ground, toward my house from the left. My phone was too far away for me to have gone and get it, got the camera out, and then get a decent video, so instead I kept my eyes locked on to observe as much as I could. It seemed to just be going straight really slowly, silently, until the point when it was almost out of view over my house (I was practically leaning as far out my window at this point as I could) and it just took off straight upward literally as fast as you&#39;d imagine the Millennium Falcon jumping to light speed. That one event really nailed it in my head that UFOs are not only real, but they utilise a physics that mainstream science says doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>
I&#39;ve done plenty of research into the physics of UFOs and came across a few videos that I know are great:<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s a very awesome story! One time I was walking back to my apartment complex from the office building late at night once and it was just a clear night sky no clouds or nothing and it was almost as if this thing just materialized out of nowhere shooting straight down. Imagine just like a black hole or wormhole opening up and something coming out of it. This thing just shot straight down behind the building somewhere that must’ve been several hundred feet back I never saw what it was. But it was just crazy because this thing didn’t shoot down from the atmosphere, it didn’t leave a trail of anything. It just appeared and was accelerating straight down at an impressive speed. Somethings out there.</p>

<p>I also dated a girl in high school and her mom told us of a time they were sitting in their hot tub and saw a few orbs of light go around behind the moon but never came out the other side. Got me thinking that there is for sure moon bases or something on the other side of the moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering anatomically modern humans have been around for tens, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and the entirety of our record-keeping covers only the latest 1%, it&#39;s reasonable to believe we&#39;ve hit this level of technology before.

    <div class="md"><p>I like to pretend it wasn&#39;t 9/11. I mean, I used to be into ufo stuff and mysteries like the Bermuda triangle and atlantis, so I like to think before then. I had a teacher tell me history was written by the winners, and since then I questioned a lot of things. I&#39;ve seen Ruby ridge, waco, okc, columbine, wtc93, shit, I was not far away when twa800 happened. So I&#39;ve lived to see and read and hear much about all of these events, so it couldn&#39;t have been 9/11. It was just 9/11 that I first spoke about on the internet. Before 9/11, most conspiracy talk was &quot;you hear about this?&quot; In face to face conversations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a common day in july&#39;s ends in where I was watching Stephen Hawking documentaries, until that in one video (of the suggestions on right side) a video called, something with &quot;...así será la nueva moneda mundial...&quot; (&quot;...how will be the new world coin...&quot;). And it caught completely my attention.</p>

<p>And then, when I watched this mysterious video, on the right panel I saw LOTS of videos about a such &quot;Nuevo Orden Mundial&quot;; &quot;...has sido engañado durante toda tu vida...&quot;; &quot;...los illuminati controlan la mente de las personas...&quot;; &quot;el problema no es quién nos gobierna, sinó ser gobernados&quot;; &quot;la Matrix&quot;; etc. And of all those videos, the most outstanding video I watched is one directly from the website &quot;<a href="https://mundodesconocido.es">mundodesconocido.es</a>&quot; called &quot;Nuevas Tecnologías Exóticas De Control Humano&quot;.</p>

<p>My first reaction was to be very scared, but it just took a day. After that I FOLLOWED watching those videos, having accepted that I,  like too many people, have been deceived throughout all our lifes, and that from 28/7/2012 - 2/8/2012, I was accepting that I must do something for let the System not to defeat all of us, the 99%.</p>

<p>Honestly, that was the most superduper radical change that happened in my life, from all directions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn’t there personally but I remember as a 10 year old child watching 9/11 on tv as it was happening. Engrained in my brain forever. 
Next would be the Bermuda Triangle, then it would be random things I’d hear in high school in social studies class; How the government poisoned alcohol as a means to “stop people from drinking it” eventually killing whoever drank it. </p>

<p>In college: The Tuskegee Syphilis experiments on black people. The rigging of drugs and the social justice system to link certain minorities with specific drugs in neighborhoods to throw them in jail and separate families. The list goes on and on. The intricate loopholes these people actually looked into to keep black people perpetually locked up.</p>

<p>Random thought: One thing I’ll never understand is why we were never taught about Nikola Tesla. And another thing is why anyone would defend these actions at all. “They didn’t think people would drink the poison”. Yet no one took any responsibility and no one was put in jail. They all just got slaps on the wrists. </p>

<p>What I have concluded from my research has astonished me. I have reached five major conclusions: </p>

<p>• Traveling on the public highways is a right and not a privilege</p>

<p>• Codes pertaining to motor vehicles do not pertain to the general public but only to people contractually using their automobiles for hire (e.g. taxis or semitrailers)</p>

<p>• Police must go through the process of getting a warrant before demanding that people show their identification or forfeit their belongings to a search</p>

<p>• The state can only enforce laws that directly relate to a distinct and palpable victim   </p>

<p>• Courts routinely violate due process in order to obtain revenue from the infraction system</p>

<p>These conclusions highlight two significant philosophic problems in American society. First, they demonstrate that public education about rights enumerated in the Constitution has deteriorated; people are accustomed to blindly submitting to authority. Second, they show that the public has been subtly convinced—in error—that they do not own the highways.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>Ultimately, I have three GOALS for anyone who reads this book</strong>. First, readers should understand that we have a fundamental right to travel on the highways; the highways are owned and maintained by the public. Second, readers should prove appalled at the racketeering scheme resulting from police and judicial policy. Third, through discussing these issues, I hope to give readers a working knowledge of the maxims of law so that they can think critically about any political issue that may confront them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First it was religion, where I realized that people will lie to get money from others in exchange for far fetched hope. Ultimately it’s rich people taking the little
money that poor people have and convincing them that their lives will be better as a result.</p>

<p>Then came Santa Claus when I realized that people will willingly lie to each other just to make others happy. They know their fabrication is nicer than reality and so they perpetuate it as long as they can.</p>

<p>And then I realized that JFK and MLK were killed to protect the lie that everything was okay, that capitalism and extreme wealth inequality were somehow good for our world. This lie made people feel better about exploiting the labor others. This lie made people think that their good economic fortune would continue forever and that young people and intellectuals were a problem for rocking the boat. This lie made people side with the oligarchs and empower them even more. Revealing this lie was a threat to the current way of life. It was obvious that the government must have been involved in their deaths and that meant our government must be doing the bidding of ultra rich instead of the people.</p>

<p>I was just a kid when it happened but the first thing I said to my mom and babysitter was &quot;what movie are you watching?&quot;. The way it was being shown on the news just seemed scripted. Then when I saw it fall I was confused even more with the way it fell.. </p>

<p>My mom is super conservative and went on telling me how &quot;camel fuckers&quot; living in the sand managed to pull this off. We got along even less when I told her it didn&#39;t make sense that they could pull it off lol.</p>
