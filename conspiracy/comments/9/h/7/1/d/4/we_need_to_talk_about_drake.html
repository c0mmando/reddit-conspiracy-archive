       <em>
        There have been a couple events that have come about recently to paint a different light on the famed pop star.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       In late august, he was on tour in Washington DC, where he allegedly rented out a whole restaurant so he could eat with a model who recently turned 18. Yes, shes legal, but this situation alone gets weird fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did they meet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well .. this ended up saving his ass, for now.
      </p>
      <p>
       They met when she was 16, at his show, backstage. She posted a picture of them together that night, and apparently one later in the year on his birthday that included a sweet note of appreciation that she has now deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward to last week, they ate at the empty DC restaurant and then she posted a picture of them showing some PDA with the caption .. “No place I’d rather be ❤️”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm47gM9j-c8/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet">
        https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm47gM9j-c8/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be mentioned that this model, Bella Harris, is the daughter of James Samuel Harris, who is a pretty powerful guy in the Music industry from his songwriting back in the day. The pictures goes viral as people connect dots on her past posts and how old she would have been. The pictures are deleted and she very quickly posts this:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Which could easily be true, since the alleged dinner was in late august. She honestly handles this well, from the perspective of her not wanting her dad to know and to ruin Drakes career over this type of speculation. She could have made the dinner, and then gone to fashion week. As this forces things to subside, the dust settles, and the profitable OVO machine keeps going.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until an article is published on Drakes close friendship with Millie Bobby Brown, who is 14.

       SS: I personally believe that pedophilia is a systemic issue among the powerful. Drake is arguably the most powerful person in Music right now, so its concerning that he has been spending a lot of time around vaguely aged girls. I thought I would bring this to your attentions because I respect this platform and what is has been able to do for the truth movement.

       Adult is an odd term. Mental vs physical maturity, I'd say you need both to be an adult. But not everyone becomes mentally/emotionally mature in our culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The age at which a woman starts menstruating was used as a norm for becoming a woman for many cultures, and some still do. Even in the south eastern US it is looked at as such. For a man, making your first kill, or a physical act to some extreme was used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have pressed the age of consent basically to 18. But for myself, I was sexually active and very interested at 9, and had a 12 year old girlfriend at the time, to fool around with. Technically I could have been convicted as a pedophile in many states today, even though I was younger. It was 8 more years before I actually lost my virginity. Yet they were rather uncomfortable years of puberty where I was a loaner basically, and could never fit in...
      </p>
      <p>
       To sum up, I think alot of this stuff is silly. Teenage girls classically seek out older men, while some are terrified. There is no cookie cutter answer. We're all people, and the person is what should be addressed, not just a law written down.

       There is a cookie cutter answer and your attempt at blurring the line is gross. If she is under 18, and you dont know her, theres no need to have a close relationship with them. End of fucking story.

       Yeah it is pretty weird, especially if you barely know them. Of course any young girl will be down to do almost anything for Drake because, well it's Drake haha. I do see where the person you replied to is coming from though. I for one think that as long as you have no bad intentions with someone, then by all means do what you feel. And that has to be from both sides. But at the same time, allowing young people to go with older people can be dangerous. I mean, that law is there for a reason obviously.

       I was blurring no lines. Just philosophically considering the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine being a mother from a 3rd world country, where you were married off soon after your first time menstruating. It's not barbaric, it's your version of normal. What I find gross, is this still happens here in the US in the south, and girls are often partnered with much older men.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the line was so crystal clear, why is there no federal law? Why do states have different ages of consent? Why do some states water down the label pedophile, by convicting underage boys with the pedophilia, for simply having a naked photo of a girlfriend their same age?
      </p>
      <p>
       My main point is that people mature both physically and emotionally at different ages. Different ethnicities mature physically at different rates. There shouldn't be a norm beyond decency, caring, and common sense. The human condition doesn't do well with infinitives, there's always a case that breaks the rule, thus rules are guidelines only.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do like the general idea that you should wait until your 16, and spend your time investing in your mind. But that idea is also ridiculous, because at 16 you've spent years being immersed in hormones, and not really in your right mind. It would be better for these kids to spend middle school years in some kind of work/study apprenticeship, and communal living. Kinda like summer camp, but with a professional direction. Have them working and playing so hard, sex would be an excess you don't really have time or energy for. But no matter what we do, it's going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       My son has turned 10 this year, and just like me, he is interested in sex, and I caught him looking at some rather explicit material early this year. So for my family, the game is on. I didn't have a dad around for this time in my life, so it's both terrifying, and interesting to both be there for him, as well as give him his space. But I've yet to decide on an appropriate way for him to exercise his interest. I've only had a serious talk with him, and explained that looking at that material was very serious, and not allowed, unless I gave it to him. But if I don't figure out something, he'll just be finding it like I did, from friends who raised their dad's stash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally I think 16 is too young and 18 is a better age of consent, but your still hardly mature enough yet to make decisions that could end with you being responsible for a new life.

       Talking about that might shed light on the complexities of this pedophilia is something the OP could imply. Don’t just bat it away because the precious “pedo” word isn’t in there (although I do understand that you probably misunderstood it as derailing).

       Yet I just showed how it might not be as irrelevant as you say. You think it’s just
       <em>
        obvious
       </em>
       he’s a mason somehow - well then, that creates all sorts of connections and links to previous theories and such then, doesn’t it? He’s a mason, so clearly that’s a huge part of our current conspiracy-star Drake. Do you actually want to get to the bottom of this pedophilia or not? Because here’s another angle to look at it from.

       Well now that I’ve reasonably explained to you how it’s not such an irrelevant topic jump after all, and you know an obvious but unsaid fact on how Drake is a  sketchy mason, can you not think of anything that ties Drake’s potential pedophilia and the free masons together?

       Ok, now you’re just derailing out of ego. Answer my question clearly. Think of the children, I guess. You just said it’s obvious he’s a mason, unless you’re bad at sarcasm. “Satanism, yes” doesn’t actually mean anything at all. You said two damn words. Please explain clearly.

       My point was that he’s arguably the most powerful and popular person in music right now, so of course hes a satanic mason. I personally believe they only allow the corrupted to be truly A list. His owl symbols speak for themselves, along with ‘October’ being his month of choosing.

       You putting some sort of requirement of response on me is just childish, I already brought all this post together and responded to most comments in the thread. Im sorry you are apparently too arrogant and need to debate someone on this, or cant handle the research on your own. I brought this up because its my research, you can rebut or share your own, but to comically question me is just annoying so yeah of course Im not going to give you the complete response you want

       Well, I’m doing research now. I just find it odd how you didn’t jump excitedly onto that question where children are clearly concerned with the its topic matter - more than Drake having personal tastes, even. It’s weird, irritating and pretty hypocritical. And if we’re doing research, this thread’s discussions are included in it, other wise there’s no point creating it in the first place.

       I already addressed this, and addressed the fact that your negativity is whats irritating and unnecessary. Its all coming from a lack of communication, my point was that its obvious hes a mason due to his place in the world and other factors, making it so obvious its irrelevant. Its not hypocritical, its pointing out obvious facts without care of possible misconstrued perceptions.

       I’m only being rude because you keep being very rude to the original poster of this mini thread (as well as myself), and as I said, annoyingly refusing to talk even when someone simply asked a limited question of Drake being a freemason. Like I said, there’s your avenue that could even prompt someone else to share something important about Drake and pedophilia, but you didn’t care about it. Lots of information on Drake and pedophilia could be hatched through that. Get over yourself, honestly.

       So how long have you been on reddit? Do you think theres some sort of a single response max on all comments? Sorry you got so butthurt about me pointing out its irrelevance. I was talking about how he is slipping up and we need to direct attention at the provable, not further discuss unprovable vague details that don’t bring us much further from where we already are. If you dont like a comment, then move your eyes.

       Anyway, you can just say that about satanism instead of the many ways you’ve rudely been expressing it as “irrelevant” (which I kept refuting until this nice new perspective). You never laid down any rules for which direction the thread is supposed to go in - motivations, psychology, physical action against him, how to stop it? The whole questioning of him being involved in organisations obviously fits into a lot of those. This thread isn’t about you, it’s about the subject matter and potential victims.

       That’s my point. The truth is bad enough, but when someone exaggerates the truth they make it weaker instead of stronger. Because now anyone who reads that and knows the truth will think this is just someone pushing an agenda. Why do that?

       Well, first of all, I’m not surprised you don’t care since you clearly admire the satanic ideology. 
Secondly, it doesnt really matter if you care or not, this man has untold amounts of fans that look up to him while he thrives in a culture of enabling people as successful as him to be as evil as he pleases.

       Very concerning me that people consider a 31y/o man having a "close friendship" with a 14y/o. I can only assume that when someone doesn't speak out about it, it's because they are into it... How can you not care about children?

       I think it's disgusting, and you were right to peg it as classic mind-control grooming. Complete butter if you ask me.

       Yeah I've been in education for a while and still remember students singing lollipop... or lest we forget the 'I wanna fuck every girl in the world' song. Hip hop has always been vulgar but lil Wayne for some reason seemed to have young suburban audiences as a target demographic.

       Yeah you are right, I guess my wording was too extreme. But you basically have to go all the way back to Masta Ace, Public Enemy, Tribe, Eric B and Rakim, etc. Nonetheless the hip hop paradigm for the last 25 years has been pretty low on the 'moral integrity' scale. Some artists like Digable Planets, Fugees and Blackalicious have tried to change that paradigm but with Lil Pump and what not on the scene it's only gotten worse. BTW if you have any favorites I'm always up to hear suggestions.

       yeahh.... the voting patterns are intentionally fucked up. it makes the everyday user think we think a certain way. this helps in creating narratives, and drives away independant researchers. when you see something heavily downvoted, it is for a reason.. no one cares enough to downvote everything unless there's something in it for them.

       Lots of ignorance here. Never mind, we still fight for the children. Have noticed a video on Instagram about that Millie girl from stranger things and drake texting each other and they went out to dinner and shit.. he seems to love to have friendly relations with teens. I also remember the interview with little Wayne talking about how he was raped at like age 11 and he loved it and bird man was there telling people what to do to each other. Definitely noticed the effects on smaller IQ people in my school and parts of town. The music seeped in like a poison and changed people. Geared towards sexualizing kids, promoting promiscuity and feminising men.

       No, the defensiveness of people angry at the notion that someone could be getting too close to underaged girls is whats ruining this sub. Im not the one painting Drake as a pedo, Drake is doing all that on his own. Your comment is what disgusts me.

       OP is legitimately using our anger against pedophiles to align with his hatred for Drake its concerning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being concerned about the voting on this thread and saying ''thought you guys were concerned about children I'm sorry to see that changed'' then using text-based gossip blogs to reinforce your theory is sickening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure what moderators are doing as you guys should be all ashamed attempting to paint someone as a pedophile with no evidence and no insight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know Bella was the daughter of a family friend?
      </p>
      <p>
       Millie had always been supervised with family when seeing drake? Why is it that you jump to something suspicious and disgusting as pedophilia? Is it a reflection of yourself? It could all be friendly, and Hollywood is fucked up so I'm glad he's looking out for her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this conspiracy or fucking gossip girl
      </p>
      <p>
       Thread conclusion: OP is trying to paint Drake as a pedophile. Evidence should speak for itself, otherwise this is character assassination and shouldn't be up. ''Upvote is concerning/ Thought you cared about children''.. Yeah dude this is scummy. You arent providing evidence, but instead linking Us to text blogs and IG pics not knowing Bella is the daughter of his friend..
      </p>
      <p>
       Your legit trying

       Heck, it might even be a warning. Maybe drake is getting saucy and the record label threw this story out there.

       Well, first of all, I’m not surprised you don’t care since you clearly admire the satanic ideology. 
Secondly, it doesnt really matter if you care or not, this man has untold amounts of fans that look up to him while he thrives in a culture of enabling people as successful as him to be as evil as he pleases.

       So how long have you been on reddit? Do you think theres some sort of a single response max on all comments? Sorry you got so butthurt about me pointing out its irrelevance. I was talking about how he is slipping up and we need to direct attention at the provable, not further discuss unprovable vague details that don’t bring us much further from where we already are. If you dont like a comment, then move your eyes.
      </p>

       Im not out here telling anyone to et over themselves, so maybe since you’re the only one ...you should be the one looking in the mirror
