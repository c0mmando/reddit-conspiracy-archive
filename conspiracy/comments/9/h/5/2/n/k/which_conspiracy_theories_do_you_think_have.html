       I'll see what I can pull up when I get a chance. I don't remember there being any hard, definitive proof but there are lots of similar examples and that alone is enough for the idea to be at least plausible for me rather than laughable.

       similar examples is not the same thing as proof. like I say I've looked for it for years and never found anything indicating clear unambiguous support, funding or provision of arms to bin lade / al-Qaeda...those guys were ALWAYS hostile to the west - their spiritual leader is Sayyid Qutb who was preaching against the west as far back as the 50's.
      </p>
      <p>
       that said - yeah it's plausible...just don't let that 'plausible' slide into 'probable' due to people's political beliefs...

       Have you not heard of USSR invading Afghanistan, and the US arming of Afghan populace to fight back? But mainly the forces that were fighting against the USSR were middle east men from other Countries?
       <br/>
       Then the US arming of these "Rebels" to stop the invasion. This group was lead by Osama Bin Laden.
       <br/>
       They have made IDK how many psy-opt movies talking about this very setup. Hell even Rambo Movies got into the mix.
       <br/>
       Harts War to name another.

      <p>
       They may have had different names, but they are the same, and have been for years. The Iran Contra deal was a major part of this later on too.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a little more background for you. Look it up. Find your proof. Hell even WikiPedia knows. Read between the lines for the real answers.

       yeah i know all about all of that but no evidence exists showing that the west funded, armed or trained bin laden or al-qaeda.

       if evidence existed do you not think it would be all over the internet by now? fuck i can show you congressional hearings where the CIA were more or less proven to have started the crack epidemic but nothing exists to back this up.

       You've spent 18 years looking for proof that Al Qaeda was funded by the US? And you think it's laughable? As you know Al Qaeda means 'the base',
       <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development">
        well in a 2005 article
       </a>
       Robin Cook, former speaker of the House of Commons claims Al Qaeda was the name of the file that listed all of the CIA's mujahedin assets in Afghanistan. It's database.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also would have came across Salem Bin Laden in your 18 years of research as well. The former head of the CIA Bin Laden unit Michael Scheuer himself has said 600 million of the agencies funds have passed through OBL's charity fronts the most prolific being MAK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Salem Bin Laden was GWB's business partner. The Bush's and the Bin Laden's are old family friends. You do remember that GHWB is a former CIA director? But you're right, laughable

      </p>
      <p>
       rest in no way proves that Al-Qaeda were financed by the CIA...Osama had been disowned long before that.

      <p>
       you realize exactly how many bin ladens there are right?
      </p>
      <p>
       show me a direct link proving that the CIA funded, trained and were in operational control of Al-Qaeda...if you cant then stfu and let the adults play.

       I'd have to read up on it again. I don't think there's any definitive proof. I took more issue with OPs notion that its laughable, the fact there are other similar, proven examples bumps it out of the 'laughable' category for me.

       Proof? Who was "in charge" of Al queda during 9/11? OBL? He was a CIA asset during the USSR invasion of Afghanistan. His group turned into al queda who turned into ISIS.

       Speculation? The facts are:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        US supplied Afghan fighters with weapons and training.
       </li>
       <li>
        These fighters after the Afghan/Soviet war started Terror Training Camps (Al Queda)
       </li>
       <li>
        The leader was Osama Bin Laden (A well known CIA asset)
       </li>
       <li>
        The other leader of this group was Bagdadi (IDK the spelling and not looking it up)
       </li>
       <li>
        The Bagdadi group left Afghanistan and went to Iraq under the protection of another CIA asset Saddam Hussein.
       </li>
       <li>
        This 2nd group later formed ISIS.
       </li>
       <li>
        ISIS left Iraq and started fighting in Syria with the help of US (CIA) supplying weapons and support.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This is not Speculation. These are facts. I am sorry you were not made aware of this until now.

       Well, I could be thinking of a different guy. The fact is that the US started funding, Training, and weaponizing Terror groups.
       <br/>
       It should be no surprise that we continue to do so. That is what got NoName justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a ton of info around about all of this. Various boards various resources. This is something that I was into over 12 years ago, and not much into since. I am probably completely wrong about Bagdadi working directly with OBL, and in fact was a different person. But ISIS/Al Queda and OBL work in concert with each other to destabilize the area.

       and let's be honest in Afghanistan they (meaning the mujahideen) WERE freedom fighters in the battle against communism.

       take out the fakes...take out the military aircraft...take out the drones...take out the odd weather...and you are indeed left with evidence of UAP.

       but there's no conspiracy behind it...where that comes in is with the black military projects etc...

       my opinion on UAP is we simply don't know...I don't think it's 'aliens'...it may be demons lol...idk...but something has been there in the skies since history began to be recorded. I've got pretty much everything written in that field...it's what got me into conspiracy research in the first place...and that came from my old fella who was obsessed with back in the day.

There is evidence they were doing these tests back then. But barium in the sky that leaves comet tails? Kinda sounds like chemtrails.

       if there was a local afb then the odds are it was a black project and his 'handlers' didnt want jimothy drawings attentio to it.

       commonly available drones of today were probably being tested by the military 30 / 40 years ago...so i generally discount most of those sightings. The phoenix lights for example look like a classic drone formation.

       Some of your opinions are so odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of your substantial claims are in fact laughable and some of your laughable claims easily substantial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe laughable is the wrong term. Maybe less believable or researched?

       Sandy hook, the holy grail and catholicism are some I noticed.

       dude it wasnt a dick measuring post. and it wasnt supposed to have logical threads...simply how i feel about things...Montauk for example is incredibly out there...and there's little actual substance...i just 'feel' there's something there.
      </p>
      <p>
       sandy hook is clearly no conspiracy tho...i find that offensive...and i fail to see any reason for that conspiracy....i guess if one of the kids had seen something / been abused....i guess...but no.

      <p>
       'Maybe laughable is the wrong term. Maybe less believable or researched?'
      </p>
      <p>
       in most cases i'd say the opposite...the more i've researched some of these the less i find them credible.
      </p>
      <p>
       with the absolute glaring exception of the VIP / Elite paedophile stories...the more i see on that the worse it gets and the more it makes me see things in a different. for example - Theresa May is the PM because she was Home Secretary when a lot of the evidence bubbled up....18 months later and from outta nowhere she's Prime Minister and the abuse inquiry slowly dissolves to nothing!?

       This is a fairly good list. The only ones I'd urge you to reconsider are:
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandy Hook
      </p>
      <p>
       Moon Landings
      </p>
      <p>
       Denver airport
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that, I pretty much line up with you on the rest of them. I can shoot you some sources on those other topics if interested.
      </p>

       Cool post idea! (Not surprised how many downvotes you're getting for it).

       thanks dude...and yeah I fully expected the downvotes. all I want is the truth and if that messes up my paradigms then so be it. it's pretty obvious to me that the Zodiac killer is a hoax...there's no evidence linking any of the crimes together, the letters are all different etc etc...yet go to the zodiac sub and try and tell em that! only time I've ever reached double figures in downvotes!
      </p>
      <p>
       i'll look into those again then...and yeah I'd be very interested in the sources you mention. just don't see what the motivation would be for sandy hook...I don't buy the gun control thing...but I will look closer.

       the jonny gosch linkage is bullshit tho...danny heinreich killed him...i think bonacci was either a victim who used the media interest around Goschs case to protect himself or he was a victim brainwashed into being a patsy to make the linkage and so take the spotlight away from the actual case.

       similar examples is not the same thing as proof. like I say I've looked for it for years and never found anything indicating clear unambiguous support, funding or provision of arms to bin lade / al-Qaeda...those guys were ALWAYS hostile to the west - their spiritual leader is Sayyid Qutb who was preaching against the west as far back as the 50's.
      </p>
      <p>
       that said - yeah it's plausible...just don't let that 'plausible' slide into 'probable' due to people's political beliefs...
