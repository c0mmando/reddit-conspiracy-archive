       My family and everyone I came across reference my thoughts repeatedly no matter where I am. People on twitch reference my thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       They referenced sights seen through my eyes and felt through my body without my sub vocal words attached.
      </p>
      <p>
       They upload crafted dreams at night.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can invoke body and hearing symptoms wirelesly. It would take altering organ and cell functions to pull this off.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can play audio in your brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       They simply have deep control of the body and mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, they must have some sort of man made after life they keep secret to exclude undesirables.

       He never said that he didn't believe in the afterlife. Also, to think that a being or spirit of some magnitude wouldn't be unable to send you messages to you brain wireless is pretty shallow minded. It's been proven our brains have wifi capabilities.

       It could have been through hacked computer speakers for all I know. It happened once. Thought I still believe It can be through your head because I believe the elite have control of thr mind/body. That’s a conspiracy not schizophrenia.

       Let’s have a different discussion. Let’s say there is a man made afterlife. Christian religion tells us sinners go to hell and people who are saved go to heaven. Where would you have the worst criminals go? Where would you have autistic people go? Is there anyone you’d say needs to ceast existing?

       Don’t listen too much to the people in here, they don’t know as much as they think they do but they are trying to help you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, you need to come away from your strict beliefs until you have further prove. Don’t go linking and solidifying any thoughts about man made after life etc. unless you have studied such areas with theoretical material and have strong, physical proof for such a thing. 
One example that springs to mind is the chakra system, very real and easy to achieve physical proof. This is a good foundation for exploring the unknown and unseen side of things, as you can use it for an anchor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, your entire idea of the ‘after life’ is flawed. Autism is an Earthly issue, such a thing won’t even exist when the individual leaves the physical form when regressing inwards (or out, if the etheric body is developed). 
There are also a variety of things that can happen to you when your physical structure dies. Depends where you’ve come from and how far you are along Jacobs ladder.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sound young, best thing for you to do is understand and keep repeating to yourself that the only thing you know is nothing. Thus, keeping all thoughts in a fluid state - until hard proof is achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schizophrenia like everything, has its esoteric meanings and implications. Your mind can be broken down and re-tuned to pick up different signals. Without a proper teacher, be very cautious about believing your own thoughts. You may very well be receiving audio hallucinations, but how do you know it is a separate entity from you? Also, if it is, how do you know it has your best interests in mind? Positive and negative is in everything. It helps to achieve balance; many beings of existence align with the negative - you would perceive negative to be bad. So be cautious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe spend less time on Twitch, and start getting some physical exercise and a grounding meditation. Close up the thoughts and switch off the internal dialogue for a bit so you can see the world with less distortion and ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also one last thing, don’t go believing one religion over another. Every religion is full of half truths, with Hindu being the least distorted religion that is available to the masses. Heaven and Hell are two extremes. Somebody who raped a bunch of kids is not going to hell. Sorry but that just isn’t how things work. Karma is around though, unless you know how to work around it or rituals to clean yourself.

       This is rather dismissive because actually... it's been done and has been being experimented with since at least the 70's by using EMFs, and has been well documented in
       <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/687260.Mass_Control?from_search=true">
        this book

       . So, you're wrong. It IS possible because it's been done. Not saying that mental illness is not a possibility either though.

       Thank you. This is similar to what kind of stuff I think is happpening. Black Mirror type shit. I have a theory that there may be people playing in VR worlds while they sleep through slowed down realative time while others are stuck only in a world with 2018 level oculus VR technology. They would spend half their lives in this world doing normal jobs to maintain.

       I've found that the deeper I dive into the nature of reality the stranger it seems to get. It may simply be that the infinite nature of existence refuses to let itself be grasped/known so if you start getting to close it will throw a new mystery at you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally liken it to the Red Pill/Blue Pill paths in the Matrix. You could Blue Pill and not inquire further and be happy with life as it is, or you can Red Pill and see how far the rabbit hole goes. Just like in the movie the Matrix Neo (red pilled) can exist within the blue pill system without anyone suspecting, noticing, your Red Pill reality. While Neo could attempt to explain the whole red pill/matrix thing to the people within the matrix, this would probably result most people thinking he was crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an analogy though, not to infer any knowledge on whether such a system exist. It's simply meant to illustrate the difficulty you may find when speaking on or explaining this particular situation your in.

       My only and simple and response to your post is that nothing is impossible and none of us have sufficient evidence to say this is not impossible.the problem with a majority of the comments I see on posts like this, are the ones who automatically say it's a mental illness. Maybe, maybe not. Either way, keep thinking freely op.

       Yes, I believe I do know you! You are a part of me, as I am you. I don't always understand the synchronicity, but I know it. You do, too. Be gentle, allow yourself to trust, and say thank you often to those who give pure guidance. This life can be fun, especially for one's like you. You have gifts, and you must respect that...stay true to what is good, true, pure, and holy; and keep your mind there. All else fails into place.
