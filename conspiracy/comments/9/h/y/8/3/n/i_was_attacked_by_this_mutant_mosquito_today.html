       I was minding my own business today, smoking a cigarette in my garage when I was bit by this massive, mutant Mosquito.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was by far the most is painful mesquito bite I've ever had.  The sound of it alone, was something I've never experienced before. It sounded as loud as a bee flying around me before biting me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Z5rEOdI">
        comparison picture
       </a>
       of the normal Aedes albopictus breed of mesquito that we normally are used to here.
      </p>
      <p>
       This abnormally giant mesquito left a week the size of a half-dollar on me, and within an hour of being bit, my lymph nodes are noticable swollen, and I have a 102.5 degree fever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having lived in this area for all my life, 35 years, I've never, ever been there victim of such an aggressive, giant mesquito attack, let alone the almost immediate side effects I'm dealing with now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this a GM mesquito?  What is causing my body to all of a sudden put up it's defensive mechanism and cause my lymph nodes and fever?

       I'm just surprised that I've never been bit by one of these blood suckers before. As I said, I've been in this area my whole life and never had a mesquito that was as loud as bee (literally, I thought it was a bee or a horse fly) before in 35 years.  I've never had swollen lymph nodes or a fever from a bite either, although it could be completely unrelated to the bite also.

       I would not call fever and lymph node swelling "a normal reaction". I would definitely see a doctor asap. For the future - always keep tea tree oil around. If applied immediately, it prevents any type of reaction to insect bites ( it works for any insect bites, including fire ants"). I would also run to the pharmacy and get something along the lines of Benadryl, Emergen C, tee tree oil and bentonite. Load up on vita C, take a Benadryl (if not allergic to it/if it doesn't make you sick), mix bentonite with water and tea tree oil, apply to the spot. Once dried, re-apply.

       Fun fact: the government once dumped hundreds of thousands of mosquitoes over Georgia to test how quickly diseases such as malaria and dengue fever could spread. They were allegedly uninfected but who knows. All I know is there is still an ungodly amount of mosquitoes here in Georgia and it seems like the number continues to grow. I live only a few miles from a USDA test facility that tests the effects of certain insects and diseases on fruit and nut trees. The fact that it's do large yet virtually unnoticed by the population here blows my mind. I can't help but wonder what kind of shit that have had there or if anything has ever spread

       It's in Byron, ga. Between macon and Warner robins on interstate 75, so about 80 miles south of Atlanta. If you're heading south on 75, just past the overpass at the Byron exit, if you look to your left, youll see a fenced off area off of the side road and it's all USDA property. I'm sure you can see it on the Ariel view on maps too

       For more info on these studies, search up when the cia acted thru the smithsonian to research how fast they could spread bioweapons via bird migration.  This is quaint now of course, as nanotechnology is the new replacement for the bio carriers.

       I’m in TX and surprisingly this summer mosquitoes didn’t seem THAT bad. But after this last bout of rain we’ve had they’ve come out huge and aggressive. 
One snuck into my truck as I was loading my son (20 months) into the car seat. When we got to the grocery store about 5 minutes away, he had about 6 huge bites on him.

       I'm in WV, and the mesquitos have been pretty bad here, as we've had the wettest summer on record, but this was the first time (and hopefully the last time) I've ever come across this breed of them.

       What are you using as repellent?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve been throwing a few cloves of garlic in the shrubs right outside the front porch and it keeps them away. And since using garlic, I haven’t had any vampire problems either.

       I was trying everything in Colombia and I didn't have any luck with garlic.  My main goto was lavender oil spray and they just hated it.  Some people find tea tree oil to be repugnant but basically everyone is fine with lavender.  I won't travel again without a few vials of lavender essential oil and a few pouches of lavender to throw in my bags.  This will keep bed bugs, cockroaches, etc from hitching a ride in your bags.  It won't kill anything but it smells really icky to insects because it jams up their senses and it would probably kill them if they camped out right on top of it.

       Throw some pouches of lavender into the car and squeeze them once in a while.  The mosquitoes might pause for a moment before entering.  It screws up their senses and they flight around a bit drunk before exiting the area.

       Long ago a group of us fdirty hippies went to eat a 1:00AM breakfast at The Egg and I in HYannis Massachusetts.  Dave finished up his eggs and they right in the center of his styrofoam plate was a huge mosquito permanently sealed spreadeagled into it.  They had must have been waiting for just the right people.  It may have been the same kin you got bitten by.

       The man is also releasing mosquitoes with a bacteria in them that supposedly makes them infertile when they mate with another one.  So they are kindly admitting to putting manufactured mosquito tech out there.  Probably they are researching the hell out of all of this stuff for military defensive and offensive purposes and then they kicked down to us something that they feel is beneficial.  I don't like the idea of being injected with government produce mosquitoes.  I'm not having any of the government's injections whether it comes in the form of a hyperdermic needle or mosquito lips.
