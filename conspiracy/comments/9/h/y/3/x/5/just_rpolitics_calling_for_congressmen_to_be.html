       Since Reddit admins are on a subreddit banning spree, why not add
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       to the list? Here we have an upvoted comment calling for violence against Congressmen in protest if Trump decides to fire Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein. Notice that comment has avoided moderation for 12 hours as of posting this thread.

       The media and friends only care when the violence comes from right wing people. Antifa have been running around wearing face masks and attacking people and no one bats an eye lid. Apparently it's fine to punch a 'Nazi'. Nazi = anyone whose political opinion I disagree with.

       It wasn’t always that way either. I remember when
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       had, get this, a healthy environment where you could freely discuss political differences. When Ron Paul started to pick up a little bit of steam in 2012, the shills slooowly started to show up. It was all downhill from there.

       Yes, they are left-wing. The Democratic Party plants the seeds of socialism which are starting to sprout today. There is no left-wing movement without the Democratic Party. Replace the Central Committees of Communist parties of the past with titans of social media. The goals are the same. Their control over the populace, the economy, the schools, the culture, and the history books. They on top, you and me below.

       Bernie is a political nobody though. Hillary was the chosen candidate of the party since 2008. She isn't left-wing per se but her connections and interests align with them, pushing them forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Left-wing people should have voted for Trump given his populist, anti-war, and anti-globslist agenda that leftists were pushing for years. They never gave him that chance which proves to me that the American Left are Democrats. Some Bernie people may have defected but they aren't giving Trump credit today or in November despite doing what they wanted all along in many instances.

       It doesn’t. Though I’m not sure secret trials of American citizens not actively engaged in warfare against the us would be legal.

       It's only legal if the charges are related to treason and only if the President is choosing to use emergency Constitutional powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it is my belief that a criminal cabal has been waging war against us for decades, so I could understand using emergency powers. People who find military tribunals scary really have no idea how serious the NWO takeover had become.

        Do these powers require the state to be at war or can the president invoke them at any time?

       Any declared state of emergency will work. Trump added a new one last year under the premise of global corruption and human rights abuses.

      <blockquote>

        And you trust the state to sweep up only the guilty?

       Generally, no, but this would be one of the only ways to effectively deal with the problem once and for all. I would believe the results of the trials, they are not kangaroo courts. On the other hand, putting innocent people through that kind of nightmare would be injustice, even if they are acquitted. But if they are really guilty of treason, fuck them.

       Why do you believe secret military trials with no oversight would be fair?

       That depends on what kind of evidence they have. If a person legitimately sold out our country, then they deserve whatever happens and extreme measures might be justified. If they are innocent, then obviously that is the worst kind of injustice imaginable.

       That’s kind of the issue though isn’t it? Secret military trials don’t normally begin with the evidence being made public.

       Because it's not indicative of the subreddit. You're comparing a single pebble to a rockslide.

       Looking at the upvotes, it looks like a majority of the community agrees with the sentiment.

       I don't know. Calling for
       <em>
        mob violence
       </em>
       against elected officials just because you don't like the President is pretty fucking bad.

       Doesn't make it a majority opinion if it's still that low. Look at the post below it calling for peace, that has almost twice as many upvotes.

       It doesn’t. Though I’m not sure secret trials of American citizens not actively engaged in warfare against the us would be legal.

       I suppose you won’t answer the question but let’s give it a shot again.

      <p>
       Do you support the us government running a secret court, without oversight, putting citizens to death?
