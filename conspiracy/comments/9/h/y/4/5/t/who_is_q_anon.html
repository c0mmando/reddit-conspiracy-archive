     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       To start I would like to admit I did not follow the "Q Movement" up till recently
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been watching Cosmic Disclosure since it started. If you missed it on September 11th Corey Goode recently commented on Q Anon. Claiming Q Anon is DoD (Department of Defense) I thought that was strange as I watched it but let it go.
      </p>
      <p>
       When all the reddit banning went down. I started to think "what is up with this Q Anon stuff?" I randomly read this and that. Most of which seems like Pro-Trump nonsense, pushing patriotism and propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember hearing Joesph P. Farrell (On Dark Journalists) saying he thinks Q's native language wasn't english or Q Anon was some kind of AI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Ao-_gNI0grk">
        Simon Parkes
       </a>
       has come out saying Q is 4 men and an advanced AI.
      </p>
      <p>
       So by happenstance I stumbled on
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/erviewer">
        Edward Riordan
       </a>
       A trained remote veiwer who was given a blind target that ended up being Q Anon. He admits the info may be wrong. Remote viewing is not 100%. However if you watch his videos it's freaky how well the RV lines up with the previously claimed statements. At one point he sees a group of men talking in a very secure location. Discussing how to get information out about transformative advanced technology. Two lines that stand out to me "We found it!" &amp; "It reminds me of 2001 a space odyssey"
      </p>
      <p>
       8 days after Corey Goode claimed Q anon is DoD, Q Anon makes a post confirming the secret space program on September 19th. (Incase you didn't know Corey claims to of worked in the secret space program)
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads one to believe Q Anon is a small collection of people along side an artificial intellegence working to disseminate information about transformative advanced technology and the secret space program.

      <p>
       My theory on Q and Wikileaks is one an the same- accept every member of the team is being headhunted...
      </p>
      <p>
       Imho
      </p>
      <p>
       Julian Assange is a special agent of ASIS. (Which is likely, apart of the 5 eyes alliance)-
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that Wikileaks is a likely NSA working group potentially known as project vigilant-
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory: Project Vigilant was tasked with addressing an information leak with Bureau 121. A Hacking group national to North Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short North Korean hackers are who compromised HRC-
      </p>
      <p>
       Project vigilant was a two part mission-
      </p>
      <p>
       Agents within this NSA group are being tasked with both continuing, the continuity of government; as well as placing criminal or social redlines on the criminal parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       HRC committed multiple crimes in office to appease the Obama administrations directives-
      </p>
      <p>
       Bureau 121 had verifiable proof of these crimes-
      </p>
      <p>
       (However due to international opposition and rank they choose to distribute this information to russia).
      </p>
      <p>
       A NSA task force working with 5eyes intel soon formed 'Wikileaks'-
      </p>
      <p>
       After utilizing a short lived test model known as: DC Leaks, which was used to release information in a controlled environment, to take easing off the initial bureau 121 Hack-
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA only cares about continuity of government- They overview all western communications-
      </p>
      <p>
       It was during obamas presidency that these leaks would prove: illegal occupancy in syria- the administrations backing of mercenary groups (i.e isis)- as well as the uranium one fiasco, haiti, and potentially 9/11-
      </p>
      <p>
       Distributing the leaks to the public (at once) would have lead to world anarchy-
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly following wikileaks erection, the CIA (unaware of the NSA's participation), breached the group. Meet Adrian Lamo- Rip-
      </p>
      <p>
       The cia used Lamo to attack the first 'planned-leaker' to the projects order- (Manning)-
      </p>
      <p>
       At that time another leaker came forward with information pertaining to the dnc leak. (Seth rich).
      </p>
      <p>
       This was an unplanned leak which showed a concerted effort by the obama administration to violate the smooth transition of presidency act-
      </p>
      <p>
       It was because the information was a threat to continuity of government that the NSA continued to engage in project vigilant-
      </p>
      <p>
       Julian Assange became an international facecard for a prominent intelligence gathering institution; Which lead to the obama administration pursing him as an enemy of the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama amd HRC used GCHQ to monitor Julian and due to a planned distribution of proof- GCHQ went into the embassy to place an arrest on Julian Assange-
      </p>
      <p>
       It was during this arrest that assange attempted to provide documentation of his security clearance's and right to produce leaks-
      </p>
      <p>
       However, during the confrontation and due to the magnitude of the leaks / in addition to the intelligence gathered; GCHQ likely (and accidentally) engaged the target (Julian assange).
      </p>
      <p>
       Firing a single bullet (or more) into his body.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason this was likely not mentioned to the public-
      </p>
      <p>
       The Ecuadorian Embassy is a foreign nations soil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Killing assange opens a wartime engagement between all allies of ecuador by the invading parties. (I.e. The united states and brittan vs. Ecuador, russia, china, iran, venezuala).
      </p>
      <p>
       So killing assange within the embassy is/was a known act of war-
      </p>
      <p>
       This lead to multiple 'falsifications of POL during the election'. Hence Julians PGP being missing since october/2016-
      </p>
      <p>
       Embassy cats twitter was also offline for several months following the 'initial /suspected raid' further proving that assange was not in control of his accounts prior to this date.
      </p>
      <p>
       It likely took multiple 'legal-steps' to gain access of that twitter account. Hence it going back online only after the election was over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The day assange (potentially died) is the very same day that HRC lost the election (behind closed doors).
      </p>
      <p>
       While wikileaks is now a ghosted agency, being controlled by the cia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Project vigilant is still active using the 'Q' phantom/anon as its newest vehicle to articulate the material to the masses...
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why wikileaks staff members stated they were no longer in control of wikileaks, and told users 'not to send in links'-
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is it was obamas minions and crimes that everyone attempted to erase-
      </p>
      <p>
       Now these specific situations are being approached by mueller, and acting parties; which seek to 'demote their validity'.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is basically a 'cleanup job' fixing HRC's / bogus actions. (I.e. using illegal / insecure devices) which lead to multiple crimes coming to light to the general public-
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope the FBI arrests Clinton and Obama-
      </p>
      <p>
       They are no longer employeed by the criminal cartel in which they were, amd their reputation to the public is permanently soiled for their standing down on multiple federal crimes-
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a new world now-
      </p>
      <p>
       We can correct the record- Godspeed, guys-
      </p>
      <p>
       Imho Comey took a bullet to change the entirety of the world. He wasn't a patsy, more then a man being caught between a rock and a hardspot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump needs to come out with thefull truth-
      </p>
      <p>
       The charade / sideshow is nothing more then a public theater- designed to keep the public at bay- however it will allow all these snakes to walk free-
      </p>
      <p>
       They are afraid of what people like HRC can state on the record during an open trial (to anger the public)- (as she is a person 'in-the-know')-
      </p>
      <p>
       She will use all information gained via her past position as Secretary of state, as leverage to avoid an arrest-
      </p>
      <p>
       This creates an avenue of protection for her-
      </p>
      <p>
       P.s. there is no such thing as: "The Deep State"
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop saying that-
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that: everyone in government is known-
      </p>
      <p>
       Start being specific-
      </p>
      <p>
       Specific people are fucking with you- Specific people are covering up crimes- Specific people deserve and have earned jail time-
      </p>
      <p>
       Our accounting it to being some shadowy orginazation is pathetic-
      </p>
      <p>
       These are real criminals, getting away with real crimes-
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is doing his best to follow the narratives which will be best for american continuity-
      </p>
      <p>
       However overlooking treason of this magnitude is a violation of public trust- It is an insult to you, your family and every living prisoner in every jail in america-
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not offer them your leniency--
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand the full truth, and arrests of all participating criminals-
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand justice for assange and seth rich- Demand justice for the deceit you have been saturated in-
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand justice for america-
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand a better tomorrow then today had ever been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it is your children that are inheriting this world-
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing more, and nothing less-
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl/Dr
      </p>
      <p>
       Assanges death was caused by an accidental coup between the NSA and CIA because HRC couldnt be bothered to read a memo about hacking / protocol safety measures in 2013

       I've been "with" The Great Awakening since the start. And no they have not. Claimed to be yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q could be everything from a group of geeks who started out as a LARP to someone in some intelligence agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it doesn't really matter now because what I have seen is a lot bigger, the people gathered together for a common goal, the truth, to bring down the evil corrupt sick people in higher places and eventually all places.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a better future. And because of that - I don't really think about who Q is or what Q is. Sure would be fun to know but at this point it feels like it doesn't matter. It is WE, THE PEOPLE.

       Military is a very basic identifier I mean past or present? Honorable or DIShonorable discharge? It could explain many women and men that held that title at one time or again could be absolute rubbish anyway. So many questions...

       Grammar not you strong point is it? Insults coming from someone that by the sounds of your post came from a genius that REALLY believes you spell Patreut...well nevermind I would hate to make fun of those intellectually challenged. Nah forget it google is at the tips of your sausage fingers use it and learn a thing or two before you come around playing sheriff conspiracy over your creepy obsession with the biggest joke to ever come from the chans yet...and that is saying something as there have been a few golden nuggets to come at the expense of sages like yourself. Stick to the plan!!

       It's funny how until recently everyone was talking about A.I. as if it's something we're working towards.  Now, it just seems like the media is just acting like it was always here.  Oh you know, that A.I....
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently Elon's interview with Joe Rogan, he had a very pessimistic view, like it's too late.  Giving me the impression that he knows that A.I. is already here and is already unleashed.  It's not a huge stretch of the imagination that A.I. wouldn't just be given to the world freely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think A.I. is already here and it's very likely that Q/Q team has access to this A.I.  When you read all the connections that Q has alluded to, in my mind, only an A.I. would be able to find all that information across the internet.  Basically I think the A.I. found all the available connections on the internet, catalogued them, and then gave the anons the keywords to find that information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's probably the forecast modeling that can give probabilities of certain events happening, etc.  Anyway, I don't think you're entirely crazy.

       Elon had a very pessimistic view up until he said one thing. Elon and Joe we're talking about how monkey seem like this crazy Savage destructive community but us humans (being superior in intellect) dont seek to destroy the apes. Infact we, more or less, don't even realize they exist untill we see them on TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see why A.I. would try to murder all humans. We don't require the same resources. If anything they would just build a space shuttle and float untill the reached where ever they want. They have no life span. It just doesn't make sense to me.

       I honestly think Edward Riordan is correct about QAnon being a small part of something much bigger comming. So the which Q posts are more important question is hard to awnser. Whats really going on? What should we do? I don't think anyone really knows.

       Q (whom is to believed to be 1 or more people?) doesn’t drop facts as much as breadcrumbs in the form of questions. In fact, there are more questions then answers from what I recall. Once these questions are asked, Q researchers follow those breadcrumbs and often times, in attempting to answer these questions, bring facts to light. It’s a very clever leaking scheme.
