        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I had a nice, younger Comcast tech from the Dominican Republic work on my service yesterday. Pretty normal talk about what got screwed up and then all of a sudden he’s talking about 9/11 being bullshit. I was like, woah to myself and then obviously having decent knowledge on the topic, I got into it with him. I can’t even recall what really lead to it, but he started talking about the planes not being intercepted that day and how it was BS. Got into the shadiness of the towers coming down. We branched out to a few more topics as well, including the social divide in this country. He said, if he’s in a home that’s left leaning and he puts FOX News on just to check things, they’d say, &quot;Oh no we don’t allow that channel on in this house&quot;, or something to that effect. Lmao. I told him to check out James Corbett, as he’s done some great pieces on 9/11 before he left and mentioned that recent &quot;War Games&quot; one he did, so he could delve deeper into the air traffic shenanigans that day. </p>

<p>TL;DR... I was pleasantly surprised when a young Comcast technician was working on my service and who at first glance didn’t really fit the bill in my eyes, turned out to be very woke. It was a good day. </p>

What we need to do is not lose that momentum when it’s the side you like more that’s in power. Vote third party.

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder.  Is Comcast monitoring your browsing habits and has classified you as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; and potential threat?  Did the technician have knowledge of this and thought to play around with you regarding this?  I think many of the service representatives and technicians you deal with who work for telecommunications companies aren&#39;t necessarily on our side.  Maybe paranoia-maybe not, but whereas many of them are working in foreign nations, they have no loyalty to the people they have to deal with on the phone.</p>

<p>I had a Comcast installer come to hook up new internet service, and the very day he installed it, my computer malfunctioned ever after.  It would constantly freeze up when loading pages.</p>

<p>TLDR: Don&#39;t put too much trust in Comcast representatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone that has worked for a couple of different ISPs, I can reassure you they have neither the logistical competence nor loyal enough workers to pull off an effective idea manipulation scheme of the complexity proposed.</p>

<p>Comcast, specifically, barely has a functioning call note system or Customer Data Retrieval system. They are also heavy users of the &#39;lowest bidder&#39; philosophy, and let me tell you, the average Outsourced call center worker isn&#39;t going to give two fucks about sending out a specific tech to a specific person marked as a conspiracy theorists. They barely give enough fucks to not just press random buttons during warm transfers - and that level of fuck-giving isn&#39;t even present in all of them.</p>
