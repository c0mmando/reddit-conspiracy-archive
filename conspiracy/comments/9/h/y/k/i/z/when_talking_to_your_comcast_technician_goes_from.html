       I had a nice, younger Comcast tech from the Dominican Republic work on my service yesterday. Pretty normal talk about what got screwed up and then all of a sudden he’s talking about 9/11 being bullshit. I was like, woah to myself and then obviously having decent knowledge on the topic, I got into it with him. I can’t even recall what really lead to it, but he started talking about the planes not being intercepted that day and how it was BS. Got into the shadiness of the towers coming down. We branched out to a few more topics as well, including the social divide in this country. He said, if he’s in a home that’s left leaning and he puts FOX News on just to check things, they’d say, "Oh no we don’t allow that channel on in this house", or something to that effect. Lmao. I told him to check out James Corbett, as he’s done some great pieces on 9/11 before he left and mentioned that recent "War Games" one he did, so he could delve deeper into the air traffic shenanigans that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR... I was pleasantly surprised when a young Comcast technician was working on my service and who at first glance didn’t really fit the bill in my eyes, turned out to be very woke. It was a good day.

       That's why they have to control 'public sentiment' on the internet.  If everyone realizes were the majority, heads will roll.  Trump is the first obvious manifestation of social media/the news not only not being accurate but actively lying for six months about the forerunner.

       So far “conspiracy theories” have been highly weaponixed by tptb and are a still-useful tool for stoking the flames of the partisan divide (and conquer). What we need to do is not lose that momentum when it’s the side you like more that’s in power. Vote third party. Side with the average “crazies” of the other side of the political spectrum over the leaders of your own.

       There were Con Edison workers outside my house, I heard them talking about the War on Terror, the Trump-Russia bullshit, Benghazi, Assad and chemical weapons, Israel, tech spying, etc. It was like they've been reading /conspiracy. The word is spreading, mainstream normies are starting to realize what's going on. It is no wonder the tech companies are trying to censor everything lately.

       That's really cool, I find that to be a great example of how many people are actually seeing the truth but a lot aren't willing to be the one to break the ice. I've had a couple similar occurances with people and it's awesome to experience. Both people involved get to air it all out and not feel ridiculed.

       Taking a cab home on a Friday night in London is like taking a crash course in football (the normal football), economics and politics. Cabbies know it all. If, instead, you decide to take a Minicab, you’ll learn everything there’s to know about Pakistan.

       Yeah, I did explain to him how our government is filled with dual citizens that have Israel’s best interest in mind, not ours and how the wars we’ve engaged in the Middle East benefit Israel. He didn’t know about some of the deeper stuff, but he’s on the right track at least.

       It's not filled but it's got some in places where it can compartmentalized instructions to get 10x the work handed off and accomplished for a greater goal.  It's zionism, Biden is an admitted Zionist.  They put israel above all, great to have one for a VP

       I wonder.  Is Comcast monitoring your browsing habits and has classified you as a "conspiracy theorist" and potential threat?  Did the technician have knowledge of this and thought to play around with you regarding this?  I think many of the service representatives and technicians you deal with who work for telecommunications companies aren't necessarily on our side.  Maybe paranoia-maybe not, but whereas many of them are working in foreign nations, they have no loyalty to the people they have to deal with on the phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a Comcast installer come to hook up new internet service, and the very day he installed it, my computer malfunctioned ever after.  It would constantly freeze up when loading pages.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: Don't put too much trust in Comcast representatives.

       As someone that has worked for a couple of different ISPs, I can reassure you they have neither the logistical competence nor loyal enough workers to pull off an effective idea manipulation scheme of the complexity proposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comcast, specifically, barely has a functioning call note system or Customer Data Retrieval system. They are also heavy users of the 'lowest bidder' philosophy, and let me tell you, the average Outsourced call center worker isn't going to give two fucks about sending out a specific tech to a specific person marked as a conspiracy theorists. They barely give enough fucks to not just press random buttons during warm transfers - and that level of fuck-giving isn't even present in all of them.

       I did phone based support for Comcast. It paid 9 bucks an hour. No one gave a shit about anything except routing customers to avoid dealing with them.

       I'd think there'd be enough abuse from customers that they'd have to pay more than that.

       Well it’s my family’s account, not mine. I’m just home visiting. I mean he was in his early 20’s and makes 35-50K including over time. I didn’t get the impression that he was scoping out the scene, but who knows? He also engaged in other non conspiracy related topics and came across as pretty genuine. Very polite as well.

       Good to hear some other accounts of random people being awoke. There’s a glimmer of hope.

       I have had some AWESOME conversations with my Uber/Lyft drivers, who are immigrants!

       When you ask about "where they are from?" and what's it like there ... people from Croatia/Syria/Jordan are seriously WOKE, when it comes to the "unofficial activities" of the US government!
