    <div class="md"><p>Everybody deals with it in their own way. I choose not to talk to people about all this stuff to people, and that allows me to be woke and still live a normal life. Some of this stuff is pretty dark and disturbing, and if I think so, imagine what a normie would think. I don’t suggest living with this knowledge to anyone, because I care about them. The choice to know should be your own.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh so I see you’re trying to take the cypher route (matrix reference). Good luck with that. I wish there was something to help but it seems like the only thing that will make you forget what you have learned at this point is lobotomy. Only other advice I can give you is just don’t read any of it anymore. This information will always be talked about and you can visit whenever you want if you want to learn more. But if you yourself are unhappy then just take steps to reduce the amount of negative information that you’re taking in all the time. I’m trying to work on this myself but it’s very hard. I know I have a really extreme Internet addiction. Maybe delete Reddit and other apps that you use to check News on your phone? Good luck. But once you see, you cannot unsee. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be onto &quot;application&quot; phase.  Saturated with info, time to move that energy out.  Mediation, religion, community service, stuff like that.</p>

<p>Too many on this sub put the burden of action on those who know.  And while knowledge brings responsibility, it doesn&#39;t require direct application.  Knowing about child trafficking does not mean vigilante justice is required.  But maybe it leads one to help at a local under-priviledged school.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the CIA is doing their job perfectly then. Because as long as you can’t distinguish truth from falsehood, you’ll never have a definitive opinion on anything, thus you most likely won’t take action because of your uncertainty. Also the fact still rings true that if you want to know who is in control, just look at what you’re not allowed to talk about. A channel with 30 K views could very well have the truth to what is going on but could just be limited by the reach of their message based on VPN restrictions and other bullshit that’s destroying the Internet now. Plus it’s been pointed out on several occasions now how scripted mainstream media is. At the end of the day, you follow what you want to follow. But if “facts” aren’t lining up with reality, maybe look at who or what powers are trying to instill those “facts.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try instead developing your own intuition.  What I have learned from all of this , is that I can not rely on anything exterior for truth - I have learned instead to start listening to myself... follow my own heart. The news used to manipulate my emotions.. give me thoughts or prejudice that were not my own. The news can not do that to me anymore. So for me, this path has given me more peace. The news teaches us to fear- but when I walk outside my door the world actually does not look so scary. I focus on what I see with my own eyes more now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Turn on news, Facebook or other social site and then believe everything that seems popular. Focus efforts of life towards those views. Problem solved. </p>

<p>Or just get friends and dedicate but a small portion of your brain into things that are hidden, or will never be explained to the lament. Really it’s all about expectation management, what can you handle that takes up time from your life. Is life worth investing in, or is information that may or may not be accurate worth it more worth more time to be invested.  </p>

<p>I suggest being a boss, just juggle is all. Perfectly normal on the outside, have time for everyone and everything you love, plus be a nerd with secrets on the side. You decide ! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do whatever you feel is right, if you&#39;ve been interested in the world of conspiracies for a year then you have just begun.</p>

<p>Study the history of secret societies and fraternal organizations. Did you know George Washington wrote a letter about the Illuminati? Did you know NASA is filled with freemasons and Masonic symbology?</p>

<p>Study history and new chronology by Fomenko, did you know mathematical analysis of historical texts and maps indicate there could have been an entire rewriting of our history in the 1600s? Do you know what scaligerian chronology is? </p>

<p>There are like 20 more insanely interesting topics like this you can learn about the world and history through exploring &quot;conspiracies&quot;. </p>
