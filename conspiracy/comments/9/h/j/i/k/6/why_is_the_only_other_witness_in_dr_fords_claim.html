       I find it strange that she can’t remember a location of where this attempted rape took place, and can’t remember a date when it happened. She never told a soul till 2012 and even then never mentioned Brett Kavanaughs name in the therapy notes until she sent that secret anonymous letter to the Democrats whom never mentioned it once to Brett during his private interviews and live television interviews.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why is it she can’t remember key details but she remembers a witness after never mentioning this to a soul named Mark Judge whom just happens to be a published author where you can cite his books as “evidence”. Which is what I’ve already seen people on the internet doing.

       It makes me fearful for all men (and I'm a woman). It seems that any woman can cry sexual assault from 35 years ago, and ruin a man's career and life. That is very scary.

       It doesn't matter to me whether a man is Republican or Democrat. I have a problem with women who wait years before speaking out. This includes Harvey Weinstein. I have a problem with all those women who waited years before speaking out against him. Many of them clearly benefited by staying silent.

       No? Well, then surely, you are still annoyed by the way Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland and let Donald Trump install Neil Gorsuch (from the same prep school at Brett Kavanaugh btw), right?

       Not sure why they benefit from silence? The aggressor is the beneficiary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless the problem is that they feel pressured to stay silent for fear of retribution, right? These women feel afraid to speak out therefore they don’t. The whole idea of the movement is to help victims feel less social pressure allowing them the opportunity to speak out.

       To be fair some went almost immediately after it happened to the Police but it was suppressed in the Harvey Case. A better example would be Bill Cosby. Now those Women waited years. They all had no problem with it because he was a somebody and probably wanted his kids.

       When shit like that comes up, I always think CIA disinfo immediately. It's just another "trutherism", like what happened to the 9/11 investigations. They see people with legit questions or a verifiable incident gaining traction, they gotta send out "distraction artists" to flood out the real deal. So you take a bunch of unrelated incidents, both false and real, and staple them together then give it a hashtag (hmm, that sounds like something I heard before too, say around August 2014?) to derail support of the people who were definitely onto something. (How convenient it exploded the way it did after the DiGra link to DARPA sociological experiments was found....)

       Finally a women who agrees with that point of view on the Internet. Especially on Reddit. And just imagine 30 years from now in the future. Brett has the added bonus of no internet/social media being around then. Can you imagine those idiots subpoenaing 30+ year old Facebook/Twitter information? Now some men like Bill Clinton and President Trump these random claims are believable, but with guys like Brett Kavanaugh who aren’t womanizers and with a letter from everyone whom he’s dated in his life time refute these claims.

       I currently work in survivor support. It frequently takes years or decades for people who have been abused to come forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't come forward immediately because they're often ashamed of what has happened to them (even blaming themselves); afraid of not being believed (and/or being attacked or derided by their communities); and because the adversarial legal process is pretty much guaranteed to be an awful experience for them even if the perpetrator isn't comparatively powerful (which they frequently are).
      </p>
      <p>
       Comments in this thread are pretty much a case in point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can also see some familiar names in here who would be very accepting of abuse claims (albeit without accusers/victims), and accepting of a much lower standard of evidence and testimony when it aligns with their political ideology.

       As for the rest of it, you're not hearing them out by jumping the gun on this.  Its only just started, and this is politics.  It's foolish to back the accuser 100% right off the bat because people have been traumatized.  That can be faked, or more accurately, it can be bought.

       Do you think the lady that bill clinton raped and then had hilary defend him remembers where she was raped?

       I think so.  No repressed memory there.

       I never admitted anything. Just pointed out the similarities between what she couldn't remember about a "party" 35 years ago with the fact that a majority of people have had to deal with the same thing in their party years. Hell, I don't remember how I got home a few weeks ago on my birthday.

       Ill admit this...I think shes lying through her teeth and getting used by high level people in the "resistance" movement. Which makes me feel bad for her now. Her life, no matter what comes of this Circus, is ruined. I feel sad for her.  Ill attempt shes a victim now, another victim created by the Democrats as a pawn to Victimize another person.

       I personally think it’s a Hail Mary pass to stop Kavanaugh from becoming a SC Judge. If this were any other situation it would be a non-story and the statute of limitations would make anything she said irrelevant. But there was a strong push by the left to stop this S.C. nomination and now we have a huge story of a “rape victim” being unable to get justice for the crimes committed against her....even though it was an “attempted rape”...with no evidence...and hasn’t been mentioned ever for almost 30 years...

       No, no, it's not "Hail Mary pass attempt", it's just "Hail Mary pass." It's a reference to American football, which is a sport that is very popular in America.

       I wonder what you call it when for the first time in American history a popularly elected president gets no advice and consent whatsoever before an election because 'we need to let the people decide.' That's called judicial activism. We have a "Justice" on the Supreme Court who was literally the product of judicial activism and he claims to be against it. The hypocrisy of the past few years is unsurpassed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking about Neil Gorsuch. Has anyone read his 5-4 decision taking away the rights of workers to sue employers or even to join in arbitration? Pure oligarchy. And the decision would hot have come down against workers had Mitch McConnell not judicially activated a new rule that is not in the Constitution.

       Creating new imaginary rules out of the Constitution is judicial activism. When you do so to install a reactionary SCOTUS justice, that certainly fits.

       I'm glad we may agree that Republicans do lots of judicial activism or legislating from the bench, as we both know that
       <em>
        Roe v. Wade

       In all seriousness: Democrats should have never brought this women out with zero evidence. They've destroyed the life of what is clearly a sick/disturbed person that did not want to be identified and clearly does not want to testify. Her friends don't even want to deal with this anymore. Nice going Democrats.

       If she made the story up, why involved a third person at all? If she had claimed that she and Kavanaugh were alone when the rape attempt happened, it would have been more of a 50% she said/he said. Including Judge in the story just gives someone the chance to refute the incident or remember it differently.

       Traumatized or not, her case would not get standing in court, because in court the burden of evidence is on the accuser. If she accuses Kavanaugh of sexual harrasment, it's on her to bring sufficient evidence to court. And there's good reason for this practice, as proving a negative is almost always impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, they went with the court of public opinion, and that doesn't have these pesky rigorous standards for evidence. She can accuse all she wants and Kavanaugh can't defend himself. I think it's obvious for the neutral observer that her actions were not the right way of dealing with this, trauma or not.

       It makes sense that she would also be a CIA Operative as well solely because she has no online foot print that’s traceable. We only have 1 image of her (that I’ve seen) floating around on the Internet.

       I believe her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, on her not remembering the exact date or place, that’s not a problem for me. I’m younger than Ford, and I don’t remember basically any specific dates or places from my teen years. For example, I know how old I was when I first had sex, and I remember some hilarious embarrassing details, but I don’t know what month it was, or exactly where it happened. It makes perfect sense to me that she wouldn’t talk about it much, too. It was obviously a traumatic event, but she did get away, and Kavanaugh is only recently a household name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, there’s just no good reason for her to make this up. She’s a successful professional with a family, and she knew that if this went public it would turn her life upside down, and it has. If Kavanaugh didn’t attack her, then she doesn’t have any more personal stake in Kavanaugh’s appointment than I do, and I know I wouldn’t come forward with a false accusation and jeopardize everything I have.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can make an argument that the Democrats are cynically using this to their advantage, but I don’t think there’s a strong argument to be made that Ford herself is being dishonest. Anyway, none of this should change anyone’s mind in the Grab Them By the Pussy Era.

       Not remembering events is one thing but this lady accused a innocent man of a crime. All to stop his confirmation. You need the exact place to prove the place exists, and you need a date to start tracking down eye witnesses. She mentioned 2 other people there besides Mark Judge. Who are they? Why is Mark Judge the only person she remembers whom just happens to talk about his sex life in his books?

      <p>
       There is plenty of good reasons for her to make this up. She would be a hero to the Leftists and Democrat Elites who hate Trump if she successfully stops or stalls his nomination long enough for midterms. And she would get her own Book signing deals and a appearance on 60 minutes. She’s already profited heavily thanks to GoFundMe by making $90,000 to a case with almost no details.
      </p>
      <p>
       She’s also demanding Kavanaugh not be in the room and that he goes 1st. If Brett was Drunk like she claims he was it’s actually her duty to refresh his memory.

       Friend, that is not profiting heavily. $90k is not enough to deal with doxxing and death threats, not by a long shot. Personally I’m not sure you could offer me enough money to put my family in danger.

       No. A victim of sexual assault does not have a “duty” to refresh her attacker’s memory. That’s completely arbitrary.

      <p>
       What she’s going to do, hopefully, is tell her story. Kavanaugh, probably, will contradict her. We and the Senate Judiciary Committee will all have to weigh both stories and decide which we think is more likely: that Ford, a respected university professor who passed a polygraph test, is telling the truth about a painful and all-too-common sexual assault that occurred when she was fifteen years old; or that she’s a liar who out of the blue decided now was a good time to risk her career and family to derail a Supreme Court nominee and maybe get a book deal. I know which story I think is more plausible.

        Beyond that, there’s just no good reason for her to make this up. She’s a successful professional with a family, and she knew that if this went public it would turn her life upside down, and it has. If Kavanaugh didn’t attack her, then she doesn’t have any more personal stake in Kavanaugh’s appointment than I do, and I know I wouldn’t come forward with a false accusation and jeopardize everything I have.

       There is though. She clearly aligns with the political opposition. She's sacrificing her private life to deal a blow to the republicans.

      <p>
       There is no statute of limitations on attempted rape in Maryland. It is a criminal case, though, so there would still be no legal cost to Ford. The costs she’s paying are psychological. And, she probably has to hire security now.

       Not sure why they benefit from silence? The aggressor is the beneficiary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless the problem is that they feel pressured to stay silent for fear of retribution, right? These women feel afraid to speak out therefore they don’t. The whole idea of the movement is to help victims feel less social pressure allowing them the opportunity to speak out.

       To be fair some went almost immediately after it happened to the Police but it was suppressed in the Harvey Case. A better example would be Bill Cosby. Now those Women waited years. They all had no problem with it because he was a somebody and probably wanted his kids.
