    <div class="md"><p>The same can be said of other currencies and asset classes, the only difference is the level of volatility.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies will become more stable / less volatile as adoption and liquidity increases.</p>

<p>My biggest concern with crypto, is that much of it is deflationary by design. <strong>If</strong> Bitcoin were to become the most widely adopted currency worldwide at some point in the future, people would soon be aware that the value of 1 Bitcoin is always going to increase. This would dissuade people from actually spending any as it will be worth more in future. If nobody is spending any money, then global production would collapse.</p>

<p>Of course not all cryptos are deflationary, but who in their right mind would adopt crypto which doesnt increase in value (or even decreases) when currencies like Bitcoin are almost guaranteed to become more valuable over time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think about it, the similarities between cryptocurrency and the nwo style &quot;credits&quot; we see in shows like star wars, it seems highly likely that bitcoin was created as a precursor to this &quot;credit&quot; system. All systems that come with the ability to ultimately control people.   </p>

<p>The guy who created bitcoin is quite a mystery, but there is a little information about him, it all seems to be shrouded in secrecy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It may be boring but it&#39;s impressive that Goodman apparently succeeded where others have failed. While Dorian S. Nakamoto refused to talk at length with her, she did interview many people in his life, including his brothers, children, ex-wife, and former colleagues, all of whom found the idea that he is Bitcoin&#39;s creator compelling given his libertarian views, background as a computer engineer and work on classified military projects. </p>
