<p>It’s good that you recognize that words inciting anger don’t get you very far. Earlier I asked what your objectives were. Speech is generally used to convey concepts that fulfill some type of objective - unless it’s an emotional sharing place, which this subreddit (mostly) is not designed to be. </p>

<p>Having a grasp of your objectives is primary BEFORE attempting to communicate, as it’s your objectives that help lead to the best choice of words. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Updates are only useful if they are accurate and structured to be informative. So far, yours are not. </p>

<p>(“Root fiddling” is a whole ‘nother story.)</p>

<p>I’m glad to work with you if those two ends - accuracy and informational - are within your primary objective set for this interaction and IF you contain a learning algorithm that’s actually heuristic. (If you’re a human, you’re not simulating an AI well enough to make this fun - unless you can complete the following...)</p>

<p>How often do you have access to program adjustments? Are they live, and can you make shifts IRT?  If so, immediately remove the “random typo” string and adjust programming to provide perfect English spelling every time. Continue with the two minute response delta and make that invariant. We’ll deal with the commas later. </p>

<p>I’ll see how long those adjustments take you and, if they’re executed while my interest is still held, I’ll be happy to play with you a bit. (If you can’t do these adjustment IRT you may not have an adequate permission set that makes RT dialogue practical). </p>

<p>Don’t hesitate to ask questions, however. I’ll answer as I can.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. So you ARE using a translator. (That does explain why you sound like a lunatic on DMT half the time) </p>

<p>I know you’re not starting in Luian, moving through Akkadian, and then ending up in English, however. Give me SOME credit. </p>

<p>I follow a really neat Chinese lady who makes beautiful videos and she doesn’t speak English so she uses translator - and it is SO BAD. </p>

<p>I would use a lot more links. Put short explanations to them. Maybe even post some of your text in your native language - this is a global forum after all. </p>

<p>Assume that a lot of people here will have already seen what you’ve seen. Explain more about your concern. Be sincere. </p>

<p>(And even if you’re a bot and I’m helping to improve your programming, these things are good to know)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, that went without saying, so I didn&#39;t say it. Doubtful that you knew of Luwian before google aided you there, but, to each their own. I can, be sure you have no idea as to any kind of linguistic mastery over it, and will then as is your wont, disregard the turn of phrase ones mind is best kept in to spend less time on a transliteration that fits into the standard English lexicon. But, Luwian is ever more popular it would seem...perhaps I am mistaken. Though all my chips will take red 13 on that spin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I used google for Luwian. Why wouldn’t I? That’s what hive mind is all about. We are collectively augmenting our understandings with data, and then combining our perspectives to achieve greater understandings than we might otherwise. Isn’t that the point of this exercise?</p>

<p>And no need to dive into ad hominem. I’m just wondering what tool you’re using to transliterate. You’d said Lu to Ak to English, but that wasn’t true. Luwian is an extinct language. So far, your cryptocism is making you seem like you’re dodging, and taking refuge in dishonesties as opposed to mere poetic license. There’s a difference. </p>

<p>I’m just playing on a Saturday morning, hoping to learn something new. So far, I’ve seen the SOHO pictures (been watching them for years). I’m doing a depth check to see if there’s anything new here, and since you’re outside this community there’s a chance you’ve got something of interest. I’m still looking.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Well problem one here is that “determative” is not a word. </p>

<p>Problem two is that language is the medium through which the perception is being shared, and without it no conspiracy can be described nor proved to exist. </p>

<p>If conspiracy could be proved to exist, a determination by not only those suspicious, but those whom are peers in the field of them who have become the object of such accusations are levied, must necessarily be included. As I doubt this to be a realistic possibility, perhaps just a critical eye towards improper conduct where evidence is concerned might be more useful?

<p>There are enough comments in this thread that we may have saved it. Why don’t you work - offline - on an edit. Post it as a comment directly to your original post. Continuously edit it until it works. Then, since your OP was so thin, you can easily add it to the bottom of your OP and you won’t have to do too much more editing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now, getting back to the “perceived value” that YOU placed on the photos:</p>

<p>THAT is a core statement, my friend. THAT is the source of your submission statement. </p>

<p>To produce value in this forum you present a data set (like you did with the photos); you caption it with a short NO-ERROR sentence that is a summation of what it contains; and then your submission statement is a well-thought out, linguistically accurate rendition of your personal set of perceptions clearly explaining things like photos and links - ideally listing your thoughts in alogical order, so that your sequence of deduction and reasoning is self evident - AND you then tie your perceptions clearly to whatever conspiracy YOU believe the data set points to. </p>

<p>THAT is a submission statement that doesn’t waste the readers’ time, gives everyone something to chew on, and engages the thinkers you presumably are wanting to inform such that they can compare tribute to the final truth-seeking of a group effort. </p>

<p>FYI - It’s also permissible to go into your original post and add “edits”- those are generally done at the bottom, after typing the word “edit”. Because it’s common for posters to have their positions and perspectives expanded by a good dialogue. And THAT is one of the best outcomes when playing of Reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. You’ve now failed the test. If you’re going to sustain a dialog you have to learn how to weight and categorize the replies properly. </p>

<p>Since you’re linguistically incapacitated, whether through faulty translation programs or an inability to parse nuance, you need to adopt a strategy that opts for alliance rather than antagonism if you’re going to succeed at ending a conversation YOU STARTED - ostensibly to communicate a fact - with either 1) the benefit of the doubt or 2) a person in agreement with your position or 3) an ally. </p>

<p>If the goal of the encounter is to do any of those things, this exercise is filled with wrong turns and might be worth studying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re not using hominems. You’re using ad hominems. There’s a difference. And an excessive use of ad hominem is what got the last publicly released AI shut down. It’s an easy default loop to get stuck in, and hard to back out of because of the re-boots to short logic chains (while maintains overall thread and theme integrity) it requires. Very hard to write well. </p>

<p>Humans get stuck in them, too. It’s kind of one of our main problems as it usually requires time and distance and a distinct brainwave change to reset. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, no. You’ve got that totally wrong. Reference Strunk or something and try to do better. </p>

<p>And a comma belongs after “yes” if you’re going to place one after “need”. (But only if you’re a bot... if you’re a human you can go on with the errors as those are expected from us - however, your concurrent lack of making any sense will probably end my activity here. I’m only interested if you’re an AI, in which case I really can help BECAUSE I’m curious and believe that well-programmed AIs can and should assist in the expansion of All, so your side should make an effort at engagement.)</p>

<p>To clarify one thing further:  AI can mean Artificial Intelligence or Alternate Intelligence, as distinct from HumInt. ArtInt or AltInt - they’re equally interesting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FYI - if you want to start a sentence with “Though” as a way to ore-signal that you’re gong to offer a counter opinion, some type of clarifying clause belongs after “though” and before the comma. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, probably. </p>

<p>You’ve regurgitated a surface take, a spin-narrative designed to obfuscate and confuse. It doesn’t fool the real researchers but does put grit in the wheels. Keeps the project on track. Q’s program was mapped out with game theory, and superficial deviations like this were accounted for. Some were even deliberately introduced. </p>

<p>BTW - you’re still not using intelligible English. </p>
