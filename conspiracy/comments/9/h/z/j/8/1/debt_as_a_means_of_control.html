       Debt Bondage is an archaic method, during the high middle ages serfdom under feudalism was highly prevalent, and sadly, many parallels can be made from victims of days of old to debtors in the 21st century, in western society.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Taylor illustrated the the interests of the creditor, and the debtor.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       "One interest is a tyrant, the other its slave. In Britain, one of these interests owes to the other above ten hundred millions of pound sterling, which would require twelve million slaves to discharge, at eighty pounds sterling each... If the debtor interest amounts to ten millions of souls, and would be worth forty pounds sterling round, sold for slaves, it pays twelve and a half percentum on it's capitation value, to the creditor interest... This profit for their masters, made by those who are called freemen, greatly exceeds what is generally made by those who are called slaves"
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       To place someone in debt is obviously more profitable then ownership, a debtor does not need to be fed, housed, or clothed.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of Americans do not own the house they live in, they belong usually in majority to corrupt financial institutions, mortgage rates have seen a very steady increase^1, and so have interest rates for student loans.^2.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Something terrifying to consider is that both mortgages, student loans, as well as medical debt is tied to LIBOR, as well as Euribor which are both open to manipulation by financial institutions, usually the same banks people are in debted too.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Fascism and socialism had common roots in central economic planning and overpowering the state over the individual, the rise of the modern military industrial complex illustrates modern central economic planning in the united states, and the rise of state capitalism ^ 3
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       To continue favoring central planning, and abandoning individualism will inevitably lead to the serfdom of the individual, loss of freedom, and the creation of an oppressive society.

       Zionist Jews are just pawns of the Old World Order. They were the only religion (Christianity and Islam do not approve of usury) that were okay with charging interest, and therefore, used as the group to steal the wealth from the people. They are not the most powerful but because of their positioning in this game, they have accrued a lot more power than ever expected.

       Usury needs to be either outlawed or replaced. It's been proven that private banks cannot handle the responsibility of usury. Time and time again they take advantage of their customers.

       Bitcoin is the worst of both hard and fiat currency. Unlike most hard currencies it has no intrinsic value, unlike fiat currencies it does not have the flexibility to expand with an economy. Meaning there is a hard limit to growth and a final amount of total value possible in the system, but even less to back it up than say a gold standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a neat idea and actual block-chain based banking is likely going to be the future until quantum computing renders block-chains essentially worthless - but Bitcoin specifically will fail spectacularly.

       The scary part is that the system is now built to force people into debt! want a job? go to college! take out huge loans that you will spend decades fighting to pay off! the whole thing is engineered to get as many people into debt as possible, and its working.

       The scary part is that there are many more people who have valuable degrees who are drastically underpaid. Eg, i know a girl with a masters degree who works in a critical government position who has calculated she will finally have paid off her loans by age 55. Thats factoring in raises.

       You totally missed the point: the people running the system create this pressure and put it on people. Sure, common sense dictates you dont have to get a degree, but you are bombarded with people telling you thats what you need. And not even a 4 year degree. Think of the predatory tech schools and such.

       Any type of investment is a risk. Should 18 year olds be taking that risk? Probably not. So the blame is split between the person, their parents and their other influencers/advisors.

       See, you overplayed your hand. Now you just sound like the guys running the for profit schools.  Its easy to justify when its just some poor shmuck who made a bad call weighing out risk/reward. Thats as bad as a drug dealer saying "i dont make people take drugs, i just make them available".

       It sounds like you don't want to put any of the responsibility on the student nor their parents, when they should also be given part of the blame.

       no, i dont, for the simple reason that people are being told this is the ONLY WAY to get to a better living. they are constantly bombarded with the idea, from school counselors to advertisements to business recruiters. Coors brewery very famously would not hire anyone unless they had a college degree, from truck drivers to janitors, for example. Entire industries tailor their claims to requiring a degree to be competitive. The parents trust that the institution isnt acting out of self interest, and they only want what they are being told is best for their child. but this is exactly it- how you get millions of people into debt to control them.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for your other argument- lets take it out of metaphor. youre saying: ''i dont need an education loan. the bank has them, but i dont need it so i wont have any issues. people who do take out loans are going to keep taking them regardless of whether its from bank A or bank B until they decide to quit.'' Therein lies the problem. 1 person who isnt in debt is not the problem. you're the one little ant in his corner of the hive thinking that as long as you got yours the rest of the hive can get fucked. The whole point of this discussion is that there are massive groups of people who are being dragged into this under false pretenses and are unable to effectively extract themselves from it. and lets not forget! these are smart people, or at least smarter. its the intelligent ones who want to better themselves and improve their education for longterm goals. its the smart ones who go in for this to begin with! they just dont see the trap until the jaws close.

       I won't. My student loans will be paid off. It's just going to take some time and I will have to make some sacrifices like not going out to eat multiple times a week until its paid off.

       I would like to see college prices decrease. And the best way to make that happen is for the government to stop lending out so much money to people who may not be able to pay it back. The government is the most reliable person to pay back in the US and since the schools know they are going to get it, they have no problem raising prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like to see the schools stop allowing foreign students who 1) take spots that Americans would otherwise be taking and 2) are willing to pay more than most Americans can afford.

       Paying for any sort of education PERIOD is a stupid thing for any smart civilization to do. If you’re trying to have the strongest smartest nation, why would you want to hinder anything that allows them to be the best they could be? Unless they just want a nation of idiots which is exactly what they want Americans to be. It bugs me that education is so expensive. We can learn everything for free online yet we Force ourselves into these institutions to just take all your money and then charge you $300 for books and all that other stupid nonsense. Nothing like society telling you how desperate it is in need of smart confident workers while all along the way they don’t help you at all and expect you to do everything yourself. But then they tell you you’re an excellent employer and your valuable to the company and a great asset yet not want to give you a livable wage. Such a backwards upside down loopty loop fucky world we live in. “ oh you don’t have this piece of paper therefore you must not know what you’re talking about! Hurdur!”

       As someone who has spent at least half my life living outside the usa, i can say it comes down to 1 basic thing: attitude. America still likes to judge the success of the nation based on the peaks acheived by the wealthy few, rather than the lows persisted upon the many. Its long been said to truely judge a nation look no further than its poor. Other countries have long made a point of trying to lift people out of poverty and giving them the means to improve themselves. America puts that responsibility on the poor themselves, and blames them for their failures.

       Debt is a tool. Use it to your advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       No reason to buy a large purchase in cash if a loan interest rate is lower than the market return rate. If you buy a car or house in cash as opposed to getting a low interest rate loan you're actually losing money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could have bought my car outright but got a 0.9% interest loan. Why? Because the money I would have dropped on the car is invested and has averaged a ~7% return.

       Sadly, the vast majority of americans are unable to make large purchases without resorting to high interest loans.

       The median price of a home is around 279,000$,

       far higher then 30 years ago. How can an individual without a stable income afford to make such a purchase?
      </p>
      <p>
       They cannot, therefore the majority of homeowners are also college educated
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       , this means they are usually indebted from education, student loan interest rates have been reaching historical levels.

       In a previous post I explained the issues in manipulation of LIBOR and Euribor, adjustable rate mortgages and private student loans are directly tied to LIBOR and Euribor, manipulation of this standard has been commonplace at Tier 1 Investment banks, whether your interest is high or low you are still negatively impacted.

       While renting, you're wasting more of your working hours &amp; income making someone else rich, while also still paying the bank, just indirectly. Also, try modifying the place you're renting, without your landlord's approval. Finally, your landlord can raise your rent every year, pricing you out over time. This is all pretty obvious to anyone with some life experience, if you ask me.

       I get mobility and can move whenever I want, wherever and whenever, regardless of market conditions. I can't do that without a house. The ability to take a higher paying job at a month or two notice is invaluable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The landlord can raise the rent to whatever the market demands. If I get priced out then I move. Doesn't seem like a difficult concept to me.

       See my other reply under previous comment. I'll add that rent payments are forever, and they can and will increase, forever. Mortgage debt has a finish line, and your monthly payments are at least stable. Giving all of your money away to make landlords rich is financially foolish.

       Hopefully from the tenants, and sometimes from their own pocket when they destroy the place or don't pay.

       Depends.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know most people here think landlords were just given the place for free without a mortgage, but that is rarely the case. In my case, I had to buy it, then I had to put tens of thousands of dollars into it to make it livable.

       I pay the mortgage off first then whatever is left is split between repairs, lawyers, improvements and savings.

       A leaking roof isn't a huge problem for someone who owns an apartment building with 10-20 or more tenants. But it's a big problem for someone like me who owns a single person place.

       For normal people, it really all depends on the tenant. My last tenant cost me close to $20,000 and maybe in 20 years I'll get that back from her, maybe, but that wouldn't be a huge problem for a big company.

       If you live on the poverty line you could go into debt at any moment. All it takes is a traffic ticket for something as innocent as a burnt out tail light and because you don't have a few hundred dollars at a moments notice that ticket starts collecting late fees and the cost grows from there.

       When you are car dependent you can be stopped at any moment and your ID(driver's license) demanded, which is not true for pedestrians/cyclists/public transit users. As a driver you are much more likely to have to deal with the police than nondrivers and are more likely to break the law without realizing it. Sometimes I wonder if these are reasons for keeping most of the US car dependent and making it more difficult to live without a drivers license. As a nondriver I do not need to carry any ID on my person. Of course with the political climate and the trend towards authoritarianism that could change, just de facto mandating ID because it is difficult to live without it is doing the job to keep most US citizens under control.

       I wasted money going to college, but I take part of the blame just I blame the people who allowed me to take the loans and to the people who talked me into taking the loans.

       While renting, you're wasting more of your working hours &amp; income making someone else rich, while also still paying the bank, just indirectly. Also, try modifying the place you're renting, without your landlord's approval. Finally, your landlord can raise your rent every year, pricing you out over time. This is all pretty obvious to anyone with some life experience, if you ask me.
