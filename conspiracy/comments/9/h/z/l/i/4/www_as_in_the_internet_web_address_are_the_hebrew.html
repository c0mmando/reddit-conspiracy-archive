<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> named his precursor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE">ENQUIRE</a>, after this work in 1980.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enquire_Within_Upon_Everything#cite_note-7">[7]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enquire_Within_Upon_Everything#cite_note-Finkelstein-8">[8]</a></p>

<p><em>&quot;When I first began tinkering with a software program that eventually gave rise to the idea of the World Wide Web, I named it Enquire, short for &quot;Enquire Within upon Everything&quot;, a musty old book of Victorian advice I noticed as a child in my parents&#39; house outside London. With its title suggestive of magic, the book served as a</em> <strong><em>portal</em></strong> <em>to a world of information, everything from how to remove clothing stains to tips on investing money</em></p>

<p>TB-L worked at CERN when he coded his first web browser, a place that is often cited as attempting to open portals.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Now what it is a portal to, well one can only speculate.</p>

<p>You know those as the ones we translated FROM to get English language bibles we now use. Our original sources say 616, not 666. It wasn&#39;t changed to 666 until it was translated into English.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay thanks. I just wanted to make sure just because there are different manuscripts used for different bibles and I am weary about some manuscripts as well as some translations. That is a huge different rabbit hole though. However I have faith that the true number is 666 for many reasons. Even if it is not it still has the same idea about the end times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only that, 666 (or 616) was never written in Hebrew so that has absolutely no bearing. Revelations was written in Greek, not Hebrew since Paul was a Greek and likely couldn&#39;t write in Hebrew.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Papyrus 115 (which is the oldest preserved manuscript of the Revelation as of 2017), as well as other ancient sources like Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus, give the Number of the Beast as 616 (χιϛ), not 666;[2][3] critical editions of the Greek text, such as the Novum Testamentum Graece, note 616 as a variant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Papyrus 115 and Ephraemi Rescriptus have led some scholars to regard 616 as the original number of the beast.[17] According to Paul Louis, &quot;The number 666 has been substituted for 616 either by analogy with 888, the [Greek] number of Jesus (Gustav Adolf Deissmann), or because it is a triangular number, the sum of the first 36 numbers (1+2+3+4+5+6+...+36 = 666)&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_Beast">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_Beast</a></p>

<p>In other words, the reason you think the number is 666 is because someone in the past thought it seemed like a better number to use for these sorts of games.</p>

<p>The reason people <em>still</em> prefer it, knowing that it is wrong, is that they can still play these games with the number 666 but can&#39;t figure out how to make 616 work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some say that 666 refers to the <a href="https://www.prague-guide.co.uk/story-about-golem/">Golem</a>, a mythical creature made of clay that is animated and then becomes out of control.</p>

<p>But, specifically, the &#39;www&#39; is a typical hostname for a dedicated computer that runs a webserver.  It is still used in a somewhat vestigial form because when the internet was in its infancy there was no such thing as a domain name, only host names.  So all computers had a name.  And a domain name did not necessarily refer to a web server until after the web became widely used.  It was envisioned that, perhaps, any host on a network could run a web server and that there would be many different types of services running on each computer that might need to be addressed to be accessed.  In actuality, the web became the most popular service by far, displacing others such as Gopher, and became somewhat more centralized and run mostly on dedicated hosts for each domain.  So the &#39;www&#39; hostname became redundant.</p>

<p>Computer scientists have a fascination with creating artificial intelligence, obviously.  The world wide web was conceived as a type of &#39;intelligence&#39; that would be created and exist outside of the control of any individual person.  And it does.</p>
