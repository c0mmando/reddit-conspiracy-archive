       This gentleman was place in control of all special weapon and rocket research shortly before disappearing at the end of the war. This included v1 and v2 rocket production which was headed up by none other than....
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun">
        Wernher Von Braun
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This fellow started his career as a rocket scientist in Nazi Germany at Pennemunde Facility only to be scooped up by the American government when
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">
        Operation Paperclip
       </a>
       happened at the end of the war. Next thing you know he’s with
       <a href="https://youtu.be/2fautyLuuvo">
        Micky Mouse
       </a>
       explaining to the American public how we will reach the moon using the same rocket technology that had just bombed the fuck out of London.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although he was a busy man Von Braun managed to fit in some time to pass his trade along to a apprentice. A young man called
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Parsons_(rocket_engineer">
        Jack Whiteside Parsons
       </a>
       )  appears in Pasadena California. As a aspiring rocket scientist he speaks to Von Braun over the phone and starts experimenting with solid state rocket fuel. But Von Braun wasn’t the only person that saw Parsons as an apprentice.
A man from a small town called Leamington Spa in Warwickshire England had taken a liking to Parsons. This man went by the name
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley">
        Aleister Crowley
       </a>
       He has started a religion based upon hermetic groups of the past few hundred years. He had take notes from
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry">
        Freemasonry
       </a>
       ,

       ) ,
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis">
        Greek Mythology
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_Law">
        Egyptian Mythology
       </a>
       and collaborated them into what he called
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema">
        Thelema
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch">
        The basic idea of Thelema is that we are as humans live in ignorance of the fact we are gods. Through a process of breaking down the programming or ego we can strip away any kind of associations we have that stop us from seeing reality as it is instead of how we perceive it.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This idea can be summarised as “Do what you will” with emphasis on the phrase “will”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crowley was based in the UK and Parsons was in the US so he decided to task Parsons with establishing Thelema in the US. He bought a mansion called “The Parsonage”. The Pasonage was home to a host of bohemians that rode the beginnings of what would become Charles Mansons San Francisco art house cult. Parties held at the Parsonage would descend into
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_magic">
        sex magik
       </a>
       parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah">
        The general idea behind sex magik is that if you are to create an orgasm within your self or in someone else this acts as a build up of energy and if one or both people involved can focus their minds on a shared goal at the point of orgasm this brings said goal closer to manifestation.  This idea relates back to Jewish Kabbalah mysticism which is an idea that connects to the Tree of Life an basically acts an a path to enlightenment.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whilst all this is happening Crowley was establishing Thelema Branches all over the world by converting different mystical lodges to Thelema.
One of these was
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternitas_Saturni">
        The Brotherhood of Saturn
       </a>
       which ended up being absorbed by the
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thule_Society">
        Thule Society
       </a>
       which ended up turning into the
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahnenerbe">
        Ahnenebe
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The Thule society was basically the amalgamation of the best German occult, mystical, philosophical and political groups. 
Factually the discussed the ideas of people like
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_von_List">
        Guido Von List
       </a>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky">
        Helena Blavatsky
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manly_P._Hall">
        Manly P Hall
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Bailey">
        Alice Bailey
       </a>
       All of these individuals subscribed to the same concepts Crowley promoted in Thelema.
       <a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sumer_anunnaki/reptiles/reptiles23.htm">
        All of the also on the down low promoted the idea of Atlantis, Root Races and the idea that “God” is the universe and “God’s” are races that have enslaved humanity at different times.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can start to see a connection via trail of thought. Heinrich Himmler and Helena Blavatsky never met, but they retained a similar school of thought. This is important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile back at the Parsonage a young ex Navy officer turns up by the name of
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard">
        L Ron Hubbard
       </a>
       . Parsons takes a liking to Hubbard and the pair start attempting a ritual that was attempted by Crowley called the
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babalon_Working">
        Babalon Working
       </a>
       . 
It was meant to push humanity into the
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Aquarius">
        Age of Aquarius
       </a>
       , which was supposed to be the beginning of the Book of Revelation and the begging of the end of the garden of Eden situation, our quest for knowledge of you will. Our journey to full realisation that we are divine as is everything around us.
In reality this involved Parsons and Hubbard heading out to the desert, Parsons masturbating over some stone tablets whilst Hubbard scrubbed everything that happened. A scarlet haired women was supposed to materialise and represent the Whore of Babylon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pair get home to the Parsonage and meet
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Cameron">
        Marjorie Cameron
       </a>
       .
A scarlet haired artist.
Parsons takes the hint and the pair start doing sex magik with Hubbard as scribe.
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Dianetics">
        At this point Hubbard steals $10,000 from the Parsonage buys a boat and head into the Ocean to write Dianetics, the holy book of Scientology.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.classifiedufo.com/jack-parsons-jpl.html">
        Parsons explodes in his basement due to “chemical mixup” and Cameron claims she saw multiple UFO’s the night he died.
       </a>
       It’s worth mentioned that between all this chaos Parsons set up a lab called the Jack Parsons Lab. Upon his death the name was changed to “
       <a href="https://instagram.com/nasajpl?utm_source=ig_profile_share&amp;amp;amp;igshid=fzhv4tj8zmss">
        “Jet Propulsion Lab”
       </a>
       which was in turn 2 years after Parsons death absorbed into NASA which was under Von Brauns direction at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This takes us up to the Cold War and let me tell you it gets a whole lot more complicated once Federal Government appears in the mix. We go from everything being spread out to everything being hidden as something else. What is have explained above makes the fact that every NASA mission has been named after Greek Gods a lot more intriguing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Got any questions let me know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll try and do another one of these if people want more...

       Great post!  Call me crazy, but right before this I read the post about The Finders.  I think The Finders may have sprung up from this original group, and carried on into modern day Scientology and cults like NXIVM.  They all seem to have Thelemic teachings in common...

       In the biography of Crowley, Hubbard was described more as an unliked buffoon than some pivotal piece of the story.

       Well if you look at the whole picture that is probably a correct assumption, Dianetics is based of Parsons work which is based off Crowley’s work which is based of John Dee’s in the 1500’s. I’d say in terms of who was pivotal I goes
      </p>
      <p>
       DEE
CROWLEY 
PARSONS 
HUBBARD
      </p>
      <p>
       But it’s important to remember that Hubbard took all the religious implication out of the work and made it easy for a consumer to pick the concept up of processing emotion and raising your consciousness. Hence why Scientology has become what it has become today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hubbard’s work is the easiest to understand whilst Dee’s work is v difficult to understand due to the time period and the linguistic differences of the time + what he was doing has never fully been explained but it seems to be that he was in communication with the angles from the Book of Enoch that were cast down from heaven after disobeying God and had sex with Humans and fucked up our DNA.

       Just a bit of fill in the gaps. Great post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sex magick originates in Siddha longevity practices.
Its goal unlike tantra is physical longevity, not a state of samadhi.
Jewish mysticism might of adopted it but they didn't develop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edward Talbot ( a bit of a scoundrel ) overheard a rumour of a welsh monk being buried with " the philosophers stone " near an abbey. He convinced his friend John Dee to help him search for this abbey and dig up the grave. According to John Dee they found two vials, one with red liquid the other white. After they had clumsily experimented with and taken it, Dee admitted no real magick could be done without it. Edward Talbot now called Kelley set himself up as an alchemist, never having made " the philosophers stone " himself. John Dee stumbled his way through his experiments with the stone until a spirit called Madimi decided to teach him. Nearly everything he learnt came from her. Madimi also played with both Talbot ( Kelley ) and Dee. When she had her fun she left.
Talbots supply of the " philosophers stone " ran out.
Dee was left with half of the knowledge he sought.
The knowledge he had was eventually passed down, making its way through different secret societies.
The practices used by Crowley are based on Dee's incomplete and deliberately corrupted knowledge from Madimi.
Before the " philosophers stone " these two men were clueless.
They didn't heed the warning of previous alchemists, that those in the possession of the stone would attract forces that want to play with them.

       I am going to do a full run down of history from Bible to now I this format and style with sources posted throughout as I have here. 
It’s a lot of information but I’m sure it’s along the right lines of what has happened/is happening.

       I think you may have left out a few things...
      </p>
      <p>
       As I understand it:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Crowley was an intelligence asset, though an unruly one. Rumour has it his file said "use only if necessary and with caution" or something to that effect.
       </li>
       <li>
        Hubbard was also a spy, I think OSS.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Babalon working was intended to be a counter to Crowley's earlier working which was intended to bring about the age of Horus. Parsons wanted one thing, but I believe that Hubbard's goal for the working was different.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Also fwiw I think Crowley was an extremely interesting man... And not quite the demon that some make him out to be. Dude was just at the bleeding edge of the counterculture of the time (a counterculture to which places like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       owe their origins).

       For a while, yes... Iirc, he was part of the original group of hippies in the desert that later split into 3 or 4 factions, one went with L. Ron. , one group was the basis for the "Family"...
Which makes me wonder what happened to the other groups around there at that time??? There was a LOT of bummed out, tripped out people hanging out in the desert.

       Awesome. Much of this are epiphanies I've had myself.

       Viewing the Universe as God makes the most sense, and allows science and religion to work side by side. Things like karma, and sin, are just ways to control the masses. In reality there doesn't seem to be any negative effect for your actions, unless your too overt and get caught.

       Fantastic post. I've often repeated everything you wrote here, but I've recently begun to wonder if there are any verifiable connections between Parsons, Hubbard and Crowley. I know the stories alright, but I wonder if we're just repeating somebody else's theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       It might actually be David Icke who first suggested the connection in one of his books - what if he's scamming us?

       It seems fairly out in the open that Parsons was in communication with both Crowley and Von Braun at different times.
      </p>
      <p>
       He spoke to Crowley via letters and Von Braun via phone and as JPL became part of NASA which Von Braun was 100% part of at the period of time we can assume they were at least aware of one another. I mean I am pretty confident Parsons developed the fuel that went inside Von Brauns rocket that put us on the moon.

       Thanks. Ever seen the movie Battlefield Earth? It was written by Hubbard and it deals with mankind's collective amnesia. Scientology is a ridiculous scam, but uber-wealthy people shop for spirituality, too.

       Icke's old books mentioned all kinds of shit that's come true over the years - even the Arab spring was predicted years earlier. I wonder if the reptile crap is just a red-herring to confuse the rest

       The reptilian thing definitely means something, I just can’t decided if it’s a metaphor for individuals with particularly egotistical materialistic brains or if they literally mean 9ft lizard people that can shape shift and have enslaved us forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Billy Corona from the Smashing Pumpkins said he is writing a autobiography and has a shapeshifter story so I’m certainly looking out for that as his work is laced with esoteric symbology.

       Is/was Austin Osman Spare and his Zos Kia Cultis relevant to Crowley and his mission with Thelema? I've heard contradictory stories about Spare and Crowley and you seem like you know your shit.

       Thelema is such a wide umbrella that it covers multiple bases when looking as to what came next.
      </p>
      <p>
       It covers a lot of topics that can be grouped into different political and philosophical mindsets. If we consider Von Braun and NASA right wing we can come wider Osman Spare left wing as he was an artist. Right wing occultists are all about real world manifestation and rockets fit that bill quite nicely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spare and his Zos Kia Cultis was basically the foundation for Chaos Magik and the entertainment landscape we see today. Look up Coil and The Temple of Psychik Youth and see how they tie into the Nu Metal movement at the beginning of the 2000’s via Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson. Tie this up with what was happening in film around that time, The films of David Lynch, Fight Club and other 9/11 culture.

       you’ve been listening! Well done! Carol Rosie indeed was the director at Fairchild Industries and indeed was Von Braun’s right hand woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       He did indeed warn her of the excuses for war in space but what I find interesting is what happened with her Steven Greer and Tom DeLonge?
      </p>
      <p>
       Rosin and Greer were the first people DeLonge contacted back in 2000 when he got famous. They agreed when he met. Now they share conflicting views.
What changed?

       Tom DeLonge is literally fake news.  Not sure if he knows it, judging by his interview with Rogan he might not. Sounds like they've twisted the truth and made him a mouthpiece for disinfo. I don't trust anything his MEDIA company "to the stars" says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, the guy from blink 182 is ushering in the new "knowledge"? Gtfo I don't buy that one bit.

       Okay. You might be right. It’s completely possible your 100% correct.
But you might be wrong. Even if 99% of what your saying is right and 1% of what I’m saying is right, we have a bigger discussion at hand.

       Tom Delong, the one who says FUCK FUCK SHIT FUCK (literally) for money, and also didn't even write his own music (sometimes) and barely played instruments (sucked live).  Dad was MILITARY. Had successful career bringing punk mainstream.  Overnight becomes the person in charge of relaying truth.  If that's not propaganda then I'm a machine elf lol.

       China is the one they are covering for in space (and on earth for that matter) and the reason nobody talks about it is because it will literally start another world war. China is behind all the hacking and theft of intellectual property in the united states. Also, no bombs in space.

       Right. Few things.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Yes. Blink 182 are a band with some joke songs. They have 7 albums. 6 of which DeLonge played on. Each of these albums have a minimum of 12 songs. That’s at least 72 songs. Blink have 5 complete joke songs.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       1.Fuck a Dog
2.When you fucked Grandpa
3.Family Reunion 
4.Mothers Day
5.Happy Holidays you Bastard
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll give you the whole Cheshire Cat album if you really wanna debate but you’ve gotta give me the Dogs eating Dogs EP which has 0 joke songs.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am saying is a v small percentage of blinks discography was FUCK FUCK SHIT FUCK and actively past a certain era they were trying to move away from this aesthetic as it was hindering their artistic vision. This is literally the reason they are split up right now. Mark thinks it is safe to re hash old themes and stay true to what he thinks Blink is whilst Tom regrets the silly ways of the past and should like to move on the more philosophical topic of the youth instead of specific events of debauchery like in older songs.
There are so many
       <a href="https://youtu.be/7GgoqG9LKDI">
        interviews
       </a>
       of Tom explains how his old songs got him in trouble and how he now sees how they were just kids laughing at stupid things.
One of Tom’s new songs “New World” pretty much spells this out is
      </p>
      <p>
       “It violates and blinds the eyes
But I found a new world”
      </p>
      <p>
       He’s explaining why Blink can’t be like it used to be.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         I don’t know what your getting at by saying he doesn’t write his own music. He always wrote with Mark but there’s so many songs he wrote on his own for Blink Ava and his own solo endeavour and that’s not even considering Box Car Racer.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He has a unconventional singing style I’ll give you that, his riffs are pretty badass though. You couldn’t/haven’t wrote a Delong tier riff. Song writing is where he shines.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A lot of people’s family are in the military mine included what’s your point.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He literally wrote a song with Blink 182 in 1999 called “Aliens exist” then 15 years later left the same band for the exact reason that aliens exist. It seems if anything Blink 182 was the change of heart pulling him away from aliens studies.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I’m sorry I didn’t wanna talk to you like this but what your saying simply isn’t truth.

       True but if you search for Tom Delonge father nothing comes up at all. And what i can find is he was an oil company executive. Silver spoon? Im sorry but i can't take anyone seriously that thinks he's a good musician. I've had people try to tell me nickelback riffs are good too. Not buying it. Punk rock music from this era is among the most simple to play and there's reasons why green day suddenly came back to cash in.  There's tons of evidence on the internet of Tom sucking at guitar live. Your extensive knowledge of blink 182 and opinion of Tom shows your bias, IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's lots of evidence out there some music is used as a tool by intelligence agencies domestic and abroad.

       The fuck are you on about?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nickelback objectivity do have good riffs. Have you written a song like Animals, Flat on the Floor or How You Remind Me?
      </p>
      <p>
       You might not like them but millions of people do! Are we to say every single person that likes Nickelback is a delinquent? That doesn’t seem incredibly level headed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to know more about Toms dad than I do since all I have ever heard about him is that he left Toms mom and the family relatively early on in Toms life. 
Interesting tidbit is that Mark Hoppus (the bass player and other singer from Blink for those who do not know) had a grandfather??? In WW2 which is whose letters are being read out in the interlude between the songs Violence and Stockholm Syndrome on their Untitled record for those Blinl fans that are listening.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Tom finally got his first “big” paycheck he contacted Dr Steven Greer this was in 2001/2002 and back when he was doing the Disclosure Project (aka the credible section of his work). Greer came out to meet Tom on tour and upon meeting Mark Hoppus somehow managed to contact??? the same grandfather that had been in the war through some sort of meditation channeling experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t write the stories I just tell them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your Green Day point is not great either, I mean it’s not hard to see that when they recorded Dookie that’s the life they were loving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed, Girls, skulking around the streets at night and panic attacks. Everyone’s early 20’s basically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Follow Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning and they are all kind of autobiographical. Warning flopped and Green day took a step back from writing and tour from 1999-2002.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen to American Idiot and they are talking about the same shit they were talking about on Dookie but from a outsider philosophical point of view. Because they have lived it they can speak upon it kind of thing. 
I do believe the guys in Green Day are genuine if not a little insecure. Same as Blink. Same as most people.

       Lol the nickelback defense says all i need to hear.  I do agree with essentially everything you've said outside of Tom and the music industry. Just because it's popular doesn't mean anything. Justin Bieber had the number 1 video on youtube ever. Does that mean Despacito is better than all other music? Surely you know of the corruption in the music industry.

       He also wrote a book about a man entitled Elon taking humans to Mars and setting up government there, which is looking like a prophecy the puppetmasters seem on track to making happen. Then again he had his headstone enscribed with a biblical passage that reads, "God's handiwork is seen in the
       <em>
        firmament

       . " So yeah, the dude seemed to know about the fake Mars Landing plan and that the alien invasion would also be fake.

       I don't remember where it is but there's a painting, either in north america or south america, where it has stick figures followed by what seems like a forked path. One is stairs leading up and the other is flat ground. It was described as humans mechling to make a choice, either to ascend to the heavens or to stay behind. It may have been on ancient aliens so who knows if that's something "real" or accurate, but i do think of this a lot lately.

       This is old school conspiracy stuff. I like it. You should listen to Terence McKenna talk about how Descartes got his ideas from having hallucinations and tripping balls.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_Descartes
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       “According to Adrien Baillet, on the night of 10–11 November 1619 (St. Martin's Day), while stationed in Neuburg an der Donau, Descartes shut himself in a room with an "oven" (probably a Kachelofen or masonry heater) to escape the cold. While within, he had three dreams[31] and believed that a divine spirit revealed to him a new philosophy. However, it is likely that what Descartes considered to be his second dream was actually an episode of exploding head syndrome.[32] Upon exiting, he had formulated analytical geometry and the idea of applying the mathematical method to philosophy. He concluded from these visions that the pursuit of science would prove to be, for him, the pursuit of true wisdom and a central part of his life's work.[33][34] Descartes also saw very clearly that all truths were linked with one another so that finding a fundamental truth and proceeding with logic would open the way to all science. Descartes discovered this basic truth quite soon: his famous "I think, therefore I am".[28]”
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is the talk where McKenna briefly talks about Descartes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/pDrn-uL2EwU">
        https://youtu.be/pDrn-uL2EwU
       </a>
      </p>

       Really though I think what essentially is going on here is that wise religious people like Crowley are leading people like Von Bruan into a spiritual path that reveals truth in a way that is as yet unknown. I highly suspect this is either dormant brain power, or it is collective unconscious that Jung talked about, hence as you said the reuse of names of Greek gods for names of NASA missions. These are naturally arising reuse of the same archetypical stories that mankind has always told. But perhaps the “revealed knowledge” is something more? I don’t know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the caveat to this is that Crowley was of course known for his debauchery. And from what I’ve read about him, he died with regrets from not really knowing his son. So, how wise and enlightened was he? Was he simply knowledgeable enough to lead Von Bruan?
      </p>
      <p>
       One last theory, that has nothing to do with Descartes or Jung but everything to do with McKenna and maybe Crowley is the use of mushrooms. McKenna believes that mushrooms are an otherworldly intelligence all their own and observe the world and tell their secrets to the people who ingest them. So, maybe the mushrooms were talking to Von Bruan. There is another note here, there are receptors in the human body that only get activated by ingesting mushrooms (not necessarily hallucinogenic, although McKenna believes that hallucinogens are part of the reason why humans have evolved as far as we have), so humans evidentially were meant to be eating mushrooms all this time.

       None of that precludes wisdom or enlightenment.

       Do you know anything about the runway Braun put @ Cape Canaveral? Wasn’t there an esoteric connection with the angle or something numeric? Sorry, grasping at straws here, I just remembered reading something about this while down a rabbit hole one day. Fantastic post and links btw! Thank you.

       Hey OP,

      <p>
       Have you explored any of this in relation to folks such as:

      <p>
       Jack Sarfatti
Andrija Puharich
Uri Geller
Philip K. Dick
Robert Anton Wilson
Jacques Vallee
Kerry Thornley
And I'm sure I'm forgetting others....

       I've definitely been reading some similar things to you, and have been struggling to connect it all. It's like I'm staring at an elephant but I'm way too close to it so all I see is grey, but I know that what I'm looking at is something big.

       They supposedly opened a portal to another dimension during the rituals and met a being named "Lam"- who looks alot like a grey alien.   Some believe that it was opening that portal which led to UFOs coming into our dimension.

       I do love this sort of stuff, but you're glossing over some of the connections between this whole set and the US government. You said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It’s worth mentioned that between all this chaos Parsons set up a lab  called the Jack Parsons Lab. Upon his death the name was changed to “
        <a href="https://instagram.com/nasajpl?utm_source=ig_profile_share&amp;amp;igshid=fzhv4tj8zmss">
         “Jet Propulsion Lab”
        </a>
        which was in turn 2 years after Parsons death absorbed into NASA which was under Von Brauns direction at the time.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So Parsons and his cohort were kicking around with rockets from the 1930's and were continually trying to win contracts and bids from the US government, who could not give less of a shit about any of their work. It was only when people became aware of the military applications during the Second World War that they were given a chance, and even then they were continually pissed off by the stupidity, corruption, and backwardness of the government guys they interacted with. And it was only in the mid 1950's that things began to pick up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really doubt that any serious esoteric influence was able to penetrate through the apathy and enter into government doctrine. There was an almost lack of interest in the entire area for nearly 20 years, and there's no way this could change so quickly.
