    <div class="md"><p>Personality has a genetic component, as most things. Psychological pathologies are just collections of symptoms, most of which have been proven to be non-existant with time, and the rest have found to have a purely medical/physical cause, like Alzheimer&#39;s. Either asbergers has a physical cause or it is just some random category of similar symptoms (BS).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider people living 10 000 years ago. They had the same diseases as we do today (well, many of them), but had no science to understand their causes, didn&#39;t know about bacteria etc. </p>

<p>These people definitely made categories of symptoms and practiced early medicine. Oh, you have a headache and a scratch and some other symptoms? Eric had similar symptoms, I gave him these leaves and he felt better. Say the leaves were a good medicine against one disease which did produce some of those symptoms, the problem is that other diseases will have similar symptoms, and the leaves could be ineffective against those, because the shaman did not actually know the causes of disease. Thus many of their &quot;diseases&quot; would be misunderstood, that is, many different diseases with similar symptoms could be grouped together, or a disease with different symptoms could be classified as two different diseases, among many other potential fallacies given this method of primitive medicine.</p>

<p>Today, biology has progressed to a point where we can identify the causes of diseases, and understand why the leaves may work against the disease, and accurately diagnose whether an indication is afflicted with the disease in question or not. Psychology however, is a much younger &#39;science&#39;, if it could even be called that. Psychology is at the stage of medicine 10000 years ago: they simply categorize similar &quot;mental&quot; symptoms into what they call mental diseases. In the brief history of psychology they have produced a myriad of &quot;mental diseases&quot; that turned out to be medical conditions involving brain chemistry, or simply pure BS, like &quot;nymphomania&quot;, which was the diagnosis given to promiscuous women, who were treated as mad. There has not been any physical cause of asbergers identified, so the entire concept may be very much misunderstood, and is in fact likely to be just that, until the actual causes can be identified.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the UK, medicine is free, it costs the government money, they don&#39;t prescribe medicine unless they have to because it costs the patient £0 but costs the government the inflated prices charged because of the backwards American system.

Are you so absorbed by your little bubble that you have no idea how the rest of the world works?

<p>It is you that needs to take off your rose colored glasses.  There is always good and bad in medical care, the UK is no different.  Your doctors do get paid for prescribing drugs, so with regards to that, you either lie or you are ignorant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For patients covered by health insurance, out-of-pocket cost for an emergency room visit typically consists of a copay, usually $50-$150 or more, which often is waived if the patient is admitted to the hospital. Depending on the plan, costs might include coinsurance of 10% to 50%. (<strong>for people who have their money <em>steeled</em> by healt insurance</strong>) </p>

<p>For patients without health insurance, an emergency room visit typically costs from $150-$3,000 or more, depending on the severity of the condition and what diagnostic tests and treatment are performed.</p>

<p>Services, diagnostic tests and laboratory fees add to the final bill. For example, Wooster Community Hospital, in Ohio, charges about $170 for a simple suture, $200 for a complex suture, about $170 for a minor procedure and about $400 for a major procedure, not including doctor fees, medicine or supplies.</p>

<p>An ambulance ride typically costs $400-$1,200 or more, depending on the location and services performed.           </p>
</blockquote>

<p>they did not charge you in UK for this, actually, here in Brasil any person in a emergency situation that do not have a healthy insurance is treated for free (any foreign too) in this situations too. i believe that this is the same in most countries in europe.</p>

<p>A report of McKinsey and Co. from 2008 found that between 60,000 and 85,000 medical tourists were traveling to the United States for the purpose of receiving in-patient medical care. The same McKinsey study estimated that 750,000 American medical tourists traveled from the United States to other countries in 2007 (up from 500,000 in 2006).The availability of advanced medical technology and sophisticated training of physicians are cited as driving motivators for growth in foreigners traveling to the U.S. for medical care, whereas the low costs for hospital stays and major/complex procedures at Western-accredited medical facilities abroad are cited as major motivators for American travelers.</p>

<p>do not disagree, but this is a problem with your legislation, in Brasil doctors can&#39;t receive incentives to prescribe pre-determined medications to people. i do not know the realities of other countries except for U.S (by news and stereotypes on series) where this seems to be the common practice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course not for predetermined medications. Meaning a doctor has already made the money to prescribe it to you. After that it&#39;s only a matter of calling in the prescription for a refill. They create lifelong customers by treating symptoms instead of <strong>curing</strong> the underlying problem. <strong>Cure</strong>, keyword. A word you&#39;ll never, never hear a US doctor use. It&#39;s illegal for them to say it. They don&#39;t cure anything. They don&#39;t fix anything. They treat symptoms. Even if they know how to cure the underlying problem, they don&#39;t.

<p>bro you&#39;ve been wrong about most of what you&#39;ve claimed about US medical. News manipulates the truth for political purposes. We def have serious problems in our healthcare industry but let&#39;s be real about it. Hospitals overcharging. Pharma overcharging. Doctors treating/covering up symptoms, knowingly, instead of the disease itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Autism is often misdiagnosed.  I had a member of my family go through that back in the 90s where they were taken to a parade of  doctors and psychologists who had no earthly idea what they had and ran through more drugs and behavior modifying techniques and utterly ridiculous diagnoses than anyone bothered to keep track of.  They were treating some of the symptoms and just hoping that the rest would work themselves out.  It took them until they were in high school before they finally figured out &quot;oh, hey, they have Aspergers&quot;, the medications stopped, and they are now a reasonably functional member of society.</p>
