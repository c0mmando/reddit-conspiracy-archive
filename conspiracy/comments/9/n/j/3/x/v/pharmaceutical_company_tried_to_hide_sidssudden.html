       SS: Internal documents show a major pharmaceutical company knew that they had a bad vaccine lot on the market that was killing children. Instead of taking it off the market, they decided to conceal the deaths by distributing it all over the country instead of one select geographic area hoping that no one would notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the last link they also discuss how they possibly used good lots for their vaccine safety studies while everyone else outside the study could have received a bad lot.

       Vaccine manufactures have total immunity from liability in the instance their product injures of kills you. But from what I understand, if the actual vaccine lot was bad (as apposed to the vaccine just being dangerous anyway), you can actually take it to federal court. But good luck proving this if they deliberately mix the vaccine lots up.

       Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has a caveat that prevents pharma companies from being held liable for any successful claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore; after the creation of the VICP in 1986, congress made the US Department of Health and Human Services responsible for submitting biannual reports on safety studies being carried out to quality check the vaccines which NEVER ONCE HAPPENED. Not a single report was filed.
      </p>

       Every time I see a meme casually deriding 'anti-vaxxers' (or how about that joke about killing them that made it to front page the other day) it just reinforces the feeling this is a completely fucked state of affairs.

        What happened was that a judge in New Jersey ordered one of the companies to produce their documents too fast for them to be able to be careful and sanitize them.

        The judge made them go so fast because they were refusing to produce. So, he basically said, “Okay. Fine. You have 48 hours to get the 80 boxes to Boston from New Jersey.” So, they started packing up the trucks and they shipped up the boxes to us.

       So when my boy was about 2 months I had him on his back laying on thin receiving blanket on the living room floor I went to the kitchen to grab something, came back and he had rolled himself over was face down and struggling to move his face from that position to the side so he could breath.  They don’t have the strength to move their neck and head like a toddler and child would hence why they should not sleep on their belly.  If I hadn’t made it a quick trip my son could have suffocated himself. So I can see where SIDS comes in when sleeping on stomach.

       But heres the thing, suffocating is not SIDS.  We have the ability to know if a baby died of suffocation, SIDS is just the baby stops breathing.  This makes it incredibly strange how we have an increasing number in the rates of SIDS but with no known cause, we have some theories like babies being shaken or lying down, but people haven't changed how they take care of babies that much in the past hundred years, so why now are we only seeing this phenomenon?

       Historically the childhood mortality rate was massive. Things like germ theory and antibiotics are still relatively recent developments. We're only seeing this phenomenon now because it was significantly overshadowed by babies dying of infection, flu, pneumonia, smallpox, etc.

       According to

        this document
       </a>
       (from march 30 1979) the company voluntarily withdrew one
       <em>
        suspected
       </em>
       vaccine lot as a precautionary measure:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        These actions were taken out of an abundance of caution because it is far from clear the analysis of available data by CDC and
FDA that there is any cause-and-effect relationship between this lot of DTP vaccine and the cluster of sudden infant deaths in
Tennessee.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is there any actual evidence to support "bad vaccine was killing children" or that "they decided to conceal the deaths"?

      <p>
       Would it not be more likely that the company decided to redistribute to prevent shortage at a single location in case of a future recall?

      <p>
       And just to be clear, this incident occured almost 40 years ago.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the
risk of SIDS was halved by immunisation.
There are a number of possible explanations for this find-
ing. The seasonal distribution in the occurrence of SIDS
[25] and the high prevalence of respiratory tract symptoms
suggests infection is a factor in SIDS [26]. A number of
different viruses and bacteria have been implicated [27].
Bordetella pertussis may be especially important as an asso-
ciation between epidemic pertussis and sudden unexpected
death in infants has been observed [28] and B. pertussis infec-
tion in infants frequently causes apnoea [29]. If apnoea leads
to the death of the infant the cause of death may inappropri-
ately be labelled as SIDS. The immunisation schedules in the
studies reported here all included immunisation with B. per-
tussis. Immunisation may reduce the incidence of reported
SIDS by reducing unrecognised B. pertussis infection.
Staphylococcus aureus strains producing enterotoxins
have been implicated in SIDS [30]. Immunisation may induce
antibodies that cross react with pyrogenic staphylococcal tox-
ins, thus protecting the infant from such infections [31,32].
Immunisation may also cause non-specific enhancement
of immunological activity and reduce infection from other
viruses and bacteria not directly covered by the vaccines given
[33,34].
The immediate effect of immunisation is similar to
that of a mild infection. In view of the often reported
association of SIDS with minor infection the ECAS study
specifically examined whether risk of SIDS was associated
        <br/>
        with immunisation in the last 7 days. They reported that
univariatly the OR was quite insignificant (OR = 1.27 with
95% CI = 0.89–1.81). After the multivariate adjustment the
OR remained insignificant.
Immunisations may be indirectly associated with a reduc-
tion in SIDS. Vaccination may be avoided during illness and
infections, the so-called healthy vaccinee effect [35]. Thus
the reduction in SIDS with immunisations may be a marker
of the well being of the infant, and not directly related to the
immunisation.
Children born into poor socio-economic circumstances are
less likely to be immunized [36,37]. In one study risk factors
for lack of immunisation include low socio-economic status,
maternal smoking and intention not to breastfeed [37], all of
which are known risk factors for SIDS. This illustrates the
importance of confounding [38]. However, in the multivari-
ate analysis the studies controlled for these factors and the
apparent protective effect remained (Fig. 2).
What should be advised? Certainly the data are in the
opposite direct to the assertion that immunisation causes
SIDS [1,2]. Parents can be reassured that immunisation with
vaccines on the current schedule, particularly DTP vaccine,
does not cause SIDS.
The benefits of immunisation are well established [39]. If
a country changes their immunisation schedule to a different
age, this provides an opportunity to examine changes in the
SIDS mortality rate for the age group covered by the change
in immunisation. If there is a causal relationship between immunisation and reduction in SIDS, then SIDS mortality
may be reduced further by achieving high immunisation rates
at the scheduled times in early infancy.

       yes, they found other documents along with this one, where they estimated how much one dead baby would cost them in lawsuit and they used this to set the market price for the vaccine.

       DTP Vaccines can't reduce SIDS risk by 50% in the days following the vaccine.  SIDS means unexplained death.
      </p>
      <p>
       They compare children that are too sick to receive a vaccine to children that are healthy and get the shots. The children that are sick have a greatly increased risk of dying that's why it seems that the vaccine reduces SIDS risk. In reality, it's the other children that have an increased risk of dying that has nothing to do with immunization.

       This is called healthy user bias.

      <p>
       It's ignored because no one cares as long as they can show the vaccine is safe. The studies are flawed don't show real world risks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same happens with flu vaccines. They seem to reduce mortality far more than you would expect but the problem is they also seem to work when it's not flu season so this can't be a real world effect.

       Other vaccine studies show mercury increases mental performance and MMR vaccination protects against autism.

       <p>
        The incidence of SIDS peaks at a time
when infants are receiving numerous
immunizations. Case reports of a cluster
of deaths shortly after immunization
with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis
in the late 1970s created concern of a
possible causal relationship between
vaccinations and SIDS.312–315 Case control
studies were performed to
evaluate this temporal association.
Four of the 6 studies found no relationship
between diphtheria-tetanuspertussis
vaccination and subsequent
SIDS,316–319 and results of the other 2
studies suggested a temporal relationship
but only in specific subgroup analysis.320,321 In 2003, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of
Sciences reviewed available data and
concluded that “[t]he evidence favors
rejection of a causal relationship between
exposure to multiple vaccinations
and SIDS.”322 Additional subsequent
large population case-control
trials consistently have found vaccines
to be protective against SIDS323–325;
however, confounding factors (social,
maternal, birth, and infant medical history)
might account for this protective
effect.326 It also has been theorized that
the decreased SIDS rate immediately
after vaccination was attributable to
infants being healthier at time of immunization,
or “the healthy vaccinee
effect.”327 Recent illness would both
place infants at higher risk of SIDS and
make them more likely to have immunizations
deferred.328
Recent studies have attempted to
control for confounding by social,
maternal, birth, and infant medical
history.323,325,328 In a meta-analysis,
Vennemann et al328 found a multivariate
summary OR for immunizations
and SIDS to be 0.54 (95% CI: 0.39 –
0.76), which indicates that the risk of
SIDS is halved by immunization. The
evidence continues to show no
causal relationship between immunizations
and SIDS and suggests that
vaccination may have a protective effect
against SIDS.

       The media barely covered that at all, and it was probably one of the largest health stories of that year. The fact they fudged the data on the study that resulted in the CDC saying, the case is settled no one should look at this anymore, should be alarming to anyone with a brain.

       Thats never the answer, though the more deeper you get the more you feel that way.  It's the fact that so much of the adverse reactions are hidden that we cant get more safety research done to improve vaccines, rather we attack anyone who dares state that a vaccine is anything less than perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand if you like vaccines, but to say 50+doses of vaccines has absolutely no detrimental effect on the population is just idiotic, prople are upset we cant talk about this to prptect "herd immunity" because god forbid anyone makes people legitimately concerned about vaccines

       Vaccines are the government so, you want them to shoot themselves in the foot? Good luck with that one.

       Wait, legitimate question here. And I could be missing something.

       But those documents don't state anything about bad batches.
      </p>
      <p>
       They indicate having to send different size batches based on the amount in a geographical area based on regulatory and federal requirements????
      </p>

       I am confused.

       I was under the impression that SIDS isn't actually a real thing. Doctors just tell parents that to minimize their anguish at losing their babies and the thinking that the baby could still be alive of they did something different.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, SIDS is unpreventable, but optimal parenting practices like breastfeeding, not cosleeping, sleeping on the back, etc, reduces the risks of SIDS happening significantly.

       It's not just SIDS but the so-called "Shaken Baby Syndrome" that may also be caused by vaccine reactions in many instances. Instances where a parent, family member or caregiver usually winds-up being criminally charged for the baby's death of injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The complete lack of any adequate and appropriate testing, reporting, and controlled studies and comparisons with unvaccinated groups of children to actually justify rather than merely assume that vaccines are completely safe is the biggest indication that they aren't safe at all.
