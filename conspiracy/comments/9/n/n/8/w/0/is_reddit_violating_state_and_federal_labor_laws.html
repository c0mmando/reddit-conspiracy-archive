       They make some extremely valid points on how Reddit seems to be breaking state labor laws, while they profit millions of dollars on the backs of "volunteer" mods.

       I mean they kind of do, most major mods on the big subreddits are owned by SEO marketing companies. Advertisers spend more money than you can imagine assuring something gets marked well. So its common sense for advertisers within certain fields to gain access to moderating what ever field they advertise within.

       I have a job, it pays me, I do that work voluntarily.

       The people that moderate these subs are volunteers, but Reddit isn't a non-profit. Im trying to think of other for profit companies that employ volunteers, but I'm at a loss.

       I think it's a valid point, that the moderators are an integral part of Reddit business model and provide a necessary service to the company without compensation.

       I think the question is should they be required to pay people to do this job. Yes people are doing it for free. Yes, they signed up for it. However, Reddit benefits greatly from the labor of these volunteers, and may be violating labor law by not hiring moderators.

       I understand your point. The mods volunteer their time because they get a kick out of it. That's true. They wouldn't be doing it if they didn't want to, I can't argue with that either.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that Reddit is a for profit company which employs unpaid volunteer workers and profits from their labor. This may be a violation of labor law. I'm not saying it definitely is illegal, only that it's an interesting point, and I don't think the idea should be easily dismissed.

       You're right. People are providing a service to Reddit, for free, and without this service the business would not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose the answer is a moderators union. Allow the moderators to bargain for compensation in return for their labor. Labor which has made Reddit a multimillion dollar corporation.

       They certainly would. I keep thinking of parallels to any labor movement though. Anytime workers try to organize the company tries to and usually does remove them, but often the workers prevail and win wage gains or different forms of compensation. Im truly curious if the value a good moderator brings to Reddit would be worth compensation. Any company would pay you nothing if you would work for free. Maybe eventually Reddit will have to pay moderators; maybe not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm thinking the admin accounts are sort of already paid moderators and they police the volunteers, so maybe in that way they are already paying for some moderation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, I'm not sure that they should be paid, I just find it a very interesting idea. The internet has escaped a lot of legislative oversight and I wonder if this won't be an issue in the future.

       It's voluntary, except that moderation is required in order to keep the large majority of subreddits from being shut down. On top of that, Reddit's popularity and ergo revenue stream is incredibly dependent on the free moderation that the users of the site provide. Can you imagine if the moderators of a large subreddit like
       <a href="/r/pics">
        /r/pics
       </a>
       decided overnight to stop doing their "job"? Reddit would surely co-opt the subreddit and hand it over to someone new, but why is that fair to those who have put so much time in to growing the subreddit to it's current size, which has surely brought in tons more revenue for Reddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       And then it begs the question how a subreddit with 20 million readers is being successfully moderated by only 28 volunteers? The answer is probably they are corporate plants who are paid full time by their own business entity to help certain marketing posts thrive in the Reddit ecosystem.

       Well, in America there was a bad law passed several months ago that basically said websites' owners are responsible for anything their users post; that is that they do have to moderate or get shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some websites are more enthusiastic about moderating than others though - there have been multiple attempts at a r/piracy discord for example, but Pisscord won't stand for it and shuts them all down.

       If reddit has volunteers doing a job, they can't have paid employees doing same job. That's how I read the law.

       Well, I don't believe that volunteers are employees, though I guess that I did seem to imply that I did. I was replying more to the dismissiveness of the OP.  I just think there's room for a discussion on how most of the social media mega-corps don't create anything, they only exist to extract capital from crowdsourced content.
      </p>
      <p>
       It reminds me of an always sunny episode where Charlie is asking Frank how his company makes money, what is their product. Frank replies "What do you mean? There is no product, we make money." These companies just make money, they build machines that can suck profit straight from the hive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, regarding reddit mods specifically, I think the (alleged) peer-controlled nature of reddit is the reason it even exists as it does.

       It’s actually how they get common people to do their bidding as well as get them drunk on the very little power they have. Think about it. A lot of mods LOVE having the power to ban people. Let’s be real. I think it’s just a way for the powers that be to give certain peons just a little taste of power ,and boy do they get addicted to it and eat it up. One of The things I always find it funny that moderators complain about is that they say how they are tired of censoring or having to ban people or how this or that is becoming too much work. I just tell them to step down then. If you’re not getting paid then you’re willingly doing the service. Don’t bitch about it. And then drag everybody down to try to make your job easier. Don’t like the job? Then leave! But you won’t! because you like to have that power! I’ve seen this bullshit happen on way too many subs and Facebook pages. Mods will bitch on how they don’t wanna have to do any of the work to monitor a sub. Then don’t! Nobody’s asking you to censor anything! but they won’t step down. why? Because they just want to keep that power plain and simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tldr: TPTB know that giving certain peons a little bit of power will go to their head. Therefore they will censor all the other peons because “yayyyy I finally have power over something for once!” It’s really just fucking sad. Moderators destroy free speech and free information. I have never had a brush with any mods on this Sub but I have had a lot on others. It just gets worse if they have lackeys or users that kiss their ass because then it’s like trying to avoid stealth mods.

       Does that mean mods see illegal shit before it gets taken away? Is it even likely that mods can get away with storing or hiding certain things they don't want to flag?

       After reading thorough the Federal labor laws, it's quite apparent to me that Reddit is indeed violating the FLSA or the Fair Labor Standards Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Labor uses a six-part test to determine whether an intern is considered an employee or not, and this determination is very fact-specific.  Each of the following factors must be established for the intern to be exempt from the requirements of the FLSA:  (1) the internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment; (2) the internship experience is for the benefit of the intern; (3) the intern does not displace regular employees, but instead works under close supervision of existing staff; (4) the company which provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern and, on occasion, its operations may actually be impeded; (5) the intern is not automatically entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship; and (6) the employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think several of these statues are clearly being violated by Reddit. Specifically statue (4) and (5).

        In fact, the unpaid intern should perform little or no productive work.  In this regard, employers should know that the DOL views filing, performing other clerical work, or assisting customers as the type of productive work that would create an employment relationship.  With this in mind, structure the program so that the intern – rather than the company – benefits most from the relationship.

       Very similar cases like this have already been decided. AOL moderator volunteers got a class lawsuit against AOL for back pay. Similar lawsuits have been done against volunteer tech support boards on hardware manufacture's websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also brings to mind companies abusing unpaid interns to do work otherwise done by a paid employee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, yes, if you're a for-profit business using volunteers to do work you'd otherwise have to pay someone to do, then legally they count as employees.

       Well, I don't believe that volunteers are employees, though I guess that I did seem to imply that I did. I was replying more to the dismissiveness of the OP.  I just think there's room for a discussion on how most of the social media mega-corps don't create anything, they only exist to extract capital from crowdsourced content.
      </p>
      <p>
       It reminds me of an always sunny episode where Charlie is asking Frank how his company makes money, what is their product. Frank replies "What do you mean? There is no product, we make money." These companies just make money, they build machines that can suck profit straight from the hive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, regarding reddit mods specifically, I think the (alleged) peer-controlled nature of reddit is the reason it even exists as it does.
