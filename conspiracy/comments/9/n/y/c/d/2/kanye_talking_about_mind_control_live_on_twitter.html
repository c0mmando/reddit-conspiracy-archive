    <div class="md"><p>“Why are you trying to make this partisan exactly?”</p>

<p>I don’t have to try to do anything exactly.</p>

<p>That’s the undeniable thing about facts, they are what they are. </p>

<p>So, I’m not making it anything, just commenting on what’s obviously happening.</p>

<p>If the facts don’t fit the story in your head, don’t argue with me about the facts. Just change the facts to fit the story in your head, like you libs always do.</p>

<p>Then when the fairytale in your head doesn’t come true, you can blame yourselves (actually taking responsibility should be a new experience for you, so be careful), and leave me and the rest of the sane population out of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of the &#39;craziness&#39; vibe that you get from him is his lack of his ability to actually express what he&#39;s thinking.</p>

<p>For instance, in this video he is talking about the idea of inception. He calls it mind control, but as an analogy/metaphor.</p>

<p>I think he&#39;s starting to grasp a number of ideas and realizing how caught up in it he was. I get that he&#39;s a wrapper and he &#39;writes words&#39; for a living, but when you see him express his thoughts in the moment, they always come out wrong. This is also symptomatic of autistic tendencies as well right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I think if you flipped the names he’s using with one another, he’d be cheered and would be making headlines in the MSM as a truth prophet, called “hero”. The only reason he’s being treated like this, in my opinion, is because he supports Trump. It’s a very unenviable situation and I admire the courage it takes to speak for his convictions while being in the center of this modern ideological hurricane, so to speak. </p>

<p>It&#39;s getting to the point where the angry left are sounding 
more like my ultraconservative grandparents when they refuse to watch anything with George Clooney, Jane Fonda, etc.</p>

<p>The only reason he has a platform that people care about is because he is a successful musician, has an overzealous clothing line, and put a baby in a Kardashian. This is putting way too much stock in people&#39;s political beliefs.</p>

<p>No one puts thought to people on here writing that they are being gang stalked, believes in mind control, and otherwise obvious signs of mental illness in the paranoid varieties. </p>

<p>The only reason this is an issue is because Fox and CNN are arguing about it. Also, look at the comment you bounced in on. Does it look like they are speaking from a place that might be concerned about his mental well being? Especially if he is manic, as you say.</p>

<p>Who gives a shit that celebrities meet and hang out with the president. Nixon kicked it with Elvis, Obama with Jay-z and Bono, Kennedy fucked Monroe, and Ronald Reagan kicked it with Michael Jackson and others.</p>

<p>People really need to feel like they have to explain how an entire thread should feel about a topic, when half are going to meme it, some are going to invest and get into it, some are going to to naysay, people are going to get up at the naysaying, especially if it&#39;s against a comment like the top.</p>

<p>People need to chill the fuck out and let people be.</p>

<p>Kanye seems like a nice guy, but we shouldn’t put too much into his political ramblings. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s only because he&#39;s favouring someone you&#39;re politically against. He&#39;s guilty by association just like anyone who brushes shoulders with Trump.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure who you&#39;re trying to fool exactly or if this is just pure tribalism ideology bullshit, one thing is for sure there is 0 logic behind anything you&#39;re saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is badly acted attempt at getting more people addicted to pills for life. The acting and directing would be hilarious if the goal wasn&#39;t so sinister. That dude has no street cred in the eyes of his targeted audience. </p>

<p>Today, I heard a hip hop song - I need to take my medication unh, to make my head feel right unh unh. Something like that. I did laugh, but only one side of my lips formed a smile; the other side was a frown.</p>

<p>I empathize with him because I understand where he is coming from in his thought processes. I think in a very similar fashion.</p>

<p>I&#39;d have a beer with the man anytime.</p>
