       Worth mentioning that Caitlyn is a lifelong Republican who voted for Trump last election (and Kanye was supportive of her transition). Even if you were joking, it's not a good idea to let political tribalism define your reality.

       “Why are you trying to make this partisan exactly?”
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t have to try to do anything exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s the undeniable thing about facts, they are what they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I’m not making it anything, just commenting on what’s obviously happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the facts don’t fit the story in your head, don’t argue with me about the facts. Just change the facts to fit the story in your head, like you libs always do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when the fairytale in your head doesn’t come true, you can blame yourselves (actually taking responsibility should be a new experience for you, so be careful), and leave me and the rest of the sane population out of it.

       Bad things tend to start happening to people who try to spread a positive message and preach unity and love. Regardless of his antics in the past, I hope he stays safe and keeps the positive messages flowing. We need more of that type of message especially in the hip hop community.

       He’s being called crazy because he’s exhibiting manic behavior, and what he’s saying is mostly unintelligible rambling. No depth to his thoughts, just surface level bullshit.  I know people that act like that because they are mentally ill. 
And how can you spread positivity and unity when you support a garbage person like the president, the most divisive, dishonest and mean spirited person to occupy the office? 
Kanye seems like a nice guy, but we shouldn’t put too much into his political ramblings.

       I think a lot of the 'craziness' vibe that you get from him is his lack of his ability to actually express what he's thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, in this video he is talking about the idea of inception. He calls it mind control, but as an analogy/metaphor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he's starting to grasp a number of ideas and realizing how caught up in it he was. I get that he's a wrapper and he 'writes words' for a living, but when you see him express his thoughts in the moment, they always come out wrong. This is also symptomatic of autistic tendencies as well right.

       I disagree. I think if you flipped the names he’s using with one another, he’d be cheered and would be making headlines in the MSM as a truth prophet, called “hero”. The only reason he’s being treated like this, in my opinion, is because he supports Trump. It’s a very unenviable situation and I admire the courage it takes to speak for his convictions while being in the center of this modern ideological hurricane, so to speak.

       That's a really black and white, low level of critical thinking there. You are suggesting moving mere words(pronouns in this case) around would change everything, as if those words aren't tied to meanings, actions, beliefs, etc.

       The only reason he has a platform that people care about is because he is a successful musician, has an overzealous clothing line, and put a baby in a Kardashian. This is putting way too much stock in people's political beliefs.

       No one puts thought to people on here writing that they are being gang stalked, believes in mind control, and otherwise obvious signs of mental illness in the paranoid varieties.

      <p>
       The only reason this is an issue is because Fox and CNN are arguing about it. Also, look at the comment you bounced in on. Does it look like they are speaking from a place that might be concerned about his mental well being? Especially if he is manic, as you say.

You probably only watched the edited version of his meeting with trump, it's quite the polar opposite of what you're saying, and it was even reported by CNN trump didn't like his antics and what he was talking about where if you watched the interview he was quite impressed.

       Kanye is so interesting to me. I hope he’s okay and has found the right balance of his meds, whether it be different ones, or lower doses, whatever.

       Not sure what everyone here is getting from this... literally just seems like his management team, or record label is trying to get him to act a certain way to get mainstream money flowing in.... he didn't say anything at ALL about a larger government or rather "they" doing anything to him.

       It just seems like he and his agents, management, record label etc are having creative differences lol

       He's surrounded with fame whores and it's just too much for him. He's creative and can't live with PR porn people. Divorce soon, especially if they don't stand behind him, which they won't, because than they'll be in danger of loosing their empire.
