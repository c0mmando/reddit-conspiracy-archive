    <div class="md"><p>Warren is a dnc hack. She&#39;s no different than most of the senators. </p>

<p>Gabbard had the balls to resign her position to stand with bernie. Warren endorsed Clinton instead. Why would you want to see her anywhere near the oval office?</p>

<p>Oh I see. Beat trump. Thats really all you care about? Sounds straight out of the dnc 2018/2020 handbook</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I prefer Sanders/Gabbard for exactly that reason.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;m no american so I have no skin in the game, and am merely making observations here. Running a Clintonite against Trump for a second time won&#39;t work, so if the DNC wants to win the elections they are going to have to try something else, and I think they got a chance by using the grassroots movement of their leftwing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ket Tulsi at standing rock. Shes quite like I am. Right down to the military police in the army thing (I&#39;m out now)</p>

<p>But id rather see her run as an independent as the 2 party system is a sham. </p>

<p>Spent like 30 mins talking to her at standing rock as I was at the time a memver of a nonprofit tryibg to get her to run. Basically trying to super Pac without the money. I left bc the people thought too small but shes an ideal candidate for progressives all thw way to center right people. </p>

<p>But the dnc will do anything to keep her from a nomination. Even more than bernie. She thre2e shit in their face</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the electoral college vote. In the states that gave Donald Trump a win in the electoral college, he won by a margin of 80,000 votes. If you flip 80,000 votes out of 140 million, Clinton wins.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard to understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But apparently it&#39;s hard for you to understand that Trump didn&#39;t qin by a razor thin margin. You can&#39;t isolate 1 of the thousands of county votes. Generally, presidential elections are pretty even. However, within those pretty even counties, he took WAY more than she did.</p>

<p>If you barely win in 304 versus your opposition which got 277, that isnt razor thin. </p>

<p>Or is it that hard for you to admit that she ran a horrible campaign and got smeared?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The electoral college doesn&#39;t reflect his margin of victory. His winning margin was 80,000 votes spread across three states. In terms of a national election, it doesn&#39;t get any more razor thin than that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re trying to say about counties, that doesn&#39;t really make any sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s indeed a very good question.</p>

<p>I disagree with you though on Bernie&#39;s chances of beating her. If they hadn&#39;t declared supers early, and if Bernie came out believing in himself from the start, it would have been a landslide. Even now, if he just had taken the gloves off he might have won it. But he was very gentle, and didn&#39;t hammer hard enough on the issues where she showed weakness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, for example. But there were issues where the hurt could have been piled on even more, because they&#39;d have struck home with the core democrat voters.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, the emails thing should actually have been treated as a criminal conspiracy, because she was in blatant violation of FOIA laws, but when it comes to elections policy positions could have been more useful. When she drew the woman card, for example, Sanders could have pointed out how she treated the accusers of her husband. When she drew the inequality card, it could be pointed out how it&#39;s Clinton-era laws that actually have created a situation which allowed the 2008 crisis to happen (which did hurt a lot of poor to lower middle class people).</p>

<p>Spent like 30 mins talking to her at standing rock as I was at the time a memver of a nonprofit tryibg to get her to run. Basically trying to super Pac without the money. I left bc the people thought too small but shes an ideal candidate for progressives all thw way to center right people. </p>
