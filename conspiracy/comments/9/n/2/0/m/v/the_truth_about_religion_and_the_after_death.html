<p>Which means if you loose your body you wont be able to reach the afterlife.</p>

<p>In fact afterlife is brought by reversing necrose. Which is regenerating dead body cells with remaining dna.</p>

<p>Now if you think about it :</p>

<p>If alien civs have evoluated tech able to reach earth they can reverse necrose too. </p>

<p>Ask youself why ancient egyptians, mesopotamians, canarians, chinese, indonesians, mayans, aztecs, natives americans and incas did it ?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it weird that all those civs built pyramids and preserved elites with mummies. Moreover the gods in those religions were most of the times coming for skies or the cosmos.</p>

<p>I mean if religion was brought by aliens how would you take it ?</p>

<p>Moreover in genesis when god creates first humans the description uses plural. Even if it may be a polite form it could be taken literaly as written.</p>

<p>Who knows perhaps it was their religion their belief about a supreme being they brought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean there is a lot if possibilities. Anyways reversing necrose is possible because some forms of life can do it. I think that very evoluated alien civs would focus on fighting death because after solving political and economical issues what remains left is death. Reversing necrose would be an eternal solution because unless yozr body would desintegrate you would live forever until the end of times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jellyfish. Turritopsis dohrnii, or Turritopsis nutricula, is a small (5 millimeters (0.20 in)) species of jellyfish that uses transdifferentiation to replenish cells after sexual reproduction. This cycle can repeat indefinitely, potentially rendering it biologically immortal. Well there are ways of regenerating cells. But many scientist believe you could reverse necrose if there is enough left dna and biologic material. I think it might be weird to accept the possibility because it may seem come from science fiction. But many things were considered impossible in the past and mankind achieved it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth about life after death is that we have been deceived for thousands of years.  Jesus was from Barbelo, the immortal realm from which most of us hark from.  Jesus called Yahweh, the god of the Jews, evil, and told his disciples that they worship a god that was <em>not</em> his father.  He continuously tried to get people to meditate, before anyone knew what meditating was - and almost all of the stories in the bible are allegory for the mind.  The story of Noah&#39;s Ark has entirely to do with fortifying your mental will to be ready in the face of the greatest adversities.  That, however, is one of the biggest problems with old religions, the mix of allegory and fact.  The Ark of the Covenant, for example, DID exist, and was the first means and method of communication and interaction with what we, humanity, were told were Gods.  Unfortunately, they had extremely malevolent intentions, and now we have to deal with the shitstorm of a religious structure that the Jews created revolving around this insane entity.</p>
