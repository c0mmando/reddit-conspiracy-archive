    <div class="md"><p>I met one of many teenagers that would do this on video chat sites (as volunteers). They would get them on camera, screenshot their face, record their IP address, (but do this only after ) a conversation they had with the individual immediately led to sexual things with minors.  They did not set these perpetrators up, they would quite quickly implicate themselves because of their anonymity.  Apparenrly these teenagers also had parents that worked in law enforcement. 
Don&#39;t know what ever happened with it or how successful they were...I only had just met the one person, and even just the idea of this going on (rampant pedos) discouraged me from wanting to talk to anyone on video sites.  </p>

<p>I can imagine it would get fatiguing. It&#39;s more common than we&#39;d want to think it is. Pizzagate woke me up to the concept that it&#39;s all happening around us and that child trafficking is literally an industry, not a myth. I always had the belief that it was just a terrible thing that happened by few evil men because television shows and fiction told me those were who would be interested in children.</p>

Just as most veterans, he didn&#39;t spoke much about his deployment, but this time, watching several guest&#39;s kids playing around, he began sobbing while unloading his sadness, his fury, his impotence at the treatment to minors he saw in the place he was stationed. How he nor anyone could do anything because <em>it woud jeopardize operations and cooperation with locals there</em>. How the <em>dancing boys</em>, the brutal abuse they endured daily was just part of the culture there, as normal as the setting sun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe this topic is essential to waking people up though. I think some of the sickest people that run this planet perpetuate anything that goes along with this agenda. You can do a lot more than you think. Start educating those people around you about what exactly is been going on the past several decades. Tell them that this practice isn’t exactly new and has been practiced on the earth for thousands of years generally by elite societies/circles what ever you want to call it at this point. Tell people this doesn’t just happen with your every day pervert on the street but can happen even in the highest powers of society. The hire it goes the more concealed it can be. Do you go to college anywhere? Start making flyers with links to the videos I’m about to link down below. Just post that shit all over the school. I did it back when I went to school with certain conspiracies I was into at the time. You’ll definitely get peoples attention. This topic also shook me to my core just remember to take frequent breaks. I need to do this myself but the information is always so entrancing cause I feel whoever is at the bottom of this garbage is also responsible for many other reasons why the world is complete shit. It’s a rabbit hole ,good luck.</p>

<p>Imperium (most crucial video imo) just came out a few weeks ago and it ties it all together. Pretty long video but worth it.</p>

<p>Who took Johnny: This documentary is pretty important in my opinion because anybody that doubts this or thinks it doesn’t affect them is wrong. It shows how entire police force and beyond decided to just sweep it all under the rug. And not only can The powers that be get victims off the streets but they can walk right up to your own neighborhood and pluck them out from under you and you can’t do a damn thing about it. Or theyll just find a way to funnel them out of the child protective services units. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. When you orgasm, you are tapping into divine power and blissing out with it. Instead of selfishly enjoying the orgasm, you can transmute that moment of power and steer the energy towards a visualization of what you wish to come to be. For example, I&#39;ll orgasm and close my eyes and envision the world wrapped in light, burning out the evils and veils and praying/willing/wishing for the hopes and dreams of those people aligned with love and light to come true. Adjust according to whatever your higher-self needs.</p>

Pedophilia is part of a sexual orientation. People don&#39;t choose it and just because they&#39;re afflicted with it, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re doing sexual things with children (or indulging it in any other way).<br/>
And, no, I&#39;m not a pedophile - just someone who likes truth and fairness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s interesting we think our human efforts are superior options to prayer. But I have to admit that’s how my brain thinks and I have to remind myself <em>Who</em> we are appealing to and the vastness of His resources.  It’s probably something we could use even if more opportunities came up. And, yes it’s very helpful to let God do the work and rest in His peace. He uses even the wicked to accomplish His purposes. He works all things together for the good of those who love Him.  </p>

<p>Glad to hear of your faith, it’s all about growing in it until we see Him. But yeah, these kids’ suffering weighs on me too.  So, I keep asking for His will on earth as it is  in heaven. </p>
