        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Recently there’s been something I noticed all around media is that ever since Saudi Arabia’s men killed a Washington post contributor, all sorts of organizations, celebrities, company’s have been rejecting any business with Saudi Arabia. Trumps response was dislike for what happened but vague. So the whole media is against Saudi Arabia, but why now? Why not before? Saudi Arabia is pretty harsh when it comes to their policies, and they suck at human rights before but now this is the final straw? Killing a man who was a Washington post contributor? I mean is that unprecedented or something? They’ve done worse shit than this but this is what gives people the most attention? Why push this narrative now? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has incited violence, has sexual assaulted people and then bragged about it, he raped his ex-wife according to her own words. He has been breaking the emmouluments clause of the Constitution since day 1 by taking money from foreign states through his properties, he has statistically lied publicly more than any President in American History, He has implemented a tax policy that increased our national debt deastically and places the highest burden on working families while giving Billionaires massive tax cuts that they are hording. His tarrifs are naking goods more expensive at home and now are leading to mass lay offs in some of Americas bigfest industries. He pulled out of the Paris Accords and has rolled back the protections for clean air and  water and lowered fuel standards so that our planet will face greater paril at the exact moment we need to be addressing climate change. He has destabilized the Western alliances that have been the backbone of world peace and order for 70 years. He committed tax fraud to  avoid paying the estate tax on his father&#39;s vast fortune. He has notoriously cheated and Shirley on his business obligations through out his life and ruined the lives and businesses of many people. He was a close friend of Jeffery Epstein and testified to spending time with him and &quot;young girls&quot; on his pedo island. He has attacked the families of dead service members in the media multiple times. He has obstructed justice in the Mueller investigation continually and may have committed treason.... I can keep going but if you don&#39;t get the point by now it&#39;s not worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has definitely vilified the media for saying things about him that he doesn&#39;t like, most of which are provably true, most of which is just people reacting to or reporting on the things he does and says that most people find abhorrent, or at the very least very unusual for the POTUS according to polling. He absolutely has used violent rhetoric towards the media and reporters. During the campaign after one of his rallies two journalists were thrown down a flight of stairs and beaten by a mob of Trump supporters, he calls them the &quot;enemy of the people&quot;, &quot;evil&quot; etc. Just Google Trump inciting violence, and see it  and hear it with your own eyes and ears. No president or candidate has ever done that before. He openly encouraged people to perform acts of violence, saying he would pay for their bail, then they did at his events. He is a fucking liar, and a tyrant, and a bully and if you care about democracy you need to realize he is not your friend. He is only in it for himself and his rich buds, look at his legislation and tax breaks and who it&#39;s directed towards. Also mockingbird did not authorize anyone to use propaganda against the President of the United States, and was designed to be directed towards the cold war to stop the spread of communism. Also Trump is in total control of those institutions that could impliment such propaganda and he could literally order it to stop if it was happening, it&#39;s completely within the realm of his authrotiy, with zero of the conflict of interest aspects that keep him from interfering with something like Mueller&#39;s investigation. So yeah its not happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a fucking historian. The CIA isn&#39;t innocent by any stretch but the President does have a large amount of influence over their activities and appoints their director,  who reports directly to POTUS, who can direct policy, and can cancel ops. If you really think Trump is engaged in some deep state war, the first thing he would do is overhaul the leadership of the CIA and cancel all the programs that were working against him, because he certainly has the legal authority to do so as POTUS. He is challenging every single legal limit on his power and check to his authority, why would he not address his number one issue, which is the bad press he gets when he absolutely could do so if it was all CIA propaganda?</p>
