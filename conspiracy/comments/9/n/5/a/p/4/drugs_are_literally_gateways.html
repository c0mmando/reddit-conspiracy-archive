    <div class="md"><p>Genuine question, if what we see on drugs is what we’re actually supposed to see... why wasn’t that instilled in us from the beginning? </p>

<p>I think drugs (natural ones like weed) are very spiritual. I sort of relate it to the Bible story when god created us and wanted us to be oblivious and unaware of our nakedness and whatnot... you think that was taken away because of sin? And drugs are just a way back to that?</p>

<p>In that case, why aren’t drugs good for us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the spirit of the classic philosophers I think drugs should be only used to reach an end that inculcates virtue or some other definitive good. Weed and mushrooms can expand your sympathies, heal inner demons, and encourage you to break the matrix of government and media control. They can also cause psychotic breaks, particularly psychedelics. Likewise with any other drugs, opium can heal pain but terribly break you with addiction, alcohol can facilitate social interactions but make you a hot mess. The struggle is to know when to call it quits, to know when you&#39;re abusing something as an end in itself and not a higher goal. Source- former opiate addict and current 420/ Lsd enthusiast. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with drugs and the perception of reality through your consciousness is a massive topic. Bear with me for a couple of minutes. </p>

<p>This life, which we experience as life, is most probably just one of countless experiences we had/have right now and will have in the &#39;future&#39;. This life is probably a life set of experiences which you chose for yourself to evolve as a person. You most likely chose you parents and arranged circumstances to meet certain people at the right time in your life.
Your life experience is highly Individual as is e everyone else&#39;s.
You enter this life without memories of your true existence or your past/future lives. You experience a kind of veil which lets you forget. The reason for this is to make your experience genuine and really let you learn your lesson on earth. If you already knew what you had to learn, why live a life with all ups and downs? You knew you would have to act a certain way but this development would not stem from you, it would not occur naturally. All you have to guide you through your life is your Intuition, your gut feeling, your inner voice. Listen to it. </p>

<p>So you experience this Illusion to learn, and certain substances, I am talking about hallucinogenics, let you peak through this veil of forgetting if you wish to do so. </p>

<p>You get a glimpse of the World behind the Illusion, you sometimes see that you are never alone on your journey. That there are always kind spirits around which try to give you hints to keep you on your personal track. </p>

<p>However the most important concept is that you should understand there is more to your existence than your physical body, but also understand that your life in a human body is an invaluable experience. So rough and beautiful and you should enjoy every minute of it.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions just ask away or pm if you like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read countless books on metaphysical topics and meditate a lot. In one of those they had a couple of chapters on a series of experiments on regressive hypnosis and some people there at some point just remembered their past lives together without knowing each other. Though you will never get &#39;proof&#39; in the usual sense, you will Start to see a pattern and see that a lot of concepts are, and have been, pretty similar for thousands of years. </p>

<p>Just look at this Planet and all the beings living on it. Every being only being capable of a certain range of interaction with its surroundings and other beings, based on the capability of its consciousness. </p>

<p>Now imagine a simple ant. The ant shares the same Environment with you, but you will never be able to explain to an ant what you are. It walks on Highways, in houses, but will never understand what are cars what are houses, at least not in this &#39;ant form&#39;. The same probably goes for us humans in this Form and extraterrestrials just that we are the &#39;ants&#39; in their eyes. </p>

<p>The basic idea of this principle is the Evolution of ones consciousness.</p>

<p>I mean you really have to think/meditate a lot about these workings of life as they are incredibly rich in facets and detailed layers but every now and then you hear a biography of someone or see something in your life and it will just &#39;click&#39; , you will understand the concept or small parts of a grand concept.</p>

<p>Words are also only Part of this Illusion and are oftentimes not capable of explaining something sufficiently for they can only give hints, but true understanding comes from within yourself. This goes for mathematical concepts in school as for metaphysical concepts which you are interested in. This also has to do with the workings of the universe:</p>

<p>Why do people have sudden Inspiration, this influx of creativity at a given point. Or if you think long and Hard about something is this thinking just another Form of what other people might call prayer or Meditation and is it just that some people seem more intelligent because they are just better tuned in to this constantly available influx of Information because they already had a couple life spans more to practice and are therefore better able to access it? So if you have a Problem and think really hard how to solve it, did you come up with the solution yourself, or did your cosmic antenna, your brain, just match the right channel through countless tries of synchronization to receive the correct influx from the infinite knowledge of the universe? </p>

<p>You should check out what Einstein and especially Tesla said about consciousness and Inspiration. </p>

<p>If you are interested in a basic book I would suggest &#39;Stalking the wild pendulum&#39; from izhak bentov. It is a Quick fun read and offers a lot of concepts in a relatively easy to digest Form. </p>

He found out through my therapist(she sent him notes) that said I took mushrooms before and he grilled me saying he’s seen patients of his get completely “fried” from acid and shrooms and that they had literally no memory and became schizophrenic. I told him that there’s a balance to everything and microdosing wouldn’t lead to those effects and that they may have had those issues prior, and that I did them because I read multiple studies that showed psilocybin helps with depression and I’m just trying to fix myself. </p>

<p>he had nothing to respond to that so he turned to his computer, said “well that’s my two cents” then prescribed my Wellbutrin. </p>

<p>Oh yeah he also told me that most of the pot sold in our giant metropolitan area of 1.5 million people is laced with PCP. Idk wtf is up with this guy but he’s definitely bought off to say the least. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re rich, have your own private property and a reliable elite supplier you can pretty much overdose as much as you want. The problem is that laws regarding drug use tend to get stricter and stricter as time goes on due to what I call &quot;democratic buildup&quot; – laws are easy to vote in but impossible to remove, leading to an increasingly encrusted legal system that stifles innovation, slows down growth and leads to eventual collapse of the society under foreign invasion, at which point everything starts all over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many people talking about the positive effects of drugs. I think they just got lucky. Here are the negatives. Posting a conversation I had on this sub on this topic - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9kvb9l/the_gnostics_were_the_original_christians_who_got/e73op79/?context=20">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9kvb9l/the_gnostics_were_the_original_christians_who_got/e73op79/?context=20</a> -</p>

<p>Question - I think you may be right. So why now the re-emerging popularity of these substances? It just seems quite suspicious to me.</p>

<p>My reply - Actually these substances can be used in a variety of ways, both to further human evolution, or to place us under the control of dark entities by weakening our natural defenses.</p>

<p>When we are &#39;high&#39; we open ourselves to further influence from subtle beings, mostly of a base nature. Think about what people usually do when they&#39;re high. Listen to trap music, watch comedy shows, watch tptb sponsored stuff, and sometimes they meditate. During all of this, they are susceptible to psychic attacks and programming.</p>

<p>Meditation while high is especially dangerous, because we are consciously stepping into the subtle plane and trying to leave our gross body. This makes it even easier for entities to interfere, those who don&#39;t have our best interests at heart. But drugs can also grant siddhis - mystic abilities. So it is a tossup. I believe the usual activities promoted by the TPTB, such as listening to trap music and watching &#39;trippy&#39; videos, is to deteriorate our consciousness. As such, they are promoting drugs to the seekers as a cool activity.</p>

<p>They want to cut short our spiritual evolution by providing us a wrong path to take.</p>

<p>Question - If this is true, then shouldn&#39;t we be recommending that no one use these substances without the guidance of an experienced person? Promotion of the wholesale use of these substances by people unbelieving or unknowledgeable about the spiritual aspects will lead to far greater harm than good, imho.</p>

<p>My reply - And that is what TPTB are doing. They present it as something &#39;underground&#39;, a way of resisting them, a gateway to enlightenment, a secret storehouse of power being restricted by the government etc. This all leads to a greater desire for consuming these substances without considering the consequences first.</p>

<p>Ayahuasca is used under the guidance of shamans. That is one way to do it. Personally I believe one should not take any intoxicants whatosever (including tea, coffee). Srila Prabhupada, a great spiritual personality, and many other hindu saints, have completely prohibited intoxicants.</p>

<p>Marijuana? Making it illegal to let the paper industry squash out any traction of hemp, which is the superior material in many scenarios.</p>

<p>Hemp grown and cultivated for by Mexican farmers (refugees) </p>

<p>Reefer madness making black jazz musicians lust over your white wives? The propaganda was so ridiculous but if you lived during those times it would have sold you too.</p>

<p>Drug use/creation/prohibition in society in <em>all</em> forms are meticulously crafted to keep people down, distracted, jailed, killed. All for money. That’s always what it’s for</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The illegal substances I could have possibly took were very amazing, for lack of a better word. My mind wondered without boundaries, bias seemed to disappear, empathy increased...feelings I can only describe as being one with the world. </p>

<p>Now the prescription drugs are a whole different story. They got me high, made me numb and hurt people with little to no regard for how they felt or the consequences that were a certainty. </p>

<p>The mind opening shit is still illegal, yet the shit that keeps you dumbed down comes in a nice shinny orange bottle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drugs like cocaine, meth, crack, heroin etc. keep me from believing this wholeheartedly. Maybe naturally occuring hallucinogens. Even though weed just makes me more positive and relaxed, its not like I&#39;m having ultra enriching epiphanies or solving heavily ingrained phobias. Idk maybe i smoke too much weed and deal with too many junkies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In reaction to OP, what I&#39;ve gathered over the years is that the positive &quot;life-changing&quot; effect of some psychedelics, mostly LSD, is the least of the lawmakers concerns, as far as they&#39;re aware of it or take it seriously. 
When you consider that illegal drugs is the 2nd or 3rd market in the world in terms of value, you rapidly come the conclusion that it is an irreplaceable commodity necessary to our economy. Our banks depend on it, as well as the stability of our nations, since once the money is laundered and &quot;in the system&quot;, it is indistinguishable from any other source. It brings such an amount of liquidity that, if it was to be subtracted instantly from the global economy, I wager it would create a crisis on a scale never seen before.
Our governments know this. All the while they pretend to be fighting a war on drugs that is more akin to a war on the poor, which allow the police to conduct searches and shoot people, keep tabs on almost anyone they want... but the last thing they want is to win this war, a war lost in advance by its very nature anyway. </p>
