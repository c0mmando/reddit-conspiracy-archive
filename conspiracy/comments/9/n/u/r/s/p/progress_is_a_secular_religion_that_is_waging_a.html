       "Progress" is essentially meaningless. Ask an avowed  progressive what they think progress means and they can't tell you,  they can just give examples of what makes them feel good. They will say, progress is making everything better for more people. Okay,  who defines what is better?  It may be better to you,  but  not to a Amish community. Progress to the Amish is conservatism. Here we can clearly show that "progress" is a relative term with no unified meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it doesn't actually mean anything what is it?  Well like any ideology the elite and the masses have two different interpretations. They tell us progress will be freedom and leisure, but in truth progress to the elite is the death of what they see as vermin or beasts. We are nothing more than cattle to our financial elite overlords.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Progress" is a new religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the recent developments concerning Kanye West we have seen a backlash from the left. Racist screeds of "Kanye is a minstrel" on CNN..  The "progressive" agenda has many golems. They need sacrifices to get what they see as a moral and better future. But that requires destroying the society we currently have i.e. "progress". You see that is why they are so dangerous. They are thinking religiously. Ask them, they can't tell you what progress means. It's zealotry. They want to destroy our society but can't even articulate why....
      </p>
      <p>
       Long live the the traditions of our ancestors. Build something. Don't be a Marxist who is incapable and must tear down what others have built.

       The founding principles included a rubric for change. The Americans system allowed for what you see as "progress" and I see as politics.

       Well then that is because tptb have manipulated you into thinking that progress is a dirty word in hopes that you will reject changes that described by everyone else as progress. Expanding voting rights to women, black people, and non-lander owners is definitional progress: it is a step towards a goal of a government that represents the people. If you have a knee jerk response to hearing it described that way, you should be asking why.

       You mean the parliamentary monarchies where the monarchs hold no power and the political body is essentially social democratic in nature? Those places would be considered pretty far left in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do you mean places like Saudi Arabia and Syria? Because I honestly can't think of an advanced country where the monarch actually holds significant political power.

       Hey, I consider myself a progressive and can tell you what that means. It means that I support reform movements that seek to curb the excesses of the current system that exploit, degrade, harm, and divide the people. It means that I want children to have access to nutritious foods and seniors to have access to medical care. It means that I want workers to be paid enough to live without having to rely on welfare or charity, and that no one is denied opportunities in the labor market based on their race, sex, gender, religion, or political beliefs. It means I want the Amish to be able to continue being Amish, while I continue to be a secular person who drives a car and watches porn.
      </p>
      <p>
       This idea that so-called progressive values, the belief that people can live a higher quality of life than our pre-modern ancestors, is not some evil Marxist plot. Stop listening to the capitalist shills who tell you this in order to sell you a false bill of goods. You want traditionalism? You want to be a serf? You want to live your life working for an aristocratic system that controls every aspect of your life and makes you thank them for the privilege? You want to let all political decisions be controlled by the monied elite and for you to lose any voice in society? I didn’t think so. Stop fetishizing the past. Stop romanticizing a way of life that existed before we knew what germs were. Stop being a shill for the financial and political elite who would rather exploit you than let you have a seat at the table.

       The problem is not population, it’s inefficencies and inequity in the global food system. The solution is better farming techniques and better resource distribution. Arbitrary measures to control population growth by restricting people’s freedom to procreate are unethical and always a non-starter, but having the ability to control one’s reproductive future is important. There is a reason why economically/industrially developed countries have lower birth rates beyond access to contraceptives: child labor is not necessary to support the family unit. The solution is not a return to or fetishization of traditional subsistence farming (which history shows is often not enough for subsistence!!), but a more intelligent design of the food production system.

       Gonna have to agree with you and the other user. I see where they are coming from and what they want and see what you put out with over population and how do we feed everyone healthy food. Saw what she said about wages and health care. I wish that everyone was able to afford healthier choices. The problem with all of that stems down to what kind of environment we were raised in. If you or everyone were raised on  tap food, you will have a pretty shitty life in and out of the doctors office. If we all are healthy I bet we would see a lot less people in the hospitals.

       Because you haven't given a definition to 'traditional values'. Sure, 'progressive' is a relative term, but so is yours. You can poke holes in any ubiquitous term such as 'democracy', 'Christianity', 'conspiracy', 'traditional values', etc. So do tell, what's your definition of traditional values? And what ancestors should we hold as tradition? You can't accuse others of being vague if you do it yourself.

       The problem may be that well meaning, just ideas for our society (Progressive concepts) are taken by nefarious players and weaponized to actually bring about the opposite results. For example, Black Lives Matter, advocates for equity and is against police brutality —this makes a lot of sense.  That is, until you realize it is being used to create division and chaos within the society, to distract and weaken it, so manipulation by those in power is enabled.  It is not about progressive or traditional values, but against both and for totalitarianism. Both progressive and traditional values have a lot in common.  If there was a level playing field, both would work in harmony bec they begin with common ground of justice for all.  Whereas TPTB want to give us peace at the price of our freedom.
