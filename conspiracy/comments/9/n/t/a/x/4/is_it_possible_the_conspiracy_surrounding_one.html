<p>Who has the most to gain and the most to loose from unification?</p>

<p>It is my opinion that tptb have the most to lose from global unification. Here&#39;s how:</p>

<p>-Tax shelters would no longer be availabe</p>

<p>-Environmental regulation on a global level can&#39;t be circumvented as easily - &gt; lower profit margins</p>

<p>-if there is no more countries to go to war with the bloated military industrial complex would be fucked.</p>

<p>I truly believe a one world government (in theory) is the solution to the bulk of our problems. Change my view?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Different people deserve to be ruled primarily by their own people.  </p>

<p>Imagine for a second, a one world Democratic Government.  America makes up 4% of the World&#39;s population.  Our sovereignty, our ability to make rules and laws for ourselves would be utterly destroyed.  Also, bad rulers happen.  The damage to the world done by a bad ruler is terrible, but minimized when there are 100+ rulers around the globe then when there is one.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t believe in cooperation between governments.  Treaties are fine.  Trade deals (perhaps not the ones the U.S. has negotiated over the past 25 years or so, but in a vacuum) are fine.  Setting up world bodies like the U.N. or the IAEA is fine.  </p>

<p>Also, one thing I don&#39;t think the right leaning people of this sub have fully conceptualized yet is how little TPTB need governments in order to achieve their aims.  When businesses become large enough and powerful enough, they can strip individual liberty just as quickly and completely as governments can, and when the government is weak, beholden to businesses, or &quot;small enough to drown in a bathtub&quot; the can&#39;t/won&#39;t be able to contend with the power of businesses.  Plutocracy is just as much a form of tyranny as communism is, and one that we&#39;re actually further down the road of becoming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few ideas, why do we only have one leader? He/she is usually just a face anyways. They have huge teams of analysts etc. to help them make desicions. So what if, for example we didn&#39;t have 1 guy making desicions but 100.</p>

<p>We could us new technology e.g. Blockchain to make the domacratic process less representative and let every citizen get involved directly in voting.</p>

<p>I also believe the whole communism is bad idea is exactly the same concept as the one world government. It would help ordinary people but really screw over the wealthy so ofc the media demonizes the shit out of it.</p>

<p>Somebody, or at best, a few people still have to make the calls.  Look at the UN.  They are a world body, and eventhough they have very limited power, and aren&#39;t a true &quot;One world government&quot; are completely disfunctional, almost hopelessly so.  </p>

<p>Communism is a bad idea.  While I agree that the media demonizes the shit out of social safety nets and labels any small socialist program as the slippery slope to becoming the Soviet Union, Communism is a bad idea.  It destroys economic and technological growth.  It also, by it&#39;s very nature, is totalitarian and surprisingly, even more susceptible to corruption than capitalism is.  </p>

<p>We do have a lot of smart, capable people across the planet.  We also have a lot of selfish thugs across the planet.  How do you ensure only the former rule and the possibility for the latter to rule is eliminated?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting points, while I personally disagree with some things you said I believe this is the kind of discussion we should be having as a society.</p>

<p>To go back to what you said about communism. Communism is just such a trigger word. Marx used the words communism and socialism interchangeably. And bvioisly Noone wants to live in shitty conditions like the soviet union. We should take the good stuff from capitalism mix it with a healthy dose of socialism, while allowing everyone to contribute in a democratic way but giving those democratically elected leaders authoritarian power to allow them to over-rule huge multinational cooperations in order to do what&#39;s best for everybody.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I have the answers, in fact I don&#39;t think anyone does but we gotta start figuring out a way to put everyone&#39;s ideas together. </p>

<p>Marx did not use the word communism and socialism interchangeably. They are two different things, Marx described socialism as the stage between capitalism and communism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took a Russian history class in college, and she explained it like this: the &#39;natural&#39; order of our world will be monarchy take over (so the millennia of kingdoms/tyrants/single leader empires, which we can all agree on definitely happening), bourgeois revolution (so non-nobility, merit-based nations, which we can say defines our world today), and then worker revolution, where the representation and needs of everyone can be met.</p>

<p>My professor explained that while the bourgeois revolution (19th/20th century) was taking the world by storm, Russia wanted to bypass the inevitable bourgeois revolution, and skip right to the worker revolution. </p>

<p>Ultimately, it failed due to the global setting of the time, where the availability of technology, organization, and knowledge favored the non-nobility upper class, and will continue to do so until the further innovation/availability of many things (currency, encryption, communication, information, computer s, etc). </p>

<p>That was her theory on everything, and I hope I didn&#39;t butcher it that bad. My thoughts on it were that the next shift will not be for a long time, and meanwhile, the capitalistic US is the best type of society we can provide to one nation of people at this time.</p>

The elite do, and part of that prophecy is in the bible. Before they can bring in the anti christ the kingdoms of the world will unite under one rule. People beleive in bluebeam but why would they need aliens to do it (I still  beleive they are going to convince us to fight them even all they do is seem to watch for the last 10000 years) but why do you think the CIA is involved in so many foreign country&#39;s affairs. The world bank owns all the small country&#39;s through debt. The rest through shadow regimes. The last place is the middle east and they have been fighting this war for 15 years. And they are only resisting so hard because their holy book is telling them too. You can say its coincidence but I advise you to research it on your own before brushing it off as a (1000 monkeys banging on typewriters) effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on who is in control of the one government. Currently there are elite individuals trying to protect their wealth and profit and to subjugate the world people, protecting neoliberalism from the inevitable uprising there will be against it. This network of individuals come from all different countries and yes their aim is to protect their tax dodging and escape environmental and worker protections etc. So while they want to essentially control the world they’ll do it by manipulating different countries, promoting nationalism and divide and conquer while installing fake democracies or police states depending on what they can get away with, but dissent will not be allowed, whistleblowers will be imprisoned, NDAs will be used liberally under threat of imprisonment. This is already happening with Trump Brexit and people are being lied to and misled and turned against one another in Europe currently as well. The UK is in a terrible state right now, government is being secretive slapping NDAs on companies, pressuring the police not to investigate political crimes, jailing environmental protestors for years, and are forcing through the worst possible exit from the EU which will cause condominiums devastation- they have already lined up their ability to use this destruction to their advantage in the enactment of emergency legislation, the state media is not reporting on huge political scandals. Similar manoeuvring is happening in the US as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we <em>need</em> a &#39;unified&#39; world</p>

<p>BUT we don&#39;t either need Or want people like &#39;the old PTB&quot; calling the shots, TF for The Don and his team, they are doing a terrific job (and I&#39;m not even an American) as I can see how it could pan out for the whole world</p>

<p>the Internet <em>already has</em> &#39;unified the world&#39; to a degree unknown 30yrs ago and the information the people have gained has changed them</p>

<p>the weird part is how in many ways a &quot;global economy&quot; could be a great thing, but it would have to be based on an &#39;energy unit&#39; that&#39;s the same worldwide, something like &quot;kilowatt hours&quot; or &#39;ergs&#39;</p>

<p>that way prices would be the same worldwide as they would be based on the &#39;energy needed to produce the goods&#39; which would be a fixed amount using &#39;state of the art&#39; equipment no matter where you&#39;re using it, in the US or China or Finland </p>

<p>coz &quot;energy is energy&quot; worldwide and soon I think we&#39;ll be getting into the &#39;free energy&#39; arena -- once the swamp is drained and the bad actors/crooks &#39;removed&#39; and replaced with &quot;genuine human beings&quot; <em>who care</em> about others and believe that WWG1WGA so it will benefit everybody to do so</p>

<p>One of the current &quot;problems&quot; is that the &#39;old PTB&#39; the PTWere so to speak still are massively involved  the &quot;energy industry&quot; and they still have corrupt minions in the workplace which will be replaced <em>once the management have been</em> &#39;removed&#39;</p>

<p>the &#39;easy and hard&#39; part is that ALL these people are somehow highly involved, although not necessarily &#39;directly&#39;, in nefarious activities that involve varied abuses <em>of humans</em></p>

<p>And DT&#39;s EO of last December and the subsequent disclosure of NXIVM and who was involded, as well as the Weinstein affair, the SHTF for the &#39;oldPTB&#39; as they become EXPOSED</p>

<p>the Easy part, when the time comes, will be to pull out the NSA data on their &#39;human/child trafficking/abuse&#39; (which was <em>used by the oldPTB</em> as a form of &quot;blackmail&quot; to keep those who played &#39;in line&#39;</p>

<p>DT <em>never</em> got involved with their nefarious and criminal activities and so, being &#39;without guilt&#39; <em>he can cast</em> &#39;the first stone&#39;, he already has made it quite clear who he&#39;s after beginning with HC and BO</p>

<p>but IF Hitlary or Hussein were jailed <em>right now</em> the dems would riot and a civil war would errupt, not good, which is &#39;why it&#39;s taking so long&#39;</p>

<p>But hey, haven&#39;t you notice how the US <em>hasn&#39;t started Any conflicts</em> since DT came to power? In fact he&#39;s <em>resolved</em> several</p>

<p>and BO got a fucking Nobel Peace Prize <em>in his first year</em> for what, exactly?  It was simply a way to &#39;raise his esteem&#39; in &#39;the people&#39;s eyes and minds&#39; so they would give him more credit even though <em>un</em>earned! </p>

<p>That&#39;s how the Mockingbird media works hand in glove with the oldPTB to &#39;trick and decieve&#39; people</p>

<p>IIRC Rupert Murdoch et al are &quot;in those NSA recordings&quot; <em>and he/they know it</em></p>

<p>Kavanagh getting in is clear proof POTUS and team <em>are finally</em> on top of the situation</p>

<p>don&#39;t worry people, the day will come for the blood (and circuses)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its about too much power in too few hands...</p>

<p>for example if all the world were in 1 persons hands.... no matter how good that person was.  it would eventually become a certainty that all the power will be held someones hand that wasn&#39;t a good guy.</p>

<p>so we need self governance on a local level, and the worlds power to be held in decentralized way...</p>

<p>btw its already happened.   its all under the rule of one cabal/mafia and they only care about holding on to their power and furthering the agenda.</p>
