       To paraphrase Paracelsus: depending on the dosage, anything can be poison. One can live without any of those things, so they are not necessary, and as you say, in small  enough dosages won't hurt. To stretch the point, I doubt that smoking, say, one cigarette a year will do much damage either.

       Metallic mercury and lead do accumulate; go easy on the canned tuna! Dimethyl mercury, as far as I know, gets flushed in about a week. We baby boomers grew up with Mercurochrome and Merthiolate on our booboos.

       We're stuck with the alcohol and tobacco demons because they're grandfathered into acceptability. Weed became illegal when Prohibition ended and its enforcers, Harry Anslinger in particular, found themselves out of work. The widespread use of "hard" drugs, IMHO, comes from people medicating their despair and won't abate until self-respect becomes attainable for most.

       Dimethylmercury ((CH3)2Hg) is an organomercury compound. A highly reactive, flammable, and colorless liquid, dimethylmercury is one of the strongest known neurotoxins, with a quantity of less than 0.1 mL capable of inducing severe mercury poisoning, and is easily absorbed through the skin. Dimethylmercury is capable of permeating many materials, including plastic and rubber compounds.

       Yeah, Anslinger had to do something! That department was circling the drain. What a corrupt, racist, hypocritical jackass he was. He employed Col. George Hunter White (the agent in charge of MKULTRA sub project Operation Midnight Climax) to frame and kill Billie Holiday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anslinger also supplied dope to one Joseph McCarthy, , on the low. Some sources say heroin, some say morphine. 
 Heroin is diacetyl morphine -- just another form of ordinary hospital morphine. The only difference is that heroin is three times stronger by weight. One grain of heroin equals three grains of morphine. They are both converted to the same form of morphine when they enter the body, so they are medically interchangeable. Now, if you want to know why the drugs are equivalent but one is legal while the other is banned entirely, you can find the answer to that in
       <a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/cu/CU9.html">
        Chapter 9 of the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone is addicted to morphine/heroin and they are not getting it from a legal source, then they are getting heroin, because the only form of the drug regularly available on the black market is heroin. Therefore, it is correct to say that someone who is addicted to one is addicted to the other -- particularly if they are not getting it from a legal source. The word "heroin" may be viewed as more inflammatory -- but only if you don't understand that the two drugs are really the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are self medicating or getting high. Coping or partying. Sometimes both. They shouldn't be made criminals over it, and they shouldn't be made to believe they have a disease they are helpless against without total abstinence and higher powers.

       the two drugs aren't the same when administered intravenously, as heroin administration produces other active metabolites besides morphine, the most relevant of which is
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3791993/">
        6-MAM
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       quoting from the link:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Heroin is considered to be one of the most addicting drugs of abuse (Anthony et al., 1994). It does however have a low-binding affinity (Inturrisi et al., 1983; Gianutsos et al., 1986) and efficacy (Selley et al., 2001) at the μ-opioid receptors (MORs), and is believed to act mainly as a prodrug (Inturrisi et al., 1983; Gianutsos et al., 1986). Heroin is highly lipophilic and has a high apparent permeability through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) (Oldendorf et al., 1972). Thus an effective delivery of active metabolites to the brain has been used as an explanation for the highly addictive properties of heroin, where morphine customarily has been considered to be the most relevant active compound mediating heroin euphoria and reward. However, other metabolites, like 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), also possess pharmacological activity (Way et al., 1960; Inturrisi et al., 1983; Pasternak et al., 1987; Strandberg et al., 2006) and are therefore likely to contribute to the heroin effects. The pharmacological contribution of 6-MAM after acute or chronic administration of heroin has however only to a limited extent been studied.
       </p>
       <p>
        Andersen et al. (2009) have shown that 6-MAM reached much higher concentrations than heroin or morphine in both blood and brain after s.c. administration of heroin to mice. Moreover, the acute behavioural effects observed after heroin administration were more closely related to brain concentrations of 6-MAM than to heroin and morphine, indicating that 6-MAM was the compound mainly responsible for these effects. Subsequent pharmacokinetic analysis of these data showed that the transfer rate for heroin from blood to brain was much lower than its conversion rate to 6-MAM in blood. These results would imply that heroin was rapidly metabolized to 6-MAM and only a small fraction of the heroin dose was able to reach the brain, while the high 6-MAM concentrations in brain were merely reflecting transfer of 6-MAM formed in blood (Boix et al., 2013). Together, these observations challenge the view that morphine, formed in the brain from rapidly entering heroin, is the compound mainly responsible for the effects of heroin (Oldendorf et al., 1972; National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2005). Accordingly, they also question the generalization of numerous neurobiological studies using morphine, to also account for mechanisms involved in heroin-related effects.

       Thank you for updating my information. I didn't know that. However, like the study you cited says, that's not conclusive. Not everyone injects their drugs. Heroin is often smoked and snorted. Morphine eaten by tablets. Not every opiate user graduates to heroin, and not everyone who uses graduates to a needle. I was on morphine for six years and knew heroin addicts. The IV users are still in the gutter. I'm clean for about six years and quit cold turkey.
      </p>
      <p>
       The route of administration seems to matter some. I also wonder if the same problem when interpreting data from mouse to human has the same issue as with amphetamines. Lab mice are given large bolus doses of amphetamines, which isn't how people use recreational drugs. People build a tolerance after days of increasing the doses. Lab mice don't.

       Cigarettes have given me my quality of life back, even if it shortens it (maybe) in the long run.  I have severe ulcerative colitis that no drug or course of medicine was helping with.  I started smoking a few cigarettes a day and 90% of my symptoms disappeared.  If you’ve never had irritable bowel disease (different and much worse  than regular colitis), you wouldn’t understand what this means to a person.  Cigarettes have given my life back to me.  Maybe there will be another way some day but until then I am ever so grateful they exist and are legal.

       Somehow the cigarettes seemed to slow down my digestive system and regulated it.  I see someone talks about them being diuretic, but I had the opposite problem of being in the bathroom 30 times a day with diarrhea.  I tested my theory by stopping cigarettes for 2 weeks, which wasn’t hard for me to do.  But the ulcerative colitis came back with a vengeance.  After suffering with this for 25 years, I decided I’d risk the potential problems associated with cigarettes in exchange for a chance to live a normal life.  I do understand I may experience problems, even life threatening ones, down the road as a result of cigarettes but to have even a decade of normalcy regarding the bathroom issues is well worth it to me.

       I'm glad they help you feel better absolutely, and I know you didn't say this, but their negative side effects out weigh any positive ones by a ton, in regards to the general population. I don't know your medical history obviously, but I'd assume there are medicines you could take that would give you the same benefits without the shortening of your life bit. I smoked cigarettes for about a year, quit near the beginning of this year with the help of a vape and low nicotine juice, I feel much better overall since stopping both.

       You can argue it's a slippery slope, but realistically tobacco is and always has been a medicine. What happens when we abuse opiates or amphetamines? There's a reason these forms of medication are not freely available over the counter.

       It is available over the counter in the UK, in cbd form. Which, I think, is the most important form. It may be an unpopular opinion on the internet, but if you wish to self-medicate using psychoactives then you should continue using the black market.
      </p>
      <p>
       The uses where thc should be freely available should be catered for as freely as possible, I.e. MS or dementia. But the majority of people who are using weed in my experience, use it as a crutch rather than a medicine.

       It was a threat to so many industries the corporations lobbied the politicians to make it illegal
      </p>
      <p>
       Marijuana can help so many diseases and syndromes. It's a huge threat to the pharmasietical companies now these studies are public. That's why it remains illegal in the USA and other countries because these companies lobby the politicians once again.

       Its fucked up how it works. The 1% of the 1%control everything. Its completely wrong. They figured out the cheat code to economics and they spam it. Making them seemingly invulnerable to new ideas, and products. Or old ones in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are totally right though I've seen tons of people use it as a crutch. I wouldn't be surprised to see a statistic saying 1/3 of semi chronic/chronic users would be at the very least distressed to give it up. Psychological dependence is very real. But what medicine wouldn't be like that? I'd say most chronic users use it for those reasons. That's why i dont use it as much. It made me dull to my emotions, and more unable to control myself in stressful situations. Everyone is different though.

       Because hemp can be used for things like making clothing, paper, efficient fuel for burning. It takes 1 year to grow as opposed to 50-150 for trees. But the tree industry was already established, and they wanted to protect their market.  Lobbyist paid the politicians... and it was made illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also prohibition put a huge stigma around marijuana causing people to go into psychotic breaks and killing people. It was referd to as reefer madness. They also called it things like the devils lettuce.
      </p>
      <p>
       It remains schedule 1 (highly abuseable no beneficial value) on a federal level, because it threatens the pharmaceutical companys net gain. Even meth is schedule 2, and sometimes prescribed for narcolepsy or ADHD. Why pay for this drug or that drug when weed can help with some 400 diseases, ailments, and syndromes. That's only what's been proven. They lobby politicians even today. Some 4 people out of Congress dont get money from large corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you haven't gotten the idea... dont trust the government.

       I find relief in many things. Today I dressed in bright colors and went to a fair. Got a simple pinwheel and attached it to my backpack. It's silly, but it makes me smile.

       Even if depression is biological, I can still use other things to help. Taking a drug to supposedly fix the problem seems overkill.

       If we look at government as an agent of the people, managing group purchases with the people's money, then government has a duty to spend for the benefit of its citizens as well as to warn about various dangers. Government has no money of its own to hoard.

       I've read similar arguments, but actually made by serious economists/actuaries.  Smokers die earlier than non-smokers, saving pensions years if not decades in pension payments.  People who paid into a pension for 30 years have grown a nest egg that in many cases has no death beneficiary, and goes back into the pension pool.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are other add-on costs, people who live longer are just statistically more likely to get age-related chronic illnesses which are expensive to treat.  Lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease are expensive to treat, but they often kill quickly.  "Healthy" people with other chronic illnesses can require decades of expensive treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of pension plans have collapsed in the last 20 years, and much of the blame is laid on under-investment, shady accounting, "borrowing", etc, but it'd be interesting to know what effects are the byproduct of declining smoking breaking the actuarial models on lifespan which had built-in estimates on premature death which were influenced by smoking.

       Because smokers die younger than they otherwise would, and require less "end of life" care, they save the taxpayers money.

        LONDON — Preventing obesity and smoking can save lives, but it does not save money, according to a new report.

       <p>
        It costs more to care for healthy people who live years longer, according to a Dutch study that counters the common perception that preventing obesity would save governments millions of dollars.

        "It was a small surprise," said Pieter van Baal, an economist at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands, who led the study. "But it also makes sense. If you live longer, then you cost the health system more."

       In the US we have the Master Tobacco Settlement Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1996 46 states settled all of their Medicare cases that were cigarette caused with the major players in tobacco. In return, the tobacco industry disbanded most of their trade groupes and lobby groups, and created the "truth campaign" to push a non smoking retorect on the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The states receive a minimum of 26 million over 25 years, along with a percentage of the profits on every cigarette sold, above and beyond state and federal tax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many states, California being the best example, used that incoming windfall to bond and use the money in advance for road work, and other basic needs they didn't have a budget for.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the states are literally towed to tobacco sales for their own income and financial good.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth campaign is run by big tobacco. Note they are focused on anti vape and anti juul ads nowdays.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a conspiracy it's out there if you search the master tobacco settlement agreement.

       Funny thing about the subconscious, it doesn't really get negatives. So when you say, "don't smoke tobacco", it focuses on the act and hears, " smoke tobacco"

       So anti tobacco ads, are a sneaky way to advertise their product.

       I meant the truth anti smoking ads are often trying too hard to be cool. Though there is an element of that on Tide pods too. The tide pod trend was tiny and declining until the media started an anti tide pod challenge campaign.

       the conspiracy is that the pharmaceutical companies are lobbying against vaping because of the 95% harm reduction versus traditional tobacco products. the fda did a power grab to regulate vaping and now the pharma bros are trying to regulate the industry our of business. Over 1,000,000 jobs in the US will be lost as the result of this action.

       Lobbies. The tobacco lobby, let alone the industry in general is massive. Lobbyists and corporations make a deals with law makers. "Ill contribute this amount of money to your reelection campaign, if you put this in the bill." Corporations write the laws. This is why we need money out of politics.

       We are up to about $3.5 trillion a year spent on healthcare in the USA and of that about half is spent on about 5% of the population.  Most of the people in that 5% are terminally ill and going to die anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason they keep letting people smoke and drink and promote obesity, etc... its because the industry is making a *killing*.  The amount of money spent is staggering.  They play games with the numbers and tax laws and tax shelters, to make it look like they are barely profitable, or they lose money.  It's all lies.  And they've got people convinced that if we just let them "lock in" this fantastic system with medicare for all, then it will finally be "free".... far too many people somehow think that trillions of dollars of their own money in the form of taxes is some how "free medical care".  SMH.

       What's a bad system? I don't understand what you mean.  European countries are not marginally cheaper overall for healthcare expenses compared with the USA by virtue of the fact that they have the government acting as a single healthcare provider proxy for the taxpayers.  Its because they just have  slightly less corruption.  They still have created a monopolistic system where the citizens are getting ripped off and in many cases are not even allowed to make their own healthcare decisions, just stuck with whatever the government decides is best.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the USA the single biggest difference maker is that we have the FDA granting government sanctioned monopolies for products which puts prices through the roof.  That isn't going to change if we merely expand medicare.

       I guarantee you that that claim is utter bullshit. Private healthcare exists in those nations the same as it does in the US - if you have the money you can obtain any medical service that US private healthcare providers supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still have a choice - but you get an
       <em>
        extra
       </em>
       choice - to obtain some form of treatment for "free".
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the competition from the public healthcare system, private providers are forced to lower their prices and increase the quality of their services to make choosing them a more attractive option.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's good for poor people
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the people that can afford private healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not good for the profit margins of private healthcare providers, though.

       You have misstated the problem here. At its root the problem is corruption and cronyism. You’re talking about a false choice that the vast majority of people will be forced into. Rich people always play by their own rules. In the USA as soon as they make a law that says Medicare is for all it will completely alter the landscape and I don’t think most people realize how bad it will be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Employers will no longer have to offer healthcare. Almost nobody (percentage wise) will be able to afford private or supplemental insurance. If you thought you saw a bit of outrage over Obamacare just wait til people realize the bill of goods being sold to them now.

       My company is self-insured and if you smoke/use tobacco you gotta pay an ADDITIONAL $2400/year for insurance. Seems fair to me- their additional health concerns would otherwise jack up the costs for everyone else. I don't think it should be banned but the people smoking should definitely be footing more of the bill for their poor choices.

       The freedom to choose is more important I would say. In an ideal world yes cigarettes would not exist but then what about other drugs, fast food, not exercising, soda, watching too much porn etc.? Once you take away someone's free choice you're entering into 1984 territory.

       The real question is: Why are any substances banned?
       <br/>
       The government will answer that it's because they are harmful.
       <br/>
       But because tobacco and alcohol are not banned even though they are much more harmful than many of the banned substances, we know there must be other factors.
       <br/>
       Here are some of them:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The PTB know that the taxcattle (in every country), seek out substances for unwinding, relieving stress or just feeling better, so they allow certain non-mind-expanding substances (like tobacco, alcohol and caffeine) to keep the plebs from turning to mind-expanding substances (like cannabis &amp; psychedelics). The PTB  didn't choose tobacco, alcohol &amp; caffeine. Those were already widely popular; they just chose to ban virtually everything else
         <em>
          but
         </em>
         them.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Like the pharmaceutical industry and the meat &amp; dairy industry, the tobacco and alcohol industries have weak (or non-existent) ethics, so they have no qualms about bribing judges &amp; politicians, or flat-out planting people in political positions to write (or rewrite) laws in their favor.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Although alcohol and tobacco are damaging to health, the political system is now so perverted and intertwined with the pharmaceutical &amp; medical industry, that sick people can actually be more valuable to the PTB than healthy people; particularly older people who aren't very productive taxcattle any more, have already had all the kids they're going to have, are resistant to political/societal change and will soon be collecting money
         <em>
          from
         </em>
         the government coffers.
        </p>

       It’s not banned because the tobacco industry in the US is huge. Tobacco is a large reason the US was strong and rich enough to fight for independence; it was a gigantic industry for the US from the beginning. Worldwide, American tobacco is considered the best. In France and Russia they consider American tobacco cigarettes superior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the age, history, and wealth of the tobacco industry it is intertwined with the American government. The families that own these companies are powerful and vaunted in Washington.

       However, their power has been waning. They are trying to diversify their investments as fewer people pick up smoking today. See the Juul.

       Prohibition doesn't work. To answer your question about taxes, it doesn't matter how much health care spending is related to cigarettes for those in charge. The spending today is a result of past smoking and can't be avoided with any changes they could make. The spending tomorrow doesn't matter to them because they won't be in power then. Cutting off revenues from tobacco taxes would negatively impact them today (less spending money) with no benefit to themselves in the future, when they're out of power.

       Well the only hard data I know is from holland where there was some research into the exact cost/benefit of this all. The [source](
       <a href="http://www.stoprokenvandaag.nl/tabak-roken-en-tabaksindustrie/wat-kost-roken-de-nederlands-maatsschappij/">
        http://www.stoprokenvandaag.nl/tabak-roken-en-tabaksindustrie/wat-kost-roken-de-nederlands-maatsschappij/
       </a>
       ) is in Dutch but it's from a anti smoking website.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basic numbers add up to total to a 2.4 billion loss of revenue due to lost productivity. Taxes are higher here but they produce about 2.3 billion. Then there are lower costs in health care because smokers live shorter and when they get ill it's generally terminal saving about 600 million and about 1,2 billion saved in government pensions. The industry itself adds about 230 million to the economy. Adding misc costs etc, smokers generate a net profit of about 1,5 billion for the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       And smoking isn't banned because people are allowed to make bad choices.  If we were just working bees the government  would dictate our lives, put us in jobs to our competency to maximize productivity for the collective.

There are no government costs, only taxpayer costs and major profits for high-level players within the industry.

       Fact of the matter is that there's not much that can be done about lung cancer once it's diagnosed nor many patients that will last more than six months before succumbing to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's not actually a huge cost or drain at all in comparison to the taxes to be had from the sale of it and driving the price up with those taxes in the guise of discouraging addicts who'll still manage to scrimp and scrape up whatever it costs precisely because they're addicted to it. Drug dealers are drug dealers, addicted to the money to be made off it and the government is no different in that regard no matter what else it says.
      </p>
      <p>
       While non-smokers like to bitch and complain or suggest that smokers deserve no mercy, if they had to pony up the billions or suffer the cuts if the government ever lost those revenues, they'd all be singing a very different tune.

       And it worked out
       <em>
        great
       </em>
       and certainly didn't contribute to changing the nature of law enforcement for the worse. No sir. That there Prohibition was a great and noble experiment that was clearly a rousing success.

       I'm glad they help you feel better absolutely, and I know you didn't say this, but their negative side effects out weigh any positive ones by a ton, in regards to the general population. I don't know your medical history obviously, but I'd assume there are medicines you could take that would give you the same benefits without the shortening of your life bit. I smoked cigarettes for about a year, quit near the beginning of this year with the help of a vape and low nicotine juice, I feel much better overall since stopping both.

       Metallic mercury and lead do accumulate; go easy on the canned tuna! Dimethyl mercury, as far as I know, gets flushed in about a week. We baby boomers grew up with Mercurochrome and Merthiolate on our booboos.

       We're stuck with the alcohol and tobacco demons because they're grandfathered into acceptability. Weed became illegal when Prohibition ended and its enforcers, Harry Anslinger in particular, found themselves out of work. The widespread use of "hard" drugs, IMHO, comes from people medicating their despair and won't abate until self-respect becomes attainable for most.

       You have misstated the problem here. At its root the problem is corruption and cronyism. You’re talking about a false choice that the vast majority of people will be forced into. Rich people always play by their own rules. In the USA as soon as they make a law that says Medicare is for all it will completely alter the landscape and I don’t think most people realize how bad it will be.

       Employers will no longer have to offer healthcare. Almost nobody (percentage wise) will be able to afford private or supplemental insurance. If you thought you saw a bit of outrage over Obamacare just wait til people realize the bill of goods being sold to them now.
