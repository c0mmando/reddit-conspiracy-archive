<p>Now, since they put the kibosh on his volatility, he owes them a “penance”, and they probably trotter him out there to support trump, help get black folks to support the president. </p>

<p>They’re using him and his influence to rally the African Americans to support the current administration. Why is that so hard to believe? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I understand what you meant now - I would say that I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case and if this was the plan it&#39;s not working.</p>

<p>I at first thought this was for publicity but in all honesty he knows this would deter his usual demographic which in turn hurt his music/fashion sales. Which is why I believe what you said is not the case here.</p>

<p>The pure skeptic in me leads me to believe this is a concentrated effort to use him and Taylor Swift to push this Right/Left divide which people like yourself are very susceptible to (No offense).</p>

<p>Either this or he is confused from what he thought the Democratic party was and is now genuinely in support of Trump. Which I understand because the left is the side of the spectrum that is looking off-hinge nowadays (again, apart of what I think is a left right divide plan - not natural) </p>

<p>And to be clear before you go off on me I&#39;m neither for or opposed to Trump similar to how I&#39;ve felt about every past president since Kennedy for the record. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other person told you already: contemporary examples of Kanye West being widely praised for his comments about Bush.</p>

<p>This is going to sound crazy, but the Internet was totally a thing in 2005, it was already thriving, and there were thousands and thousands of news sites, opinion pages, forums, and other forms of commentary already out there, <em>plus</em> Youtube and other sources now have loads and loads of news clips from throughout recent history. If Kanye was given a lot of praise for his comments, that praise will be online.</p>

<p>All the other person did was ask you for contemporary examples of Kanye being praised for his comments. You&#39;ve spent the last two hours deflecting and dodging rather than taking a few moments to find some.</p>

<p>weird.</p>

<p>I used to think that both sides were equally stupid and had equal potential to do great things; after seeing how Bernie Sanders was treated, how fake Hillary&#39;s entire election was (Right down to literally faking crowd numbers, and photo shopping press photos to make them appear bigger than they were)</p>

<p>I lost complete and total respect for Democrats, and they&#39;ve earned it. They can talk shit all day, but they can&#39;t take it. Say anything that goes against their opinion and you&#39;re a pedophile nazi, and they will be trying to spread lies to your family, friends, and employers.</p>

<p>Lefties think that about righties and vice versa. Nobody wins when there is no compromise. Don’t give up hope. Believing half the people in America are dumb is a shortsighted way of thinking, especially when 90% of the time our beliefs don’t effect most daily life decisions. Like people’s stances on very partisan issues like abortion, gun control, and immigration really don’t effect anything in moooost people’s lives moooost of the time. It’s a waste of time and energy to get worked up about it and bash on an entire clump of people for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. I&#39;m firmly on the left. I would not call Kanye or others like Ben Carson &quot;tokens&quot; just because it&#39;s a little uncommon for black people to be Republicans. </p>

<p>And I really detest the term &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;. I could seriously gut punch some people. The original character of Uncle Tom of Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin was a hero who sacrificed his own safety for other people. In minstrel shows he was white washed into a self deprecating servant and I think it&#39;s grotesque to continue using the term in that way. It&#39;s racist to assume a person owes loyalty to a political party or even their race instead of what they believe is right. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with the direction Kanye has taken recently. But I don&#39;t hate him, I don&#39;t have any names to call him. I&#39;m sure he believes in his own mind he&#39;s doing something good but I have literally never trusted his state of mind and I&#39;m a big fan. Lol</p>

<p>The pure skeptic in me leads me to believe this is a concentrated effort to use him and Taylor Swift to push this Right/Left divide which people like yourself are very susceptible to (no offense).</p>

<p>Either this or he is confused from what he thought the Democratic party was and is now genuinely in support of Trump. Which I understand because the left is the side of the spectrum that is looking off-hinge nowadays (again, apart of what I think is a left right divide plan - not natural) </p>

<p>And to be clear before you go off on me I&#39;m neither for or opposed to Trump similar to how I&#39;ve felt about every past president since Kennedy for the record. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More disturbing is how illogical your logic is.</p>

<p>If the left believed Bush was racist, then of course they wouldn&#39;t be upset if Kanye called him racist. And if that same left also thinks Trump is racist, if course they&#39;d be upset at Kanye for saying he&#39;s not.</p>

<p>Like, how on Earth would you <em>expect</em> them to react? &quot;Oh, well we have these views on Trump based on XYZ, but since Kanye disagrees I guess we should just agree with him.&quot;</p>

<p>All you&#39;re doing with your claims here is saying that the left has been consistently against presidents who are allegedly racist and the people who support them.</p>

<p>That&#39;s hardly a damning criticism.</p>

<p>A Reddit account with that name was created seven years ago, yes, but it stopped posting for close to five years (there is a gap from January 2013 to to the end of November 2017), then suddenly started posting again, often pushing a specific agenda.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve made just over 100 posts here, virtually all of them just recently.</p>

<p>So no, you haven&#39;t been an active user here for 7 years. Your claim is a lie. And it&#39;s evident from your posts throughout this thread that you are not a user here in good faith to discuss conspiracies, either for or against.</p>

<p>You are not a credible poster. Users of this sub, believers and skeptics alike, should probably place you on ignore because of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if someone else has answered this yet but here’s what I learned in my American history classes several years ago:</p>

<p>The Democratic Party has always been the party of the Confederacy. It was Lincoln and the Republican Party that brought the rebel states back into the fold and outlawed slavery. It was also the Democratic Party that established the KKK and Jim Crow laws.</p>

<p>The democrats have always been in the plantation business, the only thing that’s changed is the crop they farm and the means they get people to toil on their fields picking that crop.</p>

<p>Democrats have always used the argument “the parties flipped”, but that simply isn’t true. The democrats of today, whom control all of the most impoverished cities with the greatest wealth divide in this nation by the way, use the same tactics now that they began with centuries ago.</p>

<p>Nothing has changed. </p>

<p>Just wanted to clarify, are you suggesting that the current democratic party is racist for wanting to redistribute wealth among minorities? Or do you mean by doing this, they&#39;re exploiting minorities for the political moral high ground. Or that by giving to minorities, they&#39;re taking from whites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They’re exploiting minorities by promising to redistribute wealth, garnering their votes, then creating a larger have/have not divide in this nation. I don’t advocate for the redistribution of wealth, but that’s their platform. </p>

<p>Nobody is born poor and remains poor until their death unless they’re bad with money/don’t figure out what’s making them lose their money at some point and make a change.</p>

<p>I don’t understand the last sentence option you gave because there’s a LOT of poor whites. Just head into the rural Appalachians and you’ll see some 16th century stuff. I think the Democratic Party wants control over everyone poor and slightly wealthy, taking the wealth from the latter, putting it into “govt programs” then laundering it back to themselves.</p>

<p>The pure skeptic in me leads me to believe this is a concentrated effort to use him and Taylor Swift to push this Right/Left divide which people like yourself are very susceptible to (No offense).</p>

<p>Either this or he is confused from what he thought the Democratic party was and is now genuinely in support of Trump. Which I understand because the left is the side of the spectrum that is looking off-hinge nowadays (again, apart of what I think is a left right divide plan - not natural) </p>
