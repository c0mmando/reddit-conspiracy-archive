        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok folks, time for the further ramblings of an old man.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, probably the Bellingcat thing, this week I started to think again about Fancy Bear, the boogie-people of IT security. Back when Vault 7 was released, I examined related links in articles in the INFOSEC press arriving in my inbox (I&#39;m an INFOSEC sort of person, which is all I want to say about that) and one stood out - not that I can find it again, irritatingly - in which an analyst had discovered matches between Vault 7 (CIA) techniques and Fancy Bear techniques. So, at the back of my mind, Fancy Bear has been associated with the West rather than the popular interpretation that they&#39;re Russian.</p>

<p>Thus, this week I wanted to find that analysis and started searching. Easy stuff first, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_Bear">Wiki</a>, which tells us that US outfit Crowdstrike has a fair idea they&#39;re Russian and then that the US Special Council thinks they belong to GRU Unit 26165. Hold the bus. These are the DNC hackers.</p>

<p>Now, Crowdstrike were hired by the DNC, so who are they? Over to <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-24/what-crowdstrike-firm-hired-dnc-has-ties-hillary-clinton-ukrainian-billionaire-and-g">Zerohedge</a>. Oh. &quot;Ties to Hillary Clinton, A Ukrainian Billionaire and Google&quot;. Not exactly neutrals, then.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s dig a bit more. <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2018/06/25/who-is-fancy-bear-and-who-are-they-working-for/">Off-Guardian</a> pops up with the headline &quot;Who is Fancy Bear and Who Are They Working for?&quot;. The by-line says &quot;Donbass&quot; and discomforts me, I have to find out where that is... oh.. the breakaway Eastern Ukraine. Oh. Is this Russian propaganda? Let&#39;s read the article, dated June 25th this year (keep that in mind).</p>

<p>Oh looky. After a data dump from a hacked Putin aide.. &quot;Eliot Higgins and Aric Toler of Bellingcat worked for the hackers to authenticate the data.&quot;. Bellingcat, before they were news. Let&#39;s skip to the last couple of paragraphs of the article:</p>

<p>..</p>

<p>Fancy Bear is Ukrainian Intelligence</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;Key organizations working directly and indirectly with Fancy Bear are Bellingcat, InformNapalm, Stopfake, Propornot, InterpreterMag, Euromaidan Press, Hamilton 68 Dashboard, Facebook, and Twitter. We’ll be going into a lot of detail on these later. Who’s behind Mark Zuckerberg’s new censorship program? Fancy Bear and related groups are. But, more on that, later.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, this could all be a load of bollocks. But... but.. it nags. It nags because of the extraordinary info Bellingcat have come out with in the Skripal case; how are they acquiring it? Who are their sources? They couldn&#39;t be Ukrainian, could they? Then something I&#39;d read about the Ukrainian Nationalist revolt being the Khazars/Ashkenazi Jews trying to get their &quot;homeland&quot; back rang a bell - does Ukrainian intelligence have access to Israeli skills and repertoire? If there&#39;s any truth in the Khazari angle, then very likely. And so the article gets a few more credibility points in my mind, but not many as it&#39;s a leap of faith.</p>

<p>Bear with me a little longer. The Skripal case. I cast scorn upon the official version of events in r/ukpolitics 8 days ago and got attacked by u/jampax84 who, it now seems, has deleted their account and all of their completely ad hominem arguments - I was called a &quot;tankie&quot; and had to go and look it up (I&#39;m not one, btw) and they said some crap like &quot;I bet you believe Putin when he lies about no Russian troops in Eastern Ukraine&quot;, which was so irrelevant to the point I was making that I thought my attacker had completely lost the plot. It now appears that they were giving themselves away, saying too much.</p>

<p>The Bellingcat info on the two GRU suspects is so detailed that I can only think it true. They were indeed in Salisbury; what with CCTV etc., there can be little doubt. But I have an idea that this case follows the JFK / 7/7 etc model and that these guys are patsies. I would be willing to bet that the exquisite architecture had little to do with it, but that they were there to pick up a tidbit from a dead-letter box, probably difficult to access while there was ice and slush about, hence their return the next day. If they&#39;d been on an assassination job, there&#39;s no way that they would have been so casual - but a pickup from 3rd green wheelie-bin from the gatepost somewhere in Salisbury didn&#39;t need them to be that cagey. </p>

<p>There you have my thoughts for now. Enjoy and remember that YMMV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My assumption is that &quot;fancy bear&quot; is an <em>alleged</em> group, one that theoretically exists. </p>

<p>The best speculation I&#39;ve read regarding &quot;fancy bear&quot; claims that they are actually Crowdstrike, just using v7 tools to <em>appear</em> to be from Russia.</p>

<p>What else has crowdstrike done? They had a hand in the &quot;dossier&quot; and the &quot;russia collusion narrative&quot;, and they were the ones who pointed at NK for having &quot;hacked&quot; the Sony emails... around the time of that garbo movie &quot;The Interview&quot;... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think its a form of very strange thinking. He&#39;s been saying &quot;its fake and not russia&quot; for probably 6 months I imagine.</p>

<p>Then as his position becomes more and more absurd as the Russian state denies everything, as per usual, he looks at the mounting real physical evidence and needs to justify his conspiracy. So he types up a treatise on how it was indeed russians, but they were &quot;patsies&quot; who were in fact there to visit a wheelie bin, but couldn&#39;t manage the &quot;slush&quot;. </p>

<p>He says his new theory with just as much authority and confidence as his previous 25 theories, i.e. its fake, it was mi6, the photos of them at gatwick are fake, no russians were there, novichok isn&#39;t real, wasn&#39;t it near porton down? fishy! etc.</p>

<p>This is probably his final position because its so vague it can&#39;t be disproven because its just a made up nonsense, there&#39;s no further position to take and it will probably be the final one. </p>

<p>If anyone &quot;normal&quot;, i.e. a normal president had said:</p>

<p>&quot;Ive never met putin&quot;</p>

<p>Then </p>

<p>&quot;Ive met putin, I have a relationship with him&quot;</p>

<p>Then</p>

<p>&quot;I have no business in russia. No deals. No loans.&quot;</p>

<p>Then his son said</p>

<p>&quot;We see a lot of money pouring in from russia&quot;</p>

<p>And sell 1/3 of his trump world tower, to russian oligarchs.</p>

<p>And on, and on, and on, forever.</p>

<p>They would go absolutely crazy about that conspiracy.</p>

<p>But yet here it is, a huge conspiracy, right in front of them, but they actually don&#39;t like it. Because.....I have no idea.</p>

<p>Perhaps because Trump himself is a conspiracy theorist and is friends with Alex jones, so they can&#39;t attack one of their own?</p>

<p>Kind of like when you see two conspiracy theorists saying things that both can&#39;t be true, but they don&#39;t actually disagree with each other and just tip toe around each other respectfully. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its because the conspiracy community has been weaponized by the people behind trump, so they work to shut that down, and use conspiracy theories against their political rivals.</p>

<p>They make up the conspiracy, have their public candidates amplify them, then report on the candidates amplification in the most obvious astroturfy propaganda campaign I can imagine. If people cant see it, it is either because they are complicit, willfully blind, or so lost in tribal partisanship that they would believe anything their guy says and disbelieve anything they deny, regardless of evidence</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thats been well documented as the firehose of falsehood method of propaganda. False narratives can be run out much faster than narratives based on evidence. Hit every story, hit them often, and include your ideological bent. If theyre proved wrong its fine, in fact, ignore it and keep pushing it. The truth has to be parsed from a sea of bullshit.</p>

<p>The fact that people believe what they want to believe (not what has the most evidence or makes the most logical sense) for the most part makes this very effective</p>

<p>The Bellingcat info on the two GRU suspects is so detailed that I can only think it true. They were indeed in Salisbury; what with CCTV etc., there can be little doubt. But I have an idea that this case follows the JFK / 7/7 etc model and that these guys are patsies. I would be willing to bet that the exquisite architecture had little to do with it, but that they were there to pick up a tidbit from a dead-letter box, probably difficult to access while there was ice and slush about, hence their return the next day. If they&#39;d been on an assassination job, there&#39;s no way that they would have been so casual - but a pickup from 3rd green wheelie-bin from the gatepost somewhere in Salisbury didn&#39;t need them to be that cagey.</p>

<p>&quot;Ive decided they are real now (forget I said they were fake before), but I know that they were there to pick up a &#39;tidbit&#39; from a dead-letter box. But it was probably difficult! Because of &quot;ice&quot;. They were there to visit a wheelie-bin&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand.  In reality, where I live, nobody has proven that russians did anything.</p>

<p>And when you couple that with the various inconsistencies with everything, it makes the whole situation seem bogus.</p>

<p>Hillary&#39;s people reportedly pulled an all nighter in which they planned a PR campaign which focused on alleged russian hacking.   They used their media contacts to put it out.</p>

<p>The FBI, former employer of Comey, McCabe, and Strzok apparently leaked the Carter Page FISA story to aid this process and make people think there was a legitimate russian concern.  </p>

<p>The Dossier is right in there too.  Literal evidence of trump opponents getting dirt on Trump from russians.  Oh, and their source was cut off from the FBI so they had to launder the information back in to the FBI.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I could go on to further examples that cast serious doubt on the entire story, but those are some pretty big ones I highly doubt you or anybody else could attempt to refute.</p>
