        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys! I’m Sal. I’d like to share with you something I feel you might find interesting surrounding all of the JFK theories. I can’t stress this enough and just how relevant and definitive this is surrounding his death. This subreddit has a huge audience and I’m really hoping this reaches as many people as possible!</p>

<p>My great grandfather Salvatore Buscemi was a soldato in Chicago Outfit and co-organizer of the St. Valentines Day Massacre. Saying he worked closely with Al Capone is an understatement. They were so close in fact that my great grandmother Theresa Buscemi cooked for the guys more than any other woman including the wives. It all started after my great grandpa ripped off a few bootleggers over the weekend. A few mob associates knocked on his door with a violin case and said “tomorrow, you work for us, if not, my friend here is gonna play you some music.” They opened the case and showed him a Tommy Gun. </p>

<p>After Chicago started falling apart my great grandparents moved to Southern California (San Bernardino to be exact). He ran a crew with a guy named Joey Dip (Joseph DiPilito). They had a deli with a two way Mirror from the back and they ran most operations out of it. He flew in a guy to SoCal he calls Momo (Sam Giancana). Giancana assisted them with opening a vineyard in Montclair, CA and creating a wine scheme. </p>

<p>Now my great grandpa ventured out to Hollywood to find some legit investors to open another vineyard in Santa Barbara. This is where Sam Giancana introduces my great grandpa to Frank Sinatra for the first time. They all hit off and spend a weekend in Vegas. While in Vegas Giancana &amp; Sinatra discuss their hopes for a presidential candidate they kept calling Jacky Boy (JFK). Giancana worked with JFK’s father bootlegging back in the day and Sinatra <em>really</em> wanted a President for a friend. Giancana used his influence to help JFK secure the election on the behalf of JFK’s father and Sinatra. In return, JFK promised to stay out of their illegal affairs. But for Giancana this was an opportunity to control the White House.</p>

<p>Fast forward a little bit and Giancana spills some beans to a few associates (my great grandpa included) that he convinced JFK that his empire could not only benefit society, but the world. Therefore, JFK ordered the CIA to contact Giancana for an arrangement of covert operations including the assassination of Fidel Castro. Everyone laughed it off but my great grandpas friend Jon Rosselli confirmed. He even has the CIA wiretapping people on his behalf.</p>

<p>Giancana was ordered to send two guys with two pills to poison Castro with. Giancana took advantage of this opportunity and sent two guys to Cuba to do just that. But they failed and my great grandpa had no details as to why. But he suspected it has something to do with his brother, Robert Kennedy and the Attorney General at the time convicting a record number of mob associates. I remember my great grandpa saying “he is a meek man” and “can’t control his ugly brother.” </p>

<p>To make matters worse my great grandpa used to spend a lot of time with Sinatra. They would play pool and golf and gamble and hung out a lot at Sinatra’s lake house in Lake Tahoe. Marilyn Monroe was a frequent guest and so were the Kennedy brothers. My great grandpa at one time saw Giancana, Sinatra, Monroe and the Kennedy’s in the same room trying to fix a burned turkey. They met their in secret quite often. Giancana and JFK began beefing with each other because they were sleeping with the same woman. My great grandpa said he saw her picture, Giancana showed it to him a lot and he couldn’t understand why because in his words “she looks like bookworm.”</p>

<p>Months later Giancana lost his shit because JFK told him they are done. He wanted to severe his ties from the mob. To send a message to JFK Giancana murdered Marilyn Monroe on August 4th 1962 at Sinatra’s Lake Tahoe home. My great grandpa said they had moved her body over night and staged the scene. The message was clear however because Giancana had previously threatened to kill her if JFK wouldn’t continue to bend. After her death JFK took it upon himself to get rid of the mob and Giancana. </p>

<p>Giancana went to New York and spoke with the “commission” and received approval to assasinate JFK under the conditions of using a Patsy. They shopped around in communist sub cultures and found Lee Harvey Oswold. The perfect Patsy. Oswold was a known communistic, he wanted to move to Cuba and join Castro’s cause. Giancana and his men pretended to be alpha communists working closely with Castro. In the words of my great grandpa “Momo tricked the bastard into the whole goddam thing.” My great grandpa said there were two cops who were paid off to kill Oswald after he shot Kennedy and ran. That didn’t go to plan since Oswald didn’t know and tried defending himself. Oswald shot one of the cops and Jack Ruby an associate of my great grandpas and Giancana since Chicago finished the job and executed Oswald. </p>

<p>The night before the assassination Giancana, Ruby and many others were present in Dallas. They met up with Oswald again to go over the plan they had duped “Operation Victoria Siempre” a popular Cuban communist saying. Oswald was told that he is doing God’s work for the country of Cuba.</p>

<p>Well folks, that’s the story. My great grandfather passed on a few years ago. But we talk about this every Christmas and thanksgiving and my grandpa and aunts still tell it to all his day. I have letters written to my grandpa from Sinatra, Giancana, Capone and many others. </p>

<p>This story has even surfaced a lot in recent years. Quincy Jones, in a recent interview admitted that Sam Giancana killed JFK. I called my mom and was like “see!!” This is what happened.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading. I hope this reaches many.</p>

<p>Ciao for now,</p>

<p>Sal</p>

<p>And Sam Giancana admits it in his book Double Cross.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oswald didn’t know and tried defending himself. Oswald shot one of the cops</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t believe this however. You&#39;re referring to JD Tippet. He could not have killed him as it doesn&#39;t fit the timeline and the witness descriptions. Although the murder was pinned on Oswald.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>James Elroy wrote a novel called “American Tabloid” which has basically the same narrative outline.  The mob backs JFK and partners with the CIA to overthrow Castro to regain their empire in Cuba.  </p>

<p>JFK doesn’t back the Bay of Pigs and combined with Bobby’s crusade against organized crime causes the mob to turn against JFK, leading to the JFK assassination, handled by some of the same shadowy mob/CIA freelancers involved in the Bay of Pigs. </p>

<p>Elroy’s book almost feels like a documentary but my sense is that the mob/Kennedy/Cuba framework has been out there for years and many derivative works have been built on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m reading a book by Selwyn Raab right now called “5 Families: The Rise, Decline, and Resurgence of America’s Most Powerful Mafia Empires” and he gives a lot of credence to the mob killed JFK theory. He believes it was probably done by Santo Trafficante Jr (Tampa based mob boss) and Carlos Marcello (New Orleans based mob boss) and Sam Giancana (Chicago based mob boss) to get back at JFK and Bobby Kennedy because Giancana essentially won the election for JFK by rigging the votes in his areas, and he “thanked” them by unleashing Bobby on the mob when previously the mob had been a virtual mystery and unknown to most of the country, and nobody was taking them seriously as an entity. And then Bobby comes along and makes it his crusade to take down the mob. He says their thinking was “if you cut off the tail (Bobby) the dog (JFK) can still bite you, but kill the dog and the tail won’t wag anymore” so that’s why they went after JFK. There was more to it, and he got more into his theories of how it went down and all that but I can’t remember it all right now. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe this however. You&#39;re referring to JD Tippet. He could not have killed him as it doesn&#39;t fit the timeline and the witness descriptions. Although the murder was pinned on Oswald.</p>
