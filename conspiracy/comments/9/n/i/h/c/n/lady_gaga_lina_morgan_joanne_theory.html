       So I just watched Gaga Five Foot Two and there's a scene where she is outside smoking and starts listing all the women that "fame" has killed. She gets to the end and goes "and...you know who else..." suddenly everyone is looking down awkwardly and the director says "cut" quietly. I'm sure a lot of you have read about Gaga sacrificing Lina Morgana for her fame. - Morgana took the plunge on Oct 4 (some articles say 6) which is between Autumnal Equinox and Samhain, in the month of Beltane. 
Stefani embarked on her first tour as Lady Gaga October 9, 2008 - Morgana fell 10 stories to her death. She was 19. In Gaga's Paparazzi video she is picked up by a man and thrown off a balcony, falls with a spiral spinning background 'derivative' of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, and goes 'splat' on the concrete below. This video also features many shots of dead models, and the finale is when she gives the man poison champagne, calls 911 and says, "I killed my boyfriend" , smiling. I think Gaga has been referencing her involvement in Lina's death her whole career. My theory is that this whole "Joanne" obsession is actually a "I killed Lina" situation. She wanted to be able to honor Lina without making it obvious in her music, so she and her family (and the illuminati) came up with the idea of "Joanne". An aunt that apparently died at AGE NINETEEN. In the documentary it is mentioned that "Joanne's" hands needed to be amputated due to a disease, I believe this is a reference to Lina Morgana's ability to create art and music being forcefully stripped away. "Sinners Prayer" "Joanne" and "Angel Down" are all songs about her guilt. "I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
Oh, I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? 
Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel now" 
I feel like she is trying to say that if given the choice again, with the mindset she has now, she would choose to save Lina and allow her to live. 
"Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not ready for you
Every part of my aching heart
Needs you more than the angels do
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
If you could I know that you'd stay
We both know things don't work that way
I promised I wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin and my voice gets thin"
I find it odd that she "promised she wouldn't say goodbye" to an aunt that died long before she was born? 
Pokerface - It's about hiding her sins and wearing her mask
Love Game - Choosing fame over the right moral thing "Do you want fame? are you in the game?
Paparazzi - "I'm you're biggest fan" she's saying she'll always remember Lina and be her biggest fan since she ever got the chance to become famous. 
Perfect Illusion - It's about hiding the fact that Joanne is a lie, while still being able to have her music reference Lina. It's her "Perfect Illusion" to her fans. 
Brown Eyes - Everything was everything
But baby it's the last show
Everything could be everything
But it's time to say goodbye so
Get your last fix, and your last hit
Grab your old girl with her new tricks
There's many videos that prove that Gaga also stole Lina's style and sound. I feel like I'm one of the first people to say anything about this Joanne connection.

       Imo Lady Gaga is just running the same playbook Madonna used in her own career.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Be edgy with style/sexuality
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do and say things to draw attention to yourself.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Use music career as a launch pad and then transition over to movies when you get older.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Except Lady Gaga isn't quite the same level of talent or originality that Madonna was. She basically disappeared for the last few years. Right now she's in the remake of A Star is Born and they're shilling it really hard over at r/movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It made about $43 million on opening weekend which probably isn't the smash hit the studio was looking for. Then again, they only spent $36 million on production... which says something about their level of confidence in Lady Gaga's "star power".
      </p>
      <p>
       I figure we might see her in one or two more film roles and that'll be it. She's 32 years old now. That's young for a woman, but it's getting out of range for her fanbase... which mostly seems to be teenage emo girls.

       Madonna created the path and set the example. Gaga just imitated that, albeit in a less original and more gimmicky way.

       Madonna, will always be a pop music icon but she has nothing on Lady Gaga's natural raw talent. Gaga's rendition of the National Anthem at the superbowl was stunning. It revealed how wide the gap between them really is.

       'Was Lina Morgana Killed By Lady Gaga?'

       Basically, they came up together as friends and collaborators, Morgana started the weird costume shit Gaga does now and they were both getting famous at the same time so Gaga killed her to keep from being upstaged by a similar competitor. Seems a stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another theory is she sacrificed her to the Illuminati... because.

       Because fame requires the sacrifice of something you love? According to the Illuminati lore anyway. There are similar theories about rapper Capital Steez’s death and a whole bunch of others. Did you see the story about Beyoncé doing dark magic that came out recently? Her drummer accused her of sacrificing her cat?

      <p>
       Why jump to Illuminati at all? There's no evidence she was even in the same city at the time of death, and witnesses say Morgana jumped and wasn't pushed. Do people in the 2018 developed world really believe a singer can't get famous without being backed by some magical cult?

       Guess so. I don't think you can get ahead in entertainment without being exposed to their secrets. So how do they protect their whole scam? Membership is exclusive

       It’s my personal theory that lady Gaga is Isabella Blow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look her up. Dresses the exact same as Gaga. Similar face. Isabella blow committed suicide eight around the time Gaga was becomeing famous.
