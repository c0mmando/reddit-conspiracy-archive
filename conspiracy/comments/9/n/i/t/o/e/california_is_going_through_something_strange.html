        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ive been living back in California now for about 6 years and I&#39;ve had my ups and downs like everyone else but lately things have been feeling a bit... strange?</p>

<p>I now live in Hollywood, right in the heart actually and I swear... Ive been seeing the building swaying, roads breathing (or what looks like breathing), hearing low rumbling noises and seeing flashes of light at night.. I don&#39;t know what it means or how its going to effect us but it feels like me and a couple of my friends are noticing this. </p>

<p>More and more each night the sounds and vibrations get more intense and its hard for me to function because I live on the top floor of a very old building and I can feel the movement like a motherfucker. Ive been feeling this.. sort of energy for the past 5 months and only one other person who&#39;s this really nice elderly mexican guy can feel and get paranoid over the vibrations. Otherwise I&#39;m just made crazy to everyone else. Recently the building hired a new security guard and i told him about what I&#39;ve been experiencing and for the first time in 5 months someone heard me out and listened and then began noticing the same things I&#39;ve noticed. The other day there was a helicopter over my building (I skywatch often) and it looked like the pilot was unable to move from where he was at in the sky. I recorded this struggling helicopter over my building for over 30 minutes and it was kinda nerve racking because I thought the helicopter was going to crash. He would start to move and then become paralyzed again. Also, as he was what looked like struggling a huge massive white big winged creature flew around it. I couldn&#39;t capture it on camera since it was night and my phone is outdated. But it looked like a pair of white wings flying around for a bit before it took off. </p>

<p>Then the next night occurred which was the most bizarre annonomoly I&#39;ve ever seen... I took hundreds of photos because my video camera is too dark but it was these lights that were in the clouds and they were dancing.. I shit you not my friends.. but yeah now its just the bright red night skies, frequencies, helicopters and vibrations and i think these are the scariest because I don&#39;t know if its supposed to lead up to &quot;The Big One&quot; or what?</p>

<p>But Im officially freaked... anyone else experiencing this in your areas? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So weird.... I remember hearing a dude I met like maybe 10 or more years ago describe this exact kind of thing to me.
If I had not listened to this guy&#39;s story just for the hell of it and be as open minded to shit like that I would say your crazy.
I would be interested to share stories with you.
As well I could try to dig up some recordings possibly so you know I&#39;m not bullshitting.
If you want to message me and we can have a chat.
I am busy this weekend but if I get the chance I&#39;ll write back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do smoke weed but when i put a glass of water the counter you can see little ripples. The app I&#39;ve downloaded which shows the tilt of something and its vibration constantly fluctuates (for iPhone its called VibSensor). And I also downloaded a frequency app called Spectrum that measures the frequencies and it can hear and measure exactly what i can hear its kinda scary. But I don&#39;t know... Ive done weed since i was 14 and coke on occasion and I&#39;ve never felt anything like this before in my entire life..</p>
