<p>What constitutes a civil war is not usually defined.</p>

<p>I am curious, in your opinion what constitutes a &quot;Civil War&quot; ? </p>

<p>150 Million Vs. 150 Million?
What event would cause the country to split apart?</p>

<p>I can not think of a topic, subject matter, that would cause people to engage in a protracted conflict. Most people have become too soft, and the consequences are too extreme.</p>

<p>But I could be wrong.</p>

<p>So please, if you have the time lay out your 2nd Civil w@r scenarios.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt there would be a civil war, it&#39;s to unpredictable an you might then open yourself to external forces that might undermine the entire point of the civil war(like Russia , China, EU ,Mexico and Canada might want a some of the American pie)
I would rather think they are going to roll out tech like 5G that will make us sterile and most be depressed you will see large amount not people suicide, you will have an immense hoard of immigrants come into America not only from Latin America from Africa, China, and the Middle East.</p>

<p>This will start riots where the federal government will kill indiscriminately to reduce the population, basically creating the USA a human Trap for the immigrants, and the population. </p>

<p>Ones the population falls under X level the will start selection of the best traits or what&#39;s left (basically low IQ, not aggressive civilians) this will be given ample opportunity to breed and any deviation from the norm would be put down. </p>

<p>That&#39;s our future ... If you don&#39;t believe just keep doing what you are doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There will never be another civil war in America, the only reason the last one happened is because there were a lot of evil people living in America who were willing to fight for their right to own slaves and for other reasons, those generations are gone and now the only evil people we have to worry about are the power hungry rich people, and they are not the kind of people who are going to fight in hand to hand combat, and so there is literally nobody left to fight wars, the worst case scenario there are gang wars between major cities, but even most gang people are pretty chill and relaxed these days. It is looking like peaceful times ahead for America, I hope the rest of the world can figure out how to also live a peacefulish life.</p>

<p>TLDR: There is literally nobody that is going to join in on a war against other Americans, the worst thing that will happen is small scale conflict.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I presume that the social engineers who are currently engaged in this current pseudo &quot;culture war&quot;, have already determined that this <em>tension</em> now, is currently &#39;best practice&#39; in the U.S, insomuch as capturing as many people as possible in to ideological division. </p>

<p>So while it&#39;s not even mildly convincing that this narrative would lead to people taking up arms in any widespread fashion, it&#39;s still probably the best of the options that they&#39;ve calculated in that context.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s your answer. They&#39;ve basically created a monocultural, secular, non-monarchist republic, with enough of a focus on welfare... so this now, is the best they&#39;ve got. </p>

<p>To trigger an American civil war, it would have to be externally contributed to with mercenaries, false flags, and an incrementally engineered societal breakdown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you’re going to have a Civil War, it’s not going to be “150 million vs 150 million”; it’s going to be between the U.S. government (and its military), and an illegal revolutionary government (and its military). The goal of the U.S. government is to suppress the revolution and maintain the status quo; the goal of the revolutionary government is to abolish and replace the U.S. government, either regionally (as the southern states attempted to do a while back) or nationally (as, for example, the communists did in Vietnam). The distinction is that these aren’t just groups of people; there’s organization and a clear goal.</p>

<p>In the U.S., I would argue that this is not possible. At the time of the American Civil War, the federal government didn’t have a well-organized military, so the southern states really were on something like an even playing field. These days, there’s no outgunning the U.S. military. Also, back then states were a much more important piece of a person’s identity; these days people tend not to identify themselves that way, so it’s harder to imagine how a revolutionary force would organize.</p>

<p>Really the only sensible way to overthrow the U.S. government (aside from rigging elections, since the U.S. government basically gets overthrown every 4 to 8 years) is via a military coup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vietnam’s a difficult comparison to make, since the goal there was to unify Vietnam under the unstable and often incompetent government of Saigon, and early on the Viet Minh were able to steal American weapons from the south to fuel their side due to that incompetence. Also, a civil war would be a much more personal situation, which I think would make it less likely for rival states to arm the rebels (as China and Russia eventually did in Nam). Good points though...it’s not quite as cut and dry as I laid out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think about this everyday. Conditions for everyday life must get a lot worse. The rising wealth inequality will play a large part. The average American has to wake up to the fact that their children will be poorer than them. And every successive generation after. The assault on  conservatism, traditions and institutions by our modern secular society means the breakdown of trust and social order. The people have to see that the (((establishment))) does not care about their welfare at all, and their government is directed by a criminal conspiracy of globalists to plunder the entire world.<br/>
We would need to suffer as a nation several more engineered crisis like false flag attacks, moral panics and market collapses until all the lies crumble away and the propaganda is revealed to be misinformation. 
How long can bread and circus distract the people? Will the increasing exposure to the Internet lead the people to truth or more convenient lies? The federal government will be less and less responsive to the average persons needs and desires. 
The American empire will collapse and I believe it will be because of a civil war. </p>
