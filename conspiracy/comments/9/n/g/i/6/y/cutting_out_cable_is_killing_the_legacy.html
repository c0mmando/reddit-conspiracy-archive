<p>I just couldn&#39;t take those garbage commercials all the time. Who would have thought that adding more and more commercials would drive the masses to leave their precious cable boxes? At least with streaming services you can chose what bullshit to consume.</p>

<p>I agree with your censorship comment. They are really forcing our hand on this one. The cat is out the bag, they aint going to be able to put it back in. If they keep pushing us, they are pretty much going to force us to retaliate against their bullshit. History is always on our side. Fuck them. Keep up the good fight</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s more to life than you could ever imagine...and so much more satisfying than the sedentary slow physical death of watching TV. I always knew that it has an effect  on peoples behaviors and moods...ever notice how many ads for anti- depressants there are during the evening news? Ever notice how news anchors are actually acting and trying to convey a sense of panic and despair?</p>

<p>I cut my cable three years ago. I notice that I was feeling a sense of well being that I hadn&#39;t felt since I was a kid about three weeks or so after cutting it. I felt GOOD. Happy again. I kept up with current events online...I was in control and didn&#39;t have to sit through over the top propaganda anymore. TV media is totally anti-Islamic bullshit fear mongering.</p>

<p>I used to watch football starting with ESPN at 10 am for pre game info... watched the 1pm, 4pm and 7pm games...did not get off the couch except for beer and taking a piss. went to bed at 11 pm and felt like dog shit every Monday. I haven&#39;t watched a game in two years do not miss it a bit no sir.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the period spanned by the first four contests, Trump dominated the news coverage (see Figure 4). He garnered 37 percent of the Republican coverage, compared with Cruz’s 28 percent, Rubio’s 25 percent, and Kasich’s 10 percent. Trump’s coverage was also highly favorable. Positive news statements about his candidacy outnumbered negative ones by 57 percent to 43 percent. Cruz also had a positive balance, though by a smaller margin—55 percent positive to 45 percent negative. Rubio’s coverage tilted sharply toward the negative side. His negative press far outpaced his positive press—61 percent to 39 percent. Kasich’s figures were nearly as negative as Rubio’s.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Ratings. Clicks. Audience. Say what you will about Trump as a human being or a potential leader of the free world, he has an ineffable ability to get attention. He has called himself a “ratings machine,” and in the world of TV, ratings equal profit.  </p>

<p>“It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS,” Leslie Moonves, chairman of CBS, said of the Trump phenomenon in March, according to the Hollywood Reporter.  </p>

<p>“The money’s rolling in, and this is fun. It’s a terrible thing to say. But bring it on, Donald. Keep going.”  </p>

<p>Moonves’s ebullience makes it clear that ratings madness infects all of commercial TV, although, of course, particularly the cable-news channels.  </p>

<p>None rolled out the welcome mat more eagerly than CNN, which has billed itself as the “most trusted name in news.” And unlike Fox, which is blatantly conservative, CNN pitches itself as nonpartisan. It’s supposed to be the down-the-middle alternative to Fox and, on the left, MSNBC.</p>

<p>Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have been very, very good for the cable news networks.  </p>

<p>Thanks to an audience surge driven by nearly round-the-clock campaign coverage, the leading news networks will reap unpre­cedented profits this year.  </p>

<p>According to people intimately familiar with CNN’s finances, the network and its related media businesses will approach $1 billion in gross profit in 2016, a milestone unseen in its 36-year history. The internal estimate reflects a double-digit increase over 2015 and includes CNN’s international network, its popular website and the smaller HLN network, but it is driven primarily by its domestic channel, according to people at CNN.</p>

<p>CNN boss Jeff Zucker slammed Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook at Tina Brown’s first Women in the World Canada Summit, saying, “I urge more folks to hold them to account” for taking ads in a Russian-backed campaign to influence the election.  </p>

<p>“I think it is outrageous that Facebook will not be more transparent about the advertising they took from Russia, and show those ads and release more information,” Zucker said of the social-media platform.

<p>CNN Digital faced a budget shortfall in 2017, much like Vice and BuzzFeed, two other closely-watched digital news operations. Vice went through a round of layoffs last July. BuzzFeed also had layoffs.  </p>

<p>Morse addressed this at one of the town halls on Tuesday, according to prepared text of his talk provided by a CNN spokesman. Morse said the strength of the &quot;digital duopoly&quot; of Google and Facebook is a factor. He also said internal &quot;financial targets were overly aggressive,&quot; structural impediments got in the way of growth, and that CNN had &quot;tried to do too much too fast.&quot;</p>

<p>We&#39;ve developed an exhaustion to political parties, so they can only rely on pure hatred to keep them going into the election.</p>

<p>The next presidential election, the information you receive in your home town will be targeted to your demographic, while neighbors 50+ miles away will be receiving a different message.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve already started setting the cogs in motion with censoring political Facebook/Reddit groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t watched T.V. in years. </p>

<p>I remember many years ago being shocked when some old dude scoffed at me asking if he&#39;d seen a particular show. He laughed and basically said something along the lines of it just being a bunch of programming and propagandaand that he never watches it. </p>

<p>At the time I just thought &quot;Geesh what a paranoid old hippie!&quot;. Now I think, holy crap, he was right! I thought he was just a bit wacky, but in retrospect a lot of the outlandish sounding things he brought up (At a pre- Internet time) were dead on. Paranoid hippy wasn&#39;t paranoid, just well informed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve given up broadcast news shows for years now. Was having breakfast in the hotel lobby today and CNN was on. The anchor was almost gleeful in saying there were 5 new deaths related to Hurricane Michael. Turned my stomach, this attitude/delivery of the news. </p>

<p>Cut to the &#39;woman at the scene&#39; in Mexico Beach, FL and her delivery was breathless excitement. Like relishing in the carnage. Now that I think about it, the delivery was kind of pervy, almost fetish like.</p>

<p>Yeah, that was enough of that crap. I see no reason to spend any more of my life watching that kind of shit show. </p>

<p>I did recently switch from DirecTV to Xfinity cable to keep my sports viewing &#39;legal&#39;. For now at least. If Xfinity pisses me off I&#39;ll save money by dropping TV and paying for sports via broadcast apps.</p>
