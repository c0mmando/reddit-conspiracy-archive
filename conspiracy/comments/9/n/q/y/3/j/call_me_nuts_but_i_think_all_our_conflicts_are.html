<p>First sentence in the article:</p>

<p>A jury convicted a white Michigan man of assault on Friday for firing a shotgun at a black teen who knocked on his door to ask for directions on his way to school.</p>

<p>What I got from that:</p>

<p>Sinclair owns NBC and fuckin everything else. At this point its pretty obvious they know the impact of what they put out there. Why mention race to begin with?</p>

<p>This is just what I got from this and it happens too frequently to count. We are surrounded by media; told to fear one another while the folks up top benefit from all of our conflicts. When do we choose to stop playing the game?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>elaborate more please because im not making it just about race, this is a prime example. All races are capable of the same shit, we all are. Blacks make up a good chunk of crime with such a small % of the population, why is that? Shit education, generations of the same shit, when all you know is your neighborhood and everyone around shows you what adulthood will bring you, cops treat them different and are more aggresive off the bat, imagine not ever having a parent to tell you not to do anything different because thats how they were raised, and their folks? shits pervasive and systemic and the fact I have to go into this amount of detail over this with you should be enough of a red flag that you are carrying some prejudice about them. Will you admit it? probably not.. but why be probable? double down dude, its expected</p>

<p>If you watch the video, it looks like he did but didn&#39;t really put a lot of effort into aiming. The kid booked and was out of the yard by the time he came out. He still fired at the kid&#39;s back though. Not really a warning shot personally.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right about it being fabricated though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re clearly very young and have never been taught the first thing about using a firearm. Rule #1 is you don&#39;t point a weapon at anything you dont intend to destroy.</p>

<p>Also, There is no such thing as a &quot;warning shot&quot; in real life, that only happens in movies. In reality, when you aim a gun at someone as they&#39;re running away and pull the trigger, that&#39;s called &#39;Attempted Murder&#39; in America. At the very least Negligent Manslaughter. Regardless of whatever fictional scenario that you&#39;ve worked up in your mind.</p>

<p>Why base propaganda on real-life events, if it’s more complicated and expensive to do so? </p>

<p>You understand the news (and politics, etc.) much better if you view it as you do a reality-TV show (although some people admittedly think reality TV is “real” and that “the characters are genuine” haha).</p>

<p>Do I need to produce a list of historical and/or “news” events that were subsequently shown to be totally and utterly fabricated?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there an actual bias against blacks? Sure, up until the last century they were legally treated as lesser. It’s not a fabrication that there are racist people out there. What journalists do, is make people believe things without actually saying them by implication. This is called sensationalism. Why do they include that the kid was black and the dude was white? So your brain automatically defaults to thinking about racial disparity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comcast owns NBC but you&#39;re not wrong about them sensationalizing this race baiting story.</p>

<p>In fact, if you do a google search for this story, there&#39;s tons of articles about it all mentioning race in the headline.</p>

<p>Actually it&#39;s funny. FOX is the only one that doesn&#39;t mention race in the headline. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/327058569-video">http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/327058569-video</a></p>

<p>The sad thing is FOX isn&#39;t downplaying it because they&#39;re good journalists. They&#39;re doing it because it goes against their right wing narrative.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a contrasting headline from thinkprogress at the other end of the spectrum:</p>

<p><a href="https://thinkprogress.org/a-black-teen-was-almost-shot-dead-for-asking-for-directions-to-school-8515de412523/">https://thinkprogress.org/a-black-teen-was-almost-shot-dead-for-asking-for-directions-to-school-8515de412523/</a></p>

<p>This is their headline:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATED: Black kid almost shot dead in lily-white Michigan suburb for asking for directions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The term &#39;lily-white&#39; is pretty racist personally. This headline is needlessly antagonistic. There&#39;s tons of articles all across the spectrum and it&#39;s hard to find an impartial source that just lays out the facts without the bias.</p>

<p>Nothing here justifies trying to shoot anyone in the back. </p>

<p>Apparently police were called there before. The guy also had a previous charge of shooting at someone while driving. I&#39;m not really sure why Americans allow people with previous gun charges to still own guns.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing to really say that this was race motivated but there&#39;s also nothing to say that it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Apparently his wife freaked out, he ran downstairs, the kid saw the gun, ran, he came out and shot at him.</p>

<p>Also, apparently, the cops had been at his house a few other times. I think it was because his house was broken into previously. Maybe the guy&#39;s wife freaked out for real thinking someone was trying to rob them again. I&#39;m speculating on that part. I don&#39;t actually know why the cops were there previously.</p>

<p>You should be able to tell from the local police website if that particular street has had burglaries to determine if she had a legit reason to flip out though.</p>

<p>She&#39;s the one who first called the police to report a person trying to break in even though the video clearly shows the kid just ringing the doorbell a couple times.</p>

<p>A lot of the time, they make the kid look extra good. Like they&#39;ll portray him as a straight A student and innocent victim. Then you see their facebook page and they&#39;re little hoodlums.</p>

<p>This kid doesn&#39;t look like that. He legit looks like a good kid on his way to school. It also happened at 8:20 AM so his story checks out. Also, from the video, he is completely innocent and did nothing wrong.</p>

<p>This is definitely being played up by the press though.</p>
