       Just thinking about how the Mods here on Reddit do the majority of the work, while the corporation rakes in millions of dollars, and how we can mitigate this abuse, and it occurred to me, why can't the mods on Reddit create a union to directly negotiate with corporate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether or not labor laws are being broken by Reddit, there's no disputing the fact that mods here are essential to the day to day operations of the site and should be able to have a strong voice in the executive decisions being made.

       They certainly have a huge amount of control on the site whether or not they are technically considered "employed" or not.  They absolutely do work for Reddit regardless of whether they're paid or not.

       I get the argument you're putting forth, but it falls apart when you try to bring anything remotely involving 'legal' stuff about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes mods 'job' is to do stuff - But it's not a 'real' job. It's an unofficial, voluntary position that will never be recognised by any authority as any form of employment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Payment or not, there is no contract, no hand shake with the admins, nothing. Not employees, not contractors, nothing that you're proposing can or will ever be done.

       They're not employees, so none of this makes sense, but suppose you create a mod union. Then what? You go on strike until you get a paycheck? I guarantee for every mod who joins there will be 100 other people ready to volunteer for free.

       Moderators are volunteers who bear little to no responsibility/risk, unlike employees. Do you really want paid employees running subs? Do you want the responsibility and accountability that comes with it, if you're a mod?

       The rules of every sub are arbitrary. With no mods you can make a millions posts calling Trump the supreme most excellent glorious leader and no one could stop you.

       Reddit already has paid mods. Admins.

       Their job is to remove child porn and things Reddit don't want on Reddit. Meanwhile the rules of every sub are just written down.

       Anyone that was around during the Pao/FPH/blackout phases will know that Reddit has gone to shit since giving the mods more powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of them are jumped up idiots, nuking mass amounts comments and threads for the sake of it. ‘Modding for the sake of modding’.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s gone to their heads even with the simpler things now. These days it’s almost impossible to make a post in a lot of subreddits because of the ever growing slot of rules these morons add to their territory.  Rule after rule after rule and, even if you get through, it will be heavily moderated by all their fab new tools.
