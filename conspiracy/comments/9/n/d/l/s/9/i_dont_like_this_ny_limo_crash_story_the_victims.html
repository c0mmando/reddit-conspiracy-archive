<p>Seems to me like a &quot;think tank team&quot; considering the wide array of backgrounds and relations. Maybe they completed their task and were being disposed of. IDK! HELP!</p>

<p>List of Victims and the available info on them: (taken from: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/nyregion/limo-crash-victims-new-york.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/nyregion/limo-crash-victims-new-york.html</a> )</p>

One of Ms. McGowan’s best friends, Melissa Healey, 33, said: “She was always happy.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from Plattsburgh, neighboring town to where some of them were from, there&#39;s friends of mine that knew them and stories in the paper (small town, that makes front page news) of whole communities reminiscing on them growing up. Teachers, fellow classmates, etc.. I grew up in that area. The rural areas are close knit. How exactly did that lie of these people existing when they apparently didn&#39;t, according to you, suddenly become something everyone agreed to lie about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. When people rent a limo, they just assume that the company is legit. They assume the company keeps their vehicles in good shape, passing yearly inspections, etc.</p>

<p>Yes, they might check reviews. But as far as researching the rental company, I don&#39;t think that is something people normally do.</p>

My co worker knows almost all the first responders and when we talk about how fishy stuff seems he tears up.  I never said this ain’t a conspiracy and something crazy happened, but when people are trying to say “no one died” that’s where I draw my line. I know multiple people who personally knew people who died in this.  So it’s a bit heart breaking </p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that they all died in the crash, but I&#39;m questioning the reason for the crash besides bad brakes/bad management.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew damn near all of those who died on a personal level, and apart from loving spending time at the gym they were all normal ass people from upstate NY.  I think only 1 had any connection to a small local government.  The engineer has been a resident of my small town since he was a child and he went to my girlfriend&#39;s families daycare years ago.  The veterans were just good ol boys from upstate NY that wanted to help their country.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a conspiracy, just a tragedy.  They&#39;ve used this Limo service before for weddings and other get togethers.  It&#39;s just negligence on the companies part, and an unfortunate law of averages when it came to poorly maintained limo&#39;s.</p>
