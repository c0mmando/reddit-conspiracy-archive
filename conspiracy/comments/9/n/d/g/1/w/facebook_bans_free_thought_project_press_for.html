<p>Hmm. Interesting phrasing, I don&#39;t think this would hold up in any court, but is there something specific about the ToS at the time?</p>

<p>If I made a blog site and later amended the ToS to say &quot;and no doxing&quot; I would very well kick off people who were doing that regardless of my previous ToS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the stuff they posted was absolute trash or just plain wrong. It was also incredibly left oriented, and I hardly see how that is &quot;free thought&quot;, this coming from someone who is considered left.</p>

<p>While blatant censorship like that makes them look right, their page was a pile of garbage and contradicted itself all the time. I haven&#39;t had facebook for a few months now so I can&#39;t provide any examples, but i actively hid all their stuff because it was so bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wtf are you on about? Do you know what fascism is, or are you just saying things and hope they stick?</p>

<p>Fascism is a corporate run government, a government where corporation, where the rich dictate everything, not democracy, or freedom of speech, or what the millitary does. In case of NAZIS, thats what happens when fascism goes socialist, and thats why nazis are known as nationalist socialists (whilst forgetting that nazism came from a fascist state). </p>

<p>So do you realise how faulty your ignorant logic is? I bet not, because you fail to realise the steps it takes to transform from one system to another. Its not like one day you wake up and read in the papers that democracy is dead and now police sate is the law. No, its a slow and system degradation of rights and liberties, it takes decades. </p>

<p>In this sense, it may not be comparable to fascist nazis and they concentration camps. But it is still a corporate medium, dictating what society is allowed to discuss and think, through control of media. In this case facebook holding a monopoly of social media, a space where modern day exchange of ideas between individual both familiar and unfamiliar can take place. Like him or hate him, alex jones has the right under basic human rights to say what ever the fuck he wants, and it is in the marketplace of ideas that his coice can have support or not. It DOES NOT GIVE 1 (ONE) ENTITY THE RIGHT TO CONTROL WHAT IS AND ISNT ALLOWED. If the argument is made that its a private company it can do as it pleases, that isnt right. We already were there, over 200 years ago slavery was ok, private enterprises saw it their right to own humans and slave them. This is 2018, companies like Facebook should not have the right to take away basic human rights, and in the case of constitutional right to free speech. </p>

<p>Furthermore, if we are talking about the US government here, the size of influence of private entities on the government policies, it is like democracy doesnt exist in USA. From a harvard study showing that about 30% of public policies vs 70 corporate that make into law, to that pesky net neutrality overturned. So in that sense the large corporate behemoths having influence on government and conversely the trajectory of society, it really is fascism. </p>

<p>think before you speak....</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Fascism is</p>
</blockquote>

<p>a useless term in the modern world that is said as an insult to anything left or right and never used actually because there is no strict consensus on what it entails. Generally when one says something is fascist they want to assosciate it with the Italy, Germany, Romania, and others in the 30s and 40s. I&#39;ll stick to the source scripts I guess:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people...The corporate State considers that private enterprise in the sphere of production is the most effective and useful instrument in the interest of the nation. In view of the fact that private organisation of production is a function of national concern, the organiser of the enterprise is responsible to the State for the direction given to production.
- Mussolini 1932</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t claim that fascism is just a plutocracy or corporate dictatorship (not even mentioning the point that almost all governments have been/are plutocracies), it&#39;s a pure authoritarian structure that is designed to intrude on everyone&#39;s life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you fail to realise the steps it takes to transform from one system to another</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is irrelevant. You said this is fascism today I said no.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it may not be comparable to fascist nazis and they concentration camps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that&#39;s my point, it&#39;s downright disrespectful.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong I don&#39;t uphold this but I uphold their rights as a private entity. FB does not hold a monopoly, obviously (else what website is this), and is one of many places where an &quot;exchange of ideas&quot; can take place but it&#39;s not built for some political-intellectual haven for all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It DOES NOT GIVE 1 (ONE) ENTITY THE RIGHT TO CONTROL WHAT IS AND ISNT ALLOWED.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right to speech does not mean others must give you a megaphone. It means others can&#39;t take yours away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the argument is made that its a private company it can do as it pleases, that isnt right. We already were there, over 200 years ago slavery was ok</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This justifies nothing. &quot;see what happened with one aspect private ownership 200 years ago? that&#39;s why private property must be abolished&quot;. This is the current year and more and more folk are buying into government propaganda to control more of the economy and to put more limitations on businesses. That&#39;s what I see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in that sense the large corporate behemoths having influence on government and conversely the trajectory of society, it really is fascism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it really is like a violent xenophobic extremely authoritarian political ideology. Dude if you want to say that it&#39;s corporation-influenced go ahead, fascism entails a lot of other things.</p>

<p>As for 80% of soviet 18-year old dying in WW2:</p>

<p>40%, I was mistaken. I guess it is on the same scale as Facebook shutting down one page.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascism is a weapon. The original symbol shows a hatchet or axe (weapon) with a bunch of sticks tied around the handle to increase the weapon&#39;s weight/effectiveness. I don&#39;t think it was ever a real thing people used to fight with - it only exists as a symbol.</p>

<p>Take government, media and science each as individual weapon/sticks all bound together. One day the government goes on the offensive, so the gov&#39;t represents the axe on this particular day, and the other branches ride along to  support it.</p>

<p>Tomorrow the media goes on the offensive (against us) and all the other entities rally around/support the media&#39;s effort.</p>

<p>Fascism is: &#39;a group who&#39;s members act in unison as a weapon, with members taking turns at the core/as the edge of the weapon&#39;</p>

<p>Of the people I know, good people, they are so fucking clueless. Especially the &quot;educated&quot; ones. They are all brain dead. They are unwavering in their blind belief of liberalism. The echo chamber that is Facebook just got worse. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny talking to these people in real life when they find out that most people hate liberalism. They get so upset and I can&#39;t help but feel good. They are blind to the real world. Anyone who has a job, owns a house, or ever had to deal with the system know firsthand it&#39;s a joke. Liberalism only exist in dreams and online. </p>

Can&#39;t get your content out, can&#39;t even tell people that social media is silencing you. These are truly dystopian and ominous times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corporations are doing it to protect their master, the government. These are all sites that question the state narrative.</p>

<p>You have the power dynamic inverted. The government provides them monopoly protection (via regulation), and direct subsidy (govt contracts etc), in return they spy on you for the government and help police the official government lies.</p>

<p>They are doing this because they will be rewarded for doing it.</p>
