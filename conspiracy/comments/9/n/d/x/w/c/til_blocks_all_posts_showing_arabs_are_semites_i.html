    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the definition of antisemitism is inherently anti Semitic. That is the crux of my argument. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s swap out the word Semitic for another word: Fascism. </p>

<p>fascism
[fash-iz-uh m]</p>

<p>noun
(sometimes initial capital letter) a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism.</p>

<p>Now when you add the prefix, &quot;anti&quot; that should mean that someone is against fascism, when in reality the group ANTIFA, allegedly anti-fascism, is demanding fascist response to speech and action they deem hateful and oh my gosh I totally see your point...</p>

<p>Yes, because if there’s anything Jews are known for, it’s their slanted eyes, small noses, and hairlessness.</p>

<p>But anyways, DNA testing shows that Ashkenazi Jews are about half-European and half-Middle Eastern. They cluster closest to Sephardic Jews, and then Italians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree, in fact I have argued this many times myself.  That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t really understand the comparison.  Most Turks are pretty hairy (as are many Jews), some Turks can have very large noses (as can many Jews), and the epicanthic fold is present in almost every large ethnic group, just at very small numbers outside of East Asia.  I&#39;m not arguing Ashkenazim have a Turkish origin, I haven&#39;t done enough research regarding that to make such a claim (though I have seen some interesting coincidences (such as all the cities in eastern Anatolia that bare their name), but while interesting, they were not sufficient proof of such an origin, and I have seen a good amount of evidence against the theory as well).</p>

<p>Well, I never mentioned the Khazars, but anyways <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Uksc8i1.jpg">this is a similar picture</a> that <em>contains</em> the information (but it isn&#39;t the original paper I read about it), and I don&#39;t agree with the conclusion that AJs are nearly 100% &quot;Iranian&quot; in ancestry.</p>

<p>The earliest English recordings of the word are from the 1800s and refer specifically to Jews. Everything seems to indicate that the word has been used (in English) to refer to Jews almost exclusively. This may have to do with the historical significance/presence of Jews in Christian communities as opposed to Muslims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is HUGE! The Trump predictive TV show from 1958 specifically mentions the Leonids being connected to &quot;the end&quot; and it names 11/14 as the date. Now this could be the literal date or it could be 4/20/19, which is Jewish passover. Keep in mind too that 9/11 of this year was the beginning of both the Jewish and Islamic New Year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, feel free to prove me wrong, maybe that subribbit is run by raving Zionist leftists, but </p>

<h1>1: What does Reddit corporation have to do with this, non-Reddit employed mods?</h1>

<h1>2: What does Reddit have to lose from possibly having Arabs more often included in the definition of Antisemitism?</h1>

<h1>3: How possible is it that Arabs will be popularly included in the meaning? Antisemitism is a word for hate against Jews, hate against Arabs has a fairly different association.</h1>

<p>They&#39;re just trying to sterilise their subribbit from anything controversial or political, sometimes they clearly go too far but as I see it this goes in r/subredditcaner rather than anything else.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>TIL is so fucking scared they see something containing the word Semite or anti-semitism and they delete it to pre-emptively avoid a controversy.</p></li>

<li><p>An attempt to preserve a monopoly on a term (Semite).

<p>This is conspiracy of the reddit corporation so that anything anti Israel is antisemitism but Israel being anti Arab isn&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word you&#39;re looking for is hypocrisy and it is involved in much that Israel and its backers do. Israel wants the US to destroy Iran because of its alleged clandestine nuclear program but Israel developed its nuclear weapons in the same manner. Israel&#39;s backers push open borders on the Western nations that they are trying to subvert, but Israel &quot;protects&quot; its borders by shooting unarmed civilians. Israel&#39;s backers accuse all of Israel&#39;s critics of hate speech, but manipulate the MSM to destroy any opponents to their agenda. </p>

<p>Yes, because if there’s anything Jews are known for, it’s their slanted eyes, small noses, and hairlessness.</p>

<p>But anyways, DNA testing shows that Ashkenazi Jews are about half-European and half-Middle Eastern. They cluster closest to Sephardic Jews, and then Italians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were a leftover of an ancient warrior tribe. Supposedly they created Judaism to make themselves more prominent. Which makes logical sense for the era. For us it would be like making yourself a more legitimate international business, by creating a corporation.</p>

<p>Gotta hunt down where I read this study. Anything science discovers is up for peer review and debate, and archaeology/history that much more so. But it&#39;s fun to study!</p>
