    <div class="md"><p>Cell phone radiation is a concern because of the close proximity of the radiation source to your body. With automotive radar, it&#39;s less of a concern because it&#39;s further away from your body, your car will act as a partial shield and the waves directed at you are going to be of a shorter time duration than the typical phone call. Basically radiation becomes more of a threat the closer it is to you, the less shielding there is between you and the source and the longer time duration that you&#39;re subjected to it.</p>

<p>Its possible automotive radar is harmful in a significant way, but I&#39;m not aware of any studies of the health impacts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saying the experiment is too difficult/practically impossible for us to do a fully scientific standard isn&#39;t the same as debunking. The guy literally says that if we&#39;d been using phones for X amount of time then we&#39;d expect to see brain cancer rates go up (to which he states the haven&#39;t). They have. Studies in the UK, for example have shown that they&#39;ve doubled.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I found this and just wanted to make sure it was the same one.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t pass the sniff test for me. The rates doubled <em>for the UK</em> since 1995... but cell phone usage and ownership has WAY MORE than doubled since then. In addition, many other developed countries are seeing stable or decreasing brain cancer rates. Example: <a href="https://theconversation.com/new-study-no-increase-in-brain-cancer-across-29-years-of-mobile-use-in-australia-58927">&quot;New study: no increase in brain cancer across 29 years of mobile use in Australia.&quot;</a> If there was a link to cell use then it would have to be something completely unique the UK is doing with regards to cell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither of those studies are close to enough to make any kind of evaluation, so I don&#39;t know what makes you so confident, aside from inherent biases you have. Also note that the one you just posted doesn&#39;t pass the test put forward in the &quot;debunking&quot; video you just posted. There&#39;s not enough data to make any kind of assertion one way or another, the most that can be said is that there are problems that might be connected and we need to figure it the fuck out before its too late. I think its smarter to err on the side of caution in cases like this until you know the actual facts, especially when there are also correlations that back the worries up, albeit only slightly. The universe is an unforgiving bitch the the unwary.</p>
