       The vision sensors bounce light particles at your car and count how long it takes for them to make the round trip. It determines distance and speed based on keeping the rate of time to return from dispersion as even as possible to safe time of return. If it returns way too quick, braking is needed.

       Cell phone radiation is a concern because of the close proximity of the radiation source to your body. With automotive radar, it's less of a concern because it's further away from your body, your car will act as a partial shield and the waves directed at you are going to be of a shorter time duration than the typical phone call. Basically radiation becomes more of a threat the closer it is to you, the less shielding there is between you and the source and the longer time duration that you're subjected to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its possible automotive radar is harmful in a significant way, but I'm not aware of any studies of the health impacts.

       Cell phone radiation is a concern to people who don't understand it. It is not anywhere powerful enough wattage to have negative effects on the human body. On top of that, it's not ionizing. A banana has more ionizing radiation than a cell phone.

       Saying the experiment is too difficult/practically impossible for us to do a fully scientific standard isn't the same as debunking. The guy literally says that if we'd been using phones for X amount of time then we'd expect to see brain cancer rates go up (to which he states the haven't). They have. Studies in the UK, for example have shown that they've doubled.
This video literally studied nothing and just copy pasta'd a bit of government standard talking points, so yeah, not convincing. Its mostly obfuscation and conspiritard patronising for dem easy YouTube $$

       You said head tumors, not cancer

       I misspoke. The UK study was to do with head tumors. Cancer is a catch all term for tumours. If you need to be that pedantic off the bat though, I don't think I need to have this conversation.

       I don't usually link normie news but I can't be arsed digging deeper right now, so the telegraph will have to do. The general jist of the article is tumour rates have doubled and all the research is in chaos as to the cause. Many studies all contradict each other and most aren't any more or less reliable than the others, as far as I can tell.

       This doesn't pass the sniff test for me. The rates doubled
       <em>
        for the UK
       </em>
       since 1995... but cell phone usage and ownership has WAY MORE than doubled since then. In addition, many other developed countries are seeing stable or decreasing brain cancer rates. Example:
       <a href="https://theconversation.com/new-study-no-increase-in-brain-cancer-across-29-years-of-mobile-use-in-australia-58927">
        "New study: no increase in brain cancer across 29 years of mobile use in Australia."

       Neither of those studies are close to enough to make any kind of evaluation, so I don't know what makes you so confident, aside from inherent biases you have. Also note that the one you just posted doesn't pass the test put forward in the "debunking" video you just posted. There's not enough data to make any kind of assertion one way or another, the most that can be said is that there are problems that might be connected and we need to figure it the fuck out before its too late. I think its smarter to err on the side of caution in cases like this until you know the actual facts, especially when there are also correlations that back the worries up, albeit only slightly. The universe is an unforgiving bitch the the unwary.

Its usually better to use current up to date info with this stuff because science can flip on its ass pretty quickly when new information becomes available.

       Yeah, exactly, inherent biases. You work WITH this stuff. You don't study it on a quantum, or even an atomic level. Your bias leads you to believe that you know more than you actually do. Neither one of us are even remotely qualified to have that level of confidence in the subject matter.

       You're a little stuck on a singular factor here. There a quite a few variables that could be causing the problems, not just wavelength and ionizing capabilities. Funnily enough, this stuff is a lot more complicated than a basic high school science education (or even college) can work out.
