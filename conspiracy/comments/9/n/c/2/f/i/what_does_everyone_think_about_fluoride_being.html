If there is less or an unbalanced amount of melatonin in the brain that alters sleep cycles and rest patterns, leading to all sorts of problems but mainly makes people more subservient. Could this be a method of the government preventing people turning on them and stopping civil wars or so they can pass laws which a hundred years ago would of resulted in civil wars. Freedom is slowly dying, in Britain you can get Imprisoned for using hateful language. I don&#39;t agree with hateful language but what happened to freedom of speech? I mean this is from the 1998 Human Rights Act &quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of expression.&quot; - British people are literally having their human rights taken away and doing nothing about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Ireland we have fluoride added to the water supply. It&#39;s not going away any time soon and the whole supply of it comes from a family business associated with a current ruling government minister.</p>

<p>As far as the subservient part, I could well believe, as it&#39;s a carryover from our past days as a British colony, along with orange streets lights, to keep the population from uprising, according to &quot;ruling class&quot; thinking of the times. </p>

<p>Thankfully the orange street lights are slowly going and being replaced countrywide by warm white LED down lights over the last decade or so (also to stop light pollution, you can see Dublin street light pollution from across the water in Wales) but fluoride is here to stay.</p>

<p>However, resistance was not futile when it best could have been used to quell this practice (in the beginning) and now we have cultures three+ generations deep immersed in municipal water systems saturated with toxins.  </p>

<p>To those who understand the implications of this and other things like a garbage diet, for example, there is no wonder why so many are continually burdened with health problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sounds like your issue is with human rights, not the fluoride. </p>

<p>The law says &quot; Expressions of <strong>hatred</strong> toward someone on account of that person&#39;s colour, race, disability, nationality (including citizenship), ethnic or national origin, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation is forbidden. &quot; So, if youre only issue is that you cant be a racist, sexist or say something discriminating to someone then you have other issues. Expressing hate because of the reasons listed is NOT freedom of speech, its verbal expression of hate which causes pain and suffering.  Victimisation is NOT a human right and having laws to protect this IS!!!<br/>
This law is also in  </p>

<p>I’d advise anyone to drink water that has been treated 3 times:</p>

<p>Source treatment-treating well water as it comes out of the ground(this is what the town does)</p>

<p>Point of entry treatment- this is setting up a reverse osmosis filter system in your basement at the point of entry to your house. Old pipes in the ground and long runs can degrade water quality between when it leaves the plant and when it reaches your house.</p>

<p>Point of use treatment- a brita filter on the sink tap you drink out of</p>

<p>It may be overkill but no fluoride will be in your water and you can reduce excessive plastic bottle waste</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last point of treatment might actually be removing necessary minerals from your water because charcoal filters do not filter out fluoride. And if you&#39;re RO or Deionising your water then you really need to add minerals <em>back to it</em> otherwise your water is going to be stripping minerals from your body. So RO or Deionised is 100% all you need to do. But definitely get concentrated liquid minerals if you have an RO or Deionising system in your house - or if you buy water from a Whole Foods or local grocery store that has those machines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all true, I typed my response up fast and didn’t get into too many water quality details but it was more of a post saying if you’re that scared about the idea of the government putting fluoride in your drinking water their are more than enough ways to filter it out before you drink it if you’re concerned enough</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, given your question, do you think &quot;the government&quot; drinks from the municipal water supplies? What about their wives, husbands, sons, daughters, parents and grand children? What about their minions and others they require to carry out their plans? And so on. The problem with a conspiracy that uses something so universal as the water we drink or the air we breath is that it is extremely difficult to avoid targeting the conspiracy members as well. Not impossible, but certainly difficult. Then turn the question the other way: won&#39;t making a populace docile or subservient to their own leaders also make that populace that much easier to conquer by an external force?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fluoride exists naturally in lots of ground water. Many plants treat to take out fluoride to safer levels. Some plants&#39; sources do not contain much fluoride so they add Hydrofluorosilic acid or some other form to bring the levels up. People amended their constitutions to add the shit. If you don&#39;t want it in your water make an amendment and the plant operators and EPA will make water without fluoride. Also, the plains indians which had shit loads of fluoride in their water naturally still warred with eachother. I think it&#39;s just a dumb thing that we shouldn&#39;t have to add to water anymore. We get plenty of of it from our tooth paste.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think fluoride is too hyper focused on and that the rest of the stuff in the water is just as bad.  I understand the purpose of chlorine but also think you should not consume it on a daily basis either. And then there is the field runoff which I am sure they can not fully remove, like round up and other harmful pesticides. And the pollution. I know in my area there is a high level of chromium in the city water from decades past smelting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not hard to sort this all out: </p>

<p>1) Fluoride needs to be in contact with your teeth to help strengthen or whiten them.  That&#39;s how fluoride treatments at the dentist are applied - they put the fluoride pasted in a tray, shove the tray on your teeth then remove it and was off the teeth.</p>

<p>2) If digested fluoride provided any real benefits to your teeth, dentists would prescribe fluoride pills.  Dentists don&#39;t EVER do this and this should be a serious concern for anyone/everyone.</p>

<p>3) The fact that #2 is true, should tell you everything you need to know about adding fluoride to drinking water and why it should never happen and be stopped where it&#39;s already occurring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is one of the most &quot;real&quot; Conspiracy theories that exist. </p>

<p>I am not arguing that it alters your brain or that it prevents cavities. But why medicate drinking water? </p>

<p>Fluoride is in dollar store toothpaste and mouthwash, and is naturally occurring in all water sources. So it&#39;s already there and if you don&#39;t have enough, if you brush your teeth, you will get <em>more</em> then the recommended dose.</p>

<p>Also the idea of using municipality water sources as a means of mass un-diagnosed medication?  </p>

<hr/>

<p>Even if there are absolutely no side effects, no harm, and it can only help everyone who uses it, why do it? </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a &quot;rare&quot; element and it&#39;s not hard to get. If you brush your teeth you get more then the recommended daily dose. If you <em>don&#39;t</em> brush your teeth then what is it really helping? </p>
