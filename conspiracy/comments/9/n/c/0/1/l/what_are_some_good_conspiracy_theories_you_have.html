    <div class="md"><p>So a common theme in the ancient aliens theory is that humans were created as slave labor to mine precious resources, namely gold, for the Anunnaki. It is thought that this gold was transported off earth and used for what ever purposes they needed it for back on their home planet.</p>

<p>What if that was not the case? What if it was horded on earth then used to create a world banking system. What if our earliest ancestors were used as slave labor to further ensure their enslavement long after any physical (or at least blatantly physical) presence was needed.</p>

<p>To me this theory seems much more plausible than transporting a heavy metal through vast distances across space. Just something to think about.</p>

<p>I agree they were lab experiments that originally got loose at a army base in PR. I find the prospect of a government funded experiment to create a hybrid creature for the purpose of eliminating a countries live stock utterly terrifying. Not sure it got out on purpose though. Why do you think that&#39;s the case? </p>

<p>Humans have been around for about 200,000 years, according to bones. That&#39;s hard to visualize. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s imagine it as a movie. A 90-minute movie at 30 frames per second has 160,000 frames. So, if each frame is a year, a human lifetime would be about 2 seconds long. <em>Can you think of a movie where a two-second clip tells the whole story?</em></p>

<p>With our movie metaphor, the entirety of human history from the oldest written records up to present day would be just the last 2 minutes.</p>

<p>Thinking of technology, we went from horse &amp; buggy to space ships in 2 seconds.</p>

<p>Who knows what the other 89 minutes of our story may be. But there&#39;s been plenty of time to try a lot of stuff and start over many, many times.</p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly within the realm of possibility that all of our lives been painstakingly engineered ahead of time. We&#39;re living in the current technological age because those who were in charge a hundred thousand years ago designed it this way. It&#39;s like the matrix it the Truman show. Free will is an illusion. We&#39;re being farmed.</p>

<p>I believe Gandhi once said that when he was beaten by police in South Africa, that being knocked down brought him closer to God. </p>

<p>One thing I do think folk should do though is make their own shoes. It can&#39;t compare with professional machine design obviously but some cardboard slippers of 2-3 hour works that you made yourself can feel nice and cost nothing.</p>

Back when the Strava GPS heat map was found, it exposed a large number of heat signatures from a remote location in Antarctica. When you compare the area on Google Earth, you can only see mountains and snow. Why is this? Remember when John Kerry randomly visited Antarctica days after the 2016 elections? Supposedly it was to assess the area for global warming, but why would he choose such an important time in the US elections to make his trip? </p>

<p>As a kid i would skip brushing all the time. My brother brushed morning and night. He has em all messed up and mine are perfectly aligned. I would only brush mornings when I&#39;d have that morning breath (rarely).</p>

<p>However I had like 5 cavities all between the ages of 5-11. Soon after my family lost our insurance coverage &quot;my dad went self-employed&quot; and we stopped going to the dentist. I would brush more frequently but not as much and with little tooth paste</p>

<p>Around 12th grade I&#39;ve stopped brushing my teeth with anything but water. I haven&#39;t had a cavity. No teeth pain or anything except when my molars grow.</p>

<p>The only thing is mine are yellower than my brothers. At the same time I drink too much coffee and soda. Which I&#39;m trying to reduce and maybe even cut off.</p>

<p>We humans have live perfectly without fluoride. There excuse is it helps your teeth, which I don&#39;t even believe.</p>

<p>All my teeth are yellow as fuck and crooked, don’t matter to me though. I maintain that the reason I grew into a free thinker and escaped the chains of the conditioned thinking is my reduced flouride intake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SSRI/SNRI antidepressants are highly physically addictive. Doctors usualy don&#39;t warn you about this when you are prescribed them. They came up with the fancy term <em>SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome</em> to describe the withdrawal effects because they don&#39;t want people to think they are experiencing actual withdrawal from an addictive drug.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally true...speaking with a doctor, she told me &#39;SSRI&#39;s are meant to be used for very short periods, to hel get you through intense life moments&#39;</p>

<p>So, your whole family dies in a plane crash, but you still have to go into work on monday...fine, take the SSRI. The reason SSRI&#39;s prescribed long-term for people stop working, and they have to switch to a different &#39;blend&#39; to get the same effects, is because anxiety/depression serve an important function; it&#39;s not neccessarily &#39;good&#39; to just &#39;wipe out&#39; those feelings...those feelings are the brain/body matrix&#39;s way of telling you there&#39;s something you need to address. Your brain compensates after a while, trying to bring those thing back into the forefront, in an attempt to make you recognize those feelings are symptoms of an underlying problem you need to address. Escapism doesn&#39;t cure anything.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you look at big pharma&#39;s top 4 cash-cows over the past 30 or so years, they are (in no particular order):</p>

<p>1) Anti-anxiety drugs</p>

<p>2) ADHD medication</p>

<p>3) Opiates</p>

<p>4) SSRIs</p>

<p>Now, what do all those drugs have in common? They all make you feel like shit after you stop taking them, after just a short time of consuming them.</p>

<p>I started researching Pharm industries many years ago, after I became a casualty of the opiate epidemic, and let me tell you guys...that industry is straight up EVIL. Don&#39;t trust a single substance they produce. Literally, unimaginably EVIL track record in almost all regards (and I don&#39;t use that word lightly).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not correct. The top selling drug of all time is Lipitor, which is for cholesterol. Cancer treatment medications such as Herceptin and Biologic drugs such as Humira, Enbrel, Remicade etc used to treat autoimmune diseases are well into the billions as far as sales go. Nexium was a blockbuster and it&#39;s for heartburn.</p>

<p>Anti-anxiety drugs such as xanax, valium, ativan etc for the most part have been available in generic since the early to mid 80s. A 100 count bottle of generic xanax 1mg costs under 5 dollars to a pharmacy.</p>

<p>Antidepressants are widely used and sold, but are also available as cheap generics. A bottle of generic lexapro costs around 3 dollars (100 count).
Antipsychotics are profitable. Latuda costs over 1,000 for 30 tablets. Zyprexa was similar before it went generic.</p>

<p>Generic Opiods USED to be very inexpensive too. Vicodin 5/500 generic was a few bucks a bottle. Prices have gone up in recent years. Oxycontin has always been a couple hundred dollars per 100 count bottle of 10 and 20mg and upwards of 800 dollars for 80mg. Sales are way down in 2017 and 2018 of all opiods across the board. </p>

While police guarded cash points and banks they allowed rioting and looting to go on for days, meanwhile the main stream media blamed &quot;gangs organising on their BlackBerry &quot;.
BlackBerry was the last hold out to keep encryption codes from intelligence agencies and had defended themselves in court. Right after the riots courts forced BlackBerry to hand over encryption keys,because you know

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt many things official story (moon landing, JKF, 9/11) but on my own I have thought these:</p>

<p>- MTV was sabotaged from the inside: it was a huge success, you have the best idea for a tv channel, you had 3 streams of revenue: cable companies, commercial brands, and disc labels, and you only had to broadcast videos they give you or even pay you to air. All of the sudden it changes into reality tv and dumb shows. I guess rock and roll lyrics were dangerous.</p>

<p>- Black culture in the sense that is shameful to be good at school and other things was designed to put black people down. Now they want people from the other races to admire blacks and adopt those attitudes that make life more difficult.</p>

<p>- Trump was hired by Hillary to take a dive, and lose the election, He betrayed her with help from a powerful group.</p>

<p>I know for a fact that he was a drug dealer and would hop on a motorcycle late at night to drive two hours away for his traveling massage therapist cover job...</p>

<p>But i have wondered/felt that he had some kind of deal with gov or police and could even be carrying out orders. The house and land was bought from someone wealthy who was also ex-mil and rumored to be a big-time drug dealer of some sort.</p>

<p>So basically the landlord or some secretive organization gave him a good deal on the land &amp; house in exchange for his business of growing/delivering weed or whatever with a cover job. He also took a 2 month trip alone to Alaska for a &quot;job&quot; among other strangeness. </p>

What if that&#39;s what it means to ascend? To enter into a place within your self that rises above your current form and into another state of being. A level of understanding and communication that goes beyond words. What if being in communication with any thing at all is to be enslaved? To position to be effected by some other things cause. What if we never knew thoughts or feelings or emotions could be expressed simply because we did not have the words to do so? What would be the native tongue of God almighty when he said &quot; let there be light?&quot; If I were tasked with dominating a planet, the very construct of how the mind crafts its lense is what I would aim to control. Nothing else would matter if they could never escape the &quot;reality&quot; they themselves had created. What if there were an alphabet that with its letter &quot;A&quot; it contained all known languages of the earth, yet somehow it communicates and transfers information so quickly that it could never be pronounced in physical form, only encountered by sight. And that&#39;s just one &quot;letter&quot;. To sum it up I don&#39;t think any language of man has the complexity and depth to truly liberate the conflict of the human condition in it&#39;s entirety, it would take something higher. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Effective perception management at scale necessarily encompasses negative perceptions. Understanding that within any sufficiently large population, it is unavoidable that some people will believe crazy things about you, bad things about you, and crazy bad things about you no matter what you attempt---the best you can do is manage that risk: if you cannot stop people from believing crazy bad things, then instead seek to influence what specific crazy bad things people do believe. It can profoundly influence both behavior and thought patterns in a given target population.</p>

<p>As it turns out, it is much easier to convince people to believe crazy bad things about you than good things. You can also influence target populations that may even simply consider these narratives, but do not embrace them themselves as truth. Some will even choose to expose themselves to these narratives for entertainment, as well as for the purposes of debunking, mocking, and ridiculing them for pleasure. Yet even still they may be effective.</p>

<p>A key element of what makes these narratives so effective is that they are crafted and delivered in a manner intended to be perceived as subversive toward the interests of their primary focus, and so the narratives are immediately less suspect of being an influence tool actually designed to benefit their primary focus. An example of a narrative based manipulation may be ascribing highly advanced offensive and defensive capabilities to a primary focus, which then subconsciously leads to limiting the potential range of attacks an adversary may consider. Narratives may also be produced as misdirection devices to distract from legitimate and non-falsifiable information circulating in the ecosystem. Incorporating disclosure of truthful but non-verifiable information in otherwise false and easily debunked narratives can also build resistance to future acceptance of the truthful components in an alternate context. Absurd, distasteful, and blatantly false narratives may also be circulated about the primary focus, and made to look as though they were produced by the opposition, in order to discredit that opposition.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories are (to an unknown extent) stealth propaganda vehicles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two conspiracies I came up with while tripping acid on two occasions (don’t discredit just because I thought on acid, it’s a great drug).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We perceive all five senses with portions of the body that were engineered via evolution, just like any other animal on this planet. Meaning we all came from one creature. Beautiful thought right? The scary part of the thought was that corporations of today disregard your senses and sell products that in fact damage these senses (apple earbuds may cause deafness someday, fast food may poison our tastebuds, computer screens may cause blindness). I believe that millennials in their senior years will have very VERY dull senses compared to seniors of today, thus making it even more possible to manipulate mankind in the future to come</p></li>
<li><p>Relates to the first one. Humans, or most humans I should say, do not possess the evolutionary equipment (senses) that let us view the world, the TRUE world. There is a whole level of consciousness and tangibility that we can’t even grasp because our “eyes are not open wide enough” so to speak. There are definitely beings/landscapes/objects that live in higher dimensions that we can’t see/touch/hear/taste/smell. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>That the reason US is set against Iran is for 2 reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>influence of Israel and Saudi Arabia in American politics, specifically the pedophile networks they use to compromise politicians, judges, businessmen.</p></li>
<li><p>To delay and hopefully destroy Chinas One Belt One Road project. The greatest geopolitical fear for the US is the supercontinent of Eurasia being dominated by one power, or even the disparate power centres working together. That&#39;s why the US elite are set against Russia, to ensure they can&#39;t ally with Germany,  and it&#39;s why they&#39;re fucking with Iran, to ensure that China doesn&#39;t have a high speed railway route to Europe.</p></li>
