<p>It seems really strange to me that everyone in the limo died but the limo itself is not all that damaged.  The frame looks intact, even the windows look undamaged.  I would have thought the vehicle would have been way more messed up.  How could everyone die and the limo hardly has any dents?</p>

<p>I am not necessarily saying there is a conspiracy here, but it is odd.  Are there any first responders here that can comment about this?  I was a volunteer firefighter many years ago and have seen lots of bad wrecks, this seems just weird to me.</p>

<p>I can’t speak for the other conspiracy angles but regarding the crash itself, I saw this shared on another post and it helped me understand how easily people not wearing seatbelts are flung around, even when the crash doesn’t look so high speed.</p>

<p>look at 0:35 - imagine the force it takes to launch a human being through the windshield and that far up into the air.</p>

<p>and 0:50, a city bus, and one which seems to be turning (so not going fast) is hit by something and it causes a rollover - “luckily” here they have a lot of room to be flung out. i think it would actually be more beneficial for there to be a rollover and big open windows because the force dissipates as it tumbles. so those people are pretty lucky comparatively speaking.</p>

<p>now imagine it’s a tightly packed limo and the crash is a lot more abrupt. By the photos it looks like the limo didn’t get to gracefully roll over, it just smashed full tilt boogie into that ditch. And all those bodies packed in there have nowhere to go and are just min 100-200 pound human projectiles smashing into each other with incredible force. It’s terrible bad luck that they all died but I could see it happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not arguing with anything you&#39;re saying here. But 1 out of the 20 I think def could of lived. I&#39;ve been thrown out of a car before, sitting in the back seat with no seat belt and we got t boned, had a bruised shoulder and that was it. Have also spin out and hit a brick wall side ways going at least 60mph, lost control at around 75mph, and again wasnt wearing my seatbelt and in that incident was completely fine with zero injuries. </p>

<p>Both accidents happened when I was 18. And i was drunk in both situations. So youth and being drunk (go limp vs tensing up) could of helped. But the passengers in the limo werent that old either and I&#39;m guessing had been drinking as well. Who knows, we are weirdly strong and yet fragile creatures at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You dont think its a conspiracy but post it in here anyway? </p>

<p>What about this seems fishy? I dont get why people are trying to make something out of this crash.... genuinely curious about the conspiracy angle on this. </p>

<p>Limo goes from 60 - 0mph instantly....... people not seatbelted would be tossed around like a salad bowl on a summers evening. Im suprised people were even alive when the first responders got to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s definitely a statistical anomaly that everyone died, but until we know exactly who perished on board I do not understand jamming conspiracy into it. It&#39;s not like a bunch of diplomats simueltaneosly died, or the random Russian people getting assassinated multiple times a week, they were just partying as far as we can tell. Any theory is worthless without a possible motive </p>

It felt like my ass was getting shoved up my spine into my brain but nothing was broken except my wife&#39;s wrist because she grabbed the dash.  Multiple tons of force would have forced us through the seat belt like an egg slicer.  It was a lot of force mind you, but not tons.  My wife and her son (who was in the back seat) had been a previous accident several years before without wearing seat belts.  Their car hit a concrete approach at highway speeds.  They both survived but the boy had several broken bones.  Accidents are crap shoots.  They could do a little or a lot of damage.  But still, if the limo was doing 100mph I can see no one surviving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are loads of reports today of the brakes being faulty the window latches not working, it ran a red light and smashed in to an unoccupied SUV, skid marks on the road found could be rom when it hit the suv as it was going full speed and  there are images of the front wheels found off the car and pieces of the front so no doube it was a full on crash and if they all slamed into the privacy window they may have broken necks or been stabbed with glass from window bar or dirnks but it is strange that theres no reports of worse damage to the car, </p>
