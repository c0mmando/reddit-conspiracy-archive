<p>Ban any user who breaks the rule . But going on about it public just creates more trouble. Like suicide and mass shooting publicity just makes people more aware of it and sees it happen even more . Lets says i get banned fir arguing with you and i see it as unfair what do i do. I know tmor is a place that annoys you and a place trolls go to comment on conspiracy sub . I know this because you make post almost weekly about tmor . What do you expect to gain from all these post . Why dont you do similar ones about other subs like a right leaning one that trashes anything against the president . </p>

<p>With all the obvious right wing propaganda accounts constantly making posts about TMOR brigading their partisan tactics it started to make sense. When liberals are banned from r/conspiracy where do they go with the account? I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t really want to go to r/politics to read everything they agree with or get mad because someone already commented the joke they thought of. Right wing users who are banned easily go to The_Donald who delves into conspiracies against them and against democrats. They also used to have greatawakening.</p>

<p>Where do liberal conspiracists go when banned from this sub for being anti-Trump and saying it over and over? They know that users in this sub are protected and have a very specific message. Also they constantly go after one particular sub. So why not join that sub when banned to annoy those who scheme to control r/con?</p>

<p>The best course of action concerning TMOR is always rejected. Never mention them and totes is already censored to not let their &quot;crossposts&quot; from being seen here.</p>

<p>Honestly, it feels like a symbiotic relationship at this point. Right wing people need &quot;shills&quot; to validate their claims and left wing people need to gang up on an unpopular opinion. </p>

<p>I think there is a thin line between brigading and participating. I think a brigade is a more direct call to action. &quot;Hey look at this guy, downvote him.&quot; over &quot;Hey look at this guy.&quot; Goes to downvote.</p>

<p>If we really want to stop brigades then why don&#39;t we make accounts specifically for the subreddit and all crossposting banned then?</p>

<p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s also a brigade when a group of people visit and disrupt a thread with votes and comments because it was linked from a meta subreddit.</p>

<p>There&#39;s many examples of this happening in popular subreddits like SubredditDrama and bestof.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The most downvoted r/conspiracy comment this year is <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7w110u/do_people_honestly_believe_theres_a_car_orbiting/dtwodpy/">this one</a> at -1300.  According to the <a href="https://archive.is/89srA">archive</a> the comment score was -46 when it was <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/7w7f0k/rconspiracy_discusses_the_shape_of_the_earth_again/dty2t22/">linked in SRD</a>, 18 hours after the comment was made.</p></li>
<li><p>The second most downvoted comment is <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8gdxz6/every_comment_is_deleted_from_this/dyaxqga/">this one</a> at -800. According to the <a href="https://archive.is/g8d4z">archive</a> its score was 5 when it was <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/8geinc/hahaha_how_the_fuck_was_slavery_real_like_just/?sort=old">linked in TMOR</a> 1.5 hours after the comment was made.</p></li>
<li><p>The third is <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8s08cf/using_fivethirtyeights_own_poll_aggregate_trumps/e0vhdpu/">this comment</a> at -430. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/8s0pqs/topmind_decides_trump_has_80_approval_rate_by/?sort=old">TMOR thread</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>etc. etc.</p>

<p>Out of the 1000 most-downvoted r/conspiracy comments this year, 736 are in threads linked from TopMindsOfReddit.</p>

<p>Being linked by a meta subreddit has a noticeable effect on comment scores whether voting was explicitly called for or not.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I would agree but then my thought goes back to why don&#39;t we make reddit disallow crossposting at all and you can only have an account for a specific sub. You could be posting in r/con, see that comment in SRD and downvote it because it said the Earth is flat and you already participate in the sub. So many situations like that.</p>

<p>The next comment was basically a right wing propaganda account agreeing with Kayne because Kayne agrees with him. About slavery being a choice and the claim that the slaves outnumbered the slave holders. Which is just not true. </p>

<p>The third comment is just laughable. Do you really expect these comments to be upvoted to a high amount if they were not linked? </p>

<p>Especially when PLC&#39;s comment was at +5 and he definitely has more than 5 alt accounts. </p>

<p>Since we&#39;re talking about how the huge change in scores is evidence of brigading, it seems you&#39;re asking if brigading really matters, especially if it&#39;s just amplifying the current sentiment.</p>

<p>I think it does. I think it disrupts discussion, frustrates regular users, discourages others from posting, and can manipulate reader&#39;s opinions on topics. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, these are just a few of the more extreme examples. There are many comments that had the direction of their score flipped. Even the second example went from +5 to -800.</p>

<p>Even if the comment would have eventually been downvoted by the r/conspiracy community, it would not have been -800. A comment score that low in this subreddit is an extreme outlier.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a scatterplot of that thread: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NWRDqtF.png">https://i.imgur.com/NWRDqtF.png</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a snapshot showing the current score for each comment, and the time the comment was made for the first 48 hours. Comments in the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8gdxz6/every_comment_is_deleted_from_this/dyaxqga/">chain</a> linked from TopMindsOfReddit are marked with a red <code>x</code> and comments outside the chain are blue dots.</p>

<p>You can see comments in the linked chain have a much higher variance in score than comments outside the chain. It&#39;s easier to see with a boxplot: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/RHqdghL.png">https://i.imgur.com/RHqdghL.png</a> Comments in the linked chain are on the right.</p>

<p>This is common with other linked threads. I have some more examples <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/91i97m/that_time_that_tmor_was_caught_redhanded/e2yjakg/">here</a></p>

<p>This one: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0HTjg2N.png">https://i.imgur.com/0HTjg2N.png</a> shows a thread that was linked after it was removed from r/conspiracy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me like you expect those comments to not have any downvotes at all. That is the real reason for calling everything a brigade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said I didn&#39;t expect them to be downvoted. I&#39;ve already responded to this at least once. I&#39;m also not calling every downvoted comment a brigade.</p>

<p>Does it matter what you call it when one subreddit linking to another causes a heavy change in vote scores?</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I said something about that. Such as we cannot crosspost ever to eliminate any threat of that. But it&#39;s a stupid idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The simple point is, non crazy shit isn&#39;t as likely to get &quot;brigaded&quot;. If were gonna post crazy shit here from time to time, you have to expect some ire from the outside. Its part and parcel of a public forum. This kind of activity is rife throughout reddit, so its not unusual that its happening here, it just seems more compounded because we deal in material that is generally more &quot; out there&quot; than most people are used to dealing with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Ban any user who breaks the rule . But going on about it public just creates more trouble. Like suicide and mass shooting publicity just makes people more aware of it and sees it happen even more &quot;</p>

<p>Not as silly as comparing complaining about online hate subreddit with mass shootings, when it&#39;s more in the realm of David Hogg spreading &#39;awareness&#39; in this weird hypothetical.</p>

<p>Also, your asking for more niche forums in a place that has been previously exterminating troublesome niche subreddits.</p>

<p>Yes there is.</p>

<p>Eh true.</p>

<p>Not really. They have some fundamental differences in opinion that&#39;s why they are divided. </p>
