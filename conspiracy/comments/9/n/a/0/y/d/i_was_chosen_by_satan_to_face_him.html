        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Allegedly he told me himself. Through one of his proxies; a guy I just met, who‚Äôs cool as shit by the way. I suppose his only pitfalls are that he‚Äôs a murderer and claims to be possessed by Satan. These are things he elected to tell me <strong>after</strong> I let him come with me and my friend on a road trip. </p>

<p>If you understand my story, which of course you probably don‚Äôt, you understand that I deal with these kinds of crazy things regularly. It really takes a lot to make me flinch. </p>

<p>But yeah I‚Äôm one of 7 white males that the elite cult chose to play their game. There‚Äôs always 7. </p>

<p>We‚Äôve been fighting a battle all year. Most of us just found who we are. 3 are evil. 4 are good. I‚Äôm sort of the neutral one who‚Äôs sided with good, for obvious reasons. They‚Äôve kept the world going this long by amplifying the negative energy field through ritual human sacrifice (including warfare blessed by 9/11). We should be in paradise by now. </p>

<p>I wouldn‚Äôt be telling you this on here, knowing that this sub is full of trolls and naysayers, unless I had a solution. Don‚Äôt believe me, I don‚Äôt expect you too. I expect you to think for yourself and ask questions, like I did. When they came to me with this information I didn‚Äôt believe them either, until they showed me how my life had been tampered with and how they‚Äôd chosen me when I was a boy. </p>

<p>Anyway. I know you don‚Äôt get what I‚Äôm talking about I‚Äôm mainly saying this <strong>too</strong> the Freemasons watching so that I may work within universal law. I‚Äôm <strong>telling you</strong> what is going to happen. I‚Äôm speaking it into existence, in public, so that you <strong>may not stop me</strong> </p>

<p>My brothers; the Crown, the Eye, and the Throat, and myself the Heart will leave for the Arctic at some point next year. We will travel into the unknown and face whatever mysteries lie at the top of the world. I will finance this journey. </p>

<p>This is not a cult, it‚Äôs not a joke, and it‚Äôs not a trap. </p>

<p>We can easily make it there alone. </p>

<p>But if by any chance this message resonates with you and you want to help us, even make the journey with us, come. </p>

<p>I would love to build an army for God. </p>

<p>Idk how to put it but basically me and my fellow sacrifices are gonna go there and maybe get sacrificed so that every body else can live. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for starters I didn‚Äôt know any of this until this spring. It was told to me by Masons in person and I spent all summer in a war with them where several people I know and worked with were killed and several of their members including one the 7, the Root, were sabotaged by me. Essentially it <strong>is not just me</strong>. There‚Äôs four of us right now, and actually there‚Äôs 963 people in the world at one time who have the ability to change reality. 963 natural warriors. 7 gatekeepers, or sacrifices, or Chakras. There are many names. We are chosen by the bad guys, why? I don‚Äôt know. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm simply recounting this information. I didn‚Äôt make any of it up. I couldn‚Äôt. If I told you the full story and showed you the evidence you would claw your eyes out. I‚Äôm trying to save the world because I can, but I‚Äôm going to die doing so. They told me of course no one would know who I was until after I was dead, and I except that. </p>

<p>God is merciful and has given me the chance to redeem mankind in this timeline and keep us going but to do that I‚Äôm gonna need some help. </p>

I had already been dealing with all kinds of strange occurrences (gangstalking, etc) you can read back to my posts from July to August of this year to get a further understanding. Essentially on June 6th they broke our agreement where behold stay off the internet an they would leave my people alone. I didn‚Äôt find out until July 19th that one of my fiends was the Crown and that in June 6th he had been offered 70k to join the Masons. This kid had $30 to his name and turned them down because of one conversation we had. </p>

<p>I could go into all kinds of detail regarding this. Seriously if you‚Äôre that interested just go back to JT posts from 2-3 months ago. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm 25 years old </p>

<p>I‚Äôm a soldier for God </p>

<p>That‚Äôs it </p>

<p>I‚Äôm the Heart </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dualism is a false dialectic created by Lucifer.  He represents both the dark and the light.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>2Co_11:14¬† And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The Masons and the New Age movement has fallen for this false paradigm.  Satan is slowly exposing his dark side to the public so when his light side crushes it, it will be seen as salvation by the world.  In reality the Antichrist will represent the light and not be this dark figure.  He will seem to be good to everyone in the world and he will have power real power that will cause him to be worshiped.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Dan_8:25¬† And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>He will cause people to prosper and seem to bring peace but it will end with destruction for anyone who falls into his trap.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>You need to abandon this quest that represents the &quot;light side.&quot;  Indeed there are mysteries to be solved about the north pole (and south) but it&#39;s not important compared to the salvation of your soul.  All that matters in this life is you repent and believe this:</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>1Co 15:1¬† Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;¬†</p>

<p>1Co 15:2¬† By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.¬†</p>

<p>1Co 15:3¬† For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;¬†</p>

<p>1Co 15:4¬† And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:¬†</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The simplicity of repentance and belief in the above gospel for salvation is what the masons and the rest of the mystery schools are trying to prevent humanity from knowing.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>2Co_11:3¬† But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>All the false religious systems are set up to deny the simplicity of the gospel.  Don&#39;t fall for Satan&#39;s false light/dark dualism paradigm.  It&#39;s been pushed forever in Hellywood movies.  The only true light is Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Joh_14:6¬† Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I haven&#39;t seen that but they like making the Antichrist an overtly evil figure (dark side) when he&#39;s named as such as with Damien in The Omen and things like that.  He&#39;s depicted more realistically in things like Game of Thrones as John Snow or characters like Superman.  He will unite disparate peoples and be a peace maker.  He will have supernatural power, be killed and resurrect causing him to be worshiped by the masses.  Probably introducing himself in the form of an interdimensional alien or something similar.  He will likely bring a warning of a grave threat to humanity from a powerful external entity that we must prepare for.  In reality that will be Christ Jesus coming to take the Kingdom of Heaven (earthly kingdom) by force and he and his army have already lost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. According to the Masons, they pick the 7. Were like a neutral force. The way to look at it would be the 963 are like the positive charge to the 7 being a negative charge. The devil himself supposedly chose us. We‚Äôre gate keepers. It has something to do with universal law. When one of us dies another is chosen. Same could be said for the 963 but they are chosen by the universe itself. </p>
