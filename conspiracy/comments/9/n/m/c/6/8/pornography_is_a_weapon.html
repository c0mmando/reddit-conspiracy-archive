        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am not advocating nofap. I am fine with masturbation. I am speaking out against the very advanced, mkultraesque, violent pornography of the gonzo age that is creating a culture of sexual violence and insecurity. Pornography will one day be looked at like a drug. I am not a Christian. Or a moralist. I am not speaking out against pornography on moral grounds. I am speaking out because of the empirical data showing its use as a weapon to degrade the relationship between men and women in society. Remember nothing is free. If something is free, you are the product.</p>

<p>Nothing against looking at hot tits online. What is bad is the deep addiction that develops into a pathology that requires more drastic expressions of sexual behavior. We have to ask ourselves what is going on in society when pornhubs analytics show that the majority of searches in the are to do with incest and cuckoldry. In the television age we have moved into a society of voyeurism. Pornography in itself is a form of cuckoldry to the celluloid images on the screen. We are becoming viewers and not doers... This kind of searched out sexual release is a sign of a sick society with messed up incentive structures.</p>

<p>A common argument in favor of pornography is that it has always existed. I agree, degeneracy has always existed, but not to the extent of what we see in the gonzo porn industry of today. I think it is disingenuous at best if a person is comparing Greek vases to Sasha Grey&#39;s gang bang videos. There is a big difference between prostitution (actual sex) and the mkultraesque flashing images and scenes of modern online pornography.</p>

<p>We must realise that we are being manipulated.</p>

<p>&quot;Porn happens to be fantastic at forming new, long-lasting pathways in the brain. In fact, porn is such a ferocious competitor that hardly any other activity can compete with it, including actual sex with a real partner. [10] That’s right, porn can actually overpower the brain’s natural ability to have real sex! Why? As Dr. Norman Doidge, a researcher at Columbia University, explains, porn creates the perfect conditions and triggers the release of the right chemicals to make lasting changes in the brain.&quot;</p>

<p>I highly suggest you all read this article;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post bro. I was addicted to it and got into very unhealthy habits because of it that ruined relationships, spent thousands towards prostitutes even though I had a gf at the times who loved me, and ruined my sex life and my subconscious because of it.</p>

<p>Porn is 100% a weapon and a subconscious programming device and you should also see who the owners of the biggest free sites are to notice what the pattern is there.</p>

<p>These days, I have disconnected from porn, have reprogrammed my subconscious, am in healthy and happy relationship, and am stoic and ascetic when it comes to what I allow into my consciousness.</p>

<p>Also kriya yoga, prayer, books, meditation, exercise, hobbies, and keeping busy is all great</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m a therapist.  There is a growing number of healthy men that struggle with their porn use.  There are real affects to the repeated exposure to porn.  It’s not unusual for a man to have a difficult sexual experience with a person because they have both conditioned their mind and body to the porn and self stimulation.  </p>

<p>Also, there is something to be said for the isolation and disconnection excessive exposure to porn can bring to men.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup. long term porn use has a ton of side effects; purely by the addictive nature of it; probably explains how a lot of hollywood went pedo; hedonism.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t hide it now, they have straight up satanic/illuminati hypnosis porn. I&#39;m all for a mindfuck but I draw the line there. Not to mention the objectification of women both by the industry and porn users.</p>

<p>I still remember quite a few years ago when porn was largely normal; its seemed literally overnight every title became incest/cuck related on every site. </p>

<p>trying to create a perceived normality perhaps?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All he said was that he thinks its interesting the gray ghost thinks interracial pornography is comparable to the others. The first thought I had of a logical explanation of interracial pornography is the assimilation of other ethnic groups into Western culture and capitalism/consumerism, therefore pandering to them in order to feed the system. I don&#39;t think that should be ignored, not when it is the driving force for so many systems in Western society.</p>

<p>When it comes to this multicultural stuff (which I have my own thoughts and opinions on which some may perceive as rather &quot;conservative&quot;)- the basis is not always a matter of other groups invading inland- but a lot of the times, it is rather a matter of certain groups expanding outward on that which is foreign.</p>

<p>The basis of promoting of incestuous and humiliation-based acts, however, seems to stem from something else that I can&#39;t (and honestly don&#39;t want to) think of...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fetishization and the promotion of interracial porn may have been part of some sort of agenda.  I&#39;m a racemixer in my family but I never had a fetish for ethnic girls...  My wife and I just happened to connect on certain things and one thing led to another.  Most people do not consider racial differences in their porn when looking for a selection.  Interracial is a niche fetish, and it may have a big slice of the pie but it&#39;s still a niche, yet it is a prominent feature on every frontpage.  There&#39;s analytics, there&#39;s data to support what I&#39;m saying, interracial porn is overrepresented on frontpages.  Haven&#39;t you noticed that racial strife has exploded in recent years?  Is it really crazy to say the promotion of interracial porn could be part of some agenda to foster this strife?</p>

<p>Confession: My first exposure to porn was from the softcore stuff they would show on Cinemax and Showtime. The actual acts were fairly &quot;tasteful&quot; and there were actual elements of realistic romance.   So you can expect what my reaction was the first time I saw it online.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Porn and military service are both tools of preventing domestic anarchy and revolution.</p>

<p>Both largely target testosterone-driven male populations. By conscripting males 18-28 and sending them overseas and keeping them busy (or killing them) with military service, we don&#39;t have to worry about them protesting or demanding change domestically. By the time they are finished with their service, they are indoctrinated or past their wilder days.</p>

<p>For the rest who don&#39;t serve, giving them easy access to pornography allows them to be distracted and diminish their own testosterone stores, keeping them docile, distracted, and in a way, sedated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to think about the military now sort of as just a source of income for young men too. Before you hardly got shit for joining the military, you just did it because you thought you were serving your country, which is an honorable selfless thing to do. We haven&#39;t really ever needed to be in any war, especially now that all of them for the past 30 years have been about getting oil. But yeah, I notice when I don&#39;t watch porn or beat off for a few weeks I feel like I have way more motivation for things because I&#39;m seeking out dopamine from things other than porn and my testosterone levels can actually become normalized without getting drained a few times a week. It&#39;s oddly different from sex too, I always feel completely energized the next day after sex as opposed to using porn </p>

<p>&quot;That’s right, porn can actually overpower the brain’s natural ability to have real sex! Why? As Dr. Norman Doidge, a researcher at Columbia University, explains, porn creates the perfect conditions and triggers the release of the right chemicals to make lasting changes in the brain.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Umm... Dr. Norman Doidge, a respected psychiatrist and lecturer on <em>neuroplasticity</em> who literally wrote a book called <strong>The Brain&#39;s Way of Healing</strong> on how these are <em>not</em> lasting changes?       </p>

<p>Also, what&#39;s up with the source? Let me guess, the new drug is... porn?      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;All addiction involves long-term, sometimes lifelong, neuroplastic change in the brain&quot;  and regarding sexual plasticity &quot;the main point is that in our critical periods we can acquire sexual and romantic tastes and inclinations that get wired into our brains and can have a powerful impact for the rest of our lives.&quot;</p>

<p>And yes, he has written extensively about how porn can destroy love relationships, often using clinical examples.    &quot;most striking were their reports, almost in passing, of their increasing difficulty in being turned on by their actual sexual partners, spouses or girlfriends, though they still considered them objectively attractive.&quot;</p>

<p>Did his 2015 book somehow discredit his own extensive body of work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, I&#39;m not experienced with his other work outside the one book and some YouTube videos (and I guess my previous experience with the book was in relation to an ill family member), but I remember a much more positive take-away and a specific focus on case studies of the brain&#39;s ability to <em>overcome</em> those kinds of neurological changes?        </p>

<p>I feel my point still stands that the posted link is literally from a site declaring a war on porn with the same wording and mindset of a war on drugs. Also, I feel that you personally make some great moral leaps back and forth in your SS, like:        </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am speaking out against the very advanced, mkultraesque, violent pornography of the gonzo age that is creating a culture of sexual violence and insecurity.<br/>
...<br/>
Nothing wrong with looking at hot tits online.<br/>
...<br/>
A common argument in favor of pornography is that it has always existed. I agree, degeneracy has always existed, but not to the extent of what we see in the gonzo porn industry of today. I think it is disingenuous at best if a person is comparing Greek vases to Sasha Grey&#39;s gang bang videos. There is a big difference between prostitution (actual sex) and the mkultraesque flashing images and scenes of modern online pornography.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But thank you for keeping it civil, and if those quotes are accurate I will concede the point about pornography causing changes to the brain, according to the author. I still have concerns about your motive, and I feel that it is more morally-based than you&#39;re letting on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was not my post or submission statement.  I have no motive here, friend.   Just a question.</p>

<p>I am not too familiar with his 2015 book, so I just asked because I thought you might know.  The first quote was from his 2007 book &quot;The Brain That Changes Itself&quot; and the second was from a 2014 paper the would have been written while the 2015 book was being worked on.  If something new was learned since 2007, then it would be possible that Doidge, in good faith, would modify some of his previous positions.     That being said, both positions you mention above have been thoroughly explored by Diodge.</p>

<p>Well, fuck. I did it again. Sorry, I confused you with the OP somewhere along the way.</p>

<p>Also, I definitely agree that quotes from years apart could mean totally different things. Like I had said, my personal take-away with <em>The Brain&#39;s Way of Healing</em> was that the brain has enormous potential to alter the way our thought processes work in response to external or internal stimuli, but the book&#39;s focus was on positive methods to use it to overcome mental illness and addiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Porn is addictive. The science is there. Addiction has been EXTENSIVELY studied. So what is your motive? What are the positive effects of a daily habit of watching incest videos? It doesn&#39;t have to be a moral issue but porn is morally corrupt at it&#39;s core. Maybe you personally enjoy moderate viewing of porn made by two loving, healthy adults. You would be in the minority. Healthy porn is always much less exciting and rewarding than spending time being intimate with someone. Sexually or otherwise. Yes cocaine makes things fun, it also make fun things less fun when not on it. </p>

<p>People try to play it off that our tastes are changing or people are coming out with their weird kinks. However, half the videos that say sister and such are just retired Brazzer or other content that has nothing to do with siblings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Survival of the fittest. Click on something like that once, I get it. Twice. Maybe. Repeatedly viewing porn that is described as incest or child related, then I don’t really care how you got caught. You did. And if you think you won’t get caught, look into what HTTP is. It’s not just four letters. It’s a protocol. And your entire life on the web is not stored just one place. It’s distributed. Everyone potentially knows what you’re actually like. That is a good thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I had a sister. This was before I discovered incest porn. mercy plz. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve personally noticed is an insane amount of bbc porn and shit degrading white men. Basically next to 0 white supremacy black slave porn in comparison. It&#39;s almost as if someone has decided destroy the white race by tapping into their sexual subconscious. Look at all the useless fags pardon my language, addicted to soylent with their moobs and pot bellies and lumber sexual beards, who I can only assume fantasize about foreign invaders impregnating their girlfriends. You know they can&#39;t get hard for shit and get tired after 2-3 pumps anyway, and what else reason would they have for wanting this open borders bullshit if they weren&#39;t brainwashed into utter self loathing. Then you provide them with these &quot;answers&quot; as if it&#39;s just natural for you to be a useless shit so go ahead and let it happen, let the invaders come in and get your women pregnant even against their will because they want it anyway deep down and those guys over there already know all women love rape and are just playing coy, which you can&#39;t seem to get cuz you have this strange obsession with consent, no man worth his salt ever fucks with consent he&#39;ll rip that butthole open and she&#39;ll thank him for the opportunity to prove her worth, and then clean off the mess she made when he&#39;s done with her mouth because if she had lubed up and done some stretching exercises there wouldn&#39;t be all this blood all over the place, so make sure to apologize for that too. Meanwhile the impotent soy addict is like oh yes plz sir, may I have some more, as if it&#39;s the natural order of things for barbarians to rape women and for men with a conscience to just watch it happen, and this is apparently what the women want too because hey my bible says so, and there&#39;s this whole thing called the red pill where they teach you that all women are so unstable that 100% of them have daddy issues and love abuse but only if you go full psychopath only pussies go half psychopath and say something nice to her afterwords, and don&#39;t even think about saying thank you I had a nice time, and it&#39;s just a function of nature and you&#39;re a beta pussy if you don&#39;t accept the naturel ordurvz. Drink up nubs. You know there&#39;s cultures out there where they have the boys blow and drink the semen of the older men to apparently absorb their knowledge and experience. I think personally if their women did a better job cleaning their man&#39;s pipe they wouldn&#39;t have to resort to making up shit like that. The reason why they don&#39;t do it with the little girls is because cmon no one wants to marry a girl that took old man dick in her mouth, say what you want that&#39;s just nasty and would uproot the entire system completely, so they bite the bullet and make the bois clean the old man pipes. Kind of like in america how the infantry are boys slurping up old man general pipes, making sure his rod is clean and his wallet full of that green. Look I know the spartans were fags, but I just sense this connections between military and homosexuality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s shaping behavior.  Combine a stimuli with an orgasm and you are conditioning yourself to associate that stimuli with pleasure.  It’s kinda like the way a fetish develops.  The amount of readily available porn is concerning.  It’s know that new/novel stimuli is more arousing than a know stimuli ... for example, what may start out as arousal by “rough sex” may over time after repeated exposure can lead someone down the road to violent, degrading sex.  (Which may have never been the persons original desire but seeking the novel stimuli the person may increase the severity of the sex act) .  </p>

<p>Also, it’s important to realize that this proliferation of incest, gang bang etc etc porn is changing people’s interest not the other way around.  You are aroused by this because you are readily exposed to it.   They are not  making this type of porn because people have been asking for this type (excluding the part do the population where this is their natural interest )  they are producing it because they want you to ask for this. </p>

<p>I don’t know why this is happening, there are many theories.  Also,  I have nothing against porn, I am concerned about classical conditioning being used on the population. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some types of porn are already illegal, as are many other Internet activities, they&#39;d just use those to justify monitoring everyone&#39;s Internet. If they weren&#39;t already, which they are, so your point is moot. What you&#39;re really worried about is not being able to watch porn as freely as you&#39;ve gotten accustomed to.</p>

<p>Your ad hominem is way off, as well. Incel types are the most pro-porn people around. And yes, there&#39;s some of those on 4chan. What gets most men going against porn is realizing that it has negatively affected their boner and ability to have sex that is enjoyable to the woman. Virgins would have no way of knowing whether they could stay hard for a real woman, and would probably just assume they could, and would never make the connection. </p>

<p>Most of us who are against porn are having sex regularly. When i see anti-porn discussions on 4chan i assume they&#39;re mostly men with families or relationships that they value. </p>

Yes, child porn is bad, but no, pornhub, which is a huge American company with massive revenue, does not host child porn, they would have been taken down by the police a long time ago if that were the case, so they are careful to make sure they keep earning big money. No, I am not fantasizing about fucking my family when I watch incest porn, I just like the story having some sexual tension.

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever read anything by Andrea Dworkin?  You might find yourself agreeing with some of what she&#39;s had to say about this.</p>

<p>Why do you say you are not making your argument on moral grounds?  If you&#39;re opposed to modern pornography because of the harmful effect it has on people, and on their communities, that is a moral argument, and I don&#39;t think you should be afraid to frame it that way.</p>

<p>I think I agree with you generally, but its a sensitive area.  The US in particular seems to have a hard time understanding how one can oppose a practice, or try to discourage a practice, without criminalizing that practice or invoking the violence of the state against it.  Pornography gets tied up so closely with legitimate issues of free speech and sexual freedom that its easy to understand how well intentioned people can find themselves on the side of depravity.  Perhaps that was what you were trying to get at by saying yours wasn&#39;t a moral critique?  That sex isn&#39;t inherently bad, and people seeing sex isn&#39;t inherently bad, but that the particular way that most modern Americans see sex is bad?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am more likely to agree with your point of view although I&#39;m a bit torn on the subject I see both sides perspectives. Has anyone ever thought maybe we are being programmed to get married  so that men are essentially feminized. How do we know marriage is the correct way to be? Personally I feel like women can be good company but 24/7 GF is a bit demanding and any sort of progress made to better man kind is forgotten. Women are all about having fun 24/7 or at least being entertained. Hence the song &quot;girls just wanna have fun&quot;. If the men are married to women they are going to be essentially slaves to the women, who are mindlessly obeying the government every step of their lives. Since women are naturally less likely to dispute group thought. natural followers if you will, see &quot;david koresh&quot; and waco texas. Or the fact that women are 98% of the time victims of pimps. not men. </p>

<p>I think the problem is Girlfriends are not very good at sex, and porn makes this very apparent. Girls just lay there or get way too excited. And GF&#39;s don&#39;t want to do alot of things that we see in porn. Thats for sure. My GF&#39;s are always afraid of my man essence , or sperm. Which I think is&#39; kind of ridiculous since If I go down on her she is going to being getting some fluids in my mouth so whats the difference? Anal is out of the question for sure.. lol. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>All of my experience leads me to believe that men and women are not meant to be married in the current situation of the world. We are meant to hook up and be together for extended periods of time, but a whole lifetime? I dont think so. That would make more sense in a colonial type of world, where a woman would have a bunch of children and that would be her whole life. But today women want to have more choices and less children. Doesn&#39;t make sense to be tied to another person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>when did I post about groping women, probably never. I anticipated your attempting to attack me on the grounds of my post history, so I was scanning through my post history earlier. I didn&#39;t find anything objectionable in it, I guess you must&#39;ve looked even harder than I did.</p>

<p>nobody said I was superior to women by the way, that&#39;s just something you&#39;re projecting onto this. Some people are in a position to lead other people, sometimes it&#39;s optimal for one kind of person to play a particular role unto another kind of person, it has nothing to do with superiority. I don&#39;t think it makes sense to make judgments about the value of human beings period, since where does the value even come from, and what bearing does a person&#39;s choices even have on it?</p>

<p>but yeah man, submitting to instruction, not that complicated. When a kid disobeys his parents and tries to do everything his own invented way, it doesn&#39;t matter if the kid is a genius or if the kid is dumb as bricks; he&#39;s not intelligent or high status for disobeying his parents,; he hasn&#39;t earned extra credit for seeking his own independence; on the contrary, his submitting to his parents is the most pragmatic thing he could do for himself, and his failure to do so  indicates his childishness. Same thing with my wife and my marriage, not sure what&#39;s so terrible about that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What’s terrible is that your wife is not your kid or your property. You are disregarding her desires in preference to your own. The relationship is unbalanced and unhealthy...<em>unless</em> she just happens to get off on that. Maybe if it’s a master-slave sexual fetish thing, that makes a bit more sense if she really wants to be dominated like that. But that’s not women in general. Putting the idea of women “obeying” their husbands out there will get negative feedback because we are sick of that. Historically women have been suppressed and told to obey because their desires and ideas were considered less important due to them being inferior. Also there are many independent women who meet resistance from certain men in life all the time due to outdated gender-based behavioral expectations that generally benefit males only. That’s why women are being so vocal and annoying now. We are just not obeying anymore. It’s time for us to discard gender roles and accept that women differ in nature just as much as men, and can be just as complex, independent and ambitious. And when we have equal power we will be subject to the same criticism, expectations of behavior and responsibilities of male leaders. Women are not children. women are often the most hardworking and mature people around. Women have been shown to be the most effective leaders in business. Men don’t even have a concept of the strength required to be a woman sometimes, or what women actually go through and experience in their lives. They don’t want to hear about it, it doesn’t give them a boner. We don’t care anymore- we’re saying it anyway. We’re done. </p>

<p>Still I think it’s nice if you have a truly happy marriage, that’s something to be proud of. The groping comment was in reference to your first Reddit post about a sexual assault and harassment sub that should most definitely be removed from the internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t delete the post, it&#39;s still there. It was a post requesting ownership of a subreddit. There&#39;s nothing wrong with the post.</p>

<p>I never presumed that my wife is my kid or my property, that&#39;s something you&#39;re adding to what I&#39;m saying. What I do presume is that my leading my wife is the most advantageous thing for my wife. I don&#39;t disregard her desires; that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about. Rather, I use my strength to lead her in what she does, so that she is not inhibited in what she does by her weakness. In her submitting to me, the correctness of my headship is revealed to her, and she is made to receive my acting in honor toward her in a way she could otherwise not receive.</p>

<p>I know that there are plenty of useless, incompetent, evil men out there, and that many are not using their resources responsibly, to put it gently. I don&#39;t blame you for seeking some alternate arrangement, or for not seeing what I am seeing. All I can tell you in response is this: different types of people attract different types of people.</p>

<p>cheers homie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it manipulation, or simply the consumer pushing the industry. </p>

<p>This could still have pretty negative affects. For example:
(Made up numbers incoming for example sake)
If 30% like incest, then an algorithm to put the most popular videos up top would have more incest videos than others that maybe 20% into lesbian or whatever.  The consumers interests are pushing this type of consumption in this scenario.</p>

<p>The problem however, is that then it pushes that in front of other people, possibly changing their minds like you indicated to then want that type of thing. </p>

<p>I agree that it can definitely be bad for you, and is causing some issues. </p>

<p>But I am not sure it is intentional manipulation, but could also be the consumption by a group of individuals causing an algorithm to put out the top videos that end up being what that portion are watching. </p>

<p>Somebody else mentioned who owns all of the porn websites, does anybody have that info? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not one to ever agree with porn stuff like this but tbh you may have a point. Idk if it’s as far reaching as govt involvement, as I think the industry (like any other) will produce what generates the most views/money which I guess now is cuckoldry and incest. It is weird though as others have said it kinda happened all of a sudden.</p>

<p>Anyways, I have noticed that since watching porn on a very frequent basis it is sometimes harder to actually find fulfilling sex with a partner. Not always but sometimes definitely. </p>

In my opinion the reason that (((they)) Do this is to weaken what we know as the west as well as Asia, great example of this is Japan, men in their country don’t know how to talk with women and their birth rates are in the negatives.As the white European becomes less and less common it will be easier to replace them. This is also one of the main reasons for open immigration from South America into the US as well as sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East into Europe. It’s systematic replacement.

<p>We&#39;re all staring into a fucking light bulb - even right now. Light bulbs can give you a hard on, too - but what else can they do? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, its actually a long plan if eugenics are involved. </p>

<p>Porn creates long-term malfunctioning sperm problems. Cases of epididymitis caused by over-exertion (too much jerking off) are at a 200% increase since 2001. This means (at an epigenetic level) they&#39;re sperms are going through constant change. For long-term quality of sperm, this is not good. </p>

<p>Healthy children are born to healthy young adults. Young men who jerk off too much are more likely to be fat and not able to have normal sex. Then when these fat adults finally do settle down and find a wife, theyre children end up being fucking mongoloids because their fathers are fat, porn-addicted head cases. These men are lower in testosterone in their middle-age, and these traits are passed off to their children.</p>

<p>When these men pro-create, they are creating a generation of weak and addiciton-prone children. In the future, the difference between well-bred humans and the rest of society will be stark. This may take several generations. </p>

<p>By that time, will all this cuckolding and incest, we are going to have an entire population of babies with birth defects and who come from broken homes. This will be a slave population. </p>

<p>Although who is to say that isnt already our present. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish your entire post could be illustrated and published in one of those health textbooks for health class taken in middle-school and high-school. It could really motivate people, especially teenagers, to stop tolerating pornography and think for a second that pornography might not be a very good thing for their growth into adulthood. Too much of &quot;it&#39;s okay to masturbate to hard-core violent cuckolding pornography!&quot; (i don&#39;t even know what people watch these days but i&#39;ve read that pornography is becoming more violent, depraved and weird) kind of thinking going on...  how do people watch that stuff and feel clean afterwards is beyond me.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to keep the ancient Reality in perspective though. These girls weren&#39;t usually willing, weren&#39;t usually over 18, and didn&#39;t usually grow up to be very old. They may not have had pornography but sex slavery and the sex slave trade was a very real part of the ancient world. It&#39;s a trade off of evils- I wouldn&#39;t say it was better though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. The bible has it correct here: the man and the woman should give their body to the other one in marriage. Porn actresses may not be married but they showcase this perfectly.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t believe the problem with porn and fornication is not the sex act, the problem is the lack of marriage. </p>

<p>The reason incest is an attractive category in pornhub is simply because people feel more connected to people we know and talk to, not because they are going to practice it at home, or because it damages anyone&#39;s psyche. </p>

<p>Learn about time delimitation and learn to practice things and study.  Self improvement and remind yourself that masturbation is self detrimental.  </p>

<p>Remind yourself its detrimental because its wasting energy, both now in the &quot;action&quot; and later when your body spends resources to recoup what you literally flushed away.    </p>

<p>remind yourself that shitting is waste, before you prepare a meal and it&#39;ll get you to think about what you need to eat that won&#39;t turn to waste.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What gets me, as a seasoned masturbator, is how much porn has changed. Once it was &quot;lonely housewife meets plumber&quot; or some variant. Then it became &quot;all women are potential whores&quot; -- &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; through &quot;Bang Bus&quot;.</p>

<p>But now the Porn Hub front page seems filled with &quot;step&quot; sister, &quot;step&quot; daughter, &quot;step&quot; mother storylines. Ugh. ot that plot matters in the videos themselves, but it clearly does to the titles or they wouldn&#39;t be putting them on there. Also, hardly anybody even pretends to feel the slightest affection. They barely even pretend any excitement. It&#39;s more like watching aerobics.</p>

<p>Look, I get it. Watching transgressive behavior is exciting for the viewer, and the more transgressive the better... up to a point. At some point, horror and/or disgust is supposed to kick in. It has for me. I don&#39;t look at any of those sites any more. Heh, sometimes I regret throwing away my old VHS tapes from the eighties. The pictures weren&#39;t as clear, the people weren&#39;t as fit (and a lot more bushy!), they took a lot longer to get to sex, and there was a lot less sex per minute... but they were a hell of a lot more erotic. Some even had decent plots!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post, right on the money! Wouldn’t be surprised if the CIA is behind PornHub and all the others too.
Porn addiction has destroyed countless lives and it’s only getting better. 
Picture a once happy confident family man sitting buck naked in his newly rented one bedroom apartment. All alone of course with a stupid looking VR headset on beating his meat till it’s raw watching the newest VR porn! 
Hold on to your masculinity men!!! Don’t let them take it from us!!! We are better than this!!!
It’s clear to me that the government must be behind this. If they really cared about it, there would be some controls in place to protect  our society from this attack. </p>

<p>I wanna add that even in the YouTube comments, I always run across comments about VR Porn, or sex robots.</p>

<p>Then again, this type of stuff is really low-vibrational and you can tell those who are leaving those comments are immature. I try not to pay it any mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can confiem. I did no fap just to try it once and lasted 11 days. After that fap, the next day I felt extremely sluggish, like my life force was taken or something. I felt exhausted mentally and physically. I do think there is some truth to is as well. Some of the benefits I&#39;ve noticed most was increased focus, confidence, and I couldn&#39;t sleep over 6 hours but felt really well rested. </p>

<p>I do think there is a problem and that porn itself can be really dangerous. But I also think it depends on the person. Forinstance there are people that need more to receive the same stimulation mentally, and this is where they will seek more exotic types of porn that are more out of the norm of reality. I think for these types of people, porn is a much more dangerous thing. I think for others it&#39;s not nearly as bad if they are looking for typical guy on girl. But I still think it&#39;s potentially dangerous regardless. 
I think their should be more studies on  this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone else noticed that an unusual amount of women like to be tied up, spit on, slapped, punched, choked, hurt, degraded, humiliated? So many women want sex to be ugly, humiliating, painful, and shameful. I’ve only slept with 22 girls but at least 50% of them wanted to be hurt and it made me feel really weird. I don’t like hurting people, but they acted like they made it feel good? That can’t be normal, and I didn’t understand why they were begging to be treated that way. I did a lot of research into it, psychologically it seems to be a manifestation of their own lack of self esteem. But after reading your post, I can’t help but feel like their desires must be heavily influenced by the pornography they watch. Someone won’t just wake up one day and asked to me fucked, punched, choked and called a pig, right? They must have seen it somewhere first. My only question is, why? What are TPTB gaining why psychologically damaging and implanting these desires in so many women? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would suggest any podcast fans to check out Jon Ronson&#39;s (Men who Stare at Goats, psychopath test, Frank) podcast called the Butterfly Effect.</p>

<p>It examines the rise of free streaming pornography starting with the algorithm developers for websites, working in the porn directors and how their business suffered, and pornstars that are falling to the wayside to the algorithm (Such as one pornstar mentioning that she cannot act as a 25 year old porn actress without having an excessively large ass to fit into the pre-milf &#39;big ass&#39; sections.</p>

<p>He also examines a child with an intense pornography addiction and Asperger&#39;s or autism, I&#39;m not sure which it was off the top of the head. This kid&#39;s entire interactions with women are basically controlled by what he sees and subsequently kicked out of school for telling a girl he wanted to hold her down and fuck the shit out of her.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very interesting listen, the final parts goes into freelancers who have found a niche market in making kink videos, such as one dude in Norway who had a huge stamp collection. He was so ashamed by his hobby that he hired one of these niche camgirls to burn it on video while making fun of it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a wild ass ride.</p>

He swears that while in an altered state he was viewing porn on a computer. He said he could see what clearly looked like Reptilians/Demons superimposed on the adult performers, almost like shadows. His opinion was that somehow these beings were parasitically absorbing the sexual energies of the people viewing the pornography. </p>

<p>Pornography will one day be looked at like a drug</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It already is.</p>

<p>However, in this day and age, porn is safer for the average man to consume over having sex with an actual woman, for fear of traps they walk into that women set.</p>

<p>I&#39;d much rather use porn than risk bringing hellspawn (children) into this earth and having my life taken away from me via money-sucking child support and bitch exes. I have enough of those already.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the &quot;pushing the more extreme porno&quot; stuff is generally a small subsection of the people that watch porn. I do agree that porn is conditioning most people to take it over having sex with the other sex, something that happened to me as well, only because sex is too time consuming and I only have so many hours in my day to get a woman worked up. It&#39;s just not worth my time. So, porn is there. 5 -10 minutes on a website, blam, I&#39;m done and back to what I want to do with my time.</p>

<p>Much safer than a relationship and more life-fulfilling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have a whole generation of young prepubescent boys who have easy access to hard-core porn, just a few clicks away at any given time. We are definitely beginning to see the effects of this on society, in many ways. Early onset of E.D. being a major new thing I see mentioned often in r/relationships &amp; r/sex. A lot of young guys have unrealistic expectations of women sexually. They seem woefully ill-informed about intimate interactions in general, &amp; it often leads to treating women like shit.  Over-masturbation to porn often causes loss of erections in the middle of sex. </p>

<p>Major disconnect seems to be developing between many younger men &amp; their female counterparts with regards to intimacy &amp; I think porn is part of the problem. Actually let me rephrase: Easily accessible porn for young boys who form beliefs about sex based on that porn, is part of the problem. This bad information gets perpetuated within their peer-group (the worst source of information for young boys), especially since this is not something these young kids talk to their parents about. </p>

<p>Something seems to be happening, and easy no-risk access to porn at such a young age can&#39;t be a good thing.  This is about the sexual health of the species, not about being prudish. I don&#39;t know what the solution is, other than just being aware of the negative effects of this over-stimulation &amp; being willing to talk about it with our young boys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thank you for your post. </p>

<p>We have a society with a lack of love and a surplus of isolation. Frankly, many children don&#39;t get affection/love from their environment/community growing up; sex is often viewed/learned as the only acceptable form of affection.  Porn offers many things- a solution in some ways- false intimacy in another. an insincere (and shitty) substitute which requires you to tune out enough to take it in. (Often the performers are pretty tuned out too.)</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>porn, including its&#39; ramifications (insincerity, dissociation, isolation, etc.), facilitates/propagates itself through our relationship with it. Of course, I&#39;m speaking a bit dramatically, but somewhere in me i hear the more we go to porn and vitual reality, the further we turn from <em>real</em> human connection (what we&#39;re really after). </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>A negative energy accompanies porn. I decided to comment because I was thinking about a year or two ago and wanted to reflect on it a little more.  You could get very multidisciplinary with this conversation though- it&#39;s a big one. The reflections/implications porn and sexuality lay on society go very deep.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>now on with the rest of my night!</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>remember, love starts with yourself - feed love, not fear :)</p>

<p>the shit on that website is... fucking DARK. it’s difficult to even get aroused when I watch clips on Pornhub. </p>

<p>I suppose it’s “nice” that that niche is getting recognized, and I know the female actresses are consenting to what happens, but you can’t help but wonder if they <em>actually</em> wanna do it. some of them are straight up crying, specifically in the UpperRoom collection, and I just have to turn it off. I understand that sex parties, or swinger parties, happen, but damn that shit they put those actresses thru can be straight up mean! </p>

<p>(also, side note here, when they tell the woman they aren’t allowed to cum, what does that even mean? how could they possibly hold that in??) </p>

<p>I tend to stay to the more amateurish side of porn, but I have to agree that the main stream porn (bangbros, reality kings, kink, etc) is just pushing the boundaries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>tl;dr: there is nothing new under the sun</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t one of the main characteristics of porn being that it &quot;wears out&quot; quickly?  One is always having to find new stuff. And that&#39;s whether it&#39;s printed on magazine pages or propagated online.  I recall plenty of incest and gangbang  (and lots of other kinky) porn in the pre-internet days, but it tended to be more narrated out in text in pulpy paperbacks.     In those days there were rumors of &quot;behind the counter&quot; materials available in the porn shops, but I had no first hand (heh) experience.    Anyways, the constant search for novelty among the porn-consuming public will eventually tend to push the envelope towards ever more &quot;forbidden fruit&quot;.</p>

<p>I would say that overall, pre-internet porn wasn&#39;t as &quot;segmented&quot; as it is now, with all the narrow specialties available today.</p>

<p>Easily accessible?  When I worked as a bag boy in a supermarket in the 70&#39;s I would take my break at the magazine rack where I could study the latest issue of a magazine/comic book called &quot;Sex to Sexty&quot;.   It was a thick read, chock full of drawings of all kinds of fetishes and borderline kinky stuff, and plenty of ordinary porn too.    There were no efforts to keep &quot;Sex to Sexty&quot; away from kids, it was simply among all the other magazines on the open rack.   The backlash began a few years later with Edwin Meese, atty. general under Reagan who began cracking down on certain kinds of borderline porn like bestiality and (as I recall) incest.  </p>

<p>Ever hear of Hustler magazine?  Which regularly featured a cartoon character named &quot;Chester the Molester&quot;?  Who was always inventing new ways to get close to the kiddies?</p>

<p>I find it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm... maybe. I&#39;ve noticed when I stopped watching porn for a long while (months) I got more shit done and really wanted to be around my SO. Obviously it made sex with her much better, but I also just wanted to be around her more; to want see her, hear her, smell her, touch her more often and even just think about her would be common. I&#39;d also study more, read more interesting stuff, etc. Mind you I&#39;d occasionally masturbate too, but without any porn. Maybe there&#39;s some truth to this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bros. It&#39;s not just about twisting your mind with porn. Porn absolutely does wrecks your mind, and makes you numb to the smaller pleasures in life, anxious, and depressed. But it is also about getting you to waste your semen, your &quot;vital essence&quot;, your &quot;jing&quot;. You&#39;re literally speeding up the aging process, weakening your immune system, and shortening your lifespan every time you do this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imo, porn that imprints anything besides vaginal intercourse is a means of population control, and I think most of us understand the limitations of Earth&#39;s resources, so maybe it&#39;s not such a bad thing after all. </p>

<p>Gonzo porn creates new, twisted pathways in the brain leading away from good old-fashioned sexual desire, and that&#39;s the whole point. I think it&#39;s fair to say it&#39;s bad for the individual person, but good for the Earth in general.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, we&#39;d be able to satisfy the typical male libido without leaving heirs all over the place because our women wouldn&#39;t be ovulating constantly, so there would be no need for porn / population control in the first place. Perhaps the typical male libido would be reduced along with the reduction in the presence of female pheromones in the air. This is a scientific issue, not a moral one.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been conditioned to take moral responsibility for all our own thoughts and desires, even though we know we can be influenced by forces beyond our control. This world is fucked, and it&#39;s not our fault. Not even the worst of us (them) can claim responsibility for creating the human condition. It&#39;s fucked because of the moon, which means we could probably fix if we really wanted to.</p>
