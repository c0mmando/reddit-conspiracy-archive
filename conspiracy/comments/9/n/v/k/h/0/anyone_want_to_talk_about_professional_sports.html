       regarding Kylie Irving’s “horrible” play in the finals against the warriors. I’m someone who has looked into this stuff and professional sports are all like the WWE to me and they appear to have predetermined outcomes. When you see an extremely talented player just stop playing for the most part it becomes pretty apparent. I could go into more detail on the comments.

       See people say “rigged”, I look at the evidence and it appears to me that professional athletes are told who will win the game and they play it out as they are paid to do.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/U7rPIg7ZNQ8">
        This
       </a>
       is another great example. The Seahawks losing the Super Bowl by throwing an interception when they had Marshawn Lynch running all over the other teams defense. And I’m saying this as someone who disposed that team. They threw that game because the Patriots where supposed to win.

       Passing was the correct choice for the Seahawks in that situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was second down with 25 seconds and 1 timeout remaining.  If the hawks ran the ball and got stuffed,  they would have been forced to burn their last time out,  leaving them on third down with zero timeouts where they would have absolutely no choice but to pass the ball.

       If the second down pass had gone incomplete,  they would have been able to run on 3rd down,  use their timeout,  then run on 4th down.
      </p>

       You think they should have just run twice?  Why the hell would you limit yourself to two plays when you can have three?

       Lynch can pick up one yard on two tries. You'd still have 4th down but you'd have to no huddle. Passing into a short field is dangerous. You could lose all of your downs. Look what happened to the Raiders last week, instead of running Lynch at the goal line they threw an interception.

       I was linked to his site in 2016 — he used his calculator to predict Texas would win the NLDS.  It was obvious to me from
       <strong>
        numbers on the surface
       </strong>
       — no calculator required — that Toronto would win.  Toronto swept.  Meanwhile ZH went on a vicious and unprovoked anti Semitic tirade against the jaysblog author who had linked to him.
So check it out, sure.  But that asshole is addicted to calculators because they are ambiguous.

       NASCAR is the worst. The constant Green-White-Checkers finishes and all the contrived gimmicks to make sure the "young guns" are in another gimmick, The Chase.
Along with practically giving Jimmie Johnson 7 Cup Championships, which is ironically, the same number of championships that Petty and Earnhardt won. He maybe a good driver but no where near #43 and #3.

       NASCAR is on par with WWE.

       Yeah that argument is crap. Baseball is a game of averages. Really good teams win 6/10. It makes sense that a best of 7 would get pretty close to 7

       Really. It seems to be the major sport with the most subjectivity and power given to a bunch of douchey umps that have shown to be immature and make things personal at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I agree from a players/managers prescriptive of shaving points, throwing games. Although baseball has as much of a documented history of stuff like that as any sport.

       Considering how extremely fast athletes'boujce back' from an injury its pretty damn obvious they were never injured at all. UFC does this heaps. Fighters with terrible knee or shoulder injuries somehow fighting within a couple months of said injury. Unbelievable.

       I watch for “entertainment” but do so knowing it’s predetermined. I have a feeling the NBA Finals will end up being Lakers vs Celtics and it might become a normal occurrence as a re-has of the old rivalry. Bird vsMagic will become Irving vs Lebron. If you have payed attention, the commentators in the past few years have made it a point to say “Stop comparing Lebron to Jordan, he is more like Magic in the way he plays.” Hmmm....

       I think the refs/umpires are instructed by the networks and MLB/NFL/NBA to extend games...how many amazing comebacks do we see in playoffs/championship games?  Fucking ridiculous!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       The refs/umps can get away with this in a ton of ways--calling penalties (many of which could be called on any play of a football game) is one of the ways they do this.  The momentum of a game can be shifted by doing this at opportune moments in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really wouldn't doubt if umps/refs get a briefing before each game--they know what to do to extend a series or cut a lead (don't want a lobsided game--bad ratings)...

       I disagree with that notion.  Not that hockey is too small to be fixed, but that bigger leagues are much harder to fix.  There is way too much money already involved for people to risk it.  Owners aren't going to go along with it because it could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars.  Players are getting paid way more than they could make doing something else.  It's much smaller leagues where you see fixing going.  Smaller soccer leagues, lower division college games.  Even e-sports has had problems with match fixing.

       You do have to consider that an athlete can lose his prime even when he is young (ie. Tyson lost it in his 30's, and so did Roy Jones after getting brutally knocked out by Tarver), and that could play a role in out-of-character performances. In combat sports you will see a lot of newer/casual fans that can't understand that, and will claim a fight was fixed (ie. Ronda Rousey, or Anderson Silva losing), when a fighter under-performs. Watching combat sports actually takes some skill, so I understand that casual fans have a limited understanding of what they are looking at (I was new to these sports at one time also, obviously). But yeah, an athlete still has the ability to take a dive.

       It's all rigged/easily manipulated. Browns game 2 weeks ago is a prime example. Refs literally snatched a W with a ridiculous call reversal which would have ended the game. Cavs-Warriors Game 1 at the end is another blatant one.

       You know, human error could be easily reduced in a lot of these pro sports, especially with the tech available now. Take the umps out of baseball. GPS chips in the football. Etc etc. I think the reason they don't do this is so they can exert influence. It only takes one blown call to change the outcome of a game.

       It's not all sports and it's not all the players in the sports that are. Some are more blatantly corrupt than others, like Olympic boxing. There are certainly players on the take, same with some officials etc. 
I don't think the outcomes are completely fixed as you you would need everybody in every team all on the same page. 
What can be done with minimal risk is to alter the likelihood of an outcome. That's very easily achieved by having just a single player having an 'off' day. 
There is a scandal like that most years in cricket for example.

       I wouldnt say scripted  but more rigged by individuals.  So much money in gambling now a days .tennis and cricket is the worse . You can bet on a play happening in one 5min gap like a over in cricket or first set  in tennis so you can still win a match but throw something to win cash

       Have you heard about the meat pie controversy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically in a forgone conclusion soccer match one team had an overweight coach also on the roster as a backup quarterback. A series of jokes about his weight led to odds being placed on him eating a meat pie during the game. He ate a meat pie at halftime and was brought up on charges for influencing betting.

       In australia there is one journo  that is on every election telecast  and also when there is a big breaking political story.  He wears a different  tie every day . So last election a betting agency  took bets on what tie he would wear out of 4 colours. Someone told him so he changed ties 4 ties and they had to pay out to everyone who bet on it

       ALL professional sport is rigged, and always has been. It's all entertainment, gambling and big money. Who wins and who loses is pre-decided. We have leaked docs from the Italian football league that show the entire game is scripted like wrestling. Even high school level sports are rife with drugs and prostitution from betting rackets.

       i'm sure they script somethings to keep it exciting for the dopes who watch it still,   i would not be surprised if organized crime was involved regarding the betting side of it too.  wherever there is that much money there will always be corruption.

At 200 mph an hour.
They already have speed, physics &amp; mechanisms fighting them.. To ask to throw a race is really not necessary.

       I love watching skateboarding. Dew tour, x games etc. Those are actually 100% legit. I mean you could make an argument about judge scores I guess but the whole nature of it is authentic.

       With the NFL specifically, I can see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one of the few sports that A: has a penalty (holding, by the books) being committed on every single play and B) half of the fans watching Want that penalty called.
      </p>
      <p>
       This amounts to the refs literally being able to call any play back they want, without it being extremely obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't willy nilly call a homerun back, it has to at least be close.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't randomly call walking on a game winning layup, even opposing fans will hate the call.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can call back any touchdown you want with a holding call, and it would be legit, and welcomed by half the fans.

       Yes. In football offsides can literally be called each snap. If the team didn’t get the first down and was supposed to all they have to do is call holding. Same goes for touchdowns like you said.

       I do love watching hockey but it could be. I think they are the least controlled of pro sports but if it’s on tv NBC ABC ESPN there’s some bullshit involved.

        Still not big enough to be fixed.

      <p>
       I disagree with that notion.  Not that hockey is too small to be fixed, but that bigger leagues are much harder to fix.  There is way too much money already involved for people to risk it.  Owners aren't going to go along with it because it could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars.  Players are getting paid way more than they could make doing something else.  It's much smaller leagues where you see fixing going.  Smaller soccer leagues, lower division college games.  Even e-sports has had problems with match fixing.

       In australia there is one journo  that is on every election telecast  and also when there is a big breaking political story.  He wears a different  tie every day . So last election a betting agency  took bets on what tie he would wear out of 4 colours. Someone told him so he changed ties 4 ties and they had to pay out to everyone who bet on it
