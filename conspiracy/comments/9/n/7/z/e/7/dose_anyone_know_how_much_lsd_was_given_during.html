    <div class="md"><p>So it looks like the guy who jumped out the window later was only given 70 micrograms. Barely enough to even have visuals. I wonder if the LSD even really had much of an impact in that scenario.</p>

<p>Later reading (p 95 415) outlines a suspected Asian espionage agent who was given 6µg LSD per kg body weight. Given the average body weight in Asia is 57.7kg, this translates into 346.2µg, but could be as high as 500µg, a relatively high dose no matter how you look at it, and seemed to have some troublesome physical symptoms.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that many of these individuals were subjected to stresses as well, and LSD is a substance which is very sensitive to set and setting. For instance:</p>

<p>&quot;Stressing techniques employed included silent treatment before or after EA 1729 administration, sustained conventional interrogation prior to EA 1729 interrogation, deprivation of food, drink, sleep or bodily evacuation, sustained isolation prior to EA 1729 administration, hot-cold switches in approach, duress &quot;pitches&quot;, verbal degradation and bodily discomfort, or dramatized threats to subject&#39;s life or mental health.&quot; (EA 1729 was the army&#39;s code name for LSD).</p>

<p>Just imagine this for a minute: Having no idea what LSD even is, you find yourself in one of the most purposely uncomfortable scenarios imaginable, whilst being deprived of basic human needs, receiving death threats, being constantly degraded, and otherwise mentally tortured by soldiers of an opposing army, on the peak of 400µg! God...the things our governments do behind closed doors...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be interesting to see how a person who has been dosed looks and acts.</p>

<p>You hear those stories about wealthy guys who come into their own house, and order their staff to pack up valuables which are then handed to whatever criminal dosed the victim... If you can&#39;t really tell if someone is on it, that&#39;s pretty freaky on top of the actual effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I watched a story on that awhile back. Deliriants scare me way more than LSD ever could. At least with LSD, you can tell you&#39;re hallucinating and understand that what&#39;s going on isn&#39;t reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember reading one such MK Ultra case where a subject was dosed daily for months.  It actually surprised me because the brains tolerance to psychedelics skyrockets after as much as 1 dose.  The effects would be diminished until at least a 1 week tolerance break, and even then it&#39;s hard to say since everyone&#39;s brain chemistry is vastly different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it’s worth noting that the “subjects” didn’t know they were being dosed with anything and were just made to believe they were going crazy. Sure tolerances increase with time but we don’t really know any effects that might become of not know about the doses, and if the “once a day for months” was actually just micro doses or even placebos at some points. I can’t imagine being micro dosed one day and then being heavily dosed the next and then just having someone tell me I’m crazy three days later because of my behavior. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LSD is interesting as there really is a maximum effective dose which I believe is in the 650ug range. That&#39;s the most which can get past the blood brain barrier before being molecularly locked out for the next couple of days. Higher doses should be pointless but I&#39;m sure that didn&#39;t stop the govt from trying. </p>
