       Hey everyone! Many folks have suggested making a thread to start compiling evidence of the sustained attack against the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       community being carried out by
       <a href="/r/TopMindsofReddit">
        /r/TopMindsofReddit
       </a>
       and similar hate subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9mm41r/the_final_truth_of_russiagate_as_the_hoax/e7g8zd0/">
        this comment of mine
       </a>
       was aggressively targeted
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/9mpheq/mueller_is_a_corrupt_as_fuck_deep_state_stooge/">
        by those participating in this TMOR thread
       </a>
       , resulting in a comment score of below -350, which is
       <em>
        unheard of
       </em>
       (by many orders of magnitude) when dealing with a normal
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       thread with negligible visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9mzsk4/rampant_manipulation_tmor_brigades_a_comment_in_a/">
        when I called them out for this stalkerish behavior
       </a>
       they responded they only way they know how:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9mzsk4/rampant_manipulation_tmor_brigades_a_comment_in_a/">
        with further brigades
       </a>
       .

       <p>
        When someone bullies someone else because they have a crush on them. This is usually because they aren't sure how to convey their feelings properly. Often the bully is a Type A Tsundere. The target of the bullying is generally under the impression that the bully is simply mean and has no clue the bully has a crush on them.

       There is much Truth to this. On the other side - hate really is their love. Their version of hate more closely correspond to ignoring something. The other side really is inverted. My parents were like this. Sort of like on Seinfeld, I realized if I did the opposite of what they would do I’d be on a productive path.

       What is the talking point? I am simply saying that things may not be exactly black and white, and provided my own anecdotal data point on two of the upvotes.

       It used to be that folks denied brigading was even occurring...and now I've seen
       <em>
        many

       users morph that denial into "well OK it's happening BUT that user deserved it" or something similar.

       People also denied that shilling was happening for a long time - and now its so rampant that we have rules to ostensibly ban people for accusing others of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, if OPs post somehow got visibility, then it was downvoted because it was a shallow analysis - basically a "No shit Sherlock."

      <p>
       If it was hidden or something though then yeah maybe it did get brigaded. I spend a lot of time on new though so I don't always notice those things.

       Look at this post, and where it stands at this point. Even the most controversial shit doesn't have this many comments to a 12+ upvoted post (at this moment).

       It seems that the sheer mention if TMOR causes this subreddit to react violently, any idea why that may be?

       5+ years of arguing with them. No offense, but we are a spastic bunch who literally lose our shit over a misquote.

       The stark differences between threads that are not linked to TMOR and threads like this and the Banksy one yesterday.

       It's literal willful ignroance to believe that those two posts have natural vote counts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I get people don't like RMFN and Axotl, but holy shit you can go down to one or their comments (you know when it gets to that point in a discussion where no one else reads because of the 'continue thread here's type notice) and see that they are hassled to the point that benign comments agreeing with a thread is downvoted massively for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are literally the only two users who make a vocal effort against TMOR and TMOR have a self-proclaimed nazihunting boner for em, unless you can somehow convince me that those users are doing it to themselves to make a subreddit dedicated to making fun of us look bad.

       There is a conspiracy there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'official story' is that Banksy and Banksy alone rigged the painting frame to shred the painting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mystery surrounding how this was accomplished added to the art and actually
       <em>
        raised the value of the painting
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If indeed Sotheby's orchestrated it, yet publicly claimed that they had no foreknowledge of the event, then not only is it a conspiracy, but it is
       <em>
        fraud, to the tune of $9 million
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a complete
       <em>
        whoosh
       </em>
       to the TMOR users. The thread title that links to that thread treats it like the linked thread was just stating the obvious.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Top mind realizes Banksy set up the painting shredding incident, after hours of research indicating that picture frames do not usually contain paper shredders.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It makes no reference to the fact that the linked post is alleging
       <em>
        Sotheby's
       </em>
       knew about the shredding event beforehand. Not Banksy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if TMOR is actually run like National Enquirer's whole "catch and kill" scam where the mods are willing to accept money to squash specific stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, their 100,000 subscribers wouldn't know that. They are just NPCs lured in by the fact that its easier to bully conspiracy theorist to ease ones cognitive dissonance than it is to resolve it by genuine morbid curiosity.

       But weren't we specifically told in another stickied thread to always sort by 'new'?
      </p>
      <p>
       There close to 3k subscribers of this sub online. If they're sorting by new as they were instructed, maybe that's why stupid stuff gets downvoted right away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unintended consequences are a thing.  Just like stickying yet another post about 'real conspiracy users' brigading this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making threads artificially sticky so they're not 'artificially' downvoted is a sure way to attract downvotes.  Also, it's clearly trying to drive an invented narrative.  It's a self fulfilling prophecy.

       One suggested that I commit suicide then threatened to doxx me (and basically intimated it would be easy for the deep state to
       <em>
        get
       </em>
       me).

       All I did was emphasize to him that they are doing exactly the same thing that went on during the Armenian Genocide...trying to silence the intellectuals first.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they call people who follow Q a "cult", yet I pointed out that I do not confer with anyone, whereas they adhere to a far more insular group behavior.

       I think the best argument against you would be to let you talk at length, in front of anyone who cares to watch. I don't even need to do a thing as you hang yourself on your own pretension. Please, speak for as long as it takes you to develop a modicum of self-awareness. Then, maybe read a few books and learn how smart people actually talk. I can give you some pointers if you'd like.

       So you think it's fine to threaten to doxx someone and suggest, not very politely, that you go commit suicide?  You find it more important to try to belittle me for some reason?

As though there was a considerate way to suggest that you were a waste of air. Still, let me give it a try: "Dear Sir, While I hesitate to suggest extreme measures, pondering the conundrum of the massive gap between your actual person and your opinion of your faculties has led me to the invariable conclusion that this realm would be substanatively improved by your self-induced departure from it."

       You're martyring yourself because somebody teased you. Yes, I think it's important to drive home the point. No, I don't feel bad about doing it.

I work a job where I am surrounded by intelligent, thoughtful people. I find it cathartic to come to a place where real idiots prance around and take them down a peg, rather than letting them avail themselves of a self-adulating echo chamber they hardly deserve.

       As I stated in here, they suggested that I commit suicide.  Do these masters of psychology somehow think that is a viable tactic?  I think it merely shows how impotent they are.

       And I like how they think that saying that the lot of them got "banned" from conspiracy somehow entitles them to attack conspiracy USERS.  That is the some of the worst logic I've ever heard.

       That comment was pretty beyond the pale though. I feel like a lot of your anti-meuller, pro-trump stuff is downvoted hard because we don't like that you have such a strong position on it - as head mod, it's really not right that you take such a opinion. You should help foster an environment where all conspiracies are welcome, including all the new people that came here expecting a this place to be a hub on the, maybe, biggest conspiracy ever.

       You're a TMOR troll fag comimg out of the woodwork like usual to troll any thread AP posts in.

       For discussion?

       Some topics are deemed "unpalatable" by the disruptors of this sub, and they are frequently targeted, buried, and prevented from having an actual discussion.

      <p>
       Q threads fell victim to this systematic manipulation, so stickied threads often help elevate this conversations above the fray.

       Conversely, if you disbelieve Q, why

       Believe me, I can't stand the TopMinds over at TMOR, but their little reverse psychology game of, "Hey, lets shit on everything pro Trump, Q, and conservative to get those idiots to defend them" isn't working on me. I still maintain this community thinks for itself, and doesn't fall prey to the "Trump is takin' down the deep state" psyop.

      <p>
       I see absolutely no evidence that mods are trying to stop the TMOR brigading. It's undeniable that r/conspiracy has been under a sustained attack...I've messaged mods about posts that were beyond obvious they were being brigaded and I was told to "prove it"...when it was as obvious as the fucking sunrise the post was brigaded and rendered useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       you are not tagging posts as "Brigaded" when they obviously have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are not banning the obvious instigators.
      </p>

       yes. It's a conspiracy sub so we should automatically believe the FBI narratives the president of the United States was colluding with Russia. We should also trust that the FBI director of 8 years (mueller) is a good guy but he's just doing his best to protect America

       But why, then, instantly believe everything Trump, his crooked allies,  and the #1 watched mainest of the mainstream media Fox says verbatim? Such T_D level political cult worship doesn't belong in a true conspiracy sub. You just can't dismiss every Trump conspiracy because you think he's cool baeed on what your media choices tell you, then latch on to everything else that has 0 evidence but looks bad for a faded old lady.

       I've been around the conspiracy community long enough to know that Mueller has
       <em>
        long
       </em>
       been suspected of skulduggery and all manners of malfeasance since he started his position at the head of the FBI
       <em>
        right
       </em>
       before 9/11 and then presided over the anthrax "investigation", which has even been acknowledged to have been botched by the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, there's traditionally no love lost for Mueller among conspiracy researchers.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the more impressive tricks they've pulled is getting folks to believe, often aggressively, that distrust for Mueller equates with support for Trump, which brings me to:

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       What "pro-trump" stuff are you referring to? I post tons of articles, but rarely take a stance on anything political.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the many unexpected outcomes of Trump's presidency was that all of the sudden many conspiracy theorists were assumed to be Trump supporters, and there appears to be a sustained propaganda effort to keep that misconception alive.

       So let me get this straight...a moderator of a

       forum shouldn't be allowed to call into question the integrity of the head of a government agency? Did I get that right?

       So, instead of having real opposition like Kenneth Starr and Brett Kavanaugh when they went after Bill Clinton, Donald Trump gets a Republican cohort who agrees with DJT's policy. They speak ill of each other, but that's just for show. It's a very simple conspiracy.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        right before 9/11
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Right before 9-11, the people who populated the illegitimate George W. Bush administration at the highest levels were members of  PNAC -- the ultimate conspiracy of our times. PNAC, in its 2000 document "Rebuilding America's Defenses," ordered more money for the military, attacks upon the Middle East including Iran, and an independent "Space Force."
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump called the Iraq invasion a "disaster," then went on to vote for GWB in 2004 because he liked the tax cuts. So much for being against war. Just give billionaires or apparent billionaires larger tax refunds and the million or more killed according to the Orb study is a fair trade off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of these PNAC people and these exact policies are being carried forward by Donald Trump, as so-called establishment Republicans whine and complain but never bother to use their power to actually take action. Rather, they refuse to pass a simple bill to try to stop Donald Trump from firing the special investigator -- because they trust Donald Trump? That's unbelievably transparent.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "all of the sudden" many conspiracy theorists were assumed to be Trump supporters,

      <p>
       People who support TPTB when the minority party -- the party of oligarchy for over a hundred years straight -- takes monopolistic power of the government against the people -- and suspiciously so in every area -- House, Senate, White House and even Supreme Court. In a conspiracy sub, this is exactly the opposite of what is expected -- and in dire opposition to the way conspiracy boards were during GWB and during Barack Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Donald Trump is an establishment Republican LARP, a fake outsider. TPTB are consolidating quickly and dangerously under their government of plutocrats.

       why is it that those complaining of a generalized right leaning bias here get massive upvotes, and yet the mod who made the thread and the regulars who post here get a ton of downvotes? seems odd, doesnt it? but hey, if you dont like something you can just make it invisible and hard to see, right?

       to complain about the general attitudes of the majority of posters on this board is silly. it would be like a libertarian setting his home at latestagecapitalism and complaining about the community and trying to change the culture of that subreddit.

       how did your post get so many upvotes? political scandals and coverups are an essential part of the conspiracy community, and ARE actual conspiracies hatched against an unwitting populace.

      <p>
       should we just never discuss propaganda 2/gladio, or the iran contra affair, or the franklin coverup?  these directly relate with politics and were some of the most heinous examples of conspiracies and coverups we have.

       u/axolotl_peyotl will lie to you, but the real reason is because he doesn't want people to know what r/The_D and other right wing subs link to posts like this and brigade. He needs to keep that under wraps and only target subs like TMOR that highlight his obvious attempts to control the narrative in this sub, particularly to downplay any narratives about Russian interference or bad news about Donald Trump.

       My favorite is when they brigade a non-partisan post about a topic like campaign finance reform, resisting internet censorship, or returning objectivity to MSM journalism. This makes it abundantly clear that their goal is subbversion, not promoting a political ideology. Somehow, they believe that they will benefit from the replacement of democracy (rr) with oligarchy.

       I hate to be a cunt, but none of the admins of reddit give a fuck. You are allowed to violate TOS as long as you're on their good side. SRS still exists after all these years, the first SJW subreddit I can recall gaining "mainstream" notoriety. No amount of evidence will make admins suddenly realize, "Oh hey, there are subreddits brigading people that have voices we don't approve of. Guess we should do something about it!"

       The point remains that I think most people would prefer a silent impartial moderator. People already recognize your name due to your participation.

       You don't need to, but it would probably be better for the subreddit as a whole if moderators kept their "usertalk" to alt user accounts and not recognizable mod accounts.

       As for the topic at hand.. I think most people who would care about this already know what's going on and talking about it and making stickies only makes the problem worse, which may be what you want for all I know.

       It's not about hiding or being ashamed of anything, just from a users point of view especially in a conspiracy sub I think it would be better to have mods only enforcing rules/doing mod shit versus participating in any of the discussion.

       That is a lie.  I seem to recall you going ban crazy and banning a significant number of users in one thread simply because they are making the same claims people are making against you now - you stir the pot, rabble rouse and abuse your mod authority.

       Exactly. This is how you know the voting is being affected from the outside. Anybody who knows anything about the Iraq War and what led up to it should know he can’t be trusted. Does Russia have some kind of ties or Leverage with Trump? Maybe, I wouldn’t be surprised. All I know is something is fishy and I’m not going to trust the guy who helped get us into another war.

       Mueller has a history of awful discriminatory practices. It makes me sad that so many on the left are idolizing him.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, Trump also has  illegal shady dealings in NYC. There's some questionable transactions relating to Russian money that I hope is investigated.

       Yeah. I'm still stuck at work though. I do recall chasing a convicted sex offender (irl) who used to love posting links and callouts from

        /r/WayOfTheBern

       to Top Minds, and I gave some background to one of the TopMinds mods, who ended up banning both of us (because they wouldn't want to look unfair to the neoliberal sex offender, I suppose).

       Though he did get me suspended from reddit for downvoting him in a comment, which is apparently a worse offense than running five targeted brigades a day for almost a year against us.

       Shills and insecure soyboys. That's Top Minds. Their downvotes don't really make a difference, though. The genuine users here know that the vote counts usually don't mean anything in this sub. In fact, usually the downvote brigaded comments are the ones that are pointing out a truth they are paid (minimum wage) to suppress.

       I doubt many of TMOR are actually vegan, that would imply they are acting based on perceived morality. Instead, it is pretty obvious they are acting out of a desire to maintain the status quo and enforce the opinion of the establishment as truth.

       Op obsession with tmor is what tmor love . I will give you a hint online bullies love attention .they love you to fight back when they think they  have you because they know there is nothing substantial  you can do . 
Just ignore them.  The more attention you give them the more trouble you will get from then. What do you think is going to happen that after one of your many post about them they will see the light and stop playing with you . Like the stupid saying they have free rent in your head

       Ban any user who breaks the rule . But going on about it public just creates more trouble. Like suicide  and mass shooting publicity  just makes people more aware of it and sees it happen even more . Lets says i get banned fir arguing with you and i see it as unfair  what do i do. I know tmor is a place that  annoys you and a place trolls go to comment on conspiracy  sub . I know this because you make post almost  weekly about tmor . What do you expect to gain from all these post . Why dont you do similar ones about other subs like a right leaning one that trashes anything against the president .

       <em>
        attempt
       </em>
       to brigade. One of the mods of that brigade sub has apparently been banned, one's account no longer exists, and the other is still a very active user here.

       I think the problem here is people  attacking the player not the game . They won't try and argue  the conspiracy they attack the person  or group  ring up the conspiracy  . I think the D sub is great at that . You will see 10 post on the person getting a door location wrong compared to the actual conspiracy.

       And just like that, the legitimate comments of TMOR brigading have been downvoted and comments defending them upvoted. Thanks for making it obvious, guys.

       I'll go on record and state that u/axolotl_peyotl is an incredible moderator and has clearly been the victim of a smear campaign. There should be more bans for people coming here to be generally negative about conspiracies, and there is nothing in his comment history to suggest truth to the radical alt-right picture they are trying to paint. And this is coming from someone (me) who thinks trump is vile.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;

      <p>
       I have no doubt that certain members of TMOR are paid shills and the rest are being taken along for the ride.

       Evidence is in the numbers. Doesn't mean you are going to understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the number of comments marked controversial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Controversial means an equal number of upvotes and downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       An upvote to cancel every downvote.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the whole thread is controversial, it is evidence of shenanigans.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, many will be quick to say "that's not evidence".

      <p>
       Some get it, some don't.

       Just because something isn't as popular or accepted as you think it should be doesn't mean its shilling.

       this is reddit, bud. it is the most insidiously manipulated and curated space online. r/conspiracy is naturally going to be targeted by skeptics and other cliques, but it has been aggravated by the current socio-political climate. of course this place is brigaded. you are not stupid and you know its true. you just dont want to admit it. look at who and what is downvoted and upvoted, particularly on hot button issues.

       Like I said, who or what is downvoted seems to reflect the current popular opinion.

       Brigaded?  Maybe, thats sort of how it works on online spaces like this.

       I specifically responded concepts regarding "shilling", paid posters, bots.

       It's a shame...I've been subbed to this group for years and I always find u/axolotl_peyotl post insightful and in no way harassing. However, their agenda is to pummel his posts to the point where he says, fuck it, it's not worth it anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its beyond me the hypocrisy of TMOR they always find a way to excuse their actions.... if the admins. Haven't stepped in at this point they are condoning their actions and have no intention to do a damn thing about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't understand the fascination they have with conspiracy....somehow it's seemed sjw took over TMOR and remind me of the Greenpeace whale war crew with the fat man at the helm.

       I'm starting to think it may be deep state sympathizers trying to do their part to shut down discussion about said deep state.

       It really doesn't make sense that there are so many people hell bent on "correcting" us crazy wackjobs.

       Numerous reports to the admins of harassment, vote brigading and report as spam brigading as neither resulted in permanent bans nor restoration of my comment karma. Last year, the admins had banned alt accounts for ban evasion in
       <a href="/r/electromagnetics">
        /r/electromagnetics
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">
        /r/targetedenergyweapons
       </a>
       . This year, the admins refused to ban.

       Dude you're fucking part of it, if your not engaging in it through alt accounts you're stirring up a crusade against them. I swear I wouldn't even be aware of tmor if it wasn't for your bullshit.

       So bringing awareness to someone or something shitty is a bad thing? They thrive on lurking in the shadows. Calling them out like the pathetic, skulking bullies they are is  necessary to expose them.

       No, silly wabbit... the brigading is bi-lateral attack, split along partisan line of alt-right (axelFchipoltle, RMDF, etc) and the alt-left (tmor, whathaveyou ,etc)...  in other words it's TWO brigades, and they are pretending to be waging a war on our home turf, disrupting the peace and ANNOYING THE LOCALS.  (Kinda like MSN, kinda no diff)
The REAL problem is that reddit, who ought to sort it out but just lets it play on without an endgame... is all in favor of this double brigading of this sub, because for all extensive purposes it makes sense to them to have this specific baseline of users maintain  modicum level of paranoia, which is how they desire to see the spirit of this community to continue.   The OP and all those people he's attacking and all those people who rush to his defense and all those people who attack them... they are all full of the dankiest shazam you ever smelt.

       It exposes them but it does nothing to stop them - they make new accounts and recruit new members nonetheless. Admins are the only ones who can do anything, and they don't, so it's pretty obvious what's going on.

       Clear and systematic campaign of harassment against specific Reddit Users, in this case YOU, u/RMFN are being systematically targeted by the mod u/MAGA_Hatter; that is coordinated harassment via one of the MODS of TMOR...and indicates that the Subreddit TMOR actually classifies and targets individual reddit users in a coordinated campaign of intimidation, prejudice (their religious beliefs also; see his title of the OP mocking you) and harassment.

       I have archived the subreddit and downloaded the zip showing your post on the front page of TMOR along with this image of TMOR with your post on it. Use all the photos here...including the one at the top to prove your case (because this is now centered around you)...

        /u/maga_hatter

       . They're intolerance to my religious and political beliefs have made me feel unsafe to freely discus my opinions. This post is to point out the fact that that kind of bigotry is allowed on reddit. I see the ideological of hatred against diverse opinions is the most important conspiracy we OK reddit have to tackle.

       Just look for the regular triple-gilded 100+ upvoted users who come to harrass the sub in any anti-establishment post, and also their friends who come to agree with them and get heavily updated, while regular users are downvoted below zero, even rational, inoffensive comments. The birgading is obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just pick any of those posts and find the patterns.

      <p>
       I like the "No contest" rule that says something among the lines of "talk about the topic, not about conspiracy theories or theorists", maybe something like that should be implemented because I have this huge pet peeve of idiots coming here just to say that this sub is crazy, delusional, etc... Never even commenting on the post, just talking shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the typical idiots who keep pushing Russiagate and demand the sub to accept it j"because it's a conspiracy!"

       If you really want to make a difference, here is my suggestion:
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       I unsubbed here months ago because, in my observation, certain mods are, perhaps unwittingly, helping the brigades. There are two or three here that consistently lay the hammer down hard on actual members while allowing disrupters to keep breaking the rules. Sure, you look in the mod logs and they remove the comments, but those people just keep getting to comment away over and over. They are not being banned, while real members are getting banned for pushing back.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       So, anyway... I am unsubbed. I am not subscribed to this sub anymore. Yet, here I am able to not only comment but able to up and downvote in the threads. Stop allowing that and a significant portion of the brigading would stop. Anyone from anywhere on reddit can vote on the comments here without ever participating in the sub. Other subs prohibit this, so it can be done. It won't stop all brigading, because some people will subscribe to do it, but it will make it much harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are people allowed to comment and vote while not being a subscriber? I know previously, the mods probably couldn't control this because the top mod was absent. But after the recent changeover, this should be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize one of those mods might ban me over this comment, but that's ok. I actually DO care what is happening to the community here. But consider this: Instead of banning me, disallow commenting and votes from non-subscribers and I wouldn't even be able to comment here. No need to ban to silence me. You can look in my post history. I have been a target of TMOR and have consistently called out the brigading in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck

        Why are people allowed to comment and vote while not being a subscriber? I know previously, the mods probably couldn't control this because the top mod was absent. But after the recent changeover, this should be possible.

       Honestly this is a

       factor in the manipulation and I actually don't think we can do anything about it.

       Idea: Some subreddits have a popover if you're not subscribed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we make people affirm exactly one time per user that they understand that by posting certain viewpoints here, they might become the target of cyber bullying?
      </p>
      <p>
       That might stir some things in the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, can we just openly start banning people who post in that subreddit unironically or in any way that isn't defending this one? I don't see any reason not to.

       The mere existence of this sub assists a great deal in keeping the fantasies chugging along. If we really hated them as much as they like to imagine, we'd remove that convenient tool by just going dark. Poof! They'd then have to confront their issues, which would certainly remain and become more apparent, all without them having the option and ease of deflecting it towards this sub. They would turn on each other and likely implode quickly.

       <strong>
        axolotl_peyote is part of the TMOR problem
       </strong>
       . He has alternate accounts he uses as part of TMOR brigades and is always the first person to stir the pot about TMOR, even if there is relatively low activity from them in a particular sub. Him being the one to call the rally here is exactly the type of shit TBTP have been pulling for centuries and quite frankly should be obvious to anyone who is a regular here.

       Personally I'd be most concerned with users here following the np links and causing trouble in other subs, thereby possibly giving an excuse to crackdown on the sub. I'm convinced a rationale can always be found on an as needed basis if we're considered too much of a liability, though

       Admittedly, it would be mildly annoying, but I'd view it much like the np-link bot comments or the archive bot comment that is already in every thread here. I've looked at many of those smaller conspiracy subs and the discussion in the comment section is usually lacking. I doubt many users here would do much more than quick looks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate the time, effort, and stressful moments you and the other mods must use to keep this community running, AP, which is a big part of why I would not wish to moderate such a large and controversial sub myself.

       How many times have people started that discussion on here and other subs? 100? I'm so fucking tired of this sub being he center of anti conspiracy bullying on Reddit. It's a fucking joke, and you're worried about promoting other subs? Fixing our troll infestation is priority #1. At this point I'm not even interested in discussing potential abuse of totes messenger. I have made, in the past, at least three new threads with my ideas on fixing things but you guys are so fun shy to implement anything I'm fucking done.  What are you worried about? A thread calling the mods facsists? Calling for you to step down? Downvoted brigaded? Because if you haven't noticed that's going to happen anyway.  People are making a career out of trolling your sub.  It's infuriating to regular users.  "Feel free to make a thread petitioning for totes messenger", I mean, that just makes it all the more infuriating. Those threads have been made ad nauseum. Let's take some steps. Ban all of them. Petition the admins DAILY. Enable totes. Scratch rule 10 or make it apply to those who are only here to troll. You know the difference. Lay down the law, the worst that can happen is already an everyday ocxurance here.

       We all know about their little secret conclave, we see the users who get permanently banned for 'repeated violations' or 'inciting hatred' after they post a comment disagreeing with an opinion of the mods, we see the 'regulars' who break rules repeatedly and get token bans.

       I think you guys underestimate the impact of the leftist paid posters on Reddit (and social media in general). Reddit is owned, lock stock and barrel. Just recognize this and laugh at it, its not gonna change unless you run - and finance - your own platform.

A mod using this sub as a personal platform to sook about their comments being downvoted is such an abuse of power.

       Seriously man, make your complaint to Reddit admins about the brigading. If they don't do anything about it then there's little point is wasting your time on it. Everyone already knows Reddit and its admins are biased toward very clearly defined viewpoints.

       You would think these TMOR jabronies would try to be somewhat subtle with their brigading... but judging by the laughably absurd voting patterns in this thread,  it almost seems like TMOR wants their manipulation to be noticed.

       I hope you keep making these threads,  let them expose themselves.  My one suggestion would be to maybe set these discussions so that the comments sort by controversial or new.  Sorting by controversial will make brigaded comments rise to the top, and sorting by new bypasses brigades entirely.

       This user was directing brigades by linking to us five, and as many as eight times a day,
       <strong>
        for months on end
       </strong>
       , as well as tagging myself and other regulars also multiple times a day, also for months on end, using derogatory title alterations, and Reddit would do nothing about it after banning his earlier account for harassment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I gave a small number of his comments a downvote. No link, no brigade, just a single downvote on especially egregious and slanderous comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       A thousands links and tags from him, and I downvoted him 25 times over the course of that year. That's less than one a month. I was banned for it. Yet he wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also bragged about inside admin knowledge. I'm sure that's unrelated.

       I watch them closely and keeps logs of their accounts and activity.
       <br/>
       I'd give more details but I don't want to give them any info that might result in them plugging holes.
       <br/>
       I'll post my findings at some point in the future.
       <br/>
       I'll just say this for now:
       <br/>
       You're right about them stalking you and downvoting your posts &amp; comments. You're their favorite target.
       <br/>
       They're also here all the time now. They still brigade and do vote purchasing &amp; botting but a huge chunk of them never even leave; they hang out here posting comments, downvoting valuable posts and upvoting garbage.

       Trained shills are everywhere, even the market. The new way is trained shills. It is very obvious, and not only to the people here.

       I hope and pray that people will be allowed to trust and be kind. There is so much to discover, if allowed.

       I believe in honesty. Life is easier when one is not playing games that damage others. Let us all put an end to fakery and psychological manipulation. We are all more powerful than the fakery, and promoted divides.

       Pretty clear when you pay attention they're using scripts and multiple accounts that "pin" karma at whatever value they choose. This should be obvious to any admins watching the database logs. If anyone did it for a purpose deemed unsavory, all those accounts would be banned.

       Referring to
       <strong>
        my own experience
       </strong>
       , R conspiracy threads are getting downvoted when they involve subjects, the FBI, the NSA and CIA do have interest in.

      <p>
       For example some of my threads, where I myself experienced downvoting:

       I seem to remember a time when RES would display upvote/downvote beside the total. And then vote fuzzing came along and ruined everything. Never did get a clear explanation why that change was made.

       It's the same people who used to run conspiratard, who were literally the people who were behind the Digg bury brigades what more needs to be said about them.  Some of them I imagine have some sort of official ties to agencies in the relevant governments, which is why they are allowed to operate with impunity.

       Hard to tell but I post somewhat often to r/conspiracy (not so much in this handle) and it gets fishy when everything I’ve posted always gets a downvote right away. I’m talking about within seconds of posting. That’s not normal on other subs.

       True. That would mean they have members who trawl through new every at all times downvoting everything indiscriminately. Whether it’s that or a script it’s pretty lame.

       You really only could determine a script if you had access to the IPs or a legit timestamp between upvotes and downvotes, or some sort of realtime graph of activity.  Even then, any halfway decent programmer could take measures to make said activity look legit.

       Ha yeah.  I still contend reddit is heavily manipulated, but it really is impossible to tell without logs, or seeing something blatantly obvious like a -15 in a single refresh.  Oftentimes reddit will even reset downvotes as their own algorithm can tell spam scripts.

       <strong>
        It is pretty obvious
       </strong>
       , that this thread - like many other threads in R conspiracy before - (and even the new comments in this thread)
       <strong>
        really are effected by manipulative downvoting!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Thus, we should focus on how we can deal with this situation,  now!
       </strong>
       (instead of complaining about this bad situation only)
      </p>
      <p>
       What we need to do this, is an
       <strong>
        effective counter-measure, that is within the reddit netiquette
       </strong>
       (the rules reddit has set up for participation in the reddit platform).
      </p>
      <p>
       From my point of view the best counter-measure to neutralize manipulative downvoting would be
       <strong>
        frequent "Manipulative Down-Voting Watcher Threads"
       </strong>
       , that enumerate and link the cases, where manipulative down-voting has been applied.
      </p>
      <p>
       For good and neutral information it should be policy to mention manipulative down-voting cases in other people's threads, only, because sometime one is simply wrong and may prematurely think, that the voting may be manipulated (which is not always the case).
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think about this proposal?

       But weren't we specifically told in another stickied thread to always sort by 'new'?
      </p>
      <p>
       There close to 3k subscribers of this sub online. If they're sorting by new as they were instructed, maybe that's why stupid stuff gets downvoted right away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unintended consequences are a thing.  Just like stickying yet another post about 'real conspiracy users' brigading this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making threads artificially sticky so they're not 'artificially' downvoted is a sure way to attract downvotes.  Also, it's clearly trying to drive an invented narrative.  It's a self fulfilling prophecy.

       to complain about the general attitudes of the majority of posters on this board is silly. it would be like a libertarian setting his home at latestagecapitalism and complaining about the community and trying to change the culture of that subreddit.

       funny, the lefty boards seem to be muuuuch more banhappy than places like this, and yet lefties complain about this subreddit and the people contributing to it
