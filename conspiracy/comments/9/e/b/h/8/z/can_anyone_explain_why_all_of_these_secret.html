       So I understand why these people are into satanic rituals and stuff because presumably it gives them access to negative energies and such. I also understand all of that military industrial complex madness because again, it gives them money and adds more negativity and fear into this world which they feed off of. But why the paedophilia? What is it that they gain from abusing children? Is it just a power/dominance display thing, some kind of dark cult initiation procedure or are all of these people really into that kind of a sexual fetish? It's all so confusing to me. Anyone care to offer an insight?

       I’ve had a few people ask me this when I try to red pill them and I struggle to find the answer also.. part of. Me thinks there might be a blackmail element of it, like if you want to be a part of this clique we need you to do this, it gets filmed and ultimately held over them.

       They need new people coming in their circles, if they don't get "new recruits" their power will be gone once majority of members die out.
      </p>
      <p>
       How you trust new recruits? You don't. They need to prove themselves through time. Pedophilia is one thing ALMOST ALL humans find extremely wrong and pedophiles have a real hard time living among normal people if they know about the crime. So what you, as an elite member do to new recruits? You "initiate" them into the elite circle by making them rape a child on camera and store the tape somewhere safe. By doing this you have control of the new member, because if he doesn't do what he's told you can just release the tape to public.

       Don't forget MK Ultra works best with kids that haven't formed decades of opinions on their identities.

       It's an efficient system to basically use kids as bait for adults and the adults usher the kids in to replace them.

       If this is true, wouldn’t some person at one point had the video of them released. The larger conspiracies are the bigger chance of them coming to light. Some person at some point would have stepped out of line enough that they would release this video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you’re going to say it’s just a ploy to get ppl not to talk. Then once a person talks, they just get rubbed out and tape never surfaces because problem taken care of at that point. If that’s the case then the video is nothing but speculation.

       The sordid story of the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kincora_Boys%27_Home">
        Kincora Boy's Home
       </a>
       is very illuminating in this regard. AFAIK it's the best example of children being sexually exploited for the purpose of generating kompromat on political opponents.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It was alleged that extreme Ulster loyalists who were members of a paedophile ring committing offences at the Home were being blackmailed by MI5 and other branches of the security forces during the Troubles. In 2015 campaigners were trying to have Kincora included in a wide-ranging inquiry to establish whether the security services prevented action on the abuse so they could compromise some of the perpetrators.[21]

       Seems to me that pedophilia is a universally hated activity. Unless you yourself are a pedophile such activity is virtually guaranteed to stimulate a strong negative reaction. It's a way of generating intense hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
       In prison the pedophile is considered to be the lowest class of criminal. They are often targeted violently because of the nature of their crimes. Taking sexual advantage of a child is the worst crime that anyone can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoever is behind such accusations are obviously very good at what they do.

       all sound very logical to me. it is very reasonable to test the newcomers’ loyalty for example in ancient China you need to cut your arms to bleed in order to join in some group. but do you guys actually have some sort of evidence to prove that pedos are also exactly this logic?

       Well the elites sure get a free ride sitting on top of the masses like some shitty social scum - any surprise this is the social arangement we've all agreed to uphold?  Pedophelia is singled out from of their many crimes because it's easier for fear mongers to stir interest by saying children have been thrown into a fire pit than it is to bring up the conversation about our shared social rules and why we allow them continually give privilege for one group to suck the other group dry.  Because some of us here in our midst believe they are on the "winning side" and might have something to loose if they agree on common and fair social rules, so they refuse the conversation but instead these people suggest we can come together and chant "stop baby rape" on Sunday morning.

       Well the elites sure get a free ride sitting on top of the masses like some shitty social scum - any surprise this is the social arangement we've all agreed to uphold? Pedophilia is just one manifestation of this unfair social system that gives certain people the belief they can do whatever they want to another human and is often singled out because it's easier for fear mongers (not your friends) to stir interest in the subject of why we've granted privileged rights for the elites to exploit other people by saying our children have been thrown into a fire pit - than it is to bring up the complicated conversation about our shared social rules and why we allow them continually give privilege for one group to suck the other group dry.

       More power.  To just drink the blood of the young is only so effective.   Through torture,  ritual,  and sacrifice, they increase the quantity of adrenochrome prior to the blood drinking, making it entirely narcotic and addictive.

       Looks up ISGP Beyond Dutroux essay. He makes a very compelling case for blackmail based pedophile networks. Many of the X dossier witnesses named members of a far right anti communist clique associated with the CIA and the Vatican, along with NATO too. They were the brains behind Operation Gladio and Stay Behind networks- which were responsible for a number of false flag bombings blamed on commies. (Operation Gladio is probably the biggest confirmed series of false flag terror- what I tell people about when I try to sell them a 911 conspiracy)
      </p>
      <p>
       Now how do you get a bunch of ideological right wingers to OK bombings on their own citizens? By blackmailing them with pedophilia tapes. Get them trashed at a fancy chateau, lead them up to a room for a special after party, then there waiting for them is a child or teen just for them. Both pedophile blackmail and false flag terrorism is the ultimate in Machievelian thinking- the most heinous of means are justified if it means preventing a socialist or communist takeover.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now apply that same logic to Iran Contra (the Franklin Affair) and 911 and so on.

       but there is science behind the vampiric consuming of blood/energy and reaping the benefits. Even more fucked up...if you drink the blood of someone who has just gone through some intense trauma, like a young child being raped and tortured, you will get high off the adrenaline and other chemicals released during that trauma. Its so fucked and pains me to think about these "invsible children" go through.

       Yeah I just tend to be a bit leery about more extreme arguments like 'they drink blood to get high' or 'they're vampires feeding off innocent energy' when it's already hard to get people to listen about the Franklin Affair or 911. I could maybe see the getting high thing, and I totally find it easy to believe that there's an illegal organ and blood market to prevent aging. But once people start using the Alex Jones/ David Icke type language I start to get a bit exasperated.

       Both are controlled opposition and not who you should get info from, but it doesn’t negate that that shit happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I get where your coming from. But still. Not believing in something because it may sound too crazy is not a good reason to not believe in something. As well as not being able to “convert” the normies. The truth is out there. Look up interviews with ex satanists and masons. They will straight up talk about the vampiric nature, in both the life essence and blood. it’s out there.

       I kinda view videos with cult survivors and whistle blowers with skepticism. I've watched stuff with Katy O'Brien and Douglas Dietrich and other names I can't remember at the moment and a lot of it smells fishy to me- either psyop or attention seekers. But if you have any good links I'd be interested in reading or watching.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing that comes to mind is the spirit cooking Podesta email. I know those rituals use blood and breastmilk.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder how much of the whispers of occult practices are used as a smokescrean (apparently it's an abuse tactic as occult elements to abuse makes it harder to believe), and how much those practices are used for physical vitality (like blood and organ transplants), or how much it is actually believed in a religious sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me once satanism and the occult comes in the truth becomes a black hole, it's just super hard to determine what's bull shit and what isnt.

       Satan. Abuse of children is one of the most vile things you can do in the eyes of God. Also most people that are abused become easily controllable and even graduate to the control of some sort. If one does not believe in the bible then you will have a hard time understanding it. For me it is very easy to see.

      <p>
       mystery babylon deities like moloch and baal require child sacrifices.
      </p>
      <p>
       sabattean frankists doom cult believes that the arrival of their messiah, the anti-christ will come sooner the more sin there is in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       killing and torture pleases satan
      </p>
      <p>
       the elites drink baby blood for its rejuvenating properties

       Kinda hard to do that nowadays when you can walk down the road hand in hand with your husband.
