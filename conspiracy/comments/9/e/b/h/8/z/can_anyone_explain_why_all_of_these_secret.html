        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I understand why these people are into satanic rituals and stuff because presumably it gives them access to negative energies and such. I also understand all of that military industrial complex madness because again, it gives them money and adds more negativity and fear into this world which they feed off of. But why the paedophilia? What is it that they gain from abusing children? Is it just a power/dominance display thing, some kind of dark cult initiation procedure or are all of these people really into that kind of a sexual fetish? It&#39;s all so confusing to me. Anyone care to offer an insight?</p>

<p>How you trust new recruits? You don&#39;t. They need to prove themselves through time. Pedophilia is one thing ALMOST ALL humans find extremely wrong and pedophiles have a real hard time living among normal people if they know about the crime. So what you, as an elite member do to new recruits? You &quot;initiate&quot; them into the elite circle by making them rape a child on camera and store the tape somewhere safe. By doing this you have control of the new member, because if he doesn&#39;t do what he&#39;s told you can just release the tape to public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sordid story of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kincora_Boys%27_Home">Kincora Boy&#39;s Home</a> is very illuminating in this regard. AFAIK it&#39;s the best example of children being sexually exploited for the purpose of generating kompromat on political opponents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was alleged that extreme Ulster loyalists who were members of a paedophile ring committing offences at the Home were being blackmailed by MI5 and other branches of the security forces during the Troubles. In 2015 campaigners were trying to have Kincora included in a wide-ranging inquiry to establish whether the security services prevented action on the abuse so they could compromise some of the perpetrators.[21]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to me that pedophilia is a universally hated activity. Unless you yourself are a pedophile such activity is virtually guaranteed to stimulate a strong negative reaction. It&#39;s a way of generating intense hatred.</p>

<p>In prison the pedophile is considered to be the lowest class of criminal. They are often targeted violently because of the nature of their crimes. Taking sexual advantage of a child is the worst crime that anyone can do.</p>

<p>Whoever is behind such accusations are obviously very good at what they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks up ISGP Beyond Dutroux essay. He makes a very compelling case for blackmail based pedophile networks. Many of the X dossier witnesses named members of a far right anti communist clique associated with the CIA and the Vatican, along with NATO too. They were the brains behind Operation Gladio and Stay Behind networks- which were responsible for a number of false flag bombings blamed on commies. (Operation Gladio is probably the biggest confirmed series of false flag terror- what I tell people about when I try to sell them a 911 conspiracy) </p>

<p>Now how do you get a bunch of ideological right wingers to OK bombings on their own citizens? By blackmailing them with pedophilia tapes. Get them trashed at a fancy chateau, lead them up to a room for a special after party, then there waiting for them is a child or teen just for them. Both pedophile blackmail and false flag terrorism is the ultimate in Machievelian thinking- the most heinous of means are justified if it means preventing a socialist or communist takeover. </p>

<p>Now apply that same logic to Iran Contra (the Franklin Affair) and 911 and so on. </p>

<p>but there is science behind the vampiric consuming of blood/energy and reaping the benefits. Even more fucked up...if you drink the blood of someone who has just gone through some intense trauma, like a young child being raped and tortured, you will get high off the adrenaline and other chemicals released during that trauma.

    <div class="md"><p>I kinda view videos with cult survivors and whistle blowers with skepticism. I&#39;ve watched stuff with Katy O&#39;Brien and Douglas Dietrich and other names I can&#39;t remember at the moment and a lot of it smells fishy to me- either psyop or attention seekers. But if you have any good links I&#39;d be interested in reading or watching.</p>

<p>Another thing that comes to mind is the spirit cooking Podesta email. I know those rituals use blood and breastmilk. </p>

<p>I wonder how much of the whispers of occult practices are used as a smokescrean (apparently it&#39;s an abuse tactic as occult elements to abuse makes it harder to believe), and how much those practices are used for physical vitality (like blood and organ transplants), or how much it is actually believed in a religious sense. </p>

<p>For me once satanism and the occult comes in the truth becomes a black hole, it&#39;s just super hard to determine what&#39;s bull shit and what isnt. </p>
