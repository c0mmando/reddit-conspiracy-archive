<blockquote>
<p>Ginsburg called for reducing the age of consent for sexual acts to persons who are &quot;less than 12 years old.&quot; (102) She asserted that laws against &quot;bigamists, persons cohabiting with more than one woman, and women cohabiting with a bigamist&quot; are unconstitutional. (195) She objected to laws against prostitution because &quot;prostitution, as a consensual act between adults, is arguably within the zone of privacy protected by recent constitutional decisions.&quot; (97) Ginsburg wrote that the Mann Act (which punishes those who engage in interstate sex traffic of women and girls) is &quot;offensive.&quot; Such acts should be considered &quot;within the zone of privacy.&quot; (98)   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s wrong one some but right on others. Legalizing prostitution, unionizing it, taxing it, and creating a regulatory framework for it, would actually work to significantly reduce abuses and human trafficking. But concerning reduction of age of consent and the idea that trafficking laws are &quot;offensive&quot; in the absence of prostitution reform is hilarious and borders on the degenerate. </p>

<p>Any act on a human by force is abuse, and a act of force on a child is also abuse.</p>

<p>But yeah for some it&#39;s necessary not to disprove Abrahamic thought rather than stop inhumane acts based on the same Abrahamic thought</p>
