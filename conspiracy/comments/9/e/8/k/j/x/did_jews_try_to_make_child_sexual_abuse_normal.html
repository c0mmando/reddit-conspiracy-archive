       Yeah Leviticus 18 allows for a father to sexually abuse his daughter.

       I wonder if that part of the Torah has confused people, maybe even wanting to confuse others with heinous behaviour.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ginsburg called for reducing the age of consent for sexual acts to persons who are "less than 12 years old." (102) She asserted that laws against "bigamists, persons cohabiting with more than one woman, and women cohabiting with a bigamist" are unconstitutional. (195) She objected to laws against prostitution because "prostitution, as a consensual act between adults, is arguably within the zone of privacy protected by recent constitutional decisions." (97) Ginsburg wrote that the Mann Act (which punishes those who engage in interstate sex traffic of women and girls) is "offensive." Such acts should be considered "within the zone of privacy." (98)

       She's wrong one some but right on others. Legalizing prostitution, unionizing it, taxing it, and creating a regulatory framework for it, would actually work to significantly reduce abuses and human trafficking. But concerning reduction of age of consent and the idea that trafficking laws are "offensive" in the absence of prostitution reform is hilarious and borders on the degenerate.

       The Dutch legalized it. Works well for them, the women are unionized, and they want to be there. Yes, there are still abuses, but there is recourse to correct them and its a work in progress. Still better than the regressive blanket ban we current utilize.

       I can see your point in that. I stand by my comment in relation to the current system but you're right- if we change the system we eliminate the need. You could look at my method as more of a stopgap one.

       I have said it on here many times. Guess I'll have to say it again. I'm a 50 year old Mom. I'm Jewish. I have never known any Jews that sexually abuse children. Maybe some do, but I don't know them.

       Don't judge all Jews by the sick actions of a few. Same with Catholics.

       Some people would say circumcision is child abuse... it's forcing a life long scar on a child who is defenceless... sound a lot like child sexual abuse
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the need to impose something on someone, which is what Abrahamic though is about

       Well if it's legal then it's ok?

      <p>
       I think for myself, those that look to Abrahamic thought for guidance are just as easily mislead by laws and norms
      </p>
      <p>
       Any act on a human by force is abuse, and a act of force on a child is also abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah for some it's necessary not to disprove Abrahamic thought rather than stop inhumane acts based on the same Abrahamic thought

       The Dutch legalized it. Works well for them, the women are unionized, and they want to be there. Yes, there are still abuses, but there is recourse to correct them and its a work in progress. Still better than the regressive blanket ban we current utilize.
