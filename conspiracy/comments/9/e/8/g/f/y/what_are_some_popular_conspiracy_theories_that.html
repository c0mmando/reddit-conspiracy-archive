They just happen to be paid off by every major oil company and lobbyist who profits off of oil you can name. It’s the darnedest thing, isn’t it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s true that the earth has shifted climates constantly for millions of years, however, each time the climate had major changes, it happened slowly over time. One way that this is studied is by getting a thick piece of ice from Antarctica to see where the high buildup of carbon began, which was post-Industrial Revolution. The closer you are to the top of it, the more carbon you see, but as you go lower, you’ll find less and less carbon. It’s sort of like studying rings on a piece of a tree. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is the 97% consensus; science isn&#39;t determined through consensus, it never has.  Years ago, the consensus was that the world was flat; it took one man, not a global consensus to change that notion.  The perpetuation of a global consensus on man made climate change, should be enough to raise the eyebrows, of critical thinkers.   The ever increasing lack of sunspots, should be a bigger factor, in the climate change debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the day of the 911 attack, 3 Israelis filmed both planes hitting the 2 towers. They were seen celebrating, dancing, and taking selfies with the burning towers. In addition, two men were arrested in New York on the day of 911 in a van filled with explosives under the George Washington Bridge. The institutional media totally stopped reporting on this fact once they learned that the men were Israeli.

<p>The extent of the wreckage... how much was confiscated and gathered up before the photograph? How fast did the plane hit the building?

<p>As far as Bigfoot, chupakabra, etc; we&#39;re dealing with Cryptids- which while there is no solid proof of their existence, it&#39;s not as easy as simply saying &quot;they don&#39;t exist&quot;. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, after all. Concerning 9/11 holograms- I don&#39;t buy it, but I also highly <em>highly</em> doubt a plane hit the pentagon. Evidence to me seems to point more towards a missile or a drone modified to look like a plane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have always had a hard time believing that a plane didn’t hit the pentagon, but my reasoning is far different and more anecdotal than most others’. </p>

<p>My dad is a pilot for American Airlines, and back in 2001, he was just a copilot. For a few years, he was semi-frequently assigned to Charles Burlingame, the captain of Flight 77. My father was not working during 9/11, so he found out about 9/11 on the news. When he heard that it was Charles’ flight that was being reported in the news after the Pentagon incident, he was completely devastated. He told me countless stories about him and their cockpit shenanigans, and would often get teary eyed. To this day, whenever he’s D.C., he visits the memorial by himself to pay respects to him. When you’re a pilot or copilot, you gain a high sense of camaraderie.  </p>

<p>I know that this isn’t at all a logical way of looking at the event, and I will never use it as an argument for why the pentagon was never hit, but it’s just really tough to think that it there was no plane when it affects someone that closely to you. </p>

<p>I don’t have evidence for this at the moment, but I think my dad has a few photos with him, I’ll ask him about it later so I can provide proof, but for now, you’ll just have to take my word for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check this out for a better argument.  <a href="http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/moondoggie/">Dave McGowen</a></p>

<p>Here are a few reasons:</p>

<p>First, the gravity on the moon on sixth that of the Earth.  So you can jump about 6 times higher. An average man can jump about 18 in on the earth. On the moon he should be able to jump about 9 ft.  The astronauts did not jump 9 feet. They jumped about 18 in.</p>

<p>Sound does not travel in a vacuum. You can find a lot of videos where outside sounds are recorded. For example when they pounded the flag in. The sound of the hammer can be heard.</p>

<p>There are pictures of the LEM with no dust on the landing pads.  How is that possible?  The rocket engine would have thrown up a lot of dust.</p>

<p>I love the Apollo 13 movie too.  The astronauts turn off the power in the LEM and it freezes.  That makes sense right?  Space it cold.  Actually space is a vacuum.  A vacuum is a perfect isolator.  Heat can only be transferred by conduction, convention or radiation.  In space that only leaves radiation.  The space ship should have increased in temperature.  It was being constantly heated by the radiation from the sun.  But people would have a hard time understanding that, so the story was written a different way.</p>

<p>This list could get really long.     </p>

<p>You should really check out <a href="http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/moondoggie/">Dave McGowen</a> or research it a little. It does not take much.</p>

<p>Is that with or without a 180 lb suit on?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not stating the videos weren&#39;t edited in all instances. Maybe they were edited to make it more &quot;theatric&quot;? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are pictures of the LEM with no dust on the landing pads. How is that possible? The rocket engine would have thrown up a lot of dust.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If &quot;they&quot; can edit dust off the pads they can also edit it &quot;on&quot; . Thrusters tend to blow dust away from where they&#39;re pointed so if they are pointed down it&#39;s not a big stretch to say they seem to &quot;clean the landing gear&quot;.</p>

<p>Either I would have preferred if you linked to supporting arguments on each claim instead of just to one guy&#39;s website.</p>

<p>TIL: Spellcheck doesn&#39;t like thrusters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the aliens is my thing too. The Betty and Barney Hill case is truly legit. They weren&#39;t astronomers, they point out a galaxy that had yet to be discovered and it was at the right locations and everything. They were interracial so I see how they&#39;d be interesting to them. I feel the base of the ancient astronaut theory is obvious and undeniable. Every single civilization are describing the same thing. Makes perfect sense, it&#39;s just with their vocabulary. Plus I mean you can&#39;t ignore shit like an inscription of a fucking lightbulb in Egypt. P that one map from the 1600s that shows antartica WITHOUT ice and has such accuracy that when overlaid with satellite images, the details like mountain lines match up perfectly. The Dulce Base really interests me and of course Roswell. I think they&#39;ve used how aliens really look in movies so that if we saw a picture of a real one, we&#39;d think it was fake. Like how the craft look exactly like in the movies. I think the person to take a lot of truth from is Bob Lazar. He had nothing to gain at all. But he named their power supply, being element 115 in 1989, before it was introduced in the early 2000s. Same for Gary McKinnon. Can&#39;t decide on Phil Schneider, the fact that he couldnt lift his arms above his head yet supposedly strangled himself is suspicious. I think Dan Buresh and the JRod story might be bull. I think Men in Black had a lot of shit on point. The real stories have to be put in tabloids because MSM wont cover them. I think that a lot of underground bases have humans that work with ETs. I wouldn&#39;t doubt Space is already militarized. I really am intrigued by Emery Smith, but I think Corey Goode and David Wilcock are full of shit. </p>

<p>My true theory on bigfoot? It&#39;s a race that live in the center of the Earth. They use Cave systems to come up to the surface for various reasons and then retreat into the center of the Earth. If you knew your way around the cave system, you could cover vast distances without ever stepping foot above ground. </p>

<p>I live when people say that I&#39;m gonna get shot or disappear someday cuz of what I say, I respond &quot;then you&#39;ll know I&#39;m right. If I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;m just a nut. I&#39;m only a threat if I&#39;m right&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are also tons of proven conspiracies, so for a lot of them, you don&#39;t even have to believe the theory. It&#39;s already proven. In some cases, the theories that get the most attention are the ones that have a lot of discrediting trollish elements added to them, but the underlying conspiracy theory is true. </p>

<p>List of proven conspiracies: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/lopc">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/lopc</a></p>

<p>Some proven conspiracies include Big Pharma, massive cases of banking fraud, human experimentation by the military on the unsuspecting public, government manipulation of the media, mass spying, the government lying to the public about the air at ground zero being safe to breathe, many examples of false flags, authorities lying about the safety of our drinking water, government agencies editing movie or TV show scripts for over 100 years so far, government surveillance of journalists, government shills on social media, examples of the government spraying chemical or biological agents onto the public without their knowledge, and the list goes on and on. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is so true. Another similar issue is the talking point that &quot;the conspiracy is too big, someone would leak.&quot; There are hundreds of whistleblowers on a variety of topics. That&#39;s just what I&#39;m aware of. There are probably thousands. It&#39;s just that some of them don&#39;t get enough publicity, so they&#39;re not known to most of the public. </p>

<p>Besides that, compartmentalization keeps most of the participants in the conspiracy unaware of what they&#39;re ultimate goal is, so the true number of potential leakers is much lower than we would think in many cases. </p>

<p>&quot;For a hoax to persist five years, no more than 2,521 people can be active participants: that is, be aware that the conspiracy exists. To last 25 years, that number drops to 502. And to last a century: 125 people tops.&quot; <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/math-formula-charts-the-lifespan-of-hoaxes/">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/math-formula-charts-the-lifespan-of-hoaxes/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>All medication/drug/vaccines have side-effects. I mean, regular painkillers has death as a possible side-effect. 
Consuming pills over a long period of time will make you sick/addicted. That&#39;s why you see people that start with 2 pills a day for kolesterol(?)  or something, increase to maybe 5 pills a day because the original ones disrupt something else vital. Eventually it ends up with you having to take  25 different pills every day, and the only effect from that point is that you are slowly dying. </p>

<p>I never use prescribed pills for longer than two day, unless it&#39;s absolutly neccessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe: There are many so these are the ones that really shape my worldview the most.</p>

<p>Hitler escaped to South America.</p>

<p>Operation Mockingbird never ended, nor did Cointelpro.</p>

<p>JFK was killed by the M.I.C., as was RFK.</p>

<p>Government agents as well as private hitmen are used to “suicide” people. I.e. David Kelly or Vince Foster among many others.</p>

<p>9/11 was allowed and maybe even instigated to happen.
The M.I.C. uses paramilitary groups to do their dirty work and then eventually uses the media to turn on them once a boogeyman is needed. I.e. mujahadeen into al qaeda or various Arab Spring rebels into ISIS.</p>

<p>Don’t believe:
Flat earth or hollow earth. I believe these to be disinformation.</p>

<p>The Illuminati. I think old money runs everything around the world. There are probably competing factions of absurdly rich fucks. As a concept I can believe in secret societies having influence.</p>

<p>Crisis actors/fake events. I would be more inclined to believe in certain events (like school shootings) are planned or instigated by those with a vested interest than to believe all victims and their families are faking.</p>

<p>That vaccines are all bad. I think we should be skeptical about their necessity but I believe they have helped mankind on the whole.</p>

<p>The moon landing being a hoax.</p>

<p>There are others but this post is just to toss out a few.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are also tons of proven conspiracies, so for a lot of them, you don&#39;t even have to believe the theory. It&#39;s already proven. In some cases, the theories that get the most attention are the ones that have a lot of discrediting trollish elements added to them, but the underlying conspiracy theory is true. </p>

<p>List of proven conspiracies: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/lopc">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/lopc</a></p>

<p>Some proven conspiracies include Big Pharma, massive cases of banking fraud, human experimentation by the military on the unsuspecting public, government manipulation of the media, mass spying, the government lying to the public about the air at ground zero being safe to breathe, many examples of false flags, authorities lying about the safety of our drinking water, government agencies editing movie or TV show scripts for over 100 years so far, government surveillance of journalists, government shills on social media, examples of the government spraying chemical or biological agents onto the public without their knowledge, and the list goes on and on. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of the fake conspiracies are smoke screens. Most people hear about the fake shit and don&#39;t look any further. They also discredit anyone trying to talk about the underling conspiracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is so true. Another similar issue is the talking point that &quot;the conspiracy is too big, someone would leak.&quot; There are hundreds of whistleblowers on a variety of topics. That&#39;s just what I&#39;m aware of. There are probably thousands. It&#39;s just that some of them don&#39;t get enough publicity, so they&#39;re not known to most of the public. </p>

<p>Besides that, compartmentalization keeps most of the participants in the conspiracy unaware of what they&#39;re ultimate goal is, so the true number of potential leakers is much lower than we would think in many cases. </p>

<p>&quot;For a hoax to persist five years, no more than 2,521 people can be active participants: that is, be aware that the conspiracy exists. To last 25 years, that number drops to 502. And to last a century: 125 people tops.&quot; <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/math-formula-charts-the-lifespan-of-hoaxes/">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/math-formula-charts-the-lifespan-of-hoaxes/</a></p>
