       My main argument is going to be that we already have proof of elite customers purchasing expensive blood transfusions with teen or young adult blood, but that this is just the tip of the iceberg. It has both been going on for decades and there are most likely other blood transfusion operations out there.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But it’s no longer an experiment with just mice. The startup company by Jesse Karmazin, Ambrosia, is doing this with humans, and the rich are lining up to get the blood of the young.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Vanity Fair reports, Ambrosia, which buys its blood from blood banks, now has about 100 paying customers.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ambrosia currently offers teenage blood plasma to older customers at a cost of $8,000 (£6,200) for two and a half litres.
       </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The cost of the transfusions is going to limit this to only wealthy elite customers, and it would be naive to think that this is the only young blood transfusion operation out there for elite customers. This has probably been going on for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite are also clearly interested in this.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Tony Wyss-Coray, a researcher at Stanford leading the work, says that if it works he hopes to isolate factors in the blood that drive the effect and then try to make a drug that does a similar thing. (Since publishing his work in mice, many “healthy, very rich people” have contacted Wyss-Coray wondering if it might help them live longer.)

      <p>
       Evidence this has probably been going on for decades:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1924, Bogdanov started his blood transfusion experiments, apparently hoping to achieve eternal youth or at least partial rejuvenation. Lenin's sister Maria Ulyanova was among many who volunteered to take part in Bogdanov's experiments. After undergoing 11 blood transfusions, he remarked with satisfaction on the improvement of his eyesight, suspension of balding, and other positive symptoms. His fellow revolutionary Leonid Krasin wrote to his wife that "Bogdanov seems to have become 7, no, 10 years younger after the operation". In 1925–1926, Bogdanov founded the Institute for Haemotology and Blood Transfusions, which was later named after him. But a later transfusion cost him his life, when he took the blood of a student suffering from malaria and tuberculosis.

       Other than blatant profiteering from those selling the blood I just don’t see the issue or the conspiracy in this whole thing. As somebody with a high interest in cutting edge medical science I’d do it myself if I could afford it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean it’s not like they kidnapp people and drink the blood directly from severed arteries, these people are willingly giving blood.

       I'd tie it to missing and trafficked children to it, as it has been rumored the elite are involved in those via pedophilia, no reason not to throw this in the mix.

       I'd see no reason not to, gotta do something with those kids once they served their purpose... its dark but it also makes sense as a means of disposal.

       If anything it adds to the motive, beyond just perversion, you get an economic/health benefit from the practice from a practical perspective.

       Oh, child organ trafficking is a massive industry. They fetch a ton of money on the black market, esp because I heard from somewhere that you have to have the organs of two kids just in case one is too big or small.

       that's assuming they want an 18year old and ups blood. if a young adults blood is good, how about a childs that still is growing, I'm no doctor but I'd imagine a Pre-pubecient kid is rife with hormones an adult doesnt have that could be beneficial.

       It's pretty clear you're not a doctor, because it's the opposite. Children have reduced hormone levels, across the board.

       I think people see these transfusion recipients as lacking in character, because they fear death and do not age gracefully. As such, it is undesired that they should have social gains on account of their weakness. We want to give social gains to strong and proud people who have virtue enough to face aging and death.

       Correct.

       Can be confusing though because she is a character in the book called "Dracula the Undead" written by Dacre Stoker who is the grand son of  Bram Stoker. An absolute garbage book that should be avoided at all cost.

       Historical analyses reveal she never actually bathed in the blood of teen girls.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an urban legend that started right from when she was placed under house arrest by the authorities, and it continues to this very day in eastern Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her aristocratic family had a lot of enemies among the patrician class, and when they found out about her murders, they were overjoyed. They
       <em>
        easily
       </em>
       exaggerated her misdeeds, spreading anecdotes among the plebeian class.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was certainly into the female version of pederasty, as well as an extreme version of BDSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       A perverted (and violent) Sappho, if you may. That's who the legendary Countess was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, she was a benevolent human rights activist of sorts growing up. Somewhere along the line, something changed her
       <strong>
        dramatically
       </strong>
       .

       From a link another user has provided, there is another very old example of this "young blood transfusion for slowing aging" thing.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The fledgling years of the Royal Society, founded in London in 1660, witnessed some of the earliest experiments in blood transfusion. When Robert Boyle, one of the society’s founders, compiled a wishlist of scientific projects, the top entry was “The prolongation of life”. That might be achieved, he hoped, by replacing old blood with new.

       They didn't know anything about blood types, genetics, etc. That's why I think the earliest this was going on in a widespread fashion was maybe mid 20th century when the science was good enough to make sure they wouldn't have crazy complications from the transfusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before that, there was probably some experimentation with it and a lot of failure.

       You're right. A google search brings up reports that show how this is well out in the open. Nevertheless, when wealth alone gives you and advantage, it harms the species. We need to promote the characteristics of those who do not fear death, so that our future can be made of strong people.

       Excellent criticism of my post. Surely going off on a tangent about terminology will stir up a lively discussion /s

      <p>
       Not everyone here is a medical student, so it would make very little difference if I used that term or not. I think everyone who reads the post will be fine understanding it.

       Old people should gain wisdom and embrace eternal sleep. We don't need them clinging onto life just to clutter the world up with their retired asses. The kinds of people who will do this are not the kind who have admirable character -- but this transfusion procedure will increase their fecundity. That gives lackluster character an evolutionary advantage. That is cheating and bad for the species.

       Whatever they're doing, it's clearly not working. They look terrible. Like on death's door. They age so poorly. They're stupid if they think that blood does anything long-term. Its' equivalent to taking a multivitamin and hormone injections. But it's not addressing the cause of aging. The elites are the opposite of elite. They are so uneducated on basic things.

       Man, this is provably false.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The more money you have, the healthier you are and the longer you live, according to a new study from the Urban Institute crunching data from the Centers for Disease Control.
       </p>
       <p>
        The study divides Americans into five income groups and finds that each income group is healthier than the one below it and sicker than the one above it.
       </p>
       <p>
        And that outcome is remarkably consistent. Bloomberg’s John Tozzi points out that in almost every category of ailment, from heart disease to arthritis to kidney disease to strokes, prevalence drops almost in lock step as income rises.

       There are probably 20 different reasons why this is true. They have access to better healthcare, better living conditions, they get more sleep, they are less stressed out, and they get teen blood transfusions.

       Thanks. I particularly enjoyed this bit:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Wyss-Coray is not the first person to wonder whether the answer to the problem of ageing might lie in human blood. One of the first physicians to propose blood transfusions to rejuvenate older people was Andreas Libavius, a German doctor and alchemist. In 1615 he proposed connecting the arteries of an old man to those of a young man. He had high hopes for the procedure. “The hot and spirituous blood of the young man will pour into the old one as if it were from a fountain of youth, and all of his weakness will be dispelled,” he claimed, in an account told in the Textbook of Bloodbanking and Transfusion Medicine by Sally Rudmann. It is unclear how it turned out; there is no record of the transfusion happening.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fledgling years of the Royal Society, founded in London in 1660, witnessed some of the earliest experiments in blood transfusion. When Robert Boyle, one of the society’s founders, compiled a wishlist of scientific projects, the top entry was “The prolongation of life”. That might be achieved, he hoped, by replacing old blood with new.

       The teen blood doesn't do much. Like I said, it's a temporary fix. It's like putting a bandaid on. It doesn't do much. You have to fix the cause of the aging, not just temporarily treat the symptoms. And on top of that, the blood only works at most, 24 hours and only makes someone feel minimally better. Maybe better libido. But that's pretty much it. They're still old as fuck.

       Is anyone looking at the practical part of it. In my area all the blood banks always need blood but do they ever tell you for what. Evidently for 250 liters of blood it’s not going to ppl in surgery but rather to rich old ppl

       The blood banks sell blood, I think the last hospital I worked was paying red cross on average around $300.00-$500.00 per unit of blood. Officially it's to cover administrative fees, collection and testing, but they're making a ton of money as are the providers of FFP(Platelets)

       I know how you feel. When I try to find a counterargument, it's mostly just that I think it's disgusting how these old people are clinging onto life. If I argue that the procedure puts youth at risk, like with illegal organ harvesting, then I have conceded that the procedure is not wrong in itself, but wrong when done to donors to their harm. I'm getting older and I want to learn how to die. "Philosophy is the practice of death," says Plato. I think culture should embrace death as a natural and good event, just like life. Please don't give your blood to these disgusting people.

       Not saying it's related but Kim K does those blood facials that's supposed to clear up skin and make it look smoother. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a black market using children's blood that might have an even more prominent effect.

       Man, this is provably false.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The more money you have, the healthier you are and the longer you live, according to a new study from the Urban Institute crunching data from the Centers for Disease Control.
       </p>
       <p>
        The study divides Americans into five income groups and finds that each income group is healthier than the one below it and sicker than the one above it.
       </p>
       <p>
        And that outcome is remarkably consistent. Bloomberg’s John Tozzi points out that in almost every category of ailment, from heart disease to arthritis to kidney disease to strokes, prevalence drops almost in lock step as income rises.

       There are probably 20 different reasons why this is true. They have access to better healthcare, better living conditions, they get more sleep, they are less stressed out, and they get teen blood transfusions.
