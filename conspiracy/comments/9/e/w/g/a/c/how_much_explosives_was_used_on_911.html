<p>What is claimed is:  </p>

<ol>
<li>In a thermite igniter/heat source comprising a container holding an internal igniter load, the improvement wherein the container consists essentially of consumable consolidated thermite having a low gas output upon combustion, whereby upon ignition, substantially all of the container and said load is consumed with low gas production.<br/></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract  </p>

<p>An apparatus is disclosed for cutting target material which includes a housing having an inner cavity and an elongated nozzle extending from the inner cavity to communicate with the exterior of the housing. The apparatus is provided with a charge for generating a cutting flame and an activating device coupled to the charge. A method for cutting target material is also provided in which the cutting apparatus has an elongated nozzle positioned generally adjacent to a surface of a target material to be cut. The cutting apparatus may be joined with one or more housings to provide a ganged together or joined cutting apparatus. The effect of this ganged cutting apparatus is to provide an extended linear cutting action on the surface of the target material. In addition, in an opposed cutting apparatus, two housings are positioned with their nozzle channels in opposition to permit cutting target material from two directions.  </p>
