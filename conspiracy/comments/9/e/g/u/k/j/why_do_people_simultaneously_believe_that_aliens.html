       First off, I do believe in aliens, though I am personally doubtful that they have noticed or visited us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't wrap my head around why people believe NASA is forced to fake shuttle launches and space walks while also believing that a far off alien race has the technology to reach space and to cross vast distances to reach us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't it better support alien theories if a relatively new (in galactic terms) race such as ourselves were already taking our first steps into space? Conversely if we were forced to fake such things because we lacked the technology wouldn't other alien races also lack the ability to reach space?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my thoughts. Sort of a response to the recent post about a "stage crew" hand in an ISS video.

       Nah, that is round earthers.  Although it is clearly established science that the Earth is not round, people still insist it is with religious fervor, ignoring gravity, physics, evidence, testing, experimenting, or asking questions.

       <em>
        To keep track of Earth's shape, scientists now position thousands of Global Positioning System receivers on the ground that can detect changes in their elevation of a few millimeters, Gross says. Another method, dubbed satellite laser ranging, fires visible-wavelength lasers from a few dozen ground stations at satellites. Any changes detected in their orbits correspond to gravitational anomalies and thus mass distributions inside the planet. Still another technique, very long baseline interferometry, has radio telescopes on the ground listen to extragalactic radio waves to detect changes in the positions of the ground stations. It may not take much technology to understand that Earth is not perfectly round, but it takes quite a bit of effort and equipment to determine its true shape.

       Have you actually met one person who believes both if those things, or are you conflating all conspiracy theorists into one person?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I believe we have been to the moon. I do however think that there would have been a motive to fake the first moon landing in order to win the space race. That does not exclude us from being capable to reach the moon. I don't find the evidence compelling that the first landing was faked, just saying there was a motive to have faked it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've met people who believe it was faked, and have met people who believe in aliens. I have never met someone who thought both things. I have met people who think we were only able to make it to the moon through reverse engineering alien ships, but I think that's stupid too.

       Who is "we"? Because even NASA will tell you that there is no telescope that can see anything left up there. The only images they have to tenuously support the claim that there is anything up there are their LRO satellite pictures with arrows pointing to where the flag, etc are.

       Try it yourself by pointing a laser at the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that doesn’t work, simply locate a laser that can allegedly do this and see what kind of proof is offered to verify that the laser has, indeed, bounced off the moon.

       I’ll give you a head start: you will need a NASA-operated lunar observatory ...

       Idk how people can question every other 3 letter government organization (CIA FBI NSA) But when it comes to NASA they must be telling the truth

       Actually I do get it. Growing up a space nerd...to entertain the idea NASA lied would mean everything I ever felt about space was a psy op/cold war propaganda. Breaks my lunar heart. I basically hope we are wrong about it because the conspiracy is so twisted. To manipulate so many star struck kids and stuff.

       That's a good question. It's because it didn't happen. Or else it would have been big business 50 years ago. Don't believe in space travel or moon trips in the future either. They are all going to fake it with complex illusionary technology like fake screens and holograms and other advanced technology that the public has never seen.

       People have this idiotic belief that space is like this big ocean, and once we get there we can just swim around and go wherever we want. That couldn't be further from the truth. In reality, landing on the Moon is a thousand times harder than simply going into space, and manned missions are a thousand times harder than robotic missions. Yeah, there is a huge economic potential there in the long run, but nobody wants to eat the costs of pioneering that industry when the real money comes from robotic mining of asteroids. Basically, people have unrealistic expectations and don't grasp the challenge of space engineering.

       There is a similar problem with the Drake equation and the supposed paradox behind it. The variables which are severely underestimated relate to the probability of contact between intelligent races. There could be 10,000 intelligent races just in our galaxy alone, and still the chances of making contact during recorded history are slim to none. Space is just that fucking big and difficult to navigate. It's definitely surmountable, but most people just don't grasp what we are up against.

       We could fund a million moon missions if there was any real impetus behind such an endeavor, but without the competition of the Space Race compelling the government to throw money at NASA, there will be none.

       It might be the next logical step but it isn't going to happen until they can launch a long-term mission.  Other space agencies might plan missions to the moon to prove that they can, but there's not much reason for NASA to send

       I saw the Grand Canyon once.  It was only beautiful at sunset.  And it was indeed memorable, but I don’t fell any urgency in returning: been there, done that.  And going to the moon is way more costly and dangerous.

       A bunch of interrelated reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) It's expensive to get to the moon in terms of money and rocket power, especially using single use Saturn V rockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) By the time of Apollo 17 the US had pretty much established dominance in the space race and the impetus for further missions was lessened.  The Soviets either weren't able or didn't have the resources to do it, so we didn't need to keep doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The economy was tanking in the early 1970s.  Vietnam had been expensive, inflation was increasing and the government was looking for was to cut spending.  Skylab used the final Saturn V rockets and the remaining goals shifted to low Earth orbit and shuttle development, which was seen as cheaper.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The Apollo missions weren't oriented towards reusable lunar facilities, so if we kept going as we had it was even more expensive single use stuff.  A lot of this was a byproduct of how expensive single use rockets are and how expensive it is to lift anything into space and get it to the moon.  Moving crews and the building blocks of a habitat would have been really expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) The moon is an expensive place to visit AND stay.  There's nothing up there.  If we decided we wanted to keep a crew there for an extended visit (weeks or months) we have to send up everything.  Shelters.  Fuel.  Water.  Food.  Spare Parts.  It's all fantastically expensive to get it to the moon.  That's partly why Mars and its elusive water is appealing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we had wanted to keep going to the moon, it was really time to shift gears and start doing what Musk is doing now -- solving the cost problems of just getting into orbit.  IMHO, we shouldn't have built the shuttle and instead should have focused on SpaceX-type reusable rockets.  If we had done that instead of the shuttle we might have been (by the late 1980s, assuming starting in the 1970s and working continuously) able to get a lunar base operational thanks to reduced orbital lift costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still of the mind that we'd probably need to do an ISS-like stage of development anyway.  We could never get a lunar base up on a single rocket, so we'd create an ISS-like station that served as a collection/assembly point for lunar materials and bolt it all together into some kind of LEO -&gt; Moon shuttle.  Of course its still no simple feat to do all this and you still face the criticisms that there's nothing on the moon, etc.  I think it's probably good practice and a generally good way of developing the technology necessary for further solar system exploration.

       There’s nothing up there that can sustain a fledgling space colony, like water or very low extraction energy minerals or metals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mining the moon probably is valuable, but you have to get all the stuff for processing it up there as well as get it back if you don’t directly consume the raw materials on the moon.  That’s beyond our ability.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there’s some talk of Helium-2 being up there and useful for fusion reactors, which is great if you can build a fusion reactor and/or get it to the moon.

       If you think about it for a few minutes you can’t continue believing in the Van Allen belts as they are pretty clearly some kind of construct to give a somewhat reasonable sounding explanation of why it’s “hard” to go to space.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Apollo missions allegedly traversed them numerous times with no ill effects either during or after the voyage.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet all other alleged manned “space missions” have taken place well below even half the distance to the belts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it sounds weird, and I used to use the belts as “evidence” against the moon landings, but it’s impossible to see this video of Alan Bean and not realize that we are talking about something not real, but made up.

       I once met a man who argued that NASA, the actual government agency, does not exist. He also argued that Kennedy Space Center is CGI, Houston Control is CGI, and that all the money directed at NASA was actually being used to fund CIA Black Ops worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this time, I lived in Melbourne Beach Florida. I used to sit on my beach crossover deck and watch the shuttles and rockets launch. As an side, the most beautiful launch I ever saw was at sunrise. The shuttle lifted off in pure darkness and lit the sky like a star. When it broke the line of dawn, 50-60 seconds in flight, the whole sky lit up like the most incredible sunrise ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also was good friends with many NASA engineers. They took me on tours of the facilities (prior to 9/11) that most people never got to do. I was able to walk through a section that is now part of the ISS!
      </p>
      <p>
       I stood in the VAB and looked up at the two shuttles they were refurbishing for future flights. We were able to ascend to see the thrusters on the lower placed shuttle (they stacked them, vertically, and each move down was a new team for a particular sort of work).
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually witnessed all of this, with my wife and our NASA friends, and this man
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       argued that I was a liar. My wife and I were complicit in this huge conspiracy, while
       <em>
        he
       </em>
       was one of the enlightened few.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also believed that food companies were poisoning their foods to be sold in grocery stores. BUT, they were only poisoning foods to harm liberals and free thinkers. So, he is not the most reliable expert on these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told him that I had been a lifelong Republican until about 2006. Then I became a fairly hardcore liberal. And I was still alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, he called me a member of the cabal or, at least, an unwitting participant.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was one of the strangest interactions I have had, ever, with anyone.

       Because NASA is and always has been a cover agency for the black budget secret space programs developing interstellar capable space fleet based on the anti-grav tech tat was acquired as the primary purpose of US involvement in WW2. They were developing a highly advanced warp capable propulsion while keeping us distracted with low tech rocket science. The truth is "they" (not NASA)have been to the moon, built on the moon, Mars, had a fully operational warp capable space fleet since the 80s, and have already traveled so much further beyond anything we can imagine.

       They aren't mutually exclusive. Our society has only been around for less than 10k years, really only got borderline civilized the last 2k years. There could potentially be civilizations out there that have been around 4-5 billion years. It took us less than 60 years to go from the Wright brother's first flight to orbiting the Earth. Let's say you think the moon landing was a bunch of shit, you at least have to acknowledge that we have the capability to put something in orbit and maintain it there. So if we went from getting off the ground to orbiting Earth in 60 years, imagine what a society could do in a billion years. Based on the size of the universe, I would say it's mathematically impossible that there are no civilizations in existence that can travel to another solar system.

       Hmmm, I'm kind of where you're wondering about so I'll answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a moon landing skeptic. I 100% believe in ISS and satellites and all that. However, I am not 100% convinced that we have been to the moon. I believe that something that could have been done in 1969 would be much easier and cheaper by now and there are too many "coincidences" that don't add up. For example, NASA deleted the footage. Since people are still going to Antarctica and climbing Mount Everest I don't buy the "we've already been there so we don't need to go back" excuse that I hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, as far as aliens. I do believe in them and I do believe that they have been to Earth. I do not believe that they are from 100 light years away in space and get in a metal spaceship built with screws and bolts and fly here using some kind of fossil fuel and that they are living carbon based lifeforms just like us. I'm not sure what or who they are but I think that they have technology or something else like an almost infinite lifespan or hivemind or something that allows them to cover spacetime in ways that we can't comprehend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that makes sense but I'm not an expert or very well schooled on this. It is just what my mind says to me. I don't know for sure.

       We collectively believe that the world was moments away from war multiple times in the 60's and 70's thanks to mutually assured destruction but refuse to believe that the shadow gov would fake an event to gain competitive advantage... Even if they were 98% sure they could get to the moon safely the landing still would have been faked because that 2% means maybe losing the cold war. Considering this was all going on during operation gladio, operation Phoenix, mk ultra, cointelpro... It's the logical conclusion. The actual level of space tech is irrelevant.

       I don't think the same people believe both of those things, as that would be quite significantly contradictory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess those two things aren't truly mutually exclusive, but I'd say the majority that do believe some form of extraterrestrial contact has been made (I am one of them - I find the amount of evidence through sightings, government whistleblowers, alien abduction stories,...quite overwhelming for this to have no truth at all behind it) do not believe that NASA is incapable of reaching space.

       You should think more along the lines of aliens not existing and the UFOs spotted are actually man made inventions. Always remember this model, because it is fact, regardless of how hard mainstream media tries to dissuade you of it. There is only God, Satan, Angels, and Demons.

       all those conspiracy theories aside, moon is a perfect place to colonize and be used as fueling stop for deep sol system missions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I m guessing within a couple of decades we will see an increase in public interest of colonization of moon.

       To me mars always seems like a 2nd step after moon.

       As for Aliens, I believe we have been visited by people who have much more advanced technology than ours but as of right now there is no evidence that they are aliens. My money is on time travel or extra-dimensional beings.

       There some eye-witness records that is too unexplainable. Some examples that interest me are right after incidents of Fukushima and Chernobyl. For those that don’t know, in both incidents there are eye-witness records that unidentified flying object would be just hovering over the stations and “drain” some of the radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially on Chernobyl; some suggest as far as it was UFO’s that helped firefighters for a crucial time to save the station from a larger explosion with reducing radiation levels to somewhat tolerable levels. Firefighters are still died to radiation poisoning but their work saved a lot of people if not millions of people from full blown fallout that would have covered entire east Europe, black-sea and Anatolia some other regions.

       Whistleblowers in secret government projects claim that we have advanced technology but only use rocket technology as a cover. We've seen the technology in action with UFOs that do impossible turns with g-force that would kill. So logically this would only be possible through manipulation of gravity and electromagnetism, a form of antigravity which we see in hovering/levitating UFOs.
      </p>

       They already erased Nikola Tesla from history because it was free and clean implosion energy. Oil fuels the world economy and the vast military industrial complex so this us why they suppress alternative sources of energy. Debt is the only true control system they have, they dont want unlimited progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bob Lazar who claimed to work at area 51 reversing UFO antigravity technology said the UFO works like a Tesla Coil. It creates a containment field of energy like a torus and rides along a singularity. The same concept is seen in the Nazi Bell flying disc foo fighters of WW2. They got information from the vimana shastra, an ancient Hindu writing on the construction of flying craft, that the craft levitate by generating a magnetic field through rotatuon of mercury.

       That's why Einstein said energy, matter, and light are part of the same thing and interchangeable. Once you manipulate one, for example generating mass from energy to create a singularity, you can manipulate all of them. The craft creates a singularity and rides along it, thus the impossible speeds and self-contained torus gravity field that isn't effected by outside g-force, acceleration that ignores drag that would increase weight of an object to enormous numbers.

       I've never heard anyone claim that shuttle launches are fake. I believe the theory is moon missions were fake because astronauts couldn't cross the Van Allen belt. The shuttle goes only to low earth orbit so that's not an issue.

       OP, why don't you educate yourself about the research done on UFO's as a non-human phenomenon and about the secret space program? I recommend writers such as Richard Dolan, Jacque Vallee, and Joseph Farrell. You won't regret learning about this stuff, I promise. Here's Richard Dolan, probably the preeminent scholar on the history of UFO's.

       Nah, that is round earthers.  Although it is clearly established science that the Earth is not round, people still insist it is with religious fervor, ignoring gravity, physics, evidence, testing, experimenting, or asking questions.   Please join me in denouncing the "round earth" pseudo-science.
