        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So here i was discussing my previous post on Fluoridation in bottled water <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9ecs30/i_have_a_question_fluoride_in_bottle_water">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9ecs30/i_have_a_question_fluoride_in_bottle_water</a> asking why is it that Fluoride is added to Bottle water also and upon further investigation into the effects of Fluoridation and the calcification of one of our organs in the centre of our brain known as the pineal gland i came across this. Fluoride is the main cause for the calcification of our Pineal Gland. But how does that affect us and why is this not investigated? Calcification of the Pineal gland has been proven to reduce Melatonin production which is what this organ is represented as serving for. What does Melatonin do? &quot; Melatonin, also known as N-acetyl-5-methoxy tryptamine, is a  hormone that is produced by the pineal gland in humans and animals and  regulates sleep and wakefulness. &quot;   </p>

<p>Now did why i made this post. At first when reading about this Pineal Gland situation and fluoridation i believed that &quot;sleep and wakefulness&quot; mean something to with going to sleep and waking...and what most people would think. But do you know what the real meaning of wakefullness is: &quot; Wakefulness is a daily recurring brain state and state of  consciousness in which an individual is conscious and engages in  coherent cognitive and behavioral responses to the external world such  as communication, ambulation, eating, and sex. &quot;  </p>

<p>Tell me we are not being dumbed down. CONSPIRACY. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you regarded or just can’t read? Securing 1gal/day of non-fluorinated water will get pricey real damn quick if you don’t have a home filtration system. </p>

<p>So that means when you workout, you can’t shower at the gym because the water is fluoridated. Can’t drink the water at work cause that’s also fluoridated, and if you don’t have a way to bring in water to work and secure it, it can be hard to transport.</p>

<p>So no, it’s not menial. Maybe put that brain to use and actually think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so &quot;regarded&quot;, as you put it, to think bathing in flouride water will somehow absorb it through my skin like I&#39;m a single-cell organism, and actually be metabolized in that way to make it to my pineal gland...</p>

<p>So like, don&#39;t be unreasonable man. It&#39;s perfectly safe to shower in flouride water. But, if it&#39;s your own cooking or drinking at home, why not go the extra mile for yourself? Be reasonable dude, it&#39;s very menial to just purchase a reverse osmosis filter, or reverse osmosis bottle water if you don&#39;t mind the plastic bottles.</p>

<p>Just please, be reasonable. I&#39;ve never see somebody suggest that bathing in it after a go at the gym will effect you in any measurable way. That&#39;s such an incredulous thing to presume.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you’re trying to cut it out, then you would go all the way as best you could. </p>

<p>If you didn’t have a RO filter in your house, best you could do bottle water, but that can get pricey depending on how bulk you can buy, and if you can secure some of that at work.</p>

<p>You’re looking at about $1k for a 360 GPD RO system from Home Depot.</p>

<p>Depending on locality, you may have to apply for permits to install it either professionally or yourself.</p>

<p>If there are better systems, which can get up there in price.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that fluoride is a toxin for the body, but I think the consequence of calcifying of your pineal glad is overplayed and not necessarily making anyone &#39;more stupid.&#39;</p>

<p>To play devil&#39;s advocate...</p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t there be statistical correlation between regions without fluoride in their tap water and intelligence or spirituality? I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any study that would indicate such relationship.</p>

<p>I have seen elites, such as our Presidents, drink out of bottled water on TV on numerous occasions. And bottled water would contain fluoride. Surely the elites would know about the danger of such toxin and avoid them?</p>

<p>/advocate</p>

<p>So what are the actual benefits you&#39;re suggesting with a decalcified pineal gland? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Vivid dreams? I already have those.</p></li>
<li><p>Sharp/clear mind? Abstain from simple sugar, and you&#39;ll probably experience something similarly.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. About the only thing I’m ingesting that has flourished is tap water. Drinking close to a gallon a day gets pretty damn pricey and i can’t secure that large of quantity at work.</p>

<p>Do have plans to add treatment to my house main line to remove it from the incoming city water. </p>
