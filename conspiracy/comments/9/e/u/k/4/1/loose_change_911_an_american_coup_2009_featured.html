       Not trying to discredit the original post, but all those things you listed are just normal American pastimes that people consume because they enjoy. They are created because they make money. Not everything has some sinister origin.

       If you have the spare time to enjoy it, if you could rewatch the superbowl where the power went out. Team A is crushing Team B sooooo bad, in like the first quarter, the game become un-intresting to 50% of the people, and they start to leave. Then 'the power goes out.' When it comes back on, 20-40 min later, the good team is all of a sudden NOT TRYING and INTENTIONALLY FUCKING UP, the bad team ISN'T DOING MUCH BETTER. I think the game wasn't not thrown, but the real action was stopped in order to create the appearance of a close game, an interesting show, to keep a larger percentage of the crowds attention. "Can't be having 50% of the people leave the stadium in the first quarter! That would be too embarrassing. Kill the power. We need to fix this." This is just one example of many. If you have the time to watch it let me know what you think.

       You're right, the origin is almost never sinister. The problem here is once big money is involved, things usually take a dramatic turn. A lot of character ends up getting lost due to profits being put over making the best quality content possible and trying to push the envelope. This doesn't always happen, but unfortunately happens far too often.

       You can view the world however you'd like. Many people were able to feed their families and have a nice life because of those jobs. Baseball has been enjoyed by millions of people across the world and has helped diminish racial prejudice. There's a dark and light side to everything. In the end it's all a very fine balance.

       You decide....  I just wish some decided to give a shit a little more about wars fought on false pretenses than baseball... (insert any form of effortless entertainment). I think that was what the comment implied. Not that the NFL or Baseball or whatever is inherently evil, they’re just time sinks.

       <p>
        Baseball was made popular in America because of a push by the military to teach children to throw grenades.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think it's the other way around: the U.S. military designed grenades to be ball shaped to capitalize on soldiers' familiarity with throwing a baseball.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern "ball" grenades weren't developed until WWI, and didn't become standard in the U.S. military until WWII. Baseball was wildly popular in the United States well before both of those.

       I was at a restaurant a few months ago waiting for my bill, when I overheard my waiter frantically asking other staff what 56 minus 4 was. He had to ask three people before he got an answer. The guy was about 22-25, seemed perfectly intelligent and articulate when we spoke with him.

       A related anecdote: I recently worked at a grocery store for around 9 months and most of my managers had to stop for a minute and count on their fingers to figure out how many hours were between 12PM and 5PM, 10AM to 2PM, etc. And about 25% of the time they got it wrong. These were people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.

      <p>
       April of 2001

      <p>
       Less than 6 months before 9/11

      <p>
       Was it on CNN? FoxNews? NPR?

      <p>
       The first anybody had heard of ON was while watching LC

       Also research the film makers backgrounds and ask yourself how they were able to make such an amazing film with such limited time budget and experience

       It takes Hollywood longer to make a Star Wars movie than it took some teenagers to make Loose Change?

       Loose Change is meant to convince you that the US Government acted alone in 9/11, while Zionist puppet masters

       I don't blame you for believing Loose Change. It's what originally turned me into a 9/11 Truther". I still remember where I was when I saw LC

       You seem very hung up on the idea that Operation Northwoods was real, probably because it's the lynchpin of the "inside job" theory, which is a red herring, since Israel is responsible for 9/11, which would be the "outside job" theory

        Operation Aphrodite' was the World War II code name of a secret USAAF program that began in 1944. Pilotless aircraft packed with explosives were remotely controlled into their targets. Just a small piece of evidence that the technology for remote controlled flying has been around for decades.

       I'd say JFK was the coup. But unlike the stereotypical tanks-in-the-streets coup, they kept it a quiet coup and slowly, slowly locked down the country and its people.

       You mean the official story which is backed by actual facts, like steel beams can fail without melting? Also that tower 7 was hit by debris which started fires which caused its collapse, and if there was an explosion it would have been so loud that it would have been heard for several miles.

       The subterrainian thermonuclear device caused the molten bedrock. I feel like that’s an often overlooked part of the whole conspiracy. Yeah the buildings were demo’d but a traditional demolition wouldn’t cause this.

       First, the guy in the video is talking about metal, not bedrock, so I'm not sure I see how you are connecting the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, I have seen this report, and others, referring to "molten steel". I have not seen any analysis that suggested any temperatures high enough to melt steel before the buildings collapse. Could there have been hot spots in the rubble, almost certainly, but hot enough to melt steel seems unlikely. Tell me this, how do the people making the reports know that what they saw was steel? They aren't metallurgists or blacksmiths. Could it have been aluminum, since there certainly was a bunch of it from the airplanes?
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, this clearly doesn't contradict the NYTimes article about the geological formations found under the WTC site. Did you see that engineer knew about anomalies long before? " Engineers knew in advance that there were “discontinuities” in the bedrock at the southeast corner of the trade center site, where Tower 4 is situated. Some of these were revealed in the 1960s during the construction of the original slurry wall." Likewise, don't you think geologists would have known the difference?
      </p>
      <p>
       “There are areas in local parks that have small vertical potholes exposed,” said Cheryl J. Moss, the senior geologist at Mueser Rutledge, “but I’m not aware of anything in the city with a whole, self-contained depression on this scale.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Ms. Moss and Mr. Pontecorvo are scheduled to give an illustrated lecture on the site at 7 p.m. Wednesday at the Tribute W.T.C. Visitor Center, 120 Liberty Street, opposite the pothole.
      </p>
      <p>
       “It’s been called the Grand Canyon of Lower Manhattan,” Mr. Pontecorvo said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Charles Merguerian, chairman of the geology department at Hofstra University and a consultant to Mueser Rutledge on the trade center project, put it even more simply: “Beautiful!”

       If you researched the other side as much as you've been researching the conspiracy side then you'd know. You're talking about the Grenfell Tower right? Look it up. There's a difference between that tower and the WTC towers that explains why.

       It also proves that top-down progressive collapse was not a new phenomenon discovered on 9/11, but rather it was a tried and true method of controlled demolition, and the likely the method of choice for this demolition

       Explain how there was no plane debris at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania? Do you really believe the plane just vaporized into thin air? If you believe steel beams can lose integrity that fast from “office fires” than how can you not believe a plane vaporized on impact with earth /s. Cmon lol it’s not nonsense. If WTC 7 fell from office fires as a result of the debris it would be the first in history to have ever done so. That’s a huge anomaly guy, please explain why you think it’s nonsense instead of resorting to simplistic ad hominem fallacy.

       Really, how hard is it to research this on your own? Much of the debris at the pentagon was in the building. At the pennsylvania site much of the debris was embedded in the crater. Still, if you actually research you can find some photos of the plane parts. WTC 7 fires were able to take the building down because they burned for several hours uncontrolled and the building lacked certain features like columns encased in concrete rather than spray-on fire resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is not the first time steel structures have collapsed from fire. Again, research. Adhering to a conspiracy hivemind is not research.

       The government has counted on people being dumb enough to believe that a building can fall at free fall speeds due to some office fires.  For the most part, it's worked.   The general public lacks even the most modest of critical thinking.

       All 3 Zietgiest documentaries are still on Netflix, the first two discuss conspiracy aspects of 9/11.

       Build a character that believer every conspiracy possible and doesn’t stop to try and deliver any in a coherent manner without anger and with some level of logic : Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now build that character up slowly. Allow him to have a platform for awhile. Even give him a phone call with the president, fuck it right? the sheep will buy that. It will be divisive, the sheep will argue if he is allowed to speak or not to speak... that’s what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use 4 of the largest media agencies in the western world to censor and silence this guy as a test to see how the sheep react. ~50%+ dgaf and some are actually pleased with the corporations/state’s move to censor.  (That 50% is just my observation no source so jog on with that comment) Now they have an open door to censor people, me, you, your grandmother it doesn’t matter now. Now they have what they want. And we are all busy arguing over if he should be allowed to speak or not. It should be about moving to better platforms that cannot censor people regardless of the shit they say. They won, they conned even some of those in here that believed in AJ. He never sat right with me. If you want intelligent conspiracy uncovering go to The Corbett Report. Alex Jones is apart of the controlled opposition movement is what I am getting at. Lenin said it best, “The best way to control opposition is to lead it ourselves.”

       Interesting, thank you.  I actually agree with the majority of what you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I definitely think that a figure like Alex Jones if a perfect tool for the powers that be.  For every legitimate conspiracy he may discuss, another two are complete bullshit. This is why conspiracies in general are viewed as complete bullshit by many people, or at least that's the most acceptable thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, its a fact that there are and have been a shit load of legitimate conspiracies.  The reason a character like Alex Jones is so useful to the powers that be is much like you said above.  He muddies the water.  He blurs the lines between plausible and implausible conspiracies.  I think the most effective way to convince people that a conspiracy is bullshit is to put it right out into the open and ridicule it.  Enter Alex Jones and the blurring of the lines.  Trump also plays into this technique perfectly with all of his fake news claims of easily provable things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is, left or right, all of the major media companies are owned by wealthy people, insanely wealthy people.  They obviously have an agenda, but left or right, one way or the other, their main objective is to maintain and preserve their wealth and power.  A misinformed and feuding public is in their best interest.  Now, this is not to say that the articles and pieces written and discussed aren't true.  In fact, I'd say most of the information presented to us is true, however, it is irrelevant to our (the public's) interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is rarely, if ever, discussed in the main stream media?  How about Eric Prince and his mercenaries all around the globe?  How about how natural, life sustaining resources around the globe being privatized?  What about how money and capitalism itself, is inherently unsustainable, not only for human life, but for all life on this planet?  I know I'm getting a bit abstract at this point and that my last question, at this point in time, is only my opinion, but these are the questions that truly need to be answered.  These are the true conspiracies.  The fact is, those in power will do anything to maintain that power and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, I think the biggest problem we face as a species is the inequality of our power structures and resource distribution.  This inequality is holding back the human race from achieving our true potential.  We live such short lives in the grand scheme of things and we have the technology and the resources to provide everyone on this planet with happy, healthy, productive and meaningful lives.  If we were able to achieve this, everyone on the planet would benefit, as everyone would be contributing something to the advancement of human society.  I know this sounds idealist and impossible, but I believe it to be true regardless of how attainable it may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, sorry, I went on a few tangents, but these discussions always lead me back to my last paragraph.  Most of this is just thinking out loud, but I'd be interested in your thoughts should you take the time to read all this.

        Loose Change

       is a good wakeup film, good production/entertainment value too. If you want to go deeper and really understand what happened that day, including the demolition method, check out Dmitri Khalazov's interview:

       (This is countered with the COINTELPRO Judy Wood op as an explanation for how the buildings turned to dust. But even if you believe that one,
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       you realize that thermite or conventional explosives alone could not account for the near-total disintegration of three huge buildings.)

      <p>
       There needs to be one level deeper, however, IMO. 9/11 was a small-scale test of deliberately inducing cancer into a population but covering it up with govt and medical industry. The plan has been rolled out to the country at large. This is the biggest, ugliest truth of 9/11:

       The original Loose Change blew my mind. Total wake up call. Yet, still I live in a world in which I can't bring up the possibility that 9/11 was not what the official report said it was, without being instantly marginalized or told to shut up. Any mention of it in any 9/11 thread not in r/conspiracy and it's instant down votes into oblivion.

       That's because you don't stand on facts.   You stand on nothing concrete.   Perhaps if you had a shred of evidence?  Or even a reasonably believable intent?

       I usually try to start backwards from Building 7 and the facts of how fast it came down into its own footprint, then move to how fast the two towers came down with barely any resistance. Those are facts. Then I move to how fast those planes were going near sea level and talk about the facts about how fast passenger planes can go near sea level and still be controlled, or it breaking up. Then I like to talk about how cell phones didn't work from those heights at those speeds back then. Keep working back. Getting to the "coincidence" and fact that Washington D.C. was left unprotected because the Air Force had their planes elsewhere conducting exercises that included hijackings of planes. There are so many coincidental facts that anyone with any logic can see something was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to use actual facts and logic but no one wants to discuss them. I don't bring up "no planes" or directed energy weapons (although they're fun to talk about). A discussion is not even allowed basically.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intent is shown in the actions taken immediately afterwards: the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and The Patriot Act. Which the government now had carte blanche to implement. A perfect false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I do stand on facts and try not to go off into wild theories (though, again, they're fun to discuss).

       Research it. There are actual facts one look at.
      </p>
      <p>
       How fast is free fall speed? How fast did those three steel buildings come down? Then research how is it possible for that to happen? What's the temperature that steel melts at? What were the temperatures of the fires in the twin towers? Was there molting metal under the rubble on 9/11 or not?
      </p>
      <p>
       How fast can a 767 go near sea level? How fast were the planes going on 9/11 when they crashed into those buildings? What happens to a plane when it's going faster than the allowable limits at certain heights?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where was the protection of the air space on 9/11? Why did it take so long to scramble planes to intercept these 4 planes? The facts about that are out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       "no planes" is a theory. Directed-energy beams are a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are actual facts that you can go research. I did that and came out believing that the official narrative isn't true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality that steel framed building don't collapse like that due to fires is a fact.

       Well, then certainly then you know the facts  about how fast planes can go at near sea-level, how fast the planes were going, how fast the buildings came down, what is the speed of freefall, that the air space was left unprotected, and so much more and have concluded that these facts are hogwash. You saying I'm not looking at facts is clearly the truth in your mind. Therefore no discussion is ever possible between us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, to many,  hijackers that weren't trained that well to be pilots took these 767's and flew them at incredible speeds in very thick air, doing difficult maneuvers, and with incredible accuracy, while not having been stopped by the Air Force that is supposed to be protecting the air space,  is not a theory or hypothesis, but the absolute factual truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it must not be questioned if one fears being called an idiot, conspiracy theorist, tin-foil hat wearer, and shut up instantly through downvotes or if at a gathering through silencing. And the way it's going, you might even get booted off the major social media platforms.

       You are clearly a smart man; I can tell by the way you so eloquently speak.   Which is why it's so confusing to me, that you fell for one on the most ludicrous conspiracy theory of them all.  Honestly,  the moon hoax theory is more believable than this pile of crap.  And thst's not even remotely believable.  Sigh...

       I didn't fall. I investigated what I could on my own and came to the conclusion that the official story isn't logical, thus not true. I'm not spouting beliefs in no planes, directed energy weapons, or nuclear detonations tht would clearly be hypothesis. Just that if A) the planes hit the buildings at a particular speed B) 767's can't go that fast so close to the ground without breaking up and/or the pilot losing control  C) 3 planes flown by pilots who had little training in 767's, if any, pulled off their missions with complete accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this logical? What is the likelihood?  That's my approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm the first to admit when I'm being dumb. I don't think I am in the case of 9/11. I also don't think the pilots and architects that have formed truth movements are dumb either because they're using actual facts to come to conclusions that the official story just isn't logical.

       Yes he did. And he crashed into the trees then the ground. That's a fact. How long did it take for the military to get planes on his tail? How fast was the plane traveling? I can't seem to find that information. Just for comparison sakes.

       People are that way in general. We accept the reality that is presented to us. The mere idea that one's belief systems have not been vetted, and if done to its completion, one might have what one might call a direct experience of reality (seeing things as they are) is a foreign one to many. Not so much to a Buddhist or to religious traditions that strive towards a clear, enlightened mind rather than worship a deity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mental process of which you speak is rampant among people who accept official reports, stories, and rumors as truth, as well as people that are named "conspiracy theorists." This mental process goes deep, as even unvetted belief systems about the self are held. Beliefs that are just as much stories as anything anyone can tell you. There have been people who have used logic and reason to become illuminated or enlightened in this regard, as opposed to meditating for 40 years. Some just eat a mushroom or LSD and come away with the same clear mental state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some watch Loose Change for the first time and perhaps just one detail in it wakes up something in their mind, gets them thinking. They realize they've spent their whole lives accepting stories about reality, about themselves.
       <em>
        Creating
       </em>
       stories about reality and themselves and believing them hook, line, and sinker.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of these events with official stories that defy logic, people will start to investigate, things are uncovered, but confirmation bias does come into play, as does the desire to be part of a group. Any beliefs or information presented that doesn't fit the belief system of the group is seen as a threat. People with the information are labeled things like "lone-nutters", "conspiracy theorist"  etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is so rampant among the general population, that one almost has to believe it's a built-in biological instinct. But once one experiences undifferentiated reality for the first time, one then knows and sees that humanity is asleep under a hypnosis of belief systems, and it's actually an accepted habit of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to approach such events as 9/11 is to start with logic. There are hypotheses that I've read that have no logic, but I still enjoy them as a study. It's part of the rabbit hole so-to-speak. I allow others to believe them and I don't apply a label to them like "no-planers." For if I did, I would be cutting off interesting thought that might lead somewhere, might not. Maybe someone who believes there were no planes and that they were added into the video later or that they were holograms is actually on the path to real discovery. A detail they discover leads to something highly logical and that can't be debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a state of mind one can be in which is beyond belief systems, labels, and resistance to "what is?" Can I investigate using logic and reason, and allow others the freedom to do it in their way and to offer ideas and not have the ideas be treated as threats to my own? Allow them their thoughts and expression without marginalizing them, labeling them, and buying into an illusion of separation between myself and my own experience of them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would this not be inner peace?

       That's what opened my eyes. If building 7 was controlled, which I believe it was, why wouldn't the other buildings have suffered the same fate? If one is controlled they all were, and that one was.

       When this happened, I was at home getting ready to day trade stocks so I was able to watch everything live the first time through as it happened

       Although I never thought about the towers falling, once the first one fell I immediately realized the second one was also going to fall

       Seemed impossible, yet like a foregone conclusion at the same time

       Thats what really does it for me.  There are so many questionable aspects to the official narrative--the mechanics of the building demolition is but one of them.  So many other "loose ends" that normies do not seem to care about.

       Another really simple question is ...

      <p>
       "Where is the debris from the planes?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if someone can dismiss the 2 World Trade Towers and not being able to find plane parts (which of course is ridiculous) how can they dismiss this for the Pentagon and Pennsylvania "crashes" ??
      </p>
      <p>
       If you saw the hole in the pentagon wall right after a plane was supposed to have hit it, the hole was round, 12 feet in diameter and on the ground floor and there was no wing damage whatsoever
      </p>
      <p>
       The PA Flight 93 crash had zero recognizable debris whatsoever

       No, I'm not a "no planes" believer ... just have questions about where the remnants of the planes are
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 2 crashes with the towers, it's a little easier to let it go about the plane debris because there was so much debris including 110 floors worth of contents along with all the steel and concrete
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to the Pentagon and Flight 93 in Pennsylvania it's harder to dismiss
      </p>
      <p>
       In PA, there was a hole in the ground with no debris, this doesn't seem possible and is not consistent with what has happened with any other plane crash
      </p>
      <p>
       Some think flight 93 was shot down, I'm open to that but still want to know where the debris is, especially the engines
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of the Pentagon, I have a lot of questions
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, the debris again ... where is it ?
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane supposedly flew into the building and went through 3 of the rings but there is no debris. I would think the building would almost "catch" the plane like a spider web catching a bug trying to fly through it
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there is no scarring in the grass field in front of the building from the engines scraping the ground and no damage to the areas on either side of the hole where the wings would have crashed into it and again no engines
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a "no planer" but the simple questions I have seem like something that can easily be addressed by the authorities or the people that believe the official account but the questions have not been answered
      </p>
      <p>
       My approach to conspiracies is to ask questions, rather than to make statements that I cannot support with facts

       Most of the time when a plane crashes, the pilots are driving it directly into the ground at top speed as well, that tends to produce smaller piece of debris rather than the wide "scatter" you'll see in most plane crashes (which happen and lower speeds and where pilots try to mitigate the impact).
      </p>
      <p>
       Same for the Pentagon. You're used to seeing plane crashes in movies or situations where the plane isn't being deliberate driven into the ground/building at near top speed. At those speeds, an impact will pulverize a plane so you don't get big chunks of wreckage.

       Makes sense. I hate the word conspiracy and prefer critical thinking... however can I ask a more existential question?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the point trying to find answers to things not one person will have the ability to do anything about, or change. For my questions sake, let’s assume it was all set up. The people that would have the power to do this are untouchable. So, what is the point to stress and dissect this information. Is there ever a resolution?
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask as someone probably as curious as you and others on this sub. Certain people; often referred to as the dumbed down masses etc... do you ever think they just have a better situation without even caring or worrying to stop and consider other possibilities? It seems easier and less stressful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rabbit holes I can find myself down can be so depressing and dark... if the accessibility to information like this, does nothing except depress one’s outlook on humanity- what is the real point? Why do we all want these answers so terribly, when we can all admit we will never know the real truth to any of these things 100%.. and evil atrocities have been a mainstay of humanity for thousands of years. What is the point? If nothing can be done to really spark any real change.

       Sounds like we agree this will never get sorted out and that if this is some evil plot that the people involved are untouchable, so what's the  point

       I suppose, what I hope for is to create awareness and to have people open their eyes so the next time something like this happens (any false flag operation) "the people" will ask questions and demand answers to specif questions in a timely fashion

       I'm not going to go on and on, my point is if we went through the threads we could easily put together dozens of very good questions, this should have been done within a few weeks of the actual event, not 17 years later

       The problem is that, the real answer to “what do we do about it” is extremely scary and it’s much easier to just turn a blind eye to it and accept it and enjoy the “comfort and stability” we are accustomed to, even if it means allowing things like this to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing to do about it would be a complete revolution or coup against the Zionist regime we call our government, but because of the comfort so many citizens enjoy, no one wants to sacrifice everything in order to change things and bring justice to the sick people who are responsible. It’s easier to just blame it on the Muslims and live in the illusionary bubble.

       " Even if someone can dismiss the 2 World Trade Towers and not being able to find plane parts (which of course is ridiculous) how can they dismiss this for the Pentagon and Pennsylvania "crashes" ?? "
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't. However, plenty of parts were found at the Pennsylvania and Pentagon crash sites. Some parts had serial numbers matching the original aircraft. All the passengers were eventually identified from dental records and DNA from body parts. Many personal possessions were recovered.

       If you want to doubt what happened that day, fine, but lack of airplane evidence is not a reason to do so.

       " If you saw the hole in the pentagon wall right after a plane was supposed to have hit it, the hole was round, 12 feet in diameter and on the ground floor and there was no wing damage whatsoever "
      </p>
      <p>
       You are correct, but, I'm pretty sure that the hole you are describing is the *exit* hole made in the C ring by a piece of landing gear. That mistake has been going around for sooooo long, and it has been corrected many times, but somehow keeps coming back.

       "The PA Flight 93 crash had zero recognizable debris whatsoever "
      </p>
      <p>
       It's true that there wasn't much recognizable debris on the surface right around the crash site, but plenty of debris was found and identified. See the previous link again. Remember that in most crashes, pilots are trying to *avoid* crashing. In this case, the pilots were attempting to crash, which makes a big difference in what the end results look like.

       Everything is wrong here, this man says the decision was made to "pull" or manually destroy the building which would mean that the building was already rigged with explosives

       I am with you on not accepting the official explanation while at the same time not being able to say what might have really happened. I think the Truthers are a very broad group of people and many of their strongest doubts are based on fact. Bring up those facts with an ordinary person and they react like you're making shit up, even though they're a matter of putin c record. It's weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, a quick search I did on YouTube a few months back turned up a multitude of videos purporting to show a hologram plane crashing into the tower. I just thought,
       <em>
        Ffs, this is exactly why people don't take legit doubts about 9/11 seriously
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said all that I am pretty resigned to the fact that anyone who was capable of engineering 9/11 as a cover up or conspiracy will be very good at covering their tracks, so the chances of catching them out are slim. But that doesn't mean people should stop looking for that smoking gun or incriminating leak.

      </p>

       When it comes to my doubts about the events of 9/11, I never state what happened (because I don't know) but I do ask questions
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple questions like why is there no damage to the lawn in front of the Pentagon from the plane engines
      </p>
      <p>
       Where are the plane engines
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is there no damage to the Pentagon building where the wings would have hit it
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is there no plane debris
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the hole in the building smaller than the plane ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are there no videos of an incoming plane other than the video from the guard shack when this is the most secure building in the world and there are 100s of cameras
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did the FBI confiscate the security tapes from surrounding buildings
      </p>
      <p>
       Why 17 years later has no other footage been released
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple questions like those ... I think where conspiracy theorists aka concerned citizens lose their potential audience is by making things too complicated or too far fetched

       Agreed, piling on all sorts o conjecture about who might have been behind 9/11 or their motives for it seems kind of beside the point when there are plenty of legitimate holes in the story that could be looked at directly. The answers to the questions of whodunnit and why tend to come out on their own, whenever seemingly innocuous discrepancies are investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I right in thinking George Bush Jr. blocked all such investigations with some sort of law at one point? At any rate, I've always found the paper trail to be the most worrying aspect of 9/11, and I do think that a simple order to investigate the claims of financial wrongdoing around the WTC attack would go much further toward solving the mystery. "Follow the money" remains a popular phrase with investigative journalists for a reason...

       For those of you who doubt... I understand your doubt. It's hard to imagine that the people we are told to put our trust in, that they would fabricate such a bold lie and with so many people in on the lie - how could this be possible?

       Actually, I don't think you understand why most people doubt the vast bulk of 9/11 conspiracies. It has nothing to do with "people we are told to put our trust in..." or Santa Claus. I suspect most adults realize that virtually all politicians lie, cheat, and manipulate. We doubt because we saw what we saw. We doubt because the explanation that came out makes a lot more sense to us than the bulk of the 9/11 conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find the 9/11 conspiracies fascinating and have been investigating them since they began popping up shortly after the event itself. Yes, many conspiracies raise interesting questions. They also rehash the same wrong data over, and over and over. They cherry pick data like one observer's statements and ignore 50 or 100 other contradictory statements. They refuse to acknowledge data that doesn't fit. They give pure speculation equal weight to knowledgeable opinion. In fact, such speculation has been repeated so often that many theorists state it as known fact. They confuse separate incidences and mix things together. (Case in point: The Dancing Israelis. The actual newspaper reports say that the women who observed them thought it was odd that the group was smiling while taking pictures of themselves with the burning WTC in the background. Not celebrating. Not dancing. Yes, there were other reports of Muslim people elsewhere in the world celebrating, but these were not the same things, yet somehow the story of the Dancing Israelis was created and now is talked about as if it were fact among the conspiracy community.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If theorists really want to change people's opinions, they need to do some policing of their own. Criticize theories that make no sense at all. (Judy Wood's magic disintegration ray. That Russian guy's magic nuclear demolition. Or the hologram airplanes.) Use all the facts, observations, photos, and videos, not just cherry pick the few that work. Acknowledge how much is speculation and how much is fact. Give well thought out justification to motives, not just talking-point hand-waving. (Get us into war! Except there are far easier ways to do that without risking being hung as a traitor. Take our liberties! Really? Pat downs at the airport justifies the risk of being hung as traitors?) A strong risk reward analysis results gives legitimacy to motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you really want to sway the doubters, don't fall back on completely unfounded, condescending  claims like, "We all know the reason they won't agree with us because it would shake their world view to the core." Uhm, no. Some don't agree with you because your argument isn't convincing to them. Make it convincing.

       I've obliquely answered your question in another response, and I'm not going to do another long post at this time, but the short answer is that I have looked at *all* the evidence and *all* the questions and I find the official way more convincing at this time. Of course, if I ignored, or was unaware, of a lot of the story/evidence/etc, I might feel differently.

       Fair enough. Can I get your take on some of the inconsistencies of the damage between the Twin Towers and the Pentagon? Secondarily, does it bother you that the passports were found undamaged in both NY &amp; Shanksville even though the entirety of the planes were swallowed by all targets?

       I'm not sure what you mean by "inconsistencies of the damage", so I'll move to the second question.

      <p>
       First, I *am* surprised, but then, stuff does survive explosions. If the only things found were the passports, that would seem pretty suspect, but that was not the case, especially for Shanksville.

Then there were keys, books, gift cards, letters, photographs, compact discs, pens, medallions... Some of the shoes were badly mutilated, disturbing evidence of the violence to which they'd been subjected. There was a length of electrical cord, a crumpled cigarette lighter, eighteen toenail clippers in various states of mangling. There were many snapshots of children, most painstakingly glued back together...

       You are asking the wrong questions. Instead ask them to explain the financial aspects like the insider trading and stock tips, Gelitin Project, Rumsfeld, Silverstein, Saudi’s, Enron, etc. It’s easy to speculate the how and why of the physical evidence but the paper trail and political motives are harder to write off.

       I don’t think you explained why the official narrative suits you. So I will ask again. What about the official narrative makes sense to you? Can you explain to me how WTC 7 fell that day? Can you explain the lack of plane debris at the pentagon and the crash in Pennsylvania? These are my only two questions I ever ask people that believe the official narrative. No ill intent here I just am curious how you make sense of these anomalies.

       I have answered these questions over and over to others over the years. This is part of the frustration with conspiracy discussions. Answers get forgotten immediately, unless they are theorist talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was an entire NIST investigation into the cause of the collapse of WTC 7, because the event was so unexpected. There were computer models made. There were partial structural recreation models. There were fire/heat analyses. There were hundreds of engineers investigating every aspect of the event. And its all in the report. The summary is that fires started when debris hit WTC 7. After considerable time, the heat from the fires weakened the structural supports until first one, then more began to fail. Due to the unconventional design of WTC 7, this was enough to cause the entire core support structure to eventually fail. The central part of the building began to collapse, and then the outer part followed. All of this is in the report. Right down to the sequence of beams and girders that likely failed. (Watch the videos carefully, and you can even see it happening.) It seems to me that some members of the conspiracy community think that the investigation was some quick whitewash, but that simply isn't the case. Real people put in a lot of real time and effort to really understand what happened. Start with

       , and if you like take some time with the real report. I have.

      </p>
      <p>
       Lack of plane debris at the Pentagon? What about all the plane debris found inside the Pentagon, including parts with matching serial numbers? What about body parts matched to passengers by DNA? What about personal effects of passengers found inside the Pentagon? What about the 100 or so witnesses on record reporting they watched an airliner impact the Pentagon? This was all reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same goes for the Pennsylvania crash. Debris was recovered. All the passengers were confirmed by DNA from remains. Personal effects were recovered. See, your "lack of plane debris" is one of those well worn "talking points" of the conspiracy theory community which simply isn't true. See

       </a>
       for an extensive discussion that has been around for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your questions are examples of exactly what I was talking about. Focusing on some small, and often misconstrued, details while ignoring all the rest of the evidence. I am *not* saying that details that don't fit should be ignored; they should be questioned. (Which is what real investigators actually do. Look at the discussion of the couple of samples of WTC girders that show evidence of melt. It wasn't covered up by NIST, it was published. Similarly, look at the discussion of the trace radioactivity at the WTC site.) And I think there *should be* a conspiracy community that questions things that look out of place. However, that community should also make an honest effort at effective investigation. Accept legitimate answers and cross those questions off the list. Be just as skeptical of conspiracy theories as of mainstream theories. Recognize that there are plenty of "big name contributors" who are in it for personal "gain", whether money, notoriety, or personal obsession. And recognize that these personal motivations are often way more legitimate than the "talking point" motivations tossed about by the many on the conspiracy side without much real thought. (To get us into war! To take the oil! To take our liberties! Really? Did this hypothetical mechanism and the results *really* warrant the enormous risks and punishments (if caught) of this conspiracy? Especially when way safer mechanisms exist (WMDs anyone)? )

       It's a physical impossibility for the lower part of the asymmetrically damaged Building 7 to have naturally progressively collapsed in any way that could result in the symmetrical descent of a 105 foot section of the upper part of the building as a single unit straight down through itself (the path of greatest resistance) including a 2.25 second period of gravitational acceleration, which NIST concedes. "[T]he exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above" doesn't mean they dematerialized.  For the period of time that the upper part of the building fell as a single unit at gravitational acceleration, it cannot have been using any of its potential energy to crush the building components and contents.  The building was brought down with explosives.  All credit to the power of scientific reason, care of u/EmileCole

       I suggest to you that it was physically possible, since that is what happened. Well, sort of.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you say "progressively collapse" "through itself", it sort of sounds like you are using arguments from the WTC 1 and 2 collapse. In the case of WTC 7, the bulk of the building collapsed onto the smaller number of floors below the one or two floors primarily on fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       The straight down disbelief is an intuitive argument rather than a physics argument. Without a significant horizontal force, the building is going to fall straight down. Now the intuitive problem may be that when people think of tall things falling, they tend to think in terms of trees or poles. Trees and poles are *solid* and very tall compared to their cross-sectional area. Buildings are mostly empty space between the floors and are comparatively wide for their height. Although every support did not fail at the same time in the damaged floors, after the key supports failed, the others quickly followed suit. The only way the building would fall over is if some of the supports on one side failed and the ones on the other side remained completely intact. With WTC 7, the failures began more centrally, and as the failures grew, the load on the remaining supports quickly exceeded the support capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for symmetrical descent, sort of, but not completely. The core failed first, which can be seen in most videos. You can see the "penthouse" collapse downward before the outer part of the structure begins to fall. The internal structure also buckled to one side, rather than collapsing uniformly. The NIST model shows this pretty clearly. I know that many mock this aspect of the model, but if you find the one or two videos of the collapse that actually show more than the just the upper floors collapsing, you will actually see the buckling.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the collapse of WTC 7, the point of crushing/breaking (which is the point of damage) is pretty low. Most of the destruction is happening at the bottom of the building as most of the building falls into the broken part.  With WTC 1 and 2, the point of crushing is pretty high and progresses down the building with the collapse. Very different. Meanwhile, the whole "potential energy" argument completely overlooks the immense difference between the static force and the impact force. I've referenced
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZCFo3Lcbx8">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZCFo3Lcbx8
       </a>
       before. It shows a really clear example of this difference. The can in the video can hold around 100 pounds if the load is carefully placed. You can test this yourself. The hammer weighs only 10 pounds, and, as expected, the can can easily hold it. However, drop the hammer, from even a small height and the can is crushed. Again, you can test this yourself. The point is that the impact force is definitely more than 10 times the static force after only a foot or two. Once part of the building starts falling, there is no way the structure under it can withstand the force. (This is another way people's intuition, probably from experience with trees and poles fools them. Since the tree is solid, the ratio of structural strength to weight is orders of magnitude different from the case of a tall building.)

       Jumping to the claim of explosives doesn't answer the questions of where is the shock wave from the explosion. The firefighters reported signs of failure long before the collapse. The collapse clearly starts at precisely the floors with the maximum fire damage. A large number of investigators and engineers took a long time to analyse the collapse and wrote a very comprehensive report.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sometimes think that the conspiracy community thinks the primary purpose of the NIST investigation was to figure out if sabotage was involved; it wasn't. Sure, some sanity checks were done, but the real purpose was to determine if the unexpected and dramatic collapses were do to negligence in the building or design, and whether codes needed to be modified to avoid similar collapses.

       I just watched the video you linked. I can't see how a massive hammer dropped from a large height above a tin-can in any way resembles a building collapsing. Wouldn't it make far more sense to show how the tin-can could itself collapse symmetrically at free fall? If you could show that I'd be impressed!

       The experiment is designed to give an appreciation for 1 thing: the significance of impact force. This seems to be one of primary places where intuition leads us astray when we look at the WTC collapses, particularly 1 and 2. If the building had no problems holding up the upper stories for decades how could those same upper stories cause a complete collapse? If the building was over designed by a factor of 7, surely, those upper floors couldn't cause a complete collapse? The experiment demonstrates just how much greater the impact force is than the static force when the building is standing. (In this case, more than a factor of 10, with a fall of only 2 feet.) You describe the hammer dropping from "a large height", but when the supports failed in the WTC buildings, the upper portion fell more like 12 feet, considerably more than the hammer and can experiment.

       explains the principal. Take a look at the analysis. Look at the equations. Where does the composition or the objects come into play? Where does the relative size of the objects come into play? It doesn't. Only the forces matter.

       I think the reason that conspiracies are called nuts is because there are some nuts that make crazy accusations with no real proof. All you have to do is look on this sub. Also a lot of the 9/11 videos contradict or skip information to make there case. Or instead of saying that you can’t explain what happened they say that this definitely happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some conspiracy people are like extremists that say crazy things and since they say them the loudest,  that’s what people think of when they hear conspiracy.

       I’m saying Alex Jones is used as a patsy to compare anyone that questions the official US govt narrative to. I gave those as two examples of conspiracies that get conflated. The earth is most assuredly round lmao. What if I told you, you can question official narratives without believing every conspiracy theory.

       Came here for this as I was showing my 8yo daughter the footage this morning and now I have some questions and thoughts I would appreciate some feedback on.
      </p>
      <p>
       9:00 When LBJ is being sword in on AFO who is the creepy guy with the shit eating grin in the background?
12:00 TF do they mean by "theater war"?
17:00 wait...what? Bin Laden didn't take credit? OMG they got to me!
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we know there were actual planes involved in the Pentagon and flight 93? Did anyone actually see the planes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Other WTF thoughts I learned for the first time:
      </p>
      <p>
       They were conducting "war games" specifically w/planes flying into WTC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flight 93 and Pentagon plane completely disappeared?
      </p>
      <p>
       White smoke at base of WTC before it collapsed.
Violent ejections of smoke can be seen shooting out of floors below collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secret service would have picked up the President and taken him to safety under "normal" circumstances.

       7 World Trade center was definitely a controlled demolition, NIST states "due to office fires". Only this inconsistency should wake people up. And then Barry dies mysteriously after telling his story, which included explosions.

       Are there any documentaries which cover the official story as well as the theories? Like put them against each other and come up with a ELI5 explanation in the video?
      </p>

       All I find are just one sided documentaries which clearly wont point out any evidence to the other side.

       I appreciate the response and I'll watch that when I get a chance. Don't believe I've seen that one before. I have just been struggling to find a video that isnt all tinfoil hat like or bashing conspiracies about it. A neutral video would be great.

       The video claiming video fakery?  And you're calling him a kook. Genius, this happened in broad daylight in front of masses of people. F-off with the disinfo bullshit. 911 Truth is based on hard facts and basic physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, there is lots of propaganda, exactly like no planes bullshit youre spreading here.. Its goal is to associate 911 truth with loony conspiracism. This is true of all no planes nonsense. The pentagon is a usual target of this bs, but the evidence speaks for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       See Wayne Coste's monumental analysis of it, narrated by David Chandler. Or Chandler's own much shorter analysis
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpge3e_4_Ho">
        Going Beyond Speculation
       </a>
       Or Jim Hoffman paper:
       <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/pentagon/">
        The Pentagon: What the Evidence Shows
       </a>
       and this paper is not 12 years old. The reality that all no planes claims are intended to undermine 911 Truth.

       The problem with what you are seeking is that anyone from the "official narrative" side of the equation that would be in a position to have any type of credibility will not entertain the idea because it will give credibility to the people on the "conspiracy" side

       Shes alleging the towers were destroyed in conjunction with a new directed energy weapon that 'dustified' the structures. You can see even as solid metal beams fall they seem to disintegrate into dust. Thats why the city was just covered in dust and there seemed to be so much debris missing from the collapses.

        just listen to this
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       She comes up with this "dustification" yet cannot even articulate a conceptual basis by which this process might happen. "Energy Beams" "space beams" seems legith.. lol
      </p>
      <p>
       You dont need to dig that deep. The evidence proving the demolition of the towers and Building 7 is not complex or a long list or ambiguous in any way.

       This is a very extensive documentary called "A new pearl harbor". It not only covers the official story and the conspiracy claims, but it also delves into the "debunkers" counter claims and rebuttals to those as well.

       Of course the governments explanation is going to seem real. It took over 6 years for the report to come out. Do you realize that no other Sky scraper  or large building has ever been completely demolished or fallen like that in history. ever.

       I wouldn't say that I am closed minded at all. I can entertain and accept many viewpoints. In this case though it is extremely unlikely that any other explanation could be the case. Any evidence provided is generally provided by suspicious sources or people who explain logic in terms of A to B and then skip to F. As interesting as it may seem the evidence and the logic just isn't there in this case. I have watched most of the docs about the topic and they all are full of holes or misrepresented facts or rumors. After all this time it ends up being a hollow argument. In so many years you would think that there would be one reliable claim, but no.

       I don’t think the bombs are too far fetched at all. Theres pictures of boxes. Theres reports of levels being cleared out weeks and months before by mysterious teams. Theres hundreds if not thousands of claims of second explosions from firefighters inside the twin towers. Theres almost no footage of Shanksville and the Pentagon. You really think the Pentagon got hit by a 757?

       All physical evidence at the Pentagon points to something the shape and size of a 757. You can argue whether or not it was Flight 77 (Though all evidence would suggest it was), but it was definitely a 757. Also, just because someone described a sound like a explosion, doesn't mean it was a bomb.

       Nice to see Dylan Avery make a tweet for 9-11 this year. Shame it's just a shared one and he's all about cryptocurrency these days. You can tell the guy is scared witless of the NWO fucking with him like they did Korey Rowe w/ the planted drugs. Massively feel for 'em both as independents and true patriots, they f***ed with people they didn't have the resources to fight back against.

       At 32:54 in the film, a camera focuses on some New York firemen, and then on one of the planes hitting the tower.  What was going on  there?  Who was filming the firefighters and why, and how did they know to pan the camera to catch the plane hitting the tower?

       My favorite thing about
       <em>
        Loose Change
       </em>
       is that it simultaneously turned off the mainstream person from giving a shit about 9/11 while also distracting the "woke" person from the simple and accepted truths that actors within our millitary/intelligence community started both the Vietnam and Iraq wars with outright damaging lies to both the general public and their elected representatives.  My favorite piece of illuminati propaganda ever produced - I don't think anything else has ever done it's job so well.

       The best thing that came out of Loose Change, besides being the first 9/11 doc I watched, was the interview with Barry Jennings, who was in the WTC7 "Bunker" and the story that followed where Dylan hired a PI to track him down before returning the money and telling Avery to never contact him again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Barry Jennings died in a hospital under mysterious circumstances a week before the NIST WTC7 Final Report was released in which there was Zero testimony from Jennings or Michael Hess about explosions in the WTC7 Stairwell before the planes had hit either tower.

        Factual Evidence Contradicts the 9/11 Story
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The official account of the events of September 11, 2001, has been used:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        to justify the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which have resulted in the deaths of over a million people;
        <a href="http://www.consensus911.org/the-911-consensus-points/#N_1">
         [1]
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        to authorize torture, military tribunals, and extraordinary rendition; and
       </li>
       <li>
        to suspend freedoms guaranteed by the American Constitution such as
        <em>
         habeas corpus
        </em>
        in the USA, and similar freedoms in Canada, the UK, and other countries.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The official claims regarding 9/11 are contradicted by facts that have been validated by a scientific consensus process, and which include the following points of “best evidence”.

        SGTreport BOMBSHELL: METHODICAL DECEPTION -- Rebekah Roth
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Former flight attendant turned researcher, truth teller and author Rebekah Roth joins me on the 14th anniversary of 9/11 to discuss her new book 'Methodical Deception', the follow up to her very popular first book 'Methodical Illusion'. Both books are available at
        <a href="http://www.methodicaldeception.com">
         www.methodicaldeception.com
        </a>
        In this interview Rebekah drops some bombshells that prove not only that 9/11 was a false flag event long in the planning, but that the operation leads directly back to companies and intelligence assets deeply rooted in and connected to the state of Israel. In fact, some of the information shared in this remarkable interview is so critical for every American to understand that if you don't want to listen to the full interview, at least make sure you fast forward to the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdP95oSoOFk&amp;amp;t=1880s">
         31:20
        </a>
        mark. Because as Rebekah says, "This is the elephant in the room that nobody wanted to talk about." The pictures you will see and the information you will hear may well shock you to your core. Share it with your friends and family. Every single American citizen should know the truth about what happened on 9/11 and the months leading up to it - and who the REAL culprits were.

        the Speaker meant to say:  '...The white plane came in on a diagonal North [of CITGO gas station and North of Navy Annex] path...', rather than on a 'South path.'  More generally, though the two Pentagon heliport firefighters saw a low-flying white plane diagonally approaching on their left, they were sufficiently North of the centerline of the West face that the path of the plane itself was to the North of the Navy Annex and CITGO gas station, not to the South of them.  For a more detailed discussion of the accurate interpretation of North-path witnesses' testimonies, see 1;39;45 to 1;42;35 into the Speaker's presentation at the Washington, D.C. 9/11 Conference held at the Pentagon Sheraton Hotel, Sept. 15, 2013, at

        National Security Alert - The 9/11 Pentagon Event
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2006 Citizen Investigation Team launched an independent investigation into the act of terrorism which took place at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.  This exhaustive three-year inquest involved multiple trips to the scene of the crime in Arlington, Virginia, close scrutiny of all official and unofficial data related to the event, and, most importantly, first-person interviews with dozens of eyewitnesses, many of which were conducted and filmed in the exact locations from which they witnessed the plane that allegedly struck the building that day.  Be forewarned: Our findings are extraordinarily shocking and frightening.  They are also deadly serious, and deserving of your immediate attention.  This is not about a conspiracy theory or any theory at all.  This is about independent, verifiable evidence which unfortunately happens to conclusively establish as a historical fact that the violence which took place in Arlington that day was not the result of a surprise attack by suicide hijackers, but rather a false flag "black operation" involving a carefully planned and skillfully executed deception.  If you are skeptical of (or even incensed by) this statement we do not blame you.  We are not asking you to take our word for it, nor do we want you to do that.  We want you to view the evidence and see with your own eyes that this is the case.  We want you to hear it directly from the eyewitnesses who were there, just as we did.  Please understand that this information is not being brought to your attention simply for educational purposes.  It is presented within the context of a "call to action" accompanied by a detailed step-by-step strategy intended to inspire and empower you to do something about it.  But first, please familiarize yourself with the evidence by viewing and paying close attention to the 81-minute video presentation, National Security Alert.  Thank you for your concern and thank you for your action.

       I watched "Behind the Smoke Curtain" once a while ago. At the time I had a whole list of factual and logical inconsistencys I wrote down while watching it, which I sadly can't find now. I do remember major problem really early on, however.

       She tries really hard to make 9/11 comparable to Pearl Harbor, and the first point she uses is that they were both "Surprise attacks by Kamikaze aircraft". The first Kamikaze attack was in late 1944 while Pearl Harbor was in 1941.
      </p>
      <p>
       While there was one plane intentionally crashed into a target on Pearl Harbor, it was a badly damaged plane with no hope of returning to it's carrier. The pilot also had stated his plan to do this if his plane was damaged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, it's astoundingly bad research on Miss Honegger's part to misrepresent a part of history that is so widely documented. Sadly this level of research permeated the rest of the lecture.

        Professor Graeme MacQueen on the 2001 Anthrax Deception
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This recent 2016 interview features Professor Graeme Macqueen speaking about a rarely discussed aspect of the 9/11 attacks. The  letters sent to U.S. legislators and media people which contained a weaponized form of anthrax, and ended up killing five individuals.  MacQueen explains his perspective that the anthrax letter attacks were part of the same operation as the 9/11 attacks themselves, the motives being to promote passage of the PATRIOT ACT and provide a propaganda ploy for enabling the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.   The discussion moves to the decision to try to pin the blame on a 'lone wolf' perpetrator within the US military industrial complex, the bridge with the 9/11 perpetrators and then more recent developments since the publication of the book.  Professor Graeme MacQueen is author of The 2001 Anthrax Deception: The Case for a Domestic Conspiracy. Published by Clarity Press.

       People are that way in general. We accept the reality that is presented to us. The mere idea that one's belief systems have not been vetted, and if done to its completion, one might have what one might call a direct experience of reality (seeing things as they are) is a foreign one to many. Not so much to a Buddhist or to religious traditions that strive towards a clear, enlightened mind rather than worship a deity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mental process of which you speak is rampant among people who accept official reports, stories, and rumors as truth, as well as people that are named "conspiracy theorists." This mental process goes deep, as even unvetted belief systems about the self are held. Beliefs that are just as much stories as anything anyone can tell you. There have been people who have used logic and reason to become illuminated or enlightened in this regard, as opposed to meditating for 40 years. Some just eat a mushroom or LSD and come away with the same clear mental state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some watch Loose Change for the first time and perhaps just one detail in it wakes up something in their mind, gets them thinking. They realize they've spent their whole lives accepting stories about reality, about themselves.
       <em>
        Creating
       </em>
       stories about reality and themselves and believing them hook, line, and sinker.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of these events with official stories that defy logic, people will start to investigate, things are uncovered, but confirmation bias does come into play, as does the desire to be part of a group. Any beliefs or information presented that doesn't fit the belief system of the group is seen as a threat. People with the information are labeled things like "lone-nutters", "conspiracy theorist"  etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is so rampant among the general population, that one almost has to believe it's a built-in biological instinct. But once one experiences undifferentiated reality for the first time, one then knows and sees that humanity is asleep under a hypnosis of belief systems, and it's actually an accepted habit of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to approach such events as 9/11 is to start with logic. There are hypotheses that I've read that have no logic, but I still enjoy them as a study. It's part of the rabbit hole so-to-speak. I allow others to believe them and I don't apply a label to them like "no-planers." For if I did, I would be cutting off interesting thought that might lead somewhere, might not. Maybe someone who believes there were no planes and that they were added into the video later or that they were holograms is actually on the path to real discovery. A detail they discover leads to something highly logical and that can't be debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a state of mind one can be in which is beyond belief systems, labels, and resistance to "what is?" Can I investigate using logic and reason, and allow others the freedom to do it in their way and to offer ideas and not have the ideas be treated as threats to my own? Allow them their thoughts and expression without marginalizing them, labeling them, and buying into an illusion of separation between myself and my own experience of them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would this not be inner peace?

       You're right, the origin is almost never sinister. The problem here is once big money is involved, things usually take a dramatic turn. A lot of character ends up getting lost due to profits being put over making the best quality content possible and trying to push the envelope. This doesn't always happen, but unfortunately happens far too often.

       I wouldn't say that I am closed minded at all. I can entertain and accept many viewpoints. In this case though it is extremely unlikely that any other explanation could be the case. Any evidence provided is generally provided by suspicious sources or people who explain logic in terms of A to B and then skip to F. As interesting as it may seem the evidence and the logic just isn't there in this case. I have watched most of the docs about the topic and they all are full of holes or misrepresented facts or rumors. After all this time it ends up being a hollow argument. In so many years you would think that there would be one reliable claim, but no.
