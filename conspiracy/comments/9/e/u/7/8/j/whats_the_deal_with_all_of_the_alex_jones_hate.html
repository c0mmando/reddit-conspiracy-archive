The guy has done more than anyone to expose false-flags and other government on corruption and he was right there exposing the false-flags that were taking place in Syria and now he&#39;s doing all he can to fight internet censorship.   </p>

<p>I see the odds that he&#39;s a CIA disinformation agent to be literally less than 1 percent. </p>

<p>If you wanted to argue that Jones doesn&#39;t know as much as people think and that he&#39;s off the cuff a lot then I&#39;d definitely agree... But come on, this idea that he&#39;s there to purposely misinform people? I&#39;d say anyone that believes that isn&#39;t paying close enough attention to him.  </p>

<p>Let me be clear, I don&#39;t believe everything he says, far from it. I&#39;d say I&#39;d agree with him about 65 percent of the time, which is a lot better than maybe about the 15 percent that I believe from mainstream news.   </p>

<p>I mean I&#39;ve been watching him on and off for over 15 years and there&#39;s definitely a lot that I don&#39;t agree with, but I don&#39;t fault him for that.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re grasping at straws brother. The guy is completely self-made. He&#39;s gotta make money some how. Sure, his products are overpriced, but he&#39;s running his own show. He&#39;s answering to no one. That I think should be a comfort to most of us.   </p>

<p>Sure, Alex is entertainingly nutty sometimes, but so what? Why should any forward thinking person be worried about &quot;being lumped in&quot; with him? What are we, high schoolers?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nutty sometimes, but so what?  That’s a good way to absolutely prevent any common guy sucked into debt up to his eye balls trying to bring up a family to say, “I don’t like where this message is leading, luckily there’s a convenient way for me to pull the truth ejection rip cord and pull the fuck out, so I don’t have to be exposed to what is really going on”.

    <div class="md"><p>So what, you expect Alex to cater to the brain-dead sheeple?  That&#39;s just not who Alex is.  Alex can&#39;t be all things all the time.   </p>

<p>Just because his presentation is far from perfect and isn&#39;t as wide-ranging as some would like, doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s all a conspiracy to mislead people... That&#39;s just looking for a conspiracy where there isn&#39;t one.  </p>

<p>And look, if someone better came along that really  blew the lid off things, I&#39;d be all for it... But take a guy like Rogan, he used to ruffle a lot of feathers, and now anytime any sort of hard-hitting government topics come up he runs far away with the tail between his legs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We’re on the same side, and I know I’m not wasting my time.  How many people have you woke up with an Alex Jones...anything?  I have less than five, none of which were exposed to anything from him, but I learned quickly any reference to AJ, his videos, any of his content was pure kryptonite to opening people’s eyes.  That’s what we we want isn’t it? He is simply an enormous obstacle to attaining that, and it is by design.</p>

<p>I guess we might have different goals?  I want everyone to understand the world they live in.  I don’t need reinforcement in my own beliefs.  AJ does not in any way help accomplish this.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. I listened to AJ for a good chunk of time before picking up the pieces he consistently left out. He also had a tendency to talk over callers who were willing to fill in those gaps thus consistently acting as a gatekeeper to the truth.

<p>I absolutely agree with you, and I would say, for so many of the corporate social medias to hit him at the same time reveals the regime obviously had a preconceived plan to censor AJ and it included a psyops operation to attack his grass roots support by their familiar tactics of belittling and ridiculing en mass, those who spoke out against the censorship or supported him in any way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We’re on the same side, and I know I’m not wasting my time.  How many people have you woke up with an Alex Jones...anything?  I have less than five, none of which were exposed to anything from him, but I learned quickly any reference to AJ, his videos, any of his content was pure kryptonite to opening people’s eyes.  That’s what we we want isn’t it? He is simply an enormous obstacle to attaining that, and it is by design.</p>

<p>I guess we might have different goals?  I want everyone to understand the world they live in.  I don’t need reinforcement in my own beliefs.  AJ does not in any way help accomplish this.  </p>
