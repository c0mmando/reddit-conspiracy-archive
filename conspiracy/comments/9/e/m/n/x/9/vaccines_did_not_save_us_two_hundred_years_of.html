<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The  main advances in combating disease over 200 years have been better food  and clean drinking water.  Improved sanitation, less overcrowded and  better living  conditions also contribute. This is also borne out in  published peer reviewed research:</p>

<p>When you bring in context of clean drinking water, nobody is going to claim vaccines are more important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the argument here is that vaccines did not save us. That often means that the high death rates seen in the past did not improve because of vaccination programs but because of economic and societal improvement which is true.</p>

<p>Measles wasn&#39;t a major cause of disability or death before the vaccine was introduced, the vaccine did not increase of lifespan or disease burden in an significant way so it did not save us.</p>

<p>I am not sure if he or anyone said that they kept measles CASES down i think they said that DEATHS declined before the vaccine and other treatments were available.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do we have recent statistics that correlates the yearly rise of a disease in relation to its vaccine counterpart?<br/>
Is there a very recent (last five year or ten years for example) correlation graph showing the measles vaccine, total global inoculations and subsequent or corresponding disease outbreaks? Do other years match up? So if inoculation is 70% one year and 67% the following year is there always a trend the direction we’d expect i.e do the years with lower total inoculation always results in more disease outbreaks? </p>

<p>When looking at old studies, you have to be vary what field you&#39;re researching. Some fields like history or archeology you can often use old sources, because some of the older methods are relatively reliable. In other fields such as IT, or in this case epidemiology, the precision of your analysis is very much dependent on computational power and modern algorithms. I&#39;m not saying that they are necessarily wrong, what I&#39;m saying is that I would never use such an old study for this purpose. Especially because they can&#39;t take into account that the mortality kept declining: <a href="https://www.google.dk/search?q=life+expectancy+us&amp;amp;oq=life+expectancy+us&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.4543j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">https://www.google.dk/search?q=life+expectancy+us&amp;amp;oq=life+expectancy+us&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.4543j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8</a> </p>

<p>Which of course can&#39;t be contributed to a continous decline in these infectious diseases, which at the point of the study only accounted for 6% of deaths. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ehh yea, I get the study. You&#39;re still not answering how this explains the CONTINOUS mortality decline. OP&#39;s claim is that his articles are refuting the effect of modern medicine in western life expectancy, and his article clearly can&#39;t account for what happened after 1973.</p>

<p>Our lifespan increased 8 years since 1950 of which almost certainly not all are due to medical advances and of couse even less vaccines. Since 1950 medicine added a few years to our life much of which we spend in a debilitated state. </p>

<p>Taking a lot of meds isn&#39;t the same as taking the right meds. The reason that other countries live longer is partly that they get the right amount of medicine. If you think that anyone believe that more pills = live longer, then you&#39;re wrong. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a strawman from your side. Now YOU are the one who says that I said that it&#39;s the only reason.

<p>Perhaps I didn&#39;t explain this. I think it&#39;s credible that medicine caused a lot of the later increases, I don&#39;t really disagree with you when it comes to this.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe for example that nutrition could explain this. </p>

<p>Also I am not saying that medicine is worthless or not helpful.</p>

<p>but if you look for the main reason why our lifespan nearly doubled then you will find that the main reasons were nutrition,  clean water, hygiene and economic improvement not medical advances.</p>

<p>So, just to recap: medically trained doctors and scientists developed Germ Theory and figured out the causes (and by extension preventative measures) for many of the deadliest diseases humanity had suffered from, and that&#39;s definitely <em>NOT</em> a &quot;medical advance.&quot;</p>
