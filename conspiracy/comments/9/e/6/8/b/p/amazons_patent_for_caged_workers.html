       Pretty creepy 2016 patent for workers in a cage, operating a robot arm. Yes, one can say the cages are to protect the worker from a malfunctioning arm,  but with Amazon's track record you know that person would be trapped in a cage probably worth a urine jug for 12 hours at a stretch.

       The article states that Amazon 'has not implemented the device nor has any plans to' - but I guess it's just good business to submit patents for worker cages 'just in case' or to sell/rent out the concept to other companies.

       If that's the case, then they have to be keyed in and out by a supervisor probably, every time they need to leave the cage for something. That's going to be an extreme hazard in a fire or other emergency situation, which might be why they haven't implemented them yet. Still, all I can think about is the sad little bench with the joystick and a screen and how this is like lab testing for animal that's going to be an extreme hazard in a fire or other emergency situation, which might be why they haven't implemented them yet. Still, all I can think about is the sad little bench in the cage with a joystick and a screen.  We house and treat the lab chimps  that we use for intelligence experiments better.

       I doubt it will be keyed on the outside that would be a huge fucking Osha no no. I'm sure the door openings would be logged, essentially trapping a person in there.

       If he wants to say amazon should pay workers more? I agree. But he didn’t. He related 2 unrelated things for the purpose of shoehorning Amazon wages into a discussion about curbing theft with a very illogical statement that can be disproven in seconds on google, then attempted to side step my questions when I called him out. And now you’re defending him lmao...

       No, but the job is "white" collar. As in you don't need to worry about getting anything (like the collar on his shirt)  dirty, because your hands are always clean. IE. Desk/office job.
      </p>
      <p>
       A "blue" collar worker has his hands dirty
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       of the time, so stopping to make sure your collar stays white really eats up time. Why not use blue to mask any marks?

       I've seen a similar device in action, with a plexiglass cage for protection. They could leave to use the restroom at any time, and usually preferred working there for their ten to twelve hours (it was the easiest job in that department). As for hours, they work four ten hour days. During "seasonal peak, they work six tens or five twelves. Anyone who's worked walmart during the holidays can tell you this is easy money in comparison. No conspiracy here that I can see.

       Bullshit. You're reaching. The majority of adults must do this soul draining work to make ends meet. You're actually in the minority if you have a college degree you can actually use, though the podium you're speaking from is more likely located in Mom's Basement Tavern of the Virgin Imagination. Sounds like you're in the minority trying to speak for the majority. The crazy part? You can't make art workout soul draining work like this. Now the inventory side of things is fucked. You have shown no credentials even after they were requested. No research was shown, even after it was requested. No evidence was shown, even after it was requested. You couldn't keep a job at this company if your integrity depended on it. No wonder you're pissed lol

       Zing! A joke based on the fact that the 're dropped from my 'you' as I typed on a tiny fallible illuminated keyboard with large fingers. You win the entire argument sir, I am burned. What was I thinking posting an article to a conspiracy forum and saying how it made me feel about the future of warehouse worker isolationism. 
No, truly your grammar burn is the highest form of insult AND you have shown me the errors of my opinion with solid facts tinged with mockery and swearing. I yield. /s

       You essentially gave up with your projecting remark. Do I let you get the last word in simply because I know you're a big bitch, or do I try to lighten the mood with a little light humor? Either way you're going to leave this exchange feeling "burnt", so what obligation do I have to refute your single claim of me projecting? Seriously, what do I have to prove to
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       when my experience in the field was entirely overlooked in favor of you saying I'm projecting? You'd have gotten ignored, punked, or pummeled for your remarks if they were issued outside of the internet, depending on who you issued them to. Let's just say you're horse-shit at arguing, and you have the mentality of a goddamn baby, leaving nothing but mockery and swearing as suitable responses. You seem to think you're worth more than that, SO FUCKING ACT LIKE IT.

       Currently work for Amazon.  I make the least amount of money I've ever made hourly and they are now cutting hours so I'm not giving them a pass,  the richest in the world should pay fair wages... but
      </p>
      <p>
       The rumors of all the slave practices and having to pee in cup is so not not not not not true.  You heard stories of probably employees that just were too slow and wanted to try to keep their rates up and not get fired... but honestly anyone who works at a reasonable pace has a good rate (Items per minute) can go get water or pee WHEN EVER they want.   We don't even have to ask.  If we need a break because it's too hot or dehydration or have to pee, whatever... we can take it no questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to change Amazon we have to focus on the only real issue,  not just the stories of a slow employee not making rate trying to improve rate by peeing in a bottle.  Baseless argument

       Most people don't feel they do this as a means to stay on or ahead of schedule. I can only think of maybe truckers doing this in a pinch, but it's a lot harder for them to get off and on the road than for a warehouse employee to stop and go to a restroom. I'd also bet that a 'slow' Amazon employee is a fine employee in any other factory. I think the threat of pressure is on in these warehouses more for some reason.

       For those who don't know, many companies give bonuses to patents filed or patents issued (issued means the govt granted them).
      </p>
      <p>
       A group of my coworkers sit around once a month and BS ideas that we think may be able to be patented, regardless of if they are viable.  Project related patents are submitted with the project, but others can be pretty far out there.  Either way, the goal is to get something that the lawyers are willing to pen up and submit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more about, has anyone thought about this AND bothered to write it up and submit it.
