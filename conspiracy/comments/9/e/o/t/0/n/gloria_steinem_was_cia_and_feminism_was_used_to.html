       First and second wave feminism, the temperance movement and the suffragette movement are very different from what Gloria Steinem promoted in the 1960's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gloria Steinem was CIA and feminism was used to put a wedge in the family while at the same time drive down wages destroying the union movement with the addition of so many million workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feminism is the cause of much of the hardships of our common era. High divorce rates, stagnant wages,
      </p>
      <p>
       One man could at one time support a family of ten off of one wage. My grandfather worked for the railroad as a switchman and had enough to send three of his children, the ones who wanted to go, to college. And that's in the 1960's. This is now impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inflation and usury coupled with the destructive force of feminism have brought our once great nation to its knees.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are foolish enough to think women taking on the roles of men is liberation then you are very ignorant of situation. To think women need to be free by evening a wage is to ignore the reality of freedom. Freedom is self sufficiency.

       I am absolutely not "blaming women". I'm blaming the agenda to push women into the workforce I.e. feminism.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is wage slavery liberation? When one job used to suoport an entire family.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you think working class women didn't work before feminism then you have not studied the history of the situation.

       to befair, different religions and cultures have differing marraige beliefs. just because they live here doesn't mean they change philosophies, or cultural habits. note; i am not specifically talking about any group, there are rotten bits within every tree.
      </p>
      <p>
       a bit of anecdotal evidence... went to school in new england. in middle school, early nineties, there was a girl that belonged to one of the romani families that do paving on the east coast. she was a beautiful, sweet girl with big blue eyes and jet black hair. she wore expensive outfits from new york, but was very humble. her father found out she was "fraternizing" with boys in school. he shaved her head, sent her to school like that for about and month... and then she was pulled from school entirely. religious and cultural beliefs can be a motherfucker.

       He's not blaming women specifically. Not even sure how you come to that conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feminist ideology undermined the collective union between different activist organizations. People like Gloria Steinem were useful idiots for the system to subvert and undermine the solidarity of the counterculture and working class activists by making it about rich white girls and their right to wear bras or not.

       Absolutely. The suffragette movement and the temperance movement are not to be lumped in with the insanity that is "free bleeding" and third wave feminism.

       You say constitution.  Is that different then the Constitution of the United States?  Do you mean as originally written or as currently amended?

       No your statement does not answer to which version of the Constitution you are referencing nor does it, due to the use of constitution instead of Constitution, directly specify which one you are talking about.

       Nope.  Then you started a second subthread referencing the constitution.  You then failed to clarify which constitution you meant and went on a rather twisty path so as to leave it unclear as to what you meant.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that ignores your other unresearched comments you made which you still haven't retracted.

       Sure the CIA might have jumped in, like they jumped in on everything then, for control and damage; The Black Panthers, the Anti-Vietnam War movement, Feminism, Civil Rights organizations were huge targets.

       Your whole narrative rests on a misguided application of supply and demand as being a determinant of wages, and weaving a tale where an increase in supply of workers brings down wages.  In the real world, this is not how this works.  Wages are moments of class struggle and are determined on how strong the working class is in its bargaining power.  Inclusion of women into early militant labor movements was one of the reasons why we got the eight hour working day, the weekend, and higher wages.   To grasp the role women played in the early labor movement, we need to grasp a few facts about their participation, prior to WW2.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        By the 1880s wage work for many women was a fact of life. From 1870 to
1910 the proportion of women "engaged in gainful occupations" steadily
increased from 14 percent to over 20 percent. This general figure, however,
masked the specific importance of women's work for particular communities
or industries. In some areas, few if any women worked outside their own
homes, while elsewhere the figures far exceeded the national average. In 1880,
for example, women constituted 26 percent of Philadelphia's workers, 34
percent of the workers in Fall River, Massachusetts, and 35 percent of the work
force in Atlanta, Georgia. Women's work-force participation depended largely
on local employment opportunities. Areas with major concentrations of textile
mills or clothing industries employed the largest numbers of women. In Philadelphia
women made up 46 percent of the city's textile industry while in Fall
River the figure approached 50 percent. Except for two textile cities, Lowell
and Lawrence, Massachusetts, Atlanta had the highest percentage of employed
women because of exceptional numbers of domestic servants, most of whom
probably were black. In contrast, centers of heavy industry such as Chicago or
Pittsburgh held fewer opportunities for women's employment. In Chicago
women constituted only 19 percent of the work force, 42 percent of them
working as servants and another 34 percent in the clothing industry. Clearly
the significance of women's work varied according to local circumstances.
Nonetheless, in particular communities and specific industries, women's
wage work had become a central feature of Gilded Age life.
