<p>Even in the past few months the internet censorship has began to completely purge whole swarths of information that I once thought I was somehow enlightened by having the chance to learn. The realization of the illusion we live in, what makes it keep revolving, and who are the groups who have historically disenfranchised the poor and weak of the world. </p>

<p>YouTube has systematically changed, and with the growth of power, coupled with a serious monopolistic hold on the market, we have lost that free speech that we had taken for granted to begin with.</p>

<p>All of this will most likely fall upon blind eyes, but that’s one thing the early days of this sub taught me. You must seek truth in spite of the lies. When the worlds seems at its worst is exactly the time when people need to fight for the common good. Truth will be brought to the light, forever and always. </p>

<p>With all that being said, I want this post to serve as a jumping-off point for truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gloria Steinem was CIA and feminism was used to put a wedge in the family while at the same time drive down wages destroying the union movement with the addition of so many million workers.</p>

<p>Feminism is the cause of much of the hardships of our common era. High divorce rates, stagnant wages, </p>

<p>One man could at one time support a family of ten off of one wage. My grandfather worked for the railroad as a switchman and had enough to send three of his children, the ones who wanted to go, to college. And that&#39;s in the 1960&#39;s. This is now impossible.</p>

<p>Inflation and usury coupled with the destructive force of feminism have brought our once great nation to its knees.</p>

<p>If you are foolish enough to think women taking on the roles of men is liberation then you are very ignorant of situation. To think women need to be free by evening a wage is to ignore the reality of freedom. Freedom is self sufficiency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely true. 1st wave feminism was the real deal. I do not was your post to take away from that. Yes they fought to be recognized as equal members of our communities. Right to vote and work if they so choose. The problem is that the next and following waves of feminism were not about equality anymore. Not they see themselves as victims when they no longer are, they are taught from a very young age that they need to be “self sufficient and indépendant” while chasing a career path. The problem is that not a big majority of the youth/young adults are depressed? Why is that? Well, it’s because what they have been told will make them happy goes against all of their instincts as a human woman, which is to care for their family, and nurture children into this world. Moment I became a parent everything changed, and you realize what a powerful unit the family is, the father protecting and providing while the mother nurturing and loving. This unit is indestructible, families stuck together, help each other, share the burden. This is why all these school shooters come from broken homes, the mother is out there working instead of being at home teaching and raising these children they end up lost in the system, with no father at home to discipline they run wild. </p>

<p>Women and men are equal, but we have different purposes and without one another both a father or a single mother are left trying to fill in the holes of the other missing parent, while working 1 or 2 Jobs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so cute the way a lifetime of rejection leaves the less reproductively fit amongst the fairer sex to spend their lives CAPS LOCK shouting at men on the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>YOU MEAN WOMEN ACTUALLY WANT TO BE TREATED WOTH REPECT </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Respect is earned, honey.  It is not something you can simply demand and receive.  This is but one of many &quot;full retard&quot; false assumptions that modern feminists live under.  You have no right to demand such a thing of anyone.</p>

<p>Your slit earns you nothing:  Deal with it.</p>

<p>You want respect?   Go out and earn it.</p>

<p>Just like men.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AND EQUAL TO MEN</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the fuck does this even mean?  Figure out how respect works first, then you can start pretending to know the first thing of equality.</p>

<p>Personally, I would love to see more equality between men and women.  Men are killed on the job at rates far greater than women.  Until you ladies are ready to roll up your sleeves and start pumping those numbers maybe just admit that you don&#39;t really know <em>what</em> you want.</p>

<p>I assure you, little darling, that equality to men ain&#39;t it.  </p>

<p>What you want is to be held up on a pedestal, and you&#39;re pissed that no one is dumb enough to put up with your shit and play along long enough to do so.</p>

<p>i dont trust this guy at all.  i think he is controlled opposition.</p>

<p>rp travels to rome like 50 times in a year. he was supporting the establishment of diplomatic ties with the vatican after 150 years. originally they were severed for being behind the assassination of abraham lincoln. rp supported ronald reagan, the first president inaugurated facing the giant dick. he is a freemason and they are infiltrated and controlled by the jesuits.. he is giving speeches at georgetown. he is also a 9/11 denier, protecting his masters</p>

<p>and whats the deal with rand paul carrying love letters between putin and trump. you cant get any more illuminati insider than that...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Red pill truths concerning the social engineering of men and women especially regarding gender roles are important topics. Go to r/theredpill for more on that one...I can&#39;t hand hold anyone whose going down that rabbithole but it is a trip we all men must take, but fuck me, we have to wake up and smell the social engineering dripping off every bit of media we consume concerning gender roles and inclusivity. It has turned feminism (which used to be about rights not privilege) into a hate group. r/theredpill helps with that!</p>

<p>Another topic I like is the &quot;white people aren&#39;t allowed to have a culture&quot; meme/ social engineering.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so cute the way a lifetime of rejection leaves the less reproductively fit amongst the fairer sex to spend their lives CAPS LOCK shouting at men on the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>YOU MEAN WOMEN ACTUALLY WANT TO BE TREATED WOTH REPECT </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Respect is earned, honey.  It is not something you can simply demand and receive.  This is but one of many &quot;full retard&quot; false assumptions that modern feminists live under.  You have no right to demand such a thing of anyone.</p>

<p>Your slit earns you nothing:  Deal with it.</p>

<p>You want respect?   Go out and earn it.</p>

<p>Just like men.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AND EQUAL TO MEN</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the fuck does this even mean?  Figure out how respect works first, then you can start pretending to know the first thing of equality.</p>

<p>Personally, I would love to see more equality between men and women.  Men are killed on the job at rates far greater than women.  Until you ladies are ready to roll up your sleeves and start pumping those numbers maybe just admit that you don&#39;t really know <em>what</em> you want.</p>

<p>I assure you, little darling, that equality to men ain&#39;t it.  </p>

<p>What you want is to be held up on a pedestal, and you&#39;re pissed that no one is dumb enough to put up with your shit and play along long enough to do so.</p>
