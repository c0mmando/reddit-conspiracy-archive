       So who wants to talk about the real reason we invaded Iraq? It damn sure wasn’t for oil. Have you seen the heroin epidemic steady booming? We invaded them for control of their poppy fields in order to increase the amount of crime and addicts stateside. Shit is wild and nobody wants to open their eyes to see it.

       It just seems like a lot more ppl are overdosing than there used to be. Maybe it’s just because I’m getting older but I never used to know (let alone hear about) anyone od, and now it seems pretty prevalent.

       The thing that's fucked up nowadays is that you'll find fentanyl in literally everything, not just heroin but in xanax, cocaine, etc. Which makes absolutely no sense because it gives you the opposite of the intended effect and nobody is gonna buy again from a dealer who laces shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why I feel like the CIA or whoever is randomly lacing pills and coke and stuff that they sell on the dark web with fent. No dealer would knowingly put fent in xans unless he is a total scumbag, but it seems totally likely that he could buy a thousand on the dark web and have like 5 of them be laced.

       No doubt but fentanyl giving the opposite effect of Xanax? Stimulants maybe but not benzos. I mean as long as the person doesn't die it's not a direct contradiction I know benzos are gabaergics while opiates effect dopamine and obviously the opiod receptors, but they are calming and downers as well.

       I think that is mainly ignorant dealers trying to hook people, or mixing bags up.
Maybe both, but i think what ibsaid holds relevance.
I met a guy in jail that was telling me about cutting bricks of heroin with fent, he was a cool guy, no reason to lie. He just got 10 years in prison.

       A lot of the OD's we're seeing are contributed to being cut with fent. I feel like that wasn't always a thing. Track the origins of this substance and I think more questions will be answered.

       That’s a huge reason. There was a huge spike when they started cutting it with fent. I mean there’s always been OD’s but nowhere near as many. And last couple years it’s been carfentanil(sp). That has people dropping like flies.

       What I find interesting is I use to be able to write opioids  like candy (I never have but I could have). Yet the death rate was low.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have heavy restrictions on what we can write, how often and at even challenged on the why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet Deaths are rapidly increasing.

       In a nutshell I think the government involvement is making the problem worse.

       Actually, it is a black swan effect coupled with latent raccism and overt classcism. White suburban kids from good families are od'ing now, not just urban junkies in flop houses and poor blacks on the lower east side (back when Manhattan was a shithole).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rate of addiction has not changed, it is still about 10%. The number of recorded od's has increased, but mostly because dead urban junkies are treated as dead garbage people, whose cause of death is of no interest. Also, junkies don't want to die, so they take measures to protect themselves. They don't shoot up alone, they have experienced junkies prep for them, their buddies have no qualms about dropping them off at the ER, and most of all they do not chase hot shots--heroine that is too pure (or now cut with things like stronger synthetic opiods). Dealers who get a reputation for hot shots get ostracized. If pure heroine starts flooding the streets, they get the word out, and hit the methadone clinics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sid Vicious was a classic example. Pure heroine had flooded Manhattan when he was let out but he didnt know, no one he knew was dealing due to the purity, he couldn't find his buddies, he was alone, and he took his normal strength. And he od'd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suburban kids chase hotshots, shoot up alone, don't have any experienced users to prep for them, everyone they know is terrified to call 911 out of stigma and taint, and their deaths are seen as tragic and are recorded and make the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems more prevelant now, because it has a sympathetic victim population. And because it is a really easy political stump speech point. No one is against saving white suburban kids from being junkies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of people who shoot up do not become addicts. You have to work at being an addict, most get over that bullshit pretty fast. Those "5 day" ads are the new "brains on drugs" ads. Most people prescribed opiods never finish their bottle. People who desperately need opiods for chronic pain are not junkies. They are perfectly functional, upstanding members of society, at least they were, many can no longer get their medicine and are basically invalids from pain now.

       I have fuck all sympathy to be honest.

       like you said it was definitely both. This is unfortunate. I use poppy pod tea from time to time and I have been doing so once a month for like 5 years without any increase or sign of addiction. I am very lucky that I have been able to control my usage of that, now alcohol that's a whole different story, but anyway I digress yes it's quite possibly both.

       Add rare minerals to the mix and we’re getting somewhere.  I’m so proud of the tribes in that part of the world, they don’t even recognize what passes for a national government much less the various foreign forces that periodically show up.  I can’t remember if the mongols actually held this part of the world. I hear that Alexander beat his way through, killed every man over 15 he could catch , sold everybody else into slavery and left after 18 months. He’s the only one who gets credit for “conquering “ the area known as Afghanistan.

       Yes, and the precursor to the ME conflict was Albania/Kosovo. Look where those Middle Eastern insurgents were trained, and marvel at the coincidence that the Albanian mafia shortly after that coup turned into the biggest peddlers of heroin throughout Europe (and sex trafficking but that's a whole other rabbit hole).
      </p>

       When you overlay the heroin gang activity with NATO's military involvement you can see too much overlap to dismiss as mere coincidence.

       oil and heroin are valuable byproducts, pipelines even more so, but i think, it is fundamentally, global social engineering at its core. i think that it was to create this huge influx of radicalized muslim refugees in the west in order to create a right wing white supremacist reaction - a global fourth reich, and also to create a wave of antisemitism in the west, forcing the jews back into israel and out of the western countries and possibly a new holocaust.  the zionists are partners in this with the powers that shouldn't be.  otoh the middle eastern countries that undervent regime changes (arab spring) got all their secular governments replaced with authoritarian theocracies and isis - a western/templar/jesuit terror organization - filled up the power vacuum.

       I used to think the mass immigration was a Zionist plot.  Fill the west full of the more religious, less tolerant Muslims.  Then radicalise them by infiltrating the mosques, fund, encourage and carry out terrorist atrocities, then create laws preventing anyone from criticising the Islamic faith (pressure cooker effect).
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought it was all being done purposefully.  If they could force the world to loathe and despise Muslims to the extent they could murder them, this would allow the huge expansion of Israel.  It would see a great biblical Israel, wealthy beyond belief with the entire middle Eastern oil reserves and huge natural resources within this area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, it all went on for too long.  In the UK at least, the hatred peaked around 5 years ago.  Now, the worst anyone really thinks of them is just apathy.  I haven't met anyone who hates Muslims for over a year.  It's actually having the opposite effect, I know more people becoming Muslims than opposing it.  If it was a Zionist plot, they fucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, there are people who don't agree with some Islamic beliefs, but not many think they are beyond redemption.  There is even some reform of Islam in Britain, and British Muslims are beginning to see themselves as different from sub Saharan  and Arabic Muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, there is now far more real mistrust of Zionism than Islam.  Even on Reddit and the Chans this is obvious.

       The heroin in the US is almost entirely from Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       Afghan heroin goes to Europe. And heroin is a problem here too (crack and meth are fairly irrelevant in exchange for speed and heroin). But there's no epidemic since that war.

       And nearly all of the fentanyl sold in America comes from China.

       Out in the west, east coast-midwest get more pure heroin rather than black tar.

       While not a heroin user myself, I work part time at a rehab and get a chance to talk to a lot of those that did.
      </p>
      <p>
       And from what I gather, the 'pure' stuff was mostly imported Mexico tar that was refined in country but again I can't verify it as 100% truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that state, it's more about bulk and it's a lot easier to get a pile of poppy sap in through a land border than shipping all the way from the middle east.

       Controlling Heroin funnels money into cia black arms trade which fights terrorists or something.

       In the 1980s the cia took over the cocaine trade to fight communism so follow the same blueprint.

       You can't just leave a 600 billion dollar a year drug trade uncontrolled. That's how you create warlords and super corporations

       Depends on who you ask.  Some say it's because they attempted to refuse the dollar for oil, some say it's because they slowed poppy growth, and others still will say it was to instill central banks in all these areas.  All are true, but the bigger picture was to help complete the Greater Israel Project.
      </p>
      <p>
       Create an organization and then officially label that organization a terrorist group.  Then send that group into an area you wish to invade and then invade it under the guise of attacking the group.  Destabilize the area.  Repeat in another area.  Eventually they will have the UN hand the security keys of the Middle East over to Israel.  This will complete their project.
