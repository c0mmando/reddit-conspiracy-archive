       It’s sick that they keep getting away with this. People need to ask themselves, how many people they know themselves that have died from gunshot wounds, stabbings, plane crashes, and “suicide”? These deaths are no coincidences.

       I'm 29. I've had a number of people close to me die in "suspicious" circumstances. One died at 18 from heart issues because she "forgot" to take her medication. Another died in a car accident straight out of Final Destination. One drowned in their pool during the middle of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could probably list fix or six more if I wanted to. People die and the circumstances don't always make sense. The older you get, and the more people you know, the larger that number will be.

       I can't recall many gunshot deaths in my circle. I had a middle school friend who was killed in a drive by that was supposedly intended for someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know a guy who was t-boned at an intersection while riding his motorcycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       ex boyfriend's dad was killed when a nurse gave him an "accidental overdose" of pain medications following surgery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two years ago a friend got hit by a train.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is pretty ridiculous that you don't believe deaths like these happen on a regular basis. I'm 29. She's 70-years-old and has doubtlessly known several times as many people that I have.

       No one in my circle, but I am going to say that most of the people in my circle fly much less frequently than the people in the Clinton's circle. Now car crashes, that's a different story. I can think of two dozen easy who have died in car accidents, and one in an ATV accident.

       Ron Brown was not part of any Clinton investigation, though he worked as Commerce Secretary under WJC. He was being investigated for corruption strictly performed during his duties (similar to Pruitt). The circular wound was never described as "bullet-like" in official documents, though it did mystify pathologists.

       The car didn't fail. She took a steep curve at an unsafe speed and rolled. Also, is a sign language interpreter and "important person?" It wasn't like she sat in on meetings. She literally was just an interpreter for public appearances.
