But genuinely I feel like, for example, I can sing along to a song in my head, shuffle a playlist then it’ll be the first song that comes up. Feels like this happens super often for it to be a coincidence. Or, I’ll remember a scene from a TV show or something, open the youtube app and it’ll be the exact scene I was thinking of. </p>

<p>Then there’s always the ads on facebook that come up when you talk about them, but a lot of the time I’m certain I haven’t spoken about whatever it is.</p>

<p>Anything in this or am I being overly paranoid about coincidences?</p>

They can cross reference this with every android user and predict that if you are thinking about X you will likely ask Y in the near future.  I notice it a lot when I&#39;m talking about movies with coworkers.  We&#39;ll say something like &quot;oh yeah the new batch, that&#39;s what the sequel to gremlins was called.  Was that 80s or 90s?  I&#39;ll google it&quot; then if I type &quot;what year was&quot; it will auto complete &quot;gremlins 2 released&quot; or whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People seriously underestimate what metadata can do and overestimate how often companies would use eavesdropping. Voice analysis is hard, it is very processor and storage intensive. People aren&#39;t as unique as they think they are. You gather cheap metadata from search history, location, circles of contacts, purchases and you can pretty well predict so many things at a fraction of the cost of parsing an audio conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah that makes sense, it&#39;s also easy to forget that they have pretty accurate contacts information because they can crossreference my gps location.

    <div class="md"><p>When I was in my early 20&#39;s I worked for a huge well known data company.  I just worked on server security, but I had plenty of friends in big data.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>You would be fucking shocked to see what people can learn about you just through metadata.  Shit like &quot;if you stop by convenience stores every day on the way to your home, you&#39;re likely an alcoholic, or smoker...and if you go back again later that night, it&#39;s almost certain you&#39;re overindulge in alcohol.&quot;  They can tell who your friends are, what your hobbies are, as well as your friends, your political proclivities, etc.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Big-data is basically like having a genius private eye on you all the time, who also has access to all your friends.  If one person slips up and gets busted for drugs, suddenly it&#39;s made apparent that all you guys going to his house are doing drugs.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not mind reading, it&#39;s paying close attention to your daily activities, from the places you go, to the people you talk to, to the information you ingest online.  If your life is logged in to big-data programs it&#39;s likely that they can tell you thing that not even your closest friends can.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>...that&#39;s why we must all fight against the intrustion of data corporations in our lives.  Get a fucking VPN, be intentionally vague with your internet history.  Don&#39;t give them one iota of information to make their jobs easier...but its still much easier than you probably think...</p>

<p>Researchers have created a wearable device that can read people’s minds when they use an internal voice, allowing them to control devices and ask queries without speaking.</p>

<p>The device, called AlterEgo, can transcribe words that wearers verbalise internally but do not say out loud, using electrodes attached to the skin.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/06/researchers-develop-device-that-can-hear-your-internal-voice">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/06/researchers-develop-device-that-can-hear-your-internal-voice</a></p>

<p>They can literally read your mind. So we know that technology exists which reads your mind <em>using sensors on the skin.</em> After that point, it&#39;s speculation, but I think it&#39;s reasonable to assume that this technology has been developed much further than they&#39;re telling us, especially in a black project scenario, perhaps to the point of being able to remotely reading your mind (no skin sensors necessary). If you think about it, the ability to read somebody&#39;s mind would be the most powerful tool on the planet, by far, so it&#39;s almost too obvious to me there have at least been significant efforts to develop a remote mind reading technology. Then the question is: have they released this to a corporation or two for marketing, or perhaps some kind of experimentation on making certain people in the public paranoid? That part I&#39;m not so sure about, but I wanted to throw this into the mix to start the discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For many, perhaps things like this will be the beginning of the discovery of the inherent interconnected nature of the Cosmos and the synchronicities that are implied within it.</p>

<p>Synchronicity simply means that two events that may not seem connected at all, are in fact connected, in fact in reality it implies that all events in the Universe are intimately connected. If we look at the Cosmos as an incredibly entangled web, where our (and everyone else&#39;s) very thoughts and awareness interact with the entirety of reality on a very intimate level, not yet fully discovered and explained by modern science (perhaps some theories over at r/holofractal may come close). If the old mystical traditions of especially the East, but also the West are true, then we live inside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net">Indira&#39;s Net</a>, a vast interconnected Cosmos, where your interaction with reality is not limited to the physical, but is also present on the mental and emotional levels.</p>

<p>In this case your very thoughts create the reality around you and thus seeming coincidences like this. How? Simple. Every action has a thought as its precursor. Every thought you think has a certain energetic signature, which leads you to a very specific action. Thus, perhaps you often think about a specific person you haven&#39;t seen in a while and lo an behold, at some point you meet that person when walking down a street - you and that person&#39;s energy output matched and the thoughts you had inspired you and them to take certain actions that caused you two to meet. Seemingly coincidentally, but in reality in a totally consensual and co-creative manner.</p>

<p>Thus as you think a lot about certain things, these things will be pulled into your experience, as you will intuitively make actions that will pull you into those experiences, while anyone else (from people, to animals, to bacteria) will also be drawn to your energetic output and if they match themselves, will be drawn into your experience as well.</p>

<p>Thus, in your example, since your thoughts directly influence reality, your thoughts of the specific movie scene would have influenced both your actions that caused you to open the YouTube app at a very specific moment in time, as well as influenced the random number generation in the code of the YouTube app&#39;s algorithm that caused it to spit out the exact perfect scene for you at the exactly perfect time.</p>

<p>Ah, Cosmic perfection at work :)</p>

<p>Of course all of this is simply my perspective and you are all free to disagree as you like.</p>

<p>Nitpick, but sychronicity refers to events that seem related but are not causally related.</p>

<p>From the wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jung defined synchronicity as an &quot;acausal connecting (togetherness) principle,&quot; &quot;meaningful coincidence&quot;, and &quot;acausal parallelism.&quot; </p>

So, they could listen to conversations, what you are watching on tv, what youre reading online etc.  Then using AI to predict what you may be thinking of next.  We all live in a state of predictive programming, x leads to y which leads to z and 7 times out of 10 will lead back to A.  </p>

<p>Psychologists can already use predictive programming on you.  Ask you to select any one of 20 or more random objects and they have already programmed you to pick the exact object you choose with what you think is your free will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a fair point and there is enough data to show it&#39;s possibility. Just being in the same room as a powerful device like a TV or computer screen or even phone for that matter I assume now these days has the capability to affect the energetic field of the mind/brain. It&#39;s weirdo research so don&#39;t take my word for it. Combined with the concept that people can have their choices detected by machines before they are &quot;consciously&quot; aware of them. It&#39;s seems we must also be aware of the possibility that we can be prompted or primed with thoughts or ideas by merely being in the vicinity of the various powerful computer/TV devices. It doesn&#39;t even need to be viewed. </p>

<p>Tldr: maybe it&#39;s the other way around, you were &quot;given&quot; the idea of what to search for</p>

<p>This shit sounds insane, but it&#39;s happened to me personally on a few different occasions. I don&#39;t remember what I was thinking about, but I know that it&#39;s horrid because I&#39;m left trying to figure out whether or not I told anybody, and I feel like I&#39;m going insane.</p>

As I dug through the cupboard and didn&#39;t find it, I said &quot;aww, man&quot; but most certainly did not say the name of the product. So I slap together seasoning with other spices, and a few minutes later I get on my phone (which had been sitting nearby). I&#39;m immediately deluged with multiples of the same ad saying &quot;Oh no, you forgot the Lawry&#39;s Seasoning Salt!&quot; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen that product advertised before, or since.
