<p>Often amid canned responses from NASA shills, who have designated unfalsifiable justifications for every anomaly that’s ever been pointed out about the Apollo missions, it’s easy to forget what we’re even talking about: we’re talking about this video, which is supposed to depict a real space mission. </p>

<p>For those still able to appeal to their own senses, it’s all you need. This footage has not aged well and indeed, upon each viewing and with each passing year looks and smells increasingly like farcical puppetry. </p>

<p>Consider how people would respond at that time if we actually found ruins of a lost society or actual alien beings? It would be pandemonium and all societal constructs would dissolve over night. Some may think that the discovery of alien life would unite human kind but not in the 1960s. People would not have reacted well to that kind of discovery. Not with their limited view points and religious undercurrents of that time. It would make sense that fake footage would be shown as a precautionary measure. And to admit the truth now would create more derision and discourse and completely undermine any shred of integrity the USA intelligence networks &amp; govt may hold in the global political forum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a standard argument that doesn&#39;t hold up to the normal human curiosity and interest in space or in ruins right here on Earth that we haven&#39;t the faintest inkling about how they could ever have been fashioned by human hands. </p>

<p>Others on the Moon would simply be seen as tending to confirm the suspicions that they probably weren&#39;t human hands or not by the kind of humans we believe previously existed on Earth at the time they were built or even now within the limitations of our own abilities in that department. </p>

<p>The elementary truth of European explorations from the 1500&#39;s onwards wasn&#39;t so much that there were unknown and undiscovered lands a plenty but people and fascinating alien cultures already living on all kinds of them and no one went into shock or convulsions or a mad panic over that despite how much more limited their general knowledge and understanding of the world was throughout it. It simply whet their appetite for more.</p>

<p>People had lapped-up TV shows like &quot;Men in Space, One Step Beyond, the Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits,&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot; and millions of them had already seen &quot;2001 A Space Odyssey&quot; well before the Moon missions that were actually tame and really something of a let-down by comparison. </p>

<p>The hope was there might be actually something else and more provocative and interesting besides simply the dust and craters that we already knew were there as was the disappointing and lumbering movements of the astronauts in what was supposedly only 1/5th of the gravity here on Earth. </p>

<p>Looking at it from this vantage point in time there wasn&#39;t much more to it or that was accomplished than just that. </p>

<p>This might actually be the case, but faking any part of it makes the entire idea or mission reasonable to question. To me, this footage seems fake, but my biggest issue lies with people who pretend to know for sure if it happened or if it didn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I was attempting to offer a different perspective about the footage. IMO, it seems staged. The thing that gets me is the reasoning why. </p>

<p>What reasons would the govt have for showing fake footage? 
Why not admit it was faked?</p>

<p>To me, it seems plausible that the public would be shown fake footage with that very first landing/trip. In order to keep the public from having another freak out fit (ala War of the Worlds). Even if we didn&#39;t come across anything alien, what if a malfunction happened? How would the public respond in the 1960s to seeing the astronauts blown up, or crushed, etc? Not well, to say the least. </p>
