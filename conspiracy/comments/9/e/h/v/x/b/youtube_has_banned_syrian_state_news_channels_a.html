    <div class="md"><p>this is the flipside to &quot;they are a private company, they can do what they want&quot; didn&#39;t take long to abuse it did they?</p>

<p>something i would like to see is a lawsuit against Youtube for the ISIS content or those weird kiddie videos, by stripping jones off of the platform they have taken responsibility for their content, thus the whole old argument of we arent responsible for what people post vanishes as soon as they start censoring.</p>

<p>if you take responsibility for one thing and remove it, you assume that responsibility for the rest of it.</p>

<p>i think this is all just a back handed attempt at giving the government authority to be the internet police.</p>

<p>Posts like this were spammed back then too. Russia uses &quot;false flag&quot; propoganda like this regularly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ritter was one of the groundbreakers in developing on-site inspection techniques and methodologies. With this unique experience behind him, Ritter was asked in 1991, at the end of the Gulf War, to join the United Nations Special Commission, which was tasked by the Security Council to oversee the disarmament of Iraq‚Äôs weapons of mass destruction.  From 1991 to 1998, Ritter served as a chief weapons inspector and led a number of teams into Iraq.</p>

<p>According to Ritter, in the following Flashpoints Radio interview with Dennis Bernstein conducted on April 23rd, US, British and French claims that the Syrian Government used chemical weapons against civilians last month appear to be totally bogus.</p>

<p>It was unclear what chemical had been used in Saturday&#39;s attack. Medics on the ground reported smelling a chlorine-like substance, but said the patients&#39; symptoms and the large death toll pointed to a more noxious substance <strong>such as nerve agent sarin</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They hit three of Mr. Assad‚Äôs chemical weapons facilities: a scientific research center in greater Damascus that was used in the production of weapons, and two chemical weapons facilities west of Homs, one of which was <strong>used for the production of the nerve agent sarin</strong> and the other was part of a military command post, said Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OPCW designated labs conducted analysis of prioritised samples. The results show that <strong>no organophosphorous nerve agents or their degradation products were detected in the environmental samples or in the plasma samples taken from alleged casualties.</strong> Along with explosive residues, various chlorinated organic chemicals were found in samples from two sites, for which there is full chain of custody. Work by the team to establish the significance of these results is on-going. The FFM team will continue its work to draw final conclusions. </p>

<p>2nd article references a facility in homs used to produce sarin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this has been building for awhile RT was talking about the rebels being in early planning stages for a chem attack for almost a month.</p>

<p>supposedly they have evidence of white helments smuggling chlorine in to idlib and that coalition forces have been involved.</p>

<p>considering they were talking about it so far in advance, then the west cuts Jones (one of the few even talking about it in west) and then shut down syrian media i mean teleSur has also been knee capped.</p>

<p>then all of a sudden all the western media is running a counter story saying it will be the government responsible.</p>

<p>like all the previous ones im sure they will increase sanctions, or attack the syrian positions for ISIS to keep their little terrorism puppets chugging along.</p>

<p>i only recently stumbled on to how involved china is going to be moving forward. that really ups the risk, because this just pushes that trade war closer to reality, which means open war is getting closer...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to look at all info skeptically.</p>

<p>Is it not possible to make it appear this way?</p>

<p>Here me out. RT is not known for taking a positive US stance. They may have info of an attack, false flag or not, and still choose to say it will be a false flag.</p>

<p>Hypothetically, lets say RT got info of a Syrian attack in the planning and decides to say a false flag attack is coming soon. They then get the bonus of calling an attack and people believing them that its a false flag.</p>

<p>If I knew you were secretly in serious debt to the mob and I knew they were coming to kill you I could gossip about for a month about an ex girlfriend who wants to kill you. Then when the mob gets you it looks to everybody who heard me that your ex girlfriend killed you. I have a huge amount of credibility to those people because you were murdered and I had called it happening, even if it didnt actually happen the way I said it did.</p>

<p>If somebody had info and wanted to twist it against the US thats how they could do it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m certain this kind of stuff happens with out own MSM at some point, Im sure it happens elsewhere too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so you are essentially claiming RT has knowledge and is intentionally covering for the syrian government.</p>

<p>except the problem with that is they were screaming about it from the bloody roof tops and russia even tried to show proof to the UN and the west was dead silent.</p>

<p>now we have a bunch of annon sources yet again claiming essentially &quot;no, you!&quot;</p>

<p>this is text book muddying of the water tactics.</p>

<p>there is no motive for assad to use chem weapons, hes already won and doesnt need them to do so. the only group with reason to deploy chem weapons are the rebels and the western governments trying to use it to get a foot in the door to a conflict they are not legally allowed to be involved in under international law.</p>

<p>the presence of US troops is a direct violation of international law, and constitutes and invasionary force.</p>
