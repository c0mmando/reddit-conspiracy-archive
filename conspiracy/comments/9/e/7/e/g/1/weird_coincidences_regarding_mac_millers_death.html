       First of all, I want to start by saying Mac Miller is one of my all time favourite musicians and his music has helped me get through a lot of turmoil in life. Rest in peace and my thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones. This post is in no way throwing dirt on his or Ariana Grande’s name. This is simply drawing weird connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       To begin, Mac’s house was “swept clean” and no drugs were found on the scene. No information has been released on who called in his death or what he OD’d from. My guess is fentanyl. But still, who makes sure to clean up all their drugs and makes sure there is no trace of drugs before they OD? Makes no sense. He was clean and apparently off of hard drugs. He was posting Instagram stories of him working out and doing cardio, looking genuinly happy and healthy just a few days ago. His last tweet was “I just wanna go on tour”. Not something someone on hard drugs would say.

      <p>
       Now, onto the Clinton connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ariana Grande is a known friend of the Clintons
       <a href="https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1035534916874850304">

       and her knew BF Pete Davidson literally has a tattoo of Hillary.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Clinton was recently caught oogling at Ariana, practically drooling over her.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, we all know the Clinton’s connections to Haiti’s donation funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a line from Mac: “Bought a Mercedes with money I raised for Haiti 
Abducted Brenda's baby, sold it to a gay couple”
      </p>
      <p>
       Connection to human trafficking?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I sound like a delusional paranoid person but I’m just drawing a connection that adds to the Clinton body count.

       Rest up Larry Fisherman. We love you bro.

       not a huge fan, dont know the circumstances, but i dated a heavy drug user and she hid it from me for a long time, we lived together. and all while she had a smile on her face and never skipped a beat. people can hide things man, especially when they have a personal need to do so.

       People are more likely to OD when they relapse after going clean for a while.

       i know where i'm at in NY u have good samaritan laws that protect you from possession charges when u call to report an OD so ofc outright possession is illegal, during this specific situation it's different. i can actually say this from experience, twice actually..
      </p>
      <p>
       that's not to say tho that his ppl didn't just bug out and clean the scene and gtfo due to the fact that mac obv wasn't just a 'normal' dude and the repercussions from his death would have left a lot of pockets drying up and would have left at least a few ppl looking for revenge

       I wonder when people will stop blaming literally everything on Hillary Clinton. Probably never. 2016 gave people such horrific brain damage that posts like these are the new normal.

       On another note, I’ve never trusted Hillary Clinton since elementary school and I’m almost 30. Always thought she was an evil cunt.

       Add in her start on Dan Schneider shows and how she blew the fuck up seemingly overnight. Her brother was on the show Big Brother at the time and they pulled him aside to tell him his sister was super famous now.

       Can't forget about the Manchester bombing of her concert that killed 22 people. One of the weirdest live terrorists events I have witnessed online. News broke of something at her concert then nothing for a couple of hours...people wondering if it was real or not, then videos emerged and it seemed so...nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her 5 year anniversary of her music career was just a couple weeks ago and she tweeted out she is hoping for five more years. Her newest album has 16 number one singles, the most for any artist in 2018. This is her third album in the billboard top 200. She has tweeted all of this out recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       She posts a lot of tweets that are backwards and upside, they read correctly when put in front of a mirror.
      </p>
      <p>
       She fashions herself like a young child imo. Look at her twitter profile pic, looks like a little kid.

       Pete Davidson's father died during 9/11. And that whole social media exchange between him and HRC when he got that tattoo was cringe and scripted imo.

       Good comment, got to disagree about the Manchester bombing though. I live quite near Manchester and it was a huge deal for quite a while in UK. Definitely didn’t seem so... nothing. Feel like Grande won over a lot of hearts here after that.

       Her album has only 15 songs, three singles, and none of them reached number one.

       The Manchester bombing definitely happened. Take any hour after the event and you can find news stories covering it. I did not see anyone on reddit wondering if it was real or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about the rest of your comment but I'm going to assume it's all bullshit since you've tried to pass at least two pieces of fake news off as truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why nobody takes this sub seriously. You're never going to uncover an actual conspiracy if you just keep making up bullshit to support your worldview. Go play D&amp;D if you want to play make-believe so badly.

       CDAN have revealed one of their July blind items today. He is saying that Mac Miller tried to commit suicide back in July. He's hinted that Ariana Grande started her new relationship before officially breaking up with Miller too.

       My man, my man, if you want to go down this path I got a website for you. Keep in mind I'm a heavy skeptic on this I just find it entertaining to read, this is my bigfoot I guess. Check out the vigilantcitizen website. I could have swore they had an article about mac miller but I can't find it now. Either way it talks about "occult influences within the music industry" alot.

       But it's not a redacted name at all! A redacted name looks like this:

      <hr/>
      <p>
       You don't leave all but 2 letters of their name! It's specifically left so that
       <em>
        everybody

       knows who it is, but redacted so that you feel like you worked it out. How can you honestly believe that's a real document??

       Good comment, got to disagree about the Manchester bombing though. I live quite near Manchester and it was a huge deal for quite a while in UK. Definitely didn’t seem so... nothing. Feel like Grande won over a lot of hearts here after that.

       The Manchester bombing definitely happened. Take any hour after the event and you can find news stories covering it. I did not see anyone on reddit wondering if it was real or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about the rest of your comment but I'm going to assume it's all bullshit since you've tried to pass at least two pieces of fake news off as truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why nobody takes this sub seriously. You're never going to uncover an actual conspiracy if you just keep making up bullshit to support your worldview. Go play D&amp;D if you want to play make-believe so badly.
