        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all, I want to start by saying Mac Miller is one of my all time favourite musicians and his music has helped me get through a lot of turmoil in life. Rest in peace and my thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones. This post is in no way throwing dirt on his or Ariana Grande’s name. This is simply drawing weird connections.</p>

<p>To begin, Mac’s house was “swept clean” and no drugs were found on the scene. No information has been released on who called in his death or what he OD’d from. My guess is fentanyl. But still, who makes sure to clean up all their drugs and makes sure there is no trace of drugs before they OD? Makes no sense. He was clean and apparently off of hard drugs. He was posting Instagram stories of him working out and doing cardio, looking genuinly happy and healthy just a few days ago. His last tweet was “I just wanna go on tour”. Not something someone on hard drugs would say. </p>

<p><a href="https://t.co/kDBwaMUti4">https://t.co/kDBwaMUti4</a></p>

<p>Now, onto the Clinton connection.  </p>

<p>Ariana Grande is a known friend of the Clintons <a href="https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1035534916874850304">https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1035534916874850304</a></p>

<p>and her knew BF Pete Davidson literally has a tattoo of Hillary. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/SNL-Pete-Davidson-got-a-Hillary-Clinton-tattoo-12436151.php">https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/SNL-Pete-Davidson-got-a-Hillary-Clinton-tattoo-12436151.php</a></p>

<p>Bill Clinton was recently caught oogling at Ariana, practically drooling over her.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/timrunshismouth/status/1035566822538571777">https://twitter.com/timrunshismouth/status/1035566822538571777</a></p>

<p>And lastly, we all know the Clinton’s connections to Haiti’s donation funds. </p>

<p>Here is a line from Mac: “Bought a Mercedes with money I raised for Haiti 
Abducted Brenda&#39;s baby, sold it to a gay couple”</p>

<p>Connection to human trafficking? </p>

<p>I know I sound like a delusional paranoid person but I’m just drawing a connection that adds to the Clinton body count.</p>

<p>Rest up Larry Fisherman. We love you bro.</p>

<p>that&#39;s not to say tho that his ppl didn&#39;t just bug out and clean the scene and gtfo due to the fact that mac obv wasn&#39;t just a &#39;normal&#39; dude and the repercussions from his death would have left a lot of pockets drying up and would have left at least a few ppl looking for revenge</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Add in her start on Dan Schneider shows and how she blew the fuck up seemingly overnight. Her brother was on the show Big Brother at the time and they pulled him aside to tell him his sister was super famous now. </p>

<p>Can&#39;t forget about the Manchester bombing of her concert that killed 22 people. One of the weirdest live terrorists events I have witnessed online. News broke of something at her concert then nothing for a couple of hours...people wondering if it was real or not, then videos emerged and it seemed so...nothing. </p>

<p>Her 5 year anniversary of her music career was just a couple weeks ago and she tweeted out she is hoping for five more years. Her newest album has 16 number one singles, the most for any artist in 2018. This is her third album in the billboard top 200. She has tweeted all of this out recently.</p>

<p>She posts a lot of tweets that are backwards and upside, they read correctly when put in front of a mirror. </p>

<p>She fashions herself like a young child imo. Look at her twitter profile pic, looks like a little kid.</p>

<p>Pete Davidson&#39;s father died during 9/11. And that whole social media exchange between him and HRC when he got that tattoo was cringe and scripted imo.</p>
