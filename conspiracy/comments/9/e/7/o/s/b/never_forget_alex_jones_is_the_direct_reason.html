       What is the main demonization against Alex Jones by those that want you to support or accept the censorship of the only major conspiracy website, and on a conspiracy sub no less.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a zionists gatekeeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait a minute I thought Trump and his supporters including Alex Jones were supposed to be the Nazis?
      </p>
      <p>
       Aj may be a little nutty but he is responsible for waking up millions. He may not always be right, no one ever is. He may have been married to a Jew at one point. So is that the major argument?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it really because he supports Trump. So the usual suspects are trying to turn you against him. And they think all Trump supporters are Nazis so they say he is a zionist gatekeeper because they think they are playing into your prejudices.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality about AJ's and the conspiracy community's support for Trump...
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       .
We all saw the build up for the one world government agenda. We all saw the corruption and lies from government.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then comes Trump openly saying real shit against the establishment and running on a platform opposed to the one world government agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to realize the NWO was the main conspiracy that the conspiracy community, including Jones, had been watching unfold for years. And then come someone opposed to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to have some measure of hope. When someone comes along in opposition to the evil plan you see unfolding you have to support them and hope for the best. The only alternative is to say "woes me all is lost".
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said certain aspects of what Trump is doing and who he has surrounded himself with are very very suspect. He could be a very complex illuminati psyop. But on the other hand he is doing quit a bit of good things that the people elected him for.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only alternative is to join the resist movement and become an activist demanding the illuminati regain power, because that is exactly what they stand for...
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you can just wait and see hoping for the best and expecting the worst.

       Alex Jones misdirected people for over a decade, became the face of "conspiracy theorists," then transitioned to a pure Republican partisan campaign machine.

       I warned people back in the day not to make him the face of conspiracies, but most didn't listen.

      <p>
       It's more than suspect. Donald Trump is in nearly perfect alignment with George W. Bush. Trump adopted unipolarism, hegemony, legalized torture, tax cuts, deregulation, and even PNAC. You've been fooled. The establishment took the White House by advertising the "outsider." Not a new trick either. The Tea Party was the same trick.

       Look man. Not everyone thinks every Trump supporter is a Nazi, and we all want what's best for us, as in prosperity as a whole, I would assume.
 But Trump is not the guy..  if you're religious, then.. wouldn't the Antichrist be in disguise? And all else that's said?

       Stop with the false dichotomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of people with plenty of negative and critical things to say about AJ and infowars, that doesn't mean they support him being deplatformed and censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       This black and white narrative is an intellectual slight of hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also, if you think the only reason people don't like or trust AJ is because he supported trump,  I'd understand why you think this is all so outrageous, but it's far more complicated than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example,  how much bullshit has he injected into the 911 truth movement?

       That's an awfully large wall of babble OP. Alex Jones doesn't deserve praise. He has a LONG history of being wreckless, or a liar. He is likely controlled in some fashion, and is probably a disinfo agent. He is entertaining and has a good thesis, of love, nature, and family. However, his entire gambit is to entertain and distract to ultimately keep people in stasis and unproductive.

       Why is everyone fixated on him. He was made to be the poster child for conspiracy theories by the MSM. But he was never the one to bring these problems to light he just talked about this stuff on his show for ratings. It is ridiculous how almost every other post is about him now on this sub. The only thing he had worth looking into is the burning owl video which came out ten years ago.

       I'm pretty skeptical of the claim that he has caused millions to wake up. I think it's more that people wake up for their own reasons and start looking for media that goes against the mainstream narratives. Alex Jones stands out as one of the more prominent people in alternative media, so naturally people end up watching him.
