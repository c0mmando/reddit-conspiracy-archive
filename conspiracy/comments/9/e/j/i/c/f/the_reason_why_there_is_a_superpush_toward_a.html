       The true US debt is approximately 200-Trillion and not the spouted around 21-Trillion that is typically passed around on MSM.  The US debt is pretty much impossible to pay unless the U.S. prints its own money and takes it out of the hands of the Fed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with that being said in the geo-politics and economics avenues China and Russia are both now starting to conduct trade in their own currenices instead of using the U.S. dollar which both countries used.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example, if Russia wanted to buy oil from X country, they would transfer Y amount of their Russian Ruble into USD then they buy the oil needed in the USD.  But now Russian as well as China will not be trading in the USD and Russia is buying Tons of Gold again.

       The US collapse is coming, Concentration camps and all because of this collapse is coming.

       Well even via your chart it was relatively stable until approximately 1933 in which all printing and control was given to the Fed.  And a steadily decline since then which is what I was referencing above.

       Yup.  Don’t bother buying it, invest time and money on learning how to survive in the wilderness and getting supplies.  The US has * a lot* of land.  Best bet is to get a boat and plan to head out into a river delta or swamp way the fuck away from people and build a hidden shelter.

       As someone who lived through Russia in the 90’s, I can say that economic collapses are not fun. And in the US it will be much worse, in the Soviet Union the population had a general sense of camaraderie, (which did vanish over time), but the US I feel is much more divided, with each individual or small group only caring about themselves. So a crisis here will escalate quickly and in nasty ways. (My suggestion, buy guns, food, water, silver and have friends, oh and don’t live in cities)

       We'll be good in US, the whole ultra-armed population thing makes us pretty safe from colonialisms.  A lot of the rich are going to leave, a lot of people are going to have trouble with resources, but overall we'll be good.

       I think most ppl here dont understand the deeply hard life the VAST majority of people would suddenly wake up to if the US dollar collapses. Everyone here would probably suffer significantly while they dream up fantasy of some post dollar world where they are surviving and doing semi-ok. That is not the case at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be much better to slowly ween the planet off the US dollar than for it to collapse underneath us. We would die in that building; or I should say, the vast majority of us would die buried under that house.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a good idea to stock up on supplies but that will only go so far. A dollar collapse would probably take decades to recovery from. Anyone here have enough bullets/food/shelter for decades?

       Your money would come hyper inflated which means it will continue to lose value.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take the U.S. for example, and as a rough example lets say in the 1950s you could rent an apartment for 100 a month.  Well now that same exact apartment rents for 1200 a month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Home prices constantly rising while the dollar constantly sinking is just one of many aspects of inflation.

       Look at Venezuela, this is what happens when a country keeps printing money without checks and balances.  Your money becomes worthless.
      </p>
      <p>
       You money could become so worthless that you can use 100s of dollars to make a bag with it, and that bag is worth more than the money you made it with.  LITERALLY.

       Fascinating post and the comments also.  It all seems rather probable.  Even the trumpet sounds someone posted, a group of friends and I all heard it and it was super eery.  Like the most horrifying horror movie music doesn't even compare.  It sounded like it was coming from everywhere. But no where.

       I gave up looking into that stuff a while back, but could never shake it off completely. Where and about when did you hear it? Can you try and describe the sound in any other ways? I'm guessing you would have also researched into the possible cause or source... what else have you discovered?

       Approximately 2014 around 2am-3am in Chicago, Illinois.

      <p>
       It was so loud, it actually sounded like it came from space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounded like a mixture of a massive blow-horn and trumpet coming from every single direction.  It equally sounded loud within the home we were in and when we went outside it was the exact same.  Very strange.

        I see we have gone down a similar path by the way youre tightroping around the question. People dont seen to take it very well huh? I've noticed the same and have taken the exact same approach as you :)

       Some assume religious a connection, but it's just more so if something was going to happen that made you leave this plane, would you rather leave an asshole or leave on as good of terms as able?  That's really the point in the end. Because the sounds didn't sound like anything good.

        Thanks so much for getting back to me! This phenomenon is what got me to start posting after 6 years and after only about a month, it seems we've come back full circle.

       Had to leave this somewhere and it seemed as good a place as any... from someone I look up to:

        Faith is to be sure of what we hope for and the evidence of things unseen.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you’re asking about the institutions that are run by men/man then yes. Sure. They are imperfect. Are those things your say possible?  Sure. Anything is possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        The truth that underlies our beliefs or the beliefs of any major religion holds true and firm. Regardless of what I or you actually choose to believe.
       </p>
       <p>
        So... what is that underlying truth and how will you choose (free will) to act upon those beliefs?
       </p>
       <p>
        My choices don’t involve entertaining ‘conspiracy’ theories or websites with certain narratives. I don’t have the time and I don’t feel like I need that ‘proof’.
       </p>
       <p>
        My hope is that people in power act on truths that benefit and are equitable to all. Does it always happen?  No. Does that stop me from believing in those truths?  No.
       </p>
       <p>
        Is there disappointment? Yes. But that is life. How will to respond and deal with the truths you seek, the truths you find, the truths your told.

        a group of friends and I all heard it and it was super eery. Like the most horrifying horror movie music doesn't even compare. It sounded like it was coming from everywhere. But no where.

       Weird sounds - Downtown Calgary - Nov 02, 2017

       I gave up looking into that stuff a while back, but could never shake it off completely. Where and about when did you hear it? Can you try and describe the sound in any other ways? I'm guessing you would have also researched into the possible cause or source... what else have you discovered?
