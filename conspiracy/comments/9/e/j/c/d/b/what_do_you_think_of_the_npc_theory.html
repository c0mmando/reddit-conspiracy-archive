    <div class="md"><p>I found this interesting:
<em>Notice that people with spirit who are awake to their spiritual impulses often make willful choices that serve no financial, social, or egotistic gains, that go against the expectations of Darwinian evolutionary principles, and that serve only spiritual ends. Such impulses are absent in spiritless people, thus they are truly optimized for survival in the physical world. Without conscience, empathy, or inner battle between ego and spirit holding them back, they can more quickly and easily succeed in their worldly environments regardless of the cost to others.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just gonna repost a comment I left in another thread a couple days ago:  </p>

<p>That&#39;s fascinating. I&#39;ve read plenty about theories on consciousness, and have my own theories as to what components make up a conscious individual. A conclusion I&#39;ve reached is that there are three components components that work together in tandem to result in &quot;the functioning conscious individual&quot;. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Rudimentary consciousness.
This can be defined as the sum of all physical consciousnesses that make up a body (ie. For an animal/plant/fungal life this is the sum consciousness of all the cells that make it up. For a planet it would be all plant/animal/fungal life, all the earth, and all the water, etc). This is often referred to as ego. The study of this comes under genetics. It&#39;s basically physical code to provide response to environmental stimuli. </p></li>
<li><p>Social consciousness.
This can be defined as the influences that the environment and other conscious individuals have on an individual. These present new information and expand the choice of response actions in a rudimentary consciousness. The study of this comes under memetics. </p></li>
<li><p>Extended consciousness.
I believe this to be what some refer to as the &quot;soul&quot;. It is the point of connection between a physical conscious entity and universal consciousness. The rope that if you were to follow would take you back to the source. This includes information from &quot;past lives&quot; stored in the subconscious, and an individual&#39;s morphogenetic field which permeates into the spacetime immediately surrounding a conscious individual (this field extends to around about a metre out from the focal point of consciousness and a few minutes into the past and future). </p></li>
</ol>

<p>It sounds like the NPC in this scenario would be running almost exclusively on 1 and 2, with little to no action from 3. They&#39;d simply be responding to environmental stimulus and following social structure as though they were a mere part in the machine and nothing more. There&#39;d be no sense of true self. Just ego.<br/>
I don&#39;t believe anyone is truly soulless, but I do believe that societal structures and functions act to suppress the action of extended consciousness, which in effect results in the outward appearance of being soulless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what he&#39;s saying and I can understand the perspective, but I can&#39;t agree with the theory he proposes. His assertion that physics is a study of objects and that therefore reality must be comprised of physical objects immediately shows a lack of understanding of the difference and relationships between inherent properties and emergent phenomena. By that, I mean that I could completely follow his theory, but only so long as I abandoned that entire aspect of physics at the door.<br/>
To explain: &quot;physical matter&quot; is a resultant phenomena of the superposition of complex interference patterns within the electromagnetic field. By no means is there anything &quot;physical&quot; to physical matter. This model of thinking can also help to explain &quot;wave-particle duality&quot;. The particle aspect is a resultant phenomena of the interaction of waves. The wave aspect is the inherent property. It&#39;s like how things are made up of smaller parts, but those smaller parts don&#39;t operate by the same rules. As parts come together to form an object orders of magnitude larger than themselves, the object no longer abides by the rules that the individual parts adhere to.<br/>
Think of spacetime as a free-flowing ocean. Except instead of water it&#39;s made of high frequency electromagnetic &quot;particles&quot; that aren&#39;t atomically bound. A plasma. And the &quot;particles&quot; aren&#39;t actually physical particles, but are excited states within this field. For instance, a wave peak of a certain height is what&#39;s referred to as a &quot;neutrino&quot;, whereas a wave peak that climaxes slightly higher is what&#39;s referred to as an &quot;electron&quot;. Sometimes these particles are only there for a split second. Sometimes they carry for a certain distance. But these aren&#39;t fundamental things; they&#39;re the resultant effect of the interactions of other waves. They&#39;re interference patterns. Some are more stable than others due to resonance, some aren&#39;t stable at all and can&#39;t maintain their form for more than a moment, so therefore we observe it as a &quot;particle popping in and out of existence&quot;.<br/>
Assuming that everything in this universe is fundamentally physical and physically connected assumes not only upper and lower limits to matter, but, by extention, a static universe. Whereas by assuming that this universe is fundamentally wave forms operating in a field puts no limit on matter. The electromagnetic spectrum is infinite. &quot;Matter&quot; can therefore form at infinite scales as waves of different frequency interact with one another. The frequency may be of one which acts within the bandwidth of frequencies that our sensory organs operate at, it may be of a frequency that is outside of the frequency bandwidths of our sensory organs and therefore we&#39;d require specially designed equipment to detect it, or it may be at a scale so grand or so tiny that it&#39;s so far removed from our sense of scale that it&#39;s impossible for us to even recognise. Physicality is nothing fundamental. It&#39;s an emergent phenomena entirely dependant on your perspective.<br/>
What I agree with is that everything is connected. But it&#39;s not all connected by physical ropes. It&#39;s all connected by waves that spread out infinitely in every direction within the 3D ocean of spacetime.  </p>

<p>Now, with that understanding as matter being akin to the surface ripples on the ocean caused by the interactions of the waves governed by the underlying currents... The question becomes: &quot;who&#39;s causing the currents?&quot;<br/>
Odds are that that&#39;s the effect of action from a higher dimension. From a perspective outside of space and time as we see it. There&#39;s always an external input into the system from somewhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a related concept that was put forward in Julian Jaynes book, &quot;The Origin of Consciousness and the Bicameral Mind&quot;.  The TL;DR is that for most of human history, humans had a cognitive split where the inner voice of consciousness was seen as something external, akin to commands from a God, and then a passive cognitive side that listened and obeyed.  There wasn&#39;t a recognition of the internal voice as part of a self-reflective consciousness.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting theory and not entirely well respected in terms of cognitive science, but considered influential in a larger sense.</p>

<p>It could be that the NPCs in your theory are simply people who are more bicameral -- they don&#39;t completely control their inner voice or aren&#39;t as aware of it as other people.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s possible that the mainstream media and religion are attempts to push a kind of bicameralism and disassociate the inner voice from cognitive control and use it to get people to associate with either the religion&#39;s gods or the media&#39;s messaging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A comment I have posted before, thus, this very comment is what I am describing---Stupid by my definition:</p>

<p>The BBC docu’ about stupidity took an hour to suggest there is not a consistent definition for “Stupidity”, and very little published attempting to do so.
Most of this docu’ traces IQ testing, playing dumb for affect, and often suggesting mob-activity (riot-style) is stupid activity.
I propose &quot;stupid&quot; is the activity of repeating any thought. Even repeating an effective recipe is now &quot;stupid&quot; because it is a retrieval system; &quot;rolling tape&quot;. &quot;You&#39;re not thinking---that was stupid!&quot;
This comment comes out of the often-repeated (and interesting) discussion about AI, Turing tests, etc.
Remove the “and expecting different results” from “doing the same thing over and over again”, and I propose we have stupid, no longer insanity. A stupid machine.
Next, I propose &quot;creativity&quot; is thinking; combining ideas to create a &#39;new thought&#39;. It is in this territory where intelligence is judged; are the thoughts combinational silliness, or do they reveal a &quot;creative spark&quot;?
Does the conversation build on itself; appreciating new concepts to take and then add meaning.
The thoughts do not have to be &quot;correct&quot;. I am not exposing insight on the Gettier “True belief/knowledge” areas.
(I advance &quot;Genius&quot; is any creative thought which actually produces a solution to a problem….)
Ignorance is not-knowing an existent recipe.
Stupid is not thinking.
Insanity is blablabla…
Genius is blablabla….
Failing on a skateboard is not stupid, but creative.
My comment is stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of a theory of dreaming I read recently, it says when the brain is dreaming it is combining spurious memories to create a new memory that will manifest during wakefulness as creative thought. One of his arguments was where else does creative thought come from since we can only recall memories.</p>

<p>Vitamin D is basically a hormone, if you&#39;re deficient in it you won&#39;t be able to gain muscle, will get depressed easily, etc, same as being low T.</p>
