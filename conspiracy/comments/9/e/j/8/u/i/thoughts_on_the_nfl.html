    <div class="md"><p>You knew it was a bad omen when they let them bypass the Minneapolis referendum process for the Pohlad&#39;s Twins stadium.  Of course it would get bypassed for the Vikings, too.</p>

<p>It was shameful the way city leaders fell over themselves to &quot;win&quot; the stadium, letting downtown business types sway the entire debate.</p>

<p>It was also easy to get outstate legislators to override the local referendum.  They wouldn&#39;t bear any of the local costs, so why not stick Minneapolis citizens with the expenses?</p>

<p>The good news is that we&#39;re kind of out of new stadiums to build now that St. Paul got snookered into the soccer stadium.  Target Center has been remodeled, the Xcel center is still new enough, Twins and Vikings with their own stadium.</p>

<p>The Pohlads got what amounts to an outdoor bar and grill, they draw baseball fans for the circus atmosphere and the food and beverage revenue and don&#39;t even need to bother fielding a winning team.</p>

<p>The Wilfs (convicted swindlers!) at least seem focused on having a winning team for their new stadium.  I&#39;m not sure if this is part of a goal of just colonizing the Twin Cities as real estate empire or because they have enough skin in the game that they need to field a contender to keep attendance up enough to make money.  They kind of blew their wad with hosting SuperBowl.  The smaller number of games compared to baseball may mean that they have less opportunity to make money on food and beverage and thus need consistent sellout crowds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NFL is dying because there is something un-American about the oligarchical owner cabal. The pay of players is also un-American. It&#39;s elitist. These are not gods. Also, the &quot;sky boxes&quot; are further alienating the average American. Are we supposed to sit <em>below</em> the elite Richey Riches? That&#39;s not right. It certainly isn&#39;t egalitarian nor democratic. There&#39;s also the ancient echo of slavery within the draft system. Why are the &quot;Owners&quot; called owners? WTF! Do we have to go pre-civil war all the way to Ancient Rome? Fuckit! We are willing to let it all die because you fuckers have concocted some kind of Oriental Demogogery where we dutifully worship you and your players? Fuck it. It&#39;s just not right. You guys are off base, you&#39;ve lost us. The perfect example is the Spanos organization, little punk leaving a faithful fan base because we wouldn&#39;t buy the spoiled fucker a new stadium? Cram it clowney!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a business. Fans trade their money and attention for shits and giggles. Is it like TV wrestling? I don&#39;t think so. Too many moving parts. And I really don&#39;t think it needs to be a fixed event. When you have athletes really trying to excel and beat each other on a pro level, and competing to keep their jobs, it&#39;s pretty entertaining. Spontaneous stuff happens. Actions that delight several areas of the brain, and keep us wanting more.</p>

<p>Has a player or ref ever been corrupted by organized crime and thrown or influenced games. Yes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sounds like some Alex Jones bs. Yes sports are entertainment. Jones always goes off on how the NFL is purely a distraction and your dumb if you watch. It could be said InfoWars is entertainment and a distraction. Both are distrations and a waste of time if you allow them to be. Unfortunately one is designed to be entertainment the other is entertainment that masquerades as information/resistance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a completely unsubstantiated claim that the Patriots win so much because the NFL sets them up to do so. Why? So they can have a villain, or in WWE terms, a heel, so people tune in to watch them occasionally lose and get invested into watching the Patriots&#39; rivals. They lose just enough to keep the games looking fair, but not enough to keep them from being the NFL&#39;s heel.</p>
