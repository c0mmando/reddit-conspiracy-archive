        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s this theory going around 4chan based off this study that said only like 25% of the population has an inner voice. So someone came up with the theory that most people alive today are NPC&#39;s (non player characters), meaning they&#39;re not really autonomous human beings with souls, but they&#39;re more like unconscious beings who just respond to stimuli without really thinking. There are a finite number of souls in the world that just keep getting recycled into new bodies, but with the explosion in human population many people are left without souls.</p>

<p>Now that study may have been dubious but I can&#39;t help but feel there is some validity to this theory. It explains how the majority of the population throughout history have always been sheep, and today it&#39;s so much worse. People are willing to accept and go along with anything the rulers do , no matter how horrible and immoral, without asking any questions or putting up a fight. They just go along with it. The truth seekers and the revolutionaries have always been a small percentage of the population. The rest just don&#39;t give a fuck, they&#39;re like soulless mindless zombies </p>

I went through a pretty shitty time some years ago, and I remember having to ward off those thoughts lol. </p>

<p>I remember though, even when I was young, I used to think the world rendered like a video game lol. Like nothing would actually move or happen unless I looked. 
Sometimes you just see people doing things, and a “glitch” is the only explanation.</p>

<p>But in all seriousness. 
I think the theory is just that, a theory.</p>

<p>I think the world is just weird. But it’s very real.</p>

<p>While I can see this, on the flipside it would mean strengthening of resolve for many who believe they do have the inner voice.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>After all, distraction ops are child&#39;s play in comparison to demoralizing. One could argue that the vast majority of western civilization is built around distractions from questioning ones existence.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Demoralizing events that target those whose third eye isn&#39;t crusted with sleep takes 19 guys with boxcutters, though now the stakes have been escalated.</p>

<p>You gotta look at the bigger picture my friend. Who were &quot;most people&quot; in the past? The poor. The Plebs. Those who had nothing to their name and little to give their children. How can they focus on the politicians and the bigger picture when they struggle merely to put food on the table? The modern poor of 1st world nations are far better off than those in Ancient Rome. They are not and never were without conscious- they simply prioritized different aspects of life based on the situation they were born within.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This comment came first but I want to address it second- this seems to me more as a way to dehumanize and create division between those who believe (rightly or wrongly) that they are &quot;woke&quot; and those who are not. The sad Truth is that those who are ignorant, or those who kill others, or those who perpetrate genocide, are just as Human, just as awake as anyone else. This is the Duality, the True nature of man.</p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s not about not caring. It&#39;s about having to prioritize the absolute essentials of life over everything else. Caring about the Elite&#39;s and the bigger picture is far more easily done when your material needs such as food, shelter, and bills are taken care of than when they aren&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not just talking about centuries ago but as close as the 20th century. WW1 and WW2 were both bullshit wars and people knew it at the time. The information was out there but thanks to all of the mindless  sheep the US got dragged into both wars. People weren&#39;t all poor and illiterate back then. Hell  look how many people were willing to believe the obvious lies about the Iraq war</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think divisions are always a bad thing. If a minority group feels like they&#39;re all alone in the world it can tighten their bond and ultimately strengthen them. It&#39;s how (((they))) were able to take over the world </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true in the internet age. It&#39;s not like the average r/conspiracy user is living large. And anyway almost everybody in the west has their most basic needs taken care of </p>

<p>What if the intellogent creator is running us on an equivalent to a computer and it can only process so much at a time so the &quot;player characters&quot; can have a world running as smooth as possible without sacrificing immersion and the experience of being an autonomous human? So some run on a simpler algorithm than others. It would be very efficient if so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know what&#39;s the closest thing to &quot;NPCs&quot; or &quot;soulles humans&quot; or &quot;phylosophical zombies&quot;? You may not think very often about them, but you face them very often: dream people.</p>

<p>Try to explain how NPCs would work to someone, and soon you&#39;ll find it&#39;s very hard: do they fake their reactions? how can they react to stimuli if they don&#39;t feel stimuli?, etc.</p>

<p>But bring dream characters, the people we dream with (strangers that populate our dreams), and it becomes very easy.</p>

<p>When you are in a dream, those people seem very real, they react as you&#39;d expect, they can hold realistic conversations with you, nothing about them seems off, you actually believe there&#39;s someone there looking at you and perceiving you.</p>

<p>And then you wake up and realize none of it was real. That beautiful girl you were talking to? All a dream, you could actually have done anything you wanted to her without consequences, if only you knew you were dreaming!</p>

<p>Lucid dreamers take advantage of this to fulfill their fantasies. Sure, you may not be able to carry some interactions with some people in real life, but sure enough you can dream that you do.</p>

<p>Bizarrely enough, dream people very often stop acting &quot;normal&quot; once you realize you are dreaming, so the slice where it&#39;s real enough is slim, but I digress.</p>

<p>So that&#39;d answer many questions: no, NPCs don&#39;t react to stimuli, because they don&#39;t feel anything, they just act as if they do, if you&#39;re paying attention, to keep the illusion. I have actually tested this, you can see if someone is an NPC or not, for instance, on the bus. Go and put your hand on the bare arm of some girl, if she&#39;s &quot;real&quot; you&#39;ll get instant reaction, though usually not what you&#39;d expect. However, if it&#39;s a NPC, you get no reaction at all, specially, real people would turn around to see what is up and look at you, while NPCs don&#39;t seem to care.</p>

<p>When talking to them, ask them about what they think about some esotheric or obscure subject. Real ones would act curious and/or impressed about a subject that is new to them. Some even would tell you anecdotes about things like that that happened to them. NPCs don&#39;t show a reaction at all, and as answer, they&#39;d pick some common word that you used when you talked, and change the subject to focus on it. Say, you tell them how you never noticed the strange curl that the F has on the Ford logo, they&#39;ll mostly ignore what you said and start talking about a Ford car that they had or something.</p>

<p>The theory would go and join up with the &quot;simulation theory&quot;, except we wouldn&#39;t be in a computer simulation, but on a shared dream. Then, the same dream characters of our dreams would be pupulating the real world, but in a much more consistent and realistic way. That doesn&#39;t mean they can hear you or feel you or whatever, just like people in your dreams aren&#39;t really there, but both will act convincingly enough that you wouldn&#39;t be able to jump over some moral line because they&#39;re not real people anyway, becauee, what if they are? You can only jump that line if you go lucid on an actual dream.</p>

<p>If reality is truly fractal, phylosophical zombies are to be expected. On the other side, there&#39;s the theory that some people in your dreams are actually real (first, on the cases of shared dreams, where two people dream with each other but share the same experiences, and second, 4D or 5D entities that exist and manifest in your dreams - those seem to remember you on later dreams, they&#39;d reject not being real if you bring out the subject, and, you can extract original idead that wouldn&#39;t come from yourself when you talk to them.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alan Watts claims that we&#39;re the AI that put all the suffering and pain within the dream, ourselves, on purpose. Apparently we went on for a veeeery long while experiencing only the good stuff, and went fed up on happy endings.</p>

<p>The concept is that since we were kids, we were taught to reject the &quot;bad feelings&quot;, so as adults we feel bad about feeling bad, when instead, we should give ourself permission, and embrace, whatever way we feel like. Maybe we are dreaming to learn to appreciate all the feelings we can have, not just the pleasures.</p>

<p>feel bad about feeling bad</p>

<p>Absolutely agree here. It&#39;s like some kind of feedback loop, where the feeling would (often enough) be so minute and easy to deal with if only we didn&#39;t balk at having it at all. I&#39;ve found in the past that it helps to just acknowledge it as another feeling, and trying not to assign any kind of positive or negative to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Test in the waking world, with actual people. The best way to try it is to purposely put those people in your way (say, there&#39;s your seat on the bus and a free seat, when someone wants to sit, you move to the window), that way, you&#39;ll have to interact with them so they get out of the way to let you pass, and testing for any reactions looks natural (because you want to get their attention.)</p>

<p>Strangely enough, real people tend to react before you touch them, just at the very slight indication that you&#39;d want to get out, they&#39;d turn around or stand up to let you pass. They&#39;re alert.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with having physical contact with other human beings, we live in a society where we&#39;re all set by default as &quot;strangers&quot;, and strangers are supposed to keep their distance from each other, which makes people feel lonely and isolated, for no reason at all.</p>

<p>But, look at children, specially, children that don&#39;t know each other and have gathered in some party or such. They&#39;ll have lots of physical contact while playing, naturally. They haven&#39;t learned the system&#39;s &quot;other people are strangers, you should stay away&quot; concept.</p>

<p>In a future without artificial scarcity where you can go out your home and trust everyone you find, I don&#39;t see a need for the &quot;stranger&quot; concept, so as it stops being taught, adults will treat each other like close friends, including a lot more physical contact, like children do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny that you mention the FORD logo....  The only time I&#39;ve heard people talk about &quot;NPCs&quot; is in reference to the Mandela Effect.    </p>

<p>In my experience, NPCs are very prone to what appears to be cognitive dissonance.  (It may not be <em>actual</em> cognitive dissonance, but just a programmed reflex of anger when confronted with things that don&#39;t fit their world-view).    </p>

<p>What&#39;s very strange is that the NPCs seem to be decreasing in number (at least this is what i&#39;ve seen)... which makes it strange that more people are talking about it.  When I was young, something like 90% of people I interacted with seemed to be zombies.  Now its more like 50%.    </p>

<p>A decrease in the number of apparent zombies fits with my personal theory on what is causing the Mandela Effect, which is.....    </p>

<p>We each live in our own universe, defined by our observation of it.  Our universe is loosely connected with the universes of other people, interlinking due to the interaction of our minds.  Where there is agreement in observation, patches of the universes merge. Where there is disagreement in observation, there is a disharmony that must be resolved...  (people will argue, then look together, and see who was right).<br/>
For tens of thousands of years, the collective universe you lived in was what you and your tribe observed.  We told our stories, we worshiped our gods, and we all saw the same world.  Then suddenly global communications happened.  Now 7 billion people must agree on one world.  There are conflicting universes, filled with natives (people who natively share one world-view), and NPCs, who fill in for people who you know should exist in your universe, but actually live in another.  As the universes slowly converge, there will be less NPCs.  A good thing, i think.  Less mindless assholes talking up space, replaced by the originals who have souls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. However, I think that our &quot;personal universes&quot; are very small.</p>

<p>When one hears the world universe, we think of something gigantic that encompasses everything that exist, but I think these universes we live in only go as far as what we can perceive. Like, if you have a window in front of you and light goes through it, the only sun light that exists in your universe is the one that goes through that window.</p>

<p>The rest of the sunlight is just in all superpositions of possibilities, but they don&#39;t matter, because you&#39;re not perceiving the light that hits the back of your house. If you go out and look at it, all that light is perceived and exists on your universe.</p>

<p>Something extraordinary happened with the Internet, as it forced us to extend our personal universes to include what we interact with. So now I form part of your universe, because all the possibilities of messages I could have written had to collapse into this one for you to read it.</p>

<p>I find very interesting your theory that NPCs are just people that live in another universe, which would presumably in their universe perceive ME as an NPC?</p>

<p>Sadly, I&#39;ve had experiences the other way around, with people I had known in the past, that acted &quot;real&quot;, and didn&#39;t left a single doubt about their &quot;realness&quot;, later on acting like NPCs, as if they were no longer part of my reality?</p>

<p>So I now wonder if we come from different worlds, and in my path the NPCs have increased, while in yours they have decreased.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Original Poster, check out a book called &quot;The Convoluted Universe,&quot; by Dolores Cannon. Cannon was a hypnotherapist, who would place people into trances to access their &quot;higher selves&quot;. A lot of the information she got was fascinating. One of the weird cases was a woman who was put under, and she casually mentioned &quot;Backdrop People&quot;. Cannon was confused, and asked her to back up and tell her what she meant by the term.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The patient, in a sort of Mesmeric trance, answered matter-of-factly that not every human on Earth had a soul. There were what video-gamers would call &quot;Non-playable characters&quot;. These &quot;Backdrop People&quot; were placed on the planet for one reason: To deflect higher-vibrational humans off the path of righteousness, to trap their souls here.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Humans are being harvested. The energy they give off. The demiurge who created this physical universe doesn&#39;t want us to cycle out. He wants us to remain here, reincarnating forever . . . so that he can harvest us.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&quot;Backdrop People&quot; are placed here to keep you low-vibrational. To stunt your path to spiritual progress.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>By the way, check out what a remote viewing group saw when they were tasked into looking into reincarnation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNXYuteD4rQ&amp;amp;t=311s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNXYuteD4rQ&amp;t=311s</a></p>

<p>That fact that a good chunk of people don&#39;t experience inner monolgue blows my mind. How can you go through out your day not thinking and speaking internally what you see? I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re right, you&#39;re probably wrong, but this is truly bizarre. Maybe there&#39;s some hierarchy of human thought that only some humans experience. Maybe some humans are better than others on a basis that isn&#39;t physical. Fuck it, we&#39;re probably in a simulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you can try it out, I think. Just silence your inner voice, ignore it when it pops up, and in a couple minutes that inner voice should be pretty relaxed not chattering. Then start planning a trip to the grocery store, or make a sandwich. It&#39;s pretty neat and relaxing I think.</p>

<p>Another thing about the study -- I don&#39;t think the study meant that only 26% of the people sampled had the inner voice phenomenon, but that across all of the samples taken, 26% were inner voice. It reads like the study design was:</p>

<p>1) give 30 people beepers</p>

<p>2) when a subject&#39;s beeper would beep, they would record the state of their &#39;pristine consciousness&#39; (what they were doing mentally at the time of the beep, from a sample of I think 5 categories the researchers chose)</p>

<p>It did say there was at least one person who had did not report inner voice, but I don&#39;t think it said how many. It probably wasn&#39;t many, though: across all samples of pristine consciousness 26% were inner voice, and the median value across subjects is 20% (same number of values above and below). </p>

<p>So I think it&#39;s more accurate to interpret the article as, in general those sampled reported experiencing inner voice 20% of the time, and 26% of all samples collected were reports of inner voice. However some subjects reported inner voice up to 75% of the times sampled, while others did not report inner voice a single time. in conclusion wtf lol.</p>

<p>This is just what I got from looking at the psych today article (dangerzone but could be worse). If you would like I could try to find a copy of the paper and give that a looksie :), but if the article was accurate I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what it would all mean.</p>

<p>How can you go through out your day not thinking and speaking internally what you are seeing and experiencing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first the thought of no inner monologue seems bad, but then I think of drawing and painting ... when I get deeply into a drawing or painting the words go away and I am &quot;in the flow,&quot; and I begin &#39;thinking&#39; in shades or colors. I am not &quot;aware&quot; of it at the time, but when I&#39;m drawing a pastel portrait my mind thinks there is an imbalance in the portrait and I add more brown or purple until it is dark enough, or I add white or yellow until it is in balance. If an eye or a lip is not quite right I add to the eye or lip, or I subtract by adding bordering flesh ...</p>

<p>I am told it is somewhat the same with musicians, when a note is wrong the don&#39;t think, &quot;D flat is wrong&quot; or whatever, it just feels wrong or out of place, and they move thier hands on the fretboard, or the keyboard, until they locate the &#39;correct&#39; sound.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m adding color to a lip or an eye, I fumble at pencils and add, and if it is not quite right, I fumble for a lighter or darker pencil. It is really truely relaxing to no longer have to deal with the constant inner-monologue, to serenely &#39;think&#39; in colors and shades and shapes. People refer to it as &quot;flow,&quot; or &quot;in the flow,&quot; and compare it to meditation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is something in the human brain called the &quot;default mode network&quot;. The DMN is the part of your brain that starts working when you aren&#39;t really doing anything. (It&#39;s also the part of the brain that works as the traffic director for all the parts of your brain so the conscious you can make sense of what&#39;s going on with the billions of neural synapses that fire off without having to use up any of your mental &quot;RAM&quot; but that&#39;s another lesson) The DMN is the evolved part that is more active and developed in intelligent creatures. It is the reason you talk to yourself, it&#39;s the part of you that focuses on the past to make a simulation of the future. Its why you will have 30 conversations of a conversation you have yet to have. It is the pattern maker and recegnizor. And usually the more active it is, the higher your IQ tends to be because you are constantly working problems and thinking them. Interestingly enough there is a big correlation between people who spend time with lot of time with their DMN running on high and people who are depressed. (There is so much more to say in the subject it&#39;s ridiculous that we are not teaching the human mind to children.)</p>

<p>On the flip side, there are ways to quite the network gaining access to your body and minds more instinct side instead of the analytical side. This is usually referred to a state of &quot;flow&quot; when your DMN stops filtering and forcing you to think and instead let&#39;s more information through and letting your instincts go on a sort of subconscious autopilot. Most people experience this when they pay a sport or get really into a video game. Some people may feel it at work if the are in intense situations that you trained for, or if you are doing a repetitive monotonous task. There are other ways to quite down the DMN other than activity and that&#39;s with meditation. NOW because the DMN is usually on at full blast when nothing is going on, it&#39;s usually really hard to actually teach a true statement of meditation....I mean getting to an actual point where you are sitting there and not thinking.....ABOUT ANYTHING.....SO FUCKING HARD ACTUALLY....anyways, chants and mantras and old tribal music and dance where usually designed around getting people to shut off their inner voice and kinda just go with the flow and be &quot;as one&quot; so thats an easier way to get your mind used to shutting off. And last, and my most favorite, YOU CAN SHUT IT OFF BY TAKING PSYCHEDELICS! That&#39;s right, when one takes psychedelics their DMN takes a break, letting your ego take a break too. It litterally changes the way you think, letting you escape old habits that your DMN has constructed for you. Again, I can go on a lecture length rant on this stuff, but I suggest y&#39;all look some up on any of the subjects I mentioned. It&#39;s the brain you have and the same brain everyone else has, it&#39;s best to know how it works.</p>

<p>TLDR: brains are weird, the voice in your head is the part that let&#39;s you regret, but also let&#39;s you learn from those regrets so it can be dangerous but also very helpful. People who can&#39;t handle their emotions (IMO) tend to shut that part off letting their life go on a type of auto pilot</p>

<p>Meditation is the opposite of self reflection and any type of reflection at all. And it can be accessed many ways.</p>

<p>Some other stuff</p>

<p>Somebody is trying to justify the de-humanization a large sector of the population via some pseudoscientific hogwash. Trying to sway some into believing they&#39;re special, they&#39;re <em>chosen</em>, that the rest are mindless, soulless sheep.</p>

<p>This reeks to me of an attempt to misdirect impressionable people. Of a social experiment without good intentions. Of a nasty psyop to entrap some foolish groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After recently watching Lord of the Rings again, I&#39;d have to say the Ring definitely symbolizes technology (more specifically in these days it represents computer/electronic technology).  I found myself doing my normal rounds at work, reached in my pocket for my phone to play some music and realized I made the same exact motion Bilbo did when reaching for his ring that wasn&#39;t there.  What really resonated with me was I had left the phone to charge in the break room, so the moment was pretty much exactly like the film.  I reached in with one finger to hook my phone and was left empty handed.</p>

<p>In a greater sense, I see the Ring as the Internet/Electronics in general and Sauron as a tremendous AI. It see&#39;s you when using it, it bind&#39;s us all (internet) and can instantly gratify any desire (violence, porn, r/aww, drugs, escapism etc). All facets that the ring bears as well.  Darkness is spreading (ignorance) and our world is falling from Forests to Server Farms.  </p>

<p>I agree with you that it may not be that these people are soulless npcs, but that they may just be turned &quot;off&quot; for the moment and can be turned back &quot;on&quot;.  There is a concerted effort to blind our third eye through calcification through fluoride, caffeine and over-stimulation, this I definitely know.  In most big movements (like the Civil War and the like) there was a small galvanized faction of 2-4% of the population that helped sway those in the bell of the curve.  I see this in history a lot, that there are two opposing sides of a very small percentage of the population that try and reach the ~80%+ in the middle to follow their beliefs.</p>

<p>Moreover the 25% that do hear it, are here, not simply as an example but to help those others, insofar as they can, on their own many individual journeys to becoming more, and more, aware of themselves <em>as souls</em> who have all been pursuing that very same goal on this material plane from well before the very beginning of time and will continue on these many physical journeys until they ultimately have an &quot;epiphany&quot; that makes that revelation unequivocally and abundantly clear to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t consider myself &quot;religious&quot;, more of a spiritual person. I believe in souls, but maybe a different spin on it. I think they are one of two things.</p>

<p>One, souls are actually part of a greater life force and close to what Christians think of as a soul.</p>

<p>The other theory of mine plays into the stimulation theory, and our &quot;souls&quot; are higher beings basically playing a game of &quot;Roy&quot; like in Rick and Morty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t view the notion of &quot;souls&quot; with biases associated with the rejection of organized religion</p>

<p>The &quot;souls&quot; described are more like energy. As one walks through life, they pick up energy in the form of positivity and negativity. They propagate that energy by amplifying it with their own behavior. (think of responding to bad news with rage vs responding with calm, cool, collected thought) When an individual dies they release their final bits of energy (particularly resonating within loved ones) into the universe.</p>

<p>Ones soul is a collection of experience and energy that can be weaponized or used for kindness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can confirm this theory. For a while I thought I was being gang stalked. However, eventually I accepted that I don’t do anything that would make the government spy on me, to that degree. This post connected all of events for me. </p>

<p>A few months ago I was working at a bar. For the first time in my life i had quit porn, unhealthy eating, and had cut out all the negativity in my life. That lasted for about two weeks. What’s weird is, during that entire two weeks, there was a person that came to my bar at the last minute and made me stay on the clock until 1-2 in the morning. We weren’t allowed to leave until everyone was done drinking. </p>

<p>What makes it even weirder is all of these people/brings knew I was spiritual. Even though the conversations fit my interest they drained me. When I got home I was tired, had brain fog, and felt horrible in every way. To provide context, I am only 25 and I never felt this way. It felt like I had the flu. As soon as I got home everything would be okay. </p>

<p>Guess what? After that two weeks I ended up going back to porn, unhealthy foods, and started skipping the gym again. What I never realized was they were also gathering information on me. One guy asked me for my address because he wanted to “send me a book” and Another guy asked for email so he could “help me get a job”. </p>

<p>Out of my own ignorance I didn’t understand what was going on at the time. It wasn’t until I was high that I put the pieces together. Again, I thought I was deliberately being stalked by people. I went back to my unhealthy life and I fell back into my depression. I am slowly raising my vibration again and guess what? It’s starting again.</p>

<p>The same guy walks passed my house at the same time every day. The first time he came he made a comment about liking my car. When I doing something beneficial to my spirit at work someone always randomly walks into my job wanting something. That ain’t normal where I work. When I try to abstain my sexual thoughts my girlfriend will always try to initiate sex.. she has never been the person to do that. I could go on for days. </p>

<p>In short, there is a 100% chance this is true. If you go to Chicago or New York and sit and watch you can actual see how many people are on auto pilot. You can look into people’s eyes and see that there is nothing there. There is no deep thoughts. There is no logic. Those people are nothing more than fleshy robots. Soon to be replaced by real new robots. </p>

<p>In short, our brains makes patterns from what we see, and what we see makes our reality.  If you start seeing strange stuff around more, you will start seeing more strange stuff. If you start looking for pennies in the street, then you will attach significance to finding pennies in the street. If you are horny and are conscious about your sexual thoughts and feelings (almost all of us are not) then you are more likely to pick up on actions of others that fit in with that mode of consciousness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had this theory for the past X years.  I try not to think about it because, IMO, it either means we need to learn how to control others in order to regain control over our own lives (which opposes some personal values), or it means we&#39;ll never be in control and someone else is that apparently doesn&#39;t like us.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s technically perfect.  I just believe you can get so confused and coddled that your voice is just oppressed with nonsense you picked up to survive.  </p>

<p>I had a colleague, former friend, that I abandoned because I realized he had no integrity.  He wasn&#39;t able to realize things like &quot;you know what I meant&quot; put the burden of understanding him on me , instead of himself.  </p>

<p>I ultimately told him I think we shouldn&#39;t speak until he&#39;s fully independent, which might not come until his family abandoned him.  I can somewhat recall when I was younger and I just did anything I &quot;felt&quot; like doing, like blowing my paycheck by going out that night, and being broke a couple days before the next one.  I chased money thinking once I had enough I could relax.  Eventually, I got a bunch and realized you can&#39;t pay anyone to give a shit about you and even if you had proof that they wronged you, you need even more to use the courts to get it back.  </p>

<p>But this friend had this blind trust that things would work out and people would always care for him and I think that&#39;s what prevented him from feeling the need to recursively look into things and see whether they added up consistently or if it was just an easy explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is a lazy and inaccurate view caused by an empathy disconnect. </p>

<p>Every human has complex inner thoughts even if they aren&#39;t articulated, with organic brain damage being the only exception. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s this theory going around 4chan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was started as a joke and further supports the concept that this misperception is caused by empathy disconnect. </p>

<p>The thing is, humans are pack animals. It&#39;s in our genes to follow, that&#39;s how we survived a fucking ice age, because we banded together. </p>

<p>You cannot have group cohesion without some concessions to the whole at the cost of the individual. </p>

<p>It&#39;s called the Social Contract, and it&#39;s older than words. </p>

<p>When 4chan condemns the majority of the world as sheep, they ignore what a world full of only wolves would look like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t this the official belief of Judaism? Only Jews descending from Abraham are real people with souls, the rest are NPCs. One of the reasons Judaism has been so hated historically by people not of Abrahamic descent (people don&#39;t like being dehumanised), and why Jews do not convert new believers (NPCs aren&#39;t welcome).

    <div class="md"><p>I’m areligious, but, There are theories going around that if you don’t accept Jesus Christ of Nazareth (and/or Otis Redding of Dawson) as your savior you will spend an eternity drowning in your worst sins. Also some theories that we were seeded by outer-realm beings to this planet, despite evidence of biological evolution all around us. Do seeds have souls or grow souls?</p>

<p>Either all people have souls or none of us do. This is the type of cultish thinking that falls directly into a divide and conquer scheme, whether nefariously planned or not. And as a philosophical point this is such a boring thing for this sub to discuss. What does it matter if we have souls or not?</p>

<p>How many people here think they’re NPC and how many think they have souls and “get it?” This is ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some people who move up Into their dreams and demons take over their conciousness. There are people whose lives are ran completely. No free will. All their decisions are made for them etc.. Its important to know this if you&#39;ve had a rough life because it was probably the devil the whole time causing it. Even bad decisions you made (sinful) could have not even have been your decision. Im on of these people and my life is all messed up because of it. I know its now my fault though.</p>

<p>Even being redpilled wasnt really my doing. I was steered into it. </p>

<p>Notice how most of the redpill stuff is based of germanics or people from the northern hemisphere? There&#39;s a reason they steer you into it. Its so they can make you feel guilty later. Especially with &quot;minority&quot; dealings.</p>

<p>The npcs are people who are owned by the devil/Satan. They don&#39;t eave a choice. Unless Im wrong and people who say &quot;normies&quot; are actually being controlled as well. </p>

<p>Its all about the brain and nervous system and time manipulation. Its about judgment as well. Most of us are or can be controlled if your on a list. Some are controlled since the day they are born and some become controlled because of their actions whilst using their free will (assuming they ever had free will and it wasnt another entity creating the scenarios in their lives.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there is some sort of hive mind... don&#39;t know if they&#39;re NPC&#39;s or what the deal is... </p>

<p>I remember one day lots of bullshit in the skies. So I&#39;m pretty bored at the time and I&#39;m like what the heck I&#39;ll call the local airport and ask to speak to the &quot;chemtrail department.&quot; I&#39;m talking to the guy for a few minutes all kinds of lol going on, and the moment I look outside my window for a brief second a damn cop car does a u-turn right in front of my house. I live more in a back end area and while cops do occasionally drive by, it&#39;s pretty rare. And for the cop to do a u-turn? The probability is even lower. And for the cop to do it the exact moment I look out the window? Probability even lower. I could sit there for days, weeks, months and that shit wouldn&#39;t happen the way it did. Now I&#39;m not a dummy I did it off an anonymous number and still... I know most people will be like coincidence but I&#39;ve had way too many coincidences over the years and at this point I&#39;m pretty convinced there is a hive mind. Now are they soul-less drones connected to some central computer or just being influenced by a 3rd party, perhaps spirtiual entities, or maybe they&#39;re some sort of entities themselves... I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>&quot;Moreover, it happens fairly often that essence dies in a man while his personality

already dead. </p>

<p>It is fortunate for us that we do not see and do not know it. If we knew what a number of people are actually dead and what a number of these dead people govern our lives, we should go mad with horror. And indeed people often do go mad because they find out something of this nature without the proper preparation, that is, they see something they are not supposed to see. In order to see without danger one must be on the way. If a man who can do nothing sees the truth he will certainly go mad. Only this rarely happens. Usually everything is so arranged that a man can see nothing
prematurely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh. Well a few thoughts of mine.</p>

<p>The &quot;are people secret NPCs&quot; talk scares me a little. I can&#39;t properly access the mind of a killer, but I feel like this string of thought can lead certain types to some unconscionable actions. Just the dehumanization element to the theory seems dangerous. Relating to OP&#39;s point that people just &quot;go along with it&quot;, there are plenty of human (and animal) studies that might illustrate learned helplessness and similar psychological responses to adverse struggle. </p>

<p>And in reading some of these other comments.. I mean people. Just because someone&#39;s eyes &quot;don&#39;t light up&quot; at the mention of your favorite conspiracy theory or recent news item it doesn&#39;t mean they are soulless or robots. For example, some people have anxiety and talking about aliens and dimensional shifts can be overwhelming. Some people have families and have just finished working long shifts and do not care about you or much of the immediate world around them. I feel like a lot of considerations are not being made here.</p>

<p>Although, it is true. You could compare certain behaviors of people to literal and figurative zombies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are several articles by the psychologist Hulburt. I recommend reading through them to get more information. 4chan is technically wrong about most people not having an inner voice. From the study, Hulburt identified 5 very common forms of thought, including inner speech. Subjects were given beepers and asked to record what they were thinking right before the time of the random beep. </p>

<p>The five forms of thought are: inner speech, inner seeing, feelings, sensory awareness, and unsymbolic thinking. The last two are considerably more complex and abstract, with most subjects being totally unaware they experience this type of thought , and, paradoxically, that it was the most prevalent form of thought they had. </p>

But it is up to you to make the right decisions in your life and a soul is you.

Your problem solving skills. The actions you make and people you love and care about. And many more attributes are all part of your soul. Your mental strength and free will in life are important factors. Also your ability to think for yourself too.

    <div class="md"><p>I am not religious-- and it is extraordinary to me that some folks don&#39;t have an inner voice... but to say that they are soulless humans? To lump people you are unfamiliar with into a pool of &quot;sheep&quot; who have no thoughts or emotions? It is absolutely disgusting to me.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I have been a long time subscriber to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and I think that this is one of the most unsettling things that I&#39;ve ever read here. How dare you trivialize the thoughts, emotions, experiences, and souls of\ billions of people that you don&#39;t know. Just because you are more / less informed, more / less &quot;woke&quot; indicated no such thing as soullessness in the larger population.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>NPC theory is a sickness. I love this subreddit and I love being a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;. Looking at everything from all angles and coming to my own conclusions about my interpretation of reality is a privilege. This is the essence of human logic. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>DO NOT think that you are somehow more or less &quot;special&quot; than other people.</p>

<p>HOW DARE YOU say that people who are less informed than you have &quot;no soul&quot;. </p>

<p>You say that the truth seekers and revolutionaries have always been a small percentage of the population and that&#39;s true. My grandma isn&#39;t browsing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and watching youtube videos about AJ and Syrian gas attacks. She&#39;s old and tired.</p>

<p>But for ANY of you to jump to the conclusion, to the narcissistic and egotistical conclusion that the people surrounding you on this planet in their day to day lives have no emotions, feelings, hardships, happiness&#39;s, or for lack of a better word-- SOULS, shame the fuck on you bro. I&#39;m out. This is full on disillusion with reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are not words just cues to retrieve information that one has acquired from their environments? So wouldn&#39;t those without an inner monologue be less NPC like? And wouldn&#39;t someone that is incapable  of acquiring information from their environments be severely autistic and/or mentally disabled? And wouldn&#39;t these people - those with an inability to generate thoughts - be the most &quot;soulless&quot; by this logic? And wasn&#39;t Einstein somewhat autistic? Would he be a cyborg?...
Seems like a wacky theory to me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the &quot;inner voice&quot; manifests differently in different people.  for example, one subset of the population has an extremely <em>powerful</em> inner voice - they&#39;re called schizophrenics.  If you mean to suggest that sufferers of a debilitating mental disorder are the protagonists of humanity, be my guest.</p>

<p>there&#39;s a simpler explanation for what NPC theory purports to explain: most people are <em>scared of consequences.</em>  Anyone can do the sorts of things a PC would in a video game <em>in an video game</em>; there are no consequences.  The fear response is stronger in some people than others, for a myriad of reasons.</p>

<p>Absolutely agree here. It&#39;s like some kind of feedback loop, where the feeling would (often enough) be so minute and easy to deal with if only we didn&#39;t balk at having it at all. I&#39;ve found in the past that it helps to just acknowledge it as another feeling, and trying not to assign any kind of positive or negative to it.</p>
