       There's this theory going around 4chan based off this study that said only like 25% of the population has an inner voice. So someone came up with the theory that most people alive today are NPC's (non player characters), meaning they're not really autonomous human beings with souls, but they're more like unconscious beings who just respond to stimuli without really thinking. There are a finite number of souls in the world that just keep getting recycled into new bodies, but with the explosion in human population many people are left without souls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that study may have been dubious but I can't help but feel there is some validity to this theory. It explains how the majority of the population throughout history have always been sheep, and today it's so much worse. People are willing to accept and go along with anything the rulers do , no matter how horrible and immoral, without asking any questions or putting up a fight. They just go along with it. The truth seekers and the revolutionaries have always been a small percentage of the population. The rest just don't give a fuck, they're like soulless mindless zombies

       Just blinders... Steel reinforced blinders. They're world view is constricted, that's all. You can look into their eyes and know they have souls. Someone who's diagnosed as a psychopath is the kind of person with no soul. You can see the voidness in their eyes. The people blinders, it's not void, just foggy... At least that's how I see it.

       I get that side of it too. It is kind of suspicious .But i can't help but believe this theory has a lot of truth to it. It's just something I've felt for so long but couldn't really explain. It doesn't really demoralize me though . It strengthens my faith in the people with souls.

       This.
I went through a pretty shitty time some years ago, and I remember having to ward off those thoughts lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember though, even when I was young, I used to think the world rendered like a video game lol. Like nothing would actually move or happen unless I looked. 
Sometimes you just see people doing things, and a “glitch” is the only explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in all seriousness. 
I think the theory is just that, a theory.

       I think the world is just weird. But it’s very real.

       While I can see this, on the flipside it would mean strengthening of resolve for many who believe they do have the inner voice.

       After all, distraction ops are child's play in comparison to demoralizing. One could argue that the vast majority of western civilization is built around distractions from questioning ones existence.

       You gotta look at the bigger picture my friend. Who were "most people" in the past? The poor. The Plebs. Those who had nothing to their name and little to give their children. How can they focus on the politicians and the bigger picture when they struggle merely to put food on the table? The modern poor of 1st world nations are far better off than those in Ancient Rome. They are not and never were without conscious- they simply prioritized different aspects of life based on the situation they were born within.

       This comment came first but I want to address it second- this seems to me more as a way to dehumanize and create division between those who believe (rightly or wrongly) that they are "woke" and those who are not. The sad Truth is that those who are ignorant, or those who kill others, or those who perpetrate genocide, are just as Human, just as awake as anyone else. This is the Duality, the True nature of man.

       Again, it's not about not caring. It's about having to prioritize the absolute essentials of life over everything else. Caring about the Elite's and the bigger picture is far more easily done when your material needs such as food, shelter, and bills are taken care of than when they aren't.

       I'm not just talking about centuries ago but as close as the 20th century. WW1 and WW2 were both bullshit wars and people knew it at the time. The information was out there but thanks to all of the mindless  sheep the US got dragged into both wars. People weren't all poor and illiterate back then. Hell  look how many people were willing to believe the obvious lies about the Iraq war
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think divisions are always a bad thing. If a minority group feels like they're all alone in the world it can tighten their bond and ultimately strengthen them. It's how (((they))) were able to take over the world
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that's true in the internet age. It's not like the average r/conspiracy user is living large. And anyway almost everybody in the west has their most basic needs taken care of

       I think it still all ties back to Life and distractions. We are kept intentionally ignorant and distracted. This doesn't make People soulless. It just makes them victims. Doesn't mean they are ultimately innocent but we need to be careful in considering methods of dehumanization.

       The big Banks funded both sides... There are newspaper articles and movies and other media that calls it a phony war.. not phony as in didn't happen, but phony as in people are pulling the strings on both sides

       I'm only just learning about this stuff now so I can't give you a detailed answer but look at a graph of the world population going back 1000 years and it was mostly stagnant, and then it exploded a little over 100 years ago. I don't believe souls can be created, only reborn. I know it's not proof

       Ok and I was just curious to hear your thoughts. That said, I don't believe the world population is actually what they say it is. I think it is drastically less.

       Moving on to souls. If we indeed have them then that would imply intelligent creation of them. It would seem highly illogical that the same intelligent creator could not create more. Wouldn't it?

       Just to play devils advocate to your last bit, not saying I actually believe this.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the intellogent creator is running us on an equivalent to a computer and it can only process so much at a time so the "player characters" can have a world running as smooth as possible without sacrificing immersion and the experience of being an autonomous human? So some run on a simpler algorithm than others. It would be very efficient if so.

       Anything is possible I suppose. That idea is just getting too far into the area of transhumanism and simulation theory for my liking. I've looked into it and it has it's merits but I think there is an agenda behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simulation theory is becoming more and more mainstream and that sends up some major red flags for me. But alas, I don't know and all I know is that I'm here for the ride for one reason or another.

       Why does that need to be  "who" that created the soul? Perhaps this a naturally occurring phenomenon either within or extraneous from our universe. We aren't necessarily aware of every force in out universe, and we certainly do not know about what lies beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
       We discover what is opaque, study what we see, and question what we don't understand. We are not limited by the religious stories or scientific explanation we have, and we are not aware of a rule that says that this all all there is.

       Everything is created. Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, just transferred. Maybe it was one creator or many. I don't know. All I know is something cannot come from nothing. You are rationalizing and justifying.  There is nothing wrong with being spiritual dude. You sound at odds.

Just process every intelligence one by one for cycles of a Planck length each; it might take you billions of real years to update everyone's consciousnesses but to them it'll seem like time is normal and continuous since they don't perceive the gap where other people are being updated.

       do admit I wonder about the very shallow thinking and speech lack of awareness outside of a small circle, like living in a village and not even knowing there are great cities,  of some I have met in childhood, and as an adult.

       I am not inclined to think we have a soul or spirit that is separate from our physical self. Something survives, and I have some speculations but I can't find any of the soul or spirit based ideas as I have seen them presented, believable.

Anyway, the study and historical diagnosis of national life-cycles is available in books and internet.

       Sounds like just a poorly worded survey where people didn't understand the real question.  Have 100 subjects mediate for 10 minutes without inner thoughts but to write down inner thoughts and continue if they do.  You will get 98 full pages of garbage thoughts.

       You poor soul!
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously though i think we’re all souls in bodies but some of us allow the noise of our bodies to drown out the relatively quiet inner voice. Meditation has been shown to reduce the noise thereby increasing “consciousness” or the apparent volume of the voice.

       It first came up talking about my mental health. I suffer from bouts of depression and I remember saying that my inner chatter starts to work overdrive during this. She didn't quite understand what I mean, and I explained the entire thing to her. She explained to me that she thinks only with her minds eye and visualizes everything. It's still mind blowing to me. Interestingly enough, her memory is impeccable. I've never met someone who can recall things from so long ago down to the finest detail as accurately as she can. Photographic memory perhaps.

       More optimistic but similar would be that humans souls can be created and recycled. Some folks seem entirely out of the loop because they have brand new souls crafted at demand and others may inherit older souls, giving them age beyond their years.

       Do you know what's the closest thing to "NPCs" or "soulles humans" or "phylosophical zombies"? You may not think very often about them, but you face them very often: dream people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to explain how NPCs would work to someone, and soon you'll find it's very hard: do they fake their reactions? how can they react to stimuli if they don't feel stimuli?, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But bring dream characters, the people we dream with (strangers that populate our dreams), and it becomes very easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you are in a dream, those people seem very real, they react as you'd expect, they can hold realistic conversations with you, nothing about them seems off, you actually believe there's someone there looking at you and perceiving you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you wake up and realize none of it was real. That beautiful girl you were talking to? All a dream, you could actually have done anything you wanted to her without consequences, if only you knew you were dreaming!
      </p>
      <p>
       Lucid dreamers take advantage of this to fulfill their fantasies. Sure, you may not be able to carry some interactions with some people in real life, but sure enough you can dream that you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bizarrely enough, dream people very often stop acting "normal" once you realize you are dreaming, so the slice where it's real enough is slim, but I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that'd answer many questions: no, NPCs don't react to stimuli, because they don't feel anything, they just act as if they do, if you're paying attention, to keep the illusion. I have actually tested this, you can see if someone is an NPC or not, for instance, on the bus. Go and put your hand on the bare arm of some girl, if she's "real" you'll get instant reaction, though usually not what you'd expect. However, if it's a NPC, you get no reaction at all, specially, real people would turn around to see what is up and look at you, while NPCs don't seem to care.
      </p>
      <p>
       When talking to them, ask them about what they think about some esotheric or obscure subject. Real ones would act curious and/or impressed about a subject that is new to them. Some even would tell you anecdotes about things like that that happened to them. NPCs don't show a reaction at all, and as answer, they'd pick some common word that you used when you talked, and change the subject to focus on it. Say, you tell them how you never noticed the strange curl that the F has on the Ford logo, they'll mostly ignore what you said and start talking about a Ford car that they had or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory would go and join up with the "simulation theory", except we wouldn't be in a computer simulation, but on a shared dream. Then, the same dream characters of our dreams would be pupulating the real world, but in a much more consistent and realistic way. That doesn't mean they can hear you or feel you or whatever, just like people in your dreams aren't really there, but both will act convincingly enough that you wouldn't be able to jump over some moral line because they're not real people anyway, becauee, what if they are? You can only jump that line if you go lucid on an actual dream.
      </p>
      <p>
       If reality is truly fractal, phylosophical zombies are to be expected. On the other side, there's the theory that some people in your dreams are actually real (first, on the cases of shared dreams, where two people dream with each other but share the same experiences, and second, 4D or 5D entities that exist and manifest in your dreams - those seem to remember you on later dreams, they'd reject not being real if you bring out the subject, and, you can extract original idead that wouldn't come from yourself when you talk to them.)

       Yeah probably we are in some kind of shared dream, probably mediated through very advanced technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       But maybe the controlling AI of that system went a bit crazy as time went on, that could explain the occurence of a lot of suffering and pain within our dream.

       Alan Watts claims that we're the AI that put all the suffering and pain within the dream, ourselves, on purpose. Apparently we went on for a veeeery long while experiencing only the good stuff, and went fed up on happy endings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concept is that since we were kids, we were taught to reject the "bad feelings", so as adults we feel bad about feeling bad, when instead, we should give ourself permission, and embrace, whatever way we feel like. Maybe we are dreaming to learn to appreciate all the feelings we can have, not just the pleasures.

       Absolutely agree here. It's like some kind of feedback loop, where the feeling would (often enough) be so minute and easy to deal with if only we didn't balk at having it at all. I've found in the past that it helps to just acknowledge it as another feeling, and trying not to assign any kind of positive or negative to it.

       Test in the waking world, with actual people. The best way to try it is to purposely put those people in your way (say, there's your seat on the bus and a free seat, when someone wants to sit, you move to the window), that way, you'll have to interact with them so they get out of the way to let you pass, and testing for any reactions looks natural (because you want to get their attention.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Strangely enough, real people tend to react before you touch them, just at the very slight indication that you'd want to get out, they'd turn around or stand up to let you pass. They're alert.

       Cool perspective...
Makes me remember being told in school, that the brain can't just come up with random faces for your dreams. That all the people in your dreams are "real" and that you have noticed them, even as a face in a crowd at some point in your life.

       There's nothing wrong with having physical contact with other human beings, we live in a society where we're all set by default as "strangers", and strangers are supposed to keep their distance from each other, which makes people feel lonely and isolated, for no reason at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, look at children, specially, children that don't know each other and have gathered in some party or such. They'll have lots of physical contact while playing, naturally. They haven't learned the system's "other people are strangers, you should stay away" concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a future without artificial scarcity where you can go out your home and trust everyone you find, I don't see a need for the "stranger" concept, so as it stops being taught, adults will treat each other like close friends, including a lot more physical contact, like children do.

       Funny that you mention the FORD logo....  The only time I've heard people talk about "NPCs" is in reference to the Mandela Effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my experience, NPCs are very prone to what appears to be cognitive dissonance.  (It may not be
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       cognitive dissonance, but just a programmed reflex of anger when confronted with things that don't fit their world-view).
      </p>
      <p>
       What's very strange is that the NPCs seem to be decreasing in number (at least this is what i've seen)... which makes it strange that more people are talking about it.  When I was young, something like 90% of people I interacted with seemed to be zombies.  Now its more like 50%.
      </p>
      <p>
       A decrease in the number of apparent zombies fits with my personal theory on what is causing the Mandela Effect, which is.....
      </p>
      <p>
       We each live in our own universe, defined by our observation of it.  Our universe is loosely connected with the universes of other people, interlinking due to the interaction of our minds.  Where there is agreement in observation, patches of the universes merge. Where there is disagreement in observation, there is a disharmony that must be resolved...  (people will argue, then look together, and see who was right).
       <br/>
       For tens of thousands of years, the collective universe you lived in was what you and your tribe observed.  We told our stories, we worshiped our gods, and we all saw the same world.  Then suddenly global communications happened.  Now 7 billion people must agree on one world.  There are conflicting universes, filled with natives (people who natively share one world-view), and NPCs, who fill in for people who you know should exist in your universe, but actually live in another.  As the universes slowly converge, there will be less NPCs.  A good thing, i think.  Less mindless assholes talking up space, replaced by the originals who have souls.

       I agree. However, I think that our "personal universes" are very small.
      </p>
      <p>
       When one hears the world universe, we think of something gigantic that encompasses everything that exist, but I think these universes we live in only go as far as what we can perceive. Like, if you have a window in front of you and light goes through it, the only sun light that exists in your universe is the one that goes through that window.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the sunlight is just in all superpositions of possibilities, but they don't matter, because you're not perceiving the light that hits the back of your house. If you go out and look at it, all that light is perceived and exists on your universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something extraordinary happened with the Internet, as it forced us to extend our personal universes to include what we interact with. So now I form part of your universe, because all the possibilities of messages I could have written had to collapse into this one for you to read it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find very interesting your theory that NPCs are just people that live in another universe, which would presumably in their universe perceive ME as an NPC?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, I've had experiences the other way around, with people I had known in the past, that acted "real", and didn't left a single doubt about their "realness", later on acting like NPCs, as if they were no longer part of my reality?
      </p>
      <p>
       So I now wonder if we come from different worlds, and in my path the NPCs have increased, while in yours they have decreased.

       If you are not an NPC go and read Memetic Magic by R. Kirk Packwood, in the later part of the book he explains in a pretty good way, why like 98% of people just act like NPCs or basically mere recipients of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part 1 of memetic magic you can find online as free PDF in several places.

       Original Poster, check out a book called "The Convoluted Universe," by Dolores Cannon. Cannon was a hypnotherapist, who would place people into trances to access their "higher selves". A lot of the information she got was fascinating. One of the weird cases was a woman who was put under, and she casually mentioned "Backdrop People". Cannon was confused, and asked her to back up and tell her what she meant by the term.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       The patient, in a sort of Mesmeric trance, answered matter-of-factly that not every human on Earth had a soul. There were what video-gamers would call "Non-playable characters". These "Backdrop People" were placed on the planet for one reason: To deflect higher-vibrational humans off the path of righteousness, to trap their souls here.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans are being harvested. The energy they give off. The demiurge who created this physical universe doesn't want us to cycle out. He wants us to remain here, reincarnating forever . . . so that he can harvest us.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       "Backdrop People" are placed here to keep you low-vibrational. To stunt your path to spiritual progress.
      </p>
      <p>

       By the way, check out what a remote viewing group saw when they were tasked into looking into reincarnation:

       That fact that a good chunk of people don't experience inner monolgue blows my mind. How can you go through out your day not thinking and speaking internally what you see? I'm not saying you're right, you're probably wrong, but this is truly bizarre. Maybe there's some hierarchy of human thought that only some humans experience. Maybe some humans are better than others on a basis that isn't physical. Fuck it, we're probably in a simulation.

       you can try it out, I think. Just silence your inner voice, ignore it when it pops up, and in a couple minutes that inner voice should be pretty relaxed not chattering. Then start planning a trip to the grocery store, or make a sandwich. It's pretty neat and relaxing I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing about the study -- I don't think the study meant that only 26% of the people sampled had the inner voice phenomenon, but that across all of the samples taken, 26% were inner voice. It reads like the study design was:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) give 30 people beepers
      </p>
      <p>
       2) when a subject's beeper would beep, they would record the state of their 'pristine consciousness' (what they were doing mentally at the time of the beep, from a sample of I think 5 categories the researchers chose)
      </p>
      <p>
       It did say there was at least one person who had did not report inner voice, but I don't think it said how many. It probably wasn't many, though: across all samples of pristine consciousness 26% were inner voice, and the median value across subjects is 20% (same number of values above and below).
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think it's more accurate to interpret the article as, in general those sampled reported experiencing inner voice 20% of the time, and 26% of all samples collected were reports of inner voice. However some subjects reported inner voice up to 75% of the times sampled, while others did not report inner voice a single time. in conclusion wtf lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just what I got from looking at the psych today article (dangerzone but could be worse). If you would like I could try to find a copy of the paper and give that a looksie :), but if the article was accurate I'm pretty sure that's what it would all mean.

       I think we probably are a simulation where all vibrational frequencies exist at the same time, like on a massive bluray. You can only read the part on your vibrational frequency.

       At first the thought of no inner monologue seems bad, but then I think of drawing and painting ... when I get deeply into a drawing or painting the words go away and I am "in the flow," and I begin 'thinking' in shades or colors. I am not "aware" of it at the time, but when I'm drawing a pastel portrait my mind thinks there is an imbalance in the portrait and I add more brown or purple until it is dark enough, or I add white or yellow until it is in balance. If an eye or a lip is not quite right I add to the eye or lip, or I subtract by adding bordering flesh ...
      </p>
      <p>
       I am told it is somewhat the same with musicians, when a note is wrong the don't think, "D flat is wrong" or whatever, it just feels wrong or out of place, and they move thier hands on the fretboard, or the keyboard, until they locate the 'correct' sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm adding color to a lip or an eye, I fumble at pencils and add, and if it is not quite right, I fumble for a lighter or darker pencil. It is really truely relaxing to no longer have to deal with the constant inner-monologue, to serenely 'think' in colors and shades and shapes. People refer to it as "flow," or "in the flow," and compare it to meditation.

       Would you say you are more of an extrovert or introvert? I would think, in my introvert's mind, that extroverts can't imagine not talking to themselves in their own voice in their head constantly, because they also seem to need to talk constantly out of their head.

       Sounds like a bad case of monkeymind, I'm sorry friend, if you want, try to taste the flavor of experiences before your mind gets to it.
Before it's rationalized and packed up into neat little wordboxes. Does that make sense?

       There is something in the human brain called the "default mode network". The DMN is the part of your brain that starts working when you aren't really doing anything. (It's also the part of the brain that works as the traffic director for all the parts of your brain so the conscious you can make sense of what's going on with the billions of neural synapses that fire off without having to use up any of your mental "RAM" but that's another lesson) The DMN is the evolved part that is more active and developed in intelligent creatures. It is the reason you talk to yourself, it's the part of you that focuses on the past to make a simulation of the future. Its why you will have 30 conversations of a conversation you have yet to have. It is the pattern maker and recegnizor. And usually the more active it is, the higher your IQ tends to be because you are constantly working problems and thinking them. Interestingly enough there is a big correlation between people who spend time with lot of time with their DMN running on high and people who are depressed. (There is so much more to say in the subject it's ridiculous that we are not teaching the human mind to children.)
      </p>
      <p>
       On the flip side, there are ways to quite the network gaining access to your body and minds more instinct side instead of the analytical side. This is usually referred to a state of "flow" when your DMN stops filtering and forcing you to think and instead let's more information through and letting your instincts go on a sort of subconscious autopilot. Most people experience this when they pay a sport or get really into a video game. Some people may feel it at work if the are in intense situations that you trained for, or if you are doing a repetitive monotonous task. There are other ways to quite down the DMN other than activity and that's with meditation. NOW because the DMN is usually on at full blast when nothing is going on, it's usually really hard to actually teach a true statement of meditation....I mean getting to an actual point where you are sitting there and not thinking.....ABOUT ANYTHING.....SO FUCKING HARD ACTUALLY....anyways, chants and mantras and old tribal music and dance where usually designed around getting people to shut off their inner voice and kinda just go with the flow and be "as one" so thats an easier way to get your mind used to shutting off. And last, and my most favorite, YOU CAN SHUT IT OFF BY TAKING PSYCHEDELICS! That's right, when one takes psychedelics their DMN takes a break, letting your ego take a break too. It litterally changes the way you think, letting you escape old habits that your DMN has constructed for you. Again, I can go on a lecture length rant on this stuff, but I suggest y'all look some up on any of the subjects I mentioned. It's the brain you have and the same brain everyone else has, it's best to know how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: brains are weird, the voice in your head is the part that let's you regret, but also let's you learn from those regrets so it can be dangerous but also very helpful. People who can't handle their emotions (IMO) tend to shut that part off letting their life go on a type of auto pilot
      </p>
      <p>
       Meditation is the opposite of self reflection and any type of reflection at all. And it can be accessed many ways.

       I didn't realize I had/didn't have an inner monologue until I tripped on acid the third or so time. Low doses 120ug or so.

       The three trips leading up to discovery were the most enlightening experiences ever. I felt my world being unlocked

       On the flip side, it is
       <em>

       more difficult to function because of the new found dualistic individuality. Turns out autopilot mode is so much easier...

       I used to have an inner dialog and then I got annoyed at it and spent a fair amount of effort getting it to shut the fuck up.  Eventually, it did, and it only comes back when I'm stressed and need to fix or change something.  Now I live each day in silence inside for the most part.  It's nice.

       This meme exploded in a couple days, and to me stinks to high heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somebody is trying to justify the de-humanization a large sector of the population via some pseudoscientific hogwash. Trying to sway some into believing they're special, they're
       <em>
        chosen
       </em>
       , that the rest are mindless, soulless sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such a novel,
       <em>
        never considered before concept
       </em>
       , rigth?
      </p>
      <p>
       This reeks to me of an attempt to misdirect impressionable people. Of a social experiment without good intentions. Of a nasty psyop to entrap some foolish groups.

       After recently watching Lord of the Rings again, I'd have to say the Ring definitely symbolizes technology (more specifically in these days it represents computer/electronic technology).  I found myself doing my normal rounds at work, reached in my pocket for my phone to play some music and realized I made the same exact motion Bilbo did when reaching for his ring that wasn't there.  What really resonated with me was I had left the phone to charge in the break room, so the moment was pretty much exactly like the film.  I reached in with one finger to hook my phone and was left empty handed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a greater sense, I see the Ring as the Internet/Electronics in general and Sauron as a tremendous AI. It see's you when using it, it bind's us all (internet) and can instantly gratify any desire (violence, porn, r/aww, drugs, escapism etc). All facets that the ring bears as well.  Darkness is spreading (ignorance) and our world is falling from Forests to Server Farms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you that it may not be that these people are soulless npcs, but that they may just be turned "off" for the moment and can be turned back "on".  There is a concerted effort to blind our third eye through calcification through fluoride, caffeine and over-stimulation, this I definitely know.  In most big movements (like the Civil War and the like) there was a small galvanized faction of 2-4% of the population that helped sway those in the bell of the curve.  I see this in history a lot, that there are two opposing sides of a very small percentage of the population that try and reach the ~80%+ in the middle to follow their beliefs.

       And then again maybe only 25% of the souls dressed-up in human form are sufficiently evolved or enlightened enough at this point in time to be able to recognise and hear their own "inner voice", which is precisely what their many journeys through this material plane are all genuinely about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover the 25% that do hear it, are here, not simply as an example but to help those others, insofar as they can, on their own many individual journeys to becoming more, and more, aware of themselves
       <em>
        as souls
       </em>
       who have all been pursuing that very same goal on this material plane from well before the very beginning of time and will continue on these many physical journeys until they ultimately have an "epiphany" that makes that revelation unequivocally and abundantly clear to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you believe, not that you have a soul, like some kind of an heirloom that you might lose, but more properly ARE a soul that exists outside of Time and these experiences which, as convincing as they are, are simply a way to lead you to and indelibly impress the knowledge of the ONE CONSCIOUNESS that you are merely one of the infinitely unique fragments IT is capable of dividing ITSELF into and has divided ITSELF into, to make you and ALL of this possible.

       Not every human you see has a soul.  Demonic entities can certainly "kill" a human, send their soul to hell, and replace the soul with a demonic spirit to use their flesh as host bodies.  To what extent this is happening, who knows.

       The Toltec people taught to silence the inner voice. Which is very interesting. If you have trouble falling asleep next time quiet your mind. It's very hard but turn on a fan and only focus on the white noise. You'll be asleep in no time.

       I wouldn't consider myself "religious", more of a spiritual person. I believe in souls, but maybe a different spin on it. I think they are one of two things.
      </p>
      <p>
       One, souls are actually part of a greater life force and close to what Christians think of as a soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other theory of mine plays into the stimulation theory, and our "souls" are higher beings basically playing a game of "Roy" like in Rick and Morty.

       Don't view the notion of "souls" with biases associated with the rejection of organized religion
      </p>
      <p>
       The "souls" described are more like energy. As one walks through life, they pick up energy in the form of positivity and negativity. They propagate that energy by amplifying it with their own behavior. (think of responding to bad news with rage vs responding with calm, cool, collected thought) When an individual dies they release their final bits of energy (particularly resonating within loved ones) into the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ones soul is a collection of experience and energy that can be weaponized or used for kindness.

       I can confirm this theory. For a while I thought I was being gang stalked. However, eventually I accepted that I don’t do anything that would make the government spy on me, to that degree. This post connected all of events for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few months ago I was working at a bar. For the first time in my life i had quit porn, unhealthy eating, and had cut out all the negativity in my life. That lasted for about two weeks. What’s weird is, during that entire two weeks, there was a person that came to my bar at the last minute and made me stay on the clock until 1-2 in the morning. We weren’t allowed to leave until everyone was done drinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes it even weirder is all of these people/brings knew I was spiritual. Even though the conversations fit my interest they drained me. When I got home I was tired, had brain fog, and felt horrible in every way. To provide context, I am only 25 and I never felt this way. It felt like I had the flu. As soon as I got home everything would be okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what? After that two weeks I ended up going back to porn, unhealthy foods, and started skipping the gym again. What I never realized was they were also gathering information on me. One guy asked me for my address because he wanted to “send me a book” and Another guy asked for email so he could “help me get a job”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Out of my own ignorance I didn’t understand what was going on at the time. It wasn’t until I was high that I put the pieces together. Again, I thought I was deliberately being stalked by people. I went back to my unhealthy life and I fell back into my depression. I am slowly raising my vibration again and guess what? It’s starting again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same guy walks passed my house at the same time every day. The first time he came he made a comment about liking my car. When I doing something beneficial to my spirit at work someone always randomly walks into my job wanting something. That ain’t normal where I work. When I try to abstain my sexual thoughts my girlfriend will always try to initiate sex.. she has never been the person to do that. I could go on for days.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, there is a 100% chance this is true. If you go to Chicago or New York and sit and watch you can actual see how many people are on auto pilot. You can look into people’s eyes and see that there is nothing there. There is no deep thoughts. There is no logic. Those people are nothing more than fleshy robots. Soon to be replaced by real new robots.

       True. The thing is. That is what I assumed initially. I was like “there is no way any of this is possible” and I just don’t think a crazy person would even be sane enough to question themselves. Based on your logic.. the guy on 4chan, the people that wrote the article above, the op, and me are all crazy.

       One of my favorite quotes is “there is no achievement in being sane in an insane world” with that being said. Unless I’m hurting someone I really don’t see why I would deem myself crazy for believing something that goes against the status quo

       I think those quote are about being quirky and are using insane in the cute sense. For my friend, the actually mental illness progressed into violence against friends that were included into the conspiracy to follow him. These things always progress worst if you have them.

       The comment about seeing the same person over and over. My buddy would be telling me this on the daily and I'd just shrug it off and then finally when one day I was asking him questions and it was really apparent that this was off. I think his brain was looking for patterns all the time then started superimposing people and things that created anxious feelings

       I see. I doubted myself about that too. However, one day I left my house and I said, “if I see this guy there is something going on” and he was walking towards my house.. maybe 20 seconds away from me, tops. You think that’s by chance? There’s 100,000 people in my city

       Man maybe in places that are even more contoled by this luciferian elite, there are more "souless" peoples..   anyway do not listen to anyone that claim that you might be paranoic or something, just try go stay true with yourself and do good deeds. 
As you could see when you try to go the right path, there is "something" forcing you out of it. And i'm not talking in a religious way, even tough it seens.

       I don't think you are going mad, rather you are experiencing the weird way how humans perceive the world. Check out Robert Anton Wilson's books and also "the 23 phenomena".
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, our brains makes patterns from what we see, and what we see makes our reality.  If you start seeing strange stuff around more, you will start seeing more strange stuff. If you start looking for pennies in the street, then you will attach significance to finding pennies in the street. If you are horny and are conscious about your sexual thoughts and feelings (almost all of us are not) then you are more likely to pick up on actions of others that fit in with that mode of consciousness.

       Unfortunately when I talk to people, even NPC Sportsball people, they seem to have real lives and real worries if you break past their outer shell of a mask. I have yet to ask someone to elaborate on when they were a kid and what they liked and thought, how they acted and how they reacted. They would have true emotional responses and real almost human like faults and qualitys.

       Also you don’t have to be stupid or soulless to be really into sports. It feels awesome to REALLY care about something, passionately. Loyalty and completion are deeply human drives. Detached cynicism does not make one any more woke.

       I've had this theory for the past X years.  I try not to think about it because, IMO, it either means we need to learn how to control others in order to regain control over our own lives (which opposes some personal values), or it means we'll never be in control and someone else is that apparently doesn't like us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's technically perfect.  I just believe you can get so confused and coddled that your voice is just oppressed with nonsense you picked up to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a colleague, former friend, that I abandoned because I realized he had no integrity.  He wasn't able to realize things like "you know what I meant" put the burden of understanding him on me , instead of himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ultimately told him I think we shouldn't speak until he's fully independent, which might not come until his family abandoned him.  I can somewhat recall when I was younger and I just did anything I "felt" like doing, like blowing my paycheck by going out that night, and being broke a couple days before the next one.  I chased money thinking once I had enough I could relax.  Eventually, I got a bunch and realized you can't pay anyone to give a shit about you and even if you had proof that they wronged you, you need even more to use the courts to get it back.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this friend had this blind trust that things would work out and people would always care for him and I think that's what prevented him from feeling the need to recursively look into things and see whether they added up consistently or if it was just an easy explanation.

       Okay so one time I had a dream where I walked by a room and saw a group of people standing.
I looked over at them and realized something. 
I looked and said to myself "these are not humans".
Their eyes instantly turned black and looked at me as they didn't move a muscle.
About ten seconds of staring at me one of them raised his hand and made me freeze completely. 
My vision in the dream started to shake and I couldn't move. 
This has happened twice..

       Isn't this the official belief of Judaism? Only Jews descending from Abraham are real people with souls, the rest are NPCs. One of the reasons Judaism has been so hated historically by people not of Abrahamic descent (people don't like being dehumanised), and why Jews do not convert new believers (NPCs aren't welcome). It's like a 3000 year old belief.

       I’m areligious, but, There are theories going around that if you don’t accept Jesus Christ of Nazareth (and/or Otis Redding of Dawson) as your savior you will spend an eternity drowning in your worst sins. Also some theories that we were seeded by outer-realm beings to this planet, despite evidence of biological evolution all around us. Do seeds have souls or grow souls?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either all people have souls or none of us do. This is the type of cultish thinking that falls directly into a divide and conquer scheme, whether nefariously planned or not. And as a philosophical point this is such a boring thing for this sub to discuss. What does it matter if we have souls or not?
      </p>
      <p>
       How many people here think they’re NPC and how many think they have souls and “get it?” This is ridiculous.

       There are some people who move up Into their dreams and demons take over their conciousness. There are people whose lives are ran completely. No free will. All their decisions are made for them etc.. Its important to know this if you've had a rough life because it was probably the devil the whole time causing it. Even bad decisions you made (sinful) could have not even have been your decision. Im on of these people and my life is all messed up because of it. I know its now my fault though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even being redpilled wasnt really my doing. I was steered into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how most of the redpill stuff is based of germanics or people from the northern hemisphere? There's a reason they steer you into it. Its so they can make you feel guilty later. Especially with "minority" dealings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The npcs are people who are owned by the devil/Satan. They don't eave a choice. Unless Im wrong and people who say "normies" are actually being controlled as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all about the brain and nervous system and time manipulation. Its about judgment as well. Most of us are or can be controlled if your on a list. Some are controlled since the day they are born and some become controlled because of their actions whilst using their free will (assuming they ever had free will and it wasnt another entity creating the scenarios in their lives.)

       I believe there is some sort of hive mind... don't know if they're NPC's or what the deal is...
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember one day lots of bullshit in the skies. So I'm pretty bored at the time and I'm like what the heck I'll call the local airport and ask to speak to the "chemtrail department." I'm talking to the guy for a few minutes all kinds of lol going on, and the moment I look outside my window for a brief second a damn cop car does a u-turn right in front of my house. I live more in a back end area and while cops do occasionally drive by, it's pretty rare. And for the cop to do a u-turn? The probability is even lower. And for the cop to do it the exact moment I look out the window? Probability even lower. I could sit there for days, weeks, months and that shit wouldn't happen the way it did. Now I'm not a dummy I did it off an anonymous number and still... I know most people will be like coincidence but I've had way too many coincidences over the years and at this point I'm pretty convinced there is a hive mind. Now are they soul-less drones connected to some central computer or just being influenced by a 3rd party, perhaps spirtiual entities, or maybe they're some sort of entities themselves... I don't know.

        "Moreover, it happens fairly often that essence dies in a man while his personality

        It is fortunate for us that we do not see and do not know it. If we knew what a number of people are actually dead and what a number of these dead people govern our lives, we should go mad with horror. And indeed people often do go mad because they find out something of this nature without the proper preparation, that is, they see something they are not supposed to see. In order to see without danger one must be on the way. If a man who can do nothing sees the truth he will certainly go mad. Only this rarely happens. Usually everything is so arranged that a man can see nothing
prematurely.

       Ugh. Well a few thoughts of mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "are people secret NPCs" talk scares me a little. I can't properly access the mind of a killer, but I feel like this string of thought can lead certain types to some unconscionable actions. Just the dehumanization element to the theory seems dangerous. Relating to OP's point that people just "go along with it", there are plenty of human (and animal) studies that might illustrate learned helplessness and similar psychological responses to adverse struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in reading some of these other comments.. I mean people. Just because someone's eyes "don't light up" at the mention of your favorite conspiracy theory or recent news item it doesn't mean they are soulless or robots. For example, some people have anxiety and talking about aliens and dimensional shifts can be overwhelming. Some people have families and have just finished working long shifts and do not care about you or much of the immediate world around them. I feel like a lot of considerations are not being made here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, it is true. You could compare certain behaviors of people to literal and figurative zombies.

       I mostly agree with you! What I really think that generates this "npc behaviour pattern" is more something like a mind control os social programming that our society is going trought with all this luciferian elites rulling many important aspects of our society. 
I thnk that people are becomming npcs not that were born like that... what you think?

       I think the idea that we are grinded down by life might be closer to the truth than our souls were either stolen or never granted. That seems over the top. Maybe it's more like we were all born a raging torch but have been reduced to a flickering candle. Point being the fire is still there.

       I definitely feel this theory. Even right now some of the comments could just be robots. I’ll never be able to authenticate any of your existence is. It’s all just words on a screen.

       There are several articles by the psychologist Hulburt. I recommend reading through them to get more information. 4chan is technically wrong about most people not having an inner voice. From the study, Hulburt identified 5 very common forms of thought, including inner speech. Subjects were given beepers and asked to record what they were thinking right before the time of the random beep.
      </p>
      <p>
       The five forms of thought are: inner speech, inner seeing, feelings, sensory awareness, and unsymbolic thinking. The last two are considerably more complex and abstract, with most subjects being totally unaware they experience this type of thought , and, paradoxically, that it was the most prevalent form of thought they had.

       Let's assume this theory is true, presumably you think you're one of the 75% with an inner voice but now try and prove it.

       A soul is something you create. Your inner voice is ment to help you guide you through life. Like the old cartoons always showed a devil and angle giving you ideas. But it is up to you to make the right decisions in your life and a soul is you. A soul is all the things you experience through life and the qualities to your personality you have created from those experiences. Like the music you create. How creative you are. Your problem solving skills. The actions you make and people you love and care about. And many more attributes are all part of your soul. Your mental strength and free will in life are important factors. Also your ability to think for yourself too. With everyone with their noses stuck in their devices I will be surprised if there are any souls out there.

       It's similar to creating AI. The software has to taught and learn to be able to think for itself. When AI comes around then nobody will have to think at all. They will have computers to do that for them. We will just be blobs of flesh clicking buttons and the elite will be racking in the money from farming these people.

       I am not religious-- and it is extraordinary to me that some folks don't have an inner voice... but to say that they are soulless humans? To lump people you are unfamiliar with into a pool of "sheep" who have no thoughts or emotions? It is absolutely disgusting to me.

       I have been a long time subscriber to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and I think that this is one of the most unsettling things that I've ever read here. How dare you trivialize the thoughts, emotions, experiences, and souls of\ billions of people that you don't know. Just because you are more / less informed, more / less "woke" indicated no such thing as soullessness in the larger population.

       NPC theory is a sickness. I love this subreddit and I love being a "conspiracy theorist". Looking at everything from all angles and coming to my own conclusions about my interpretation of reality is a privilege. This is the essence of human logic.

       DO NOT think that you are somehow more or less "special" than other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       HOW DARE YOU say that people who are less informed than you have "no soul".
      </p>
      <p>
       You say that the truth seekers and revolutionaries have always been a small percentage of the population and that's true. My grandma isn't browsing
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and watching youtube videos about AJ and Syrian gas attacks. She's old and tired.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for ANY of you to jump to the conclusion, to the narcissistic and egotistical conclusion that the people surrounding you on this planet in their day to day lives have no emotions, feelings, hardships, happiness's, or for lack of a better word-- SOULS, shame the fuck on you bro. I'm out. This is full on disillusion with reality.

       Are not words just cues to retrieve information that one has acquired from their environments? So wouldn't those without an inner monologue be less NPC like? And wouldn't someone that is incapable  of acquiring information from their environments be severely autistic and/or mentally disabled? And wouldn't these people - those with an inability to generate thoughts - be the most "soulless" by this logic? And wasn't Einstein somewhat autistic? Would he be a cyborg?...
Seems like a wacky theory to me

       the "inner voice" manifests differently in different people.  for example, one subset of the population has an extremely
       <em>
        powerful
       </em>
       inner voice - they're called schizophrenics.  If you mean to suggest that sufferers of a debilitating mental disorder are the protagonists of humanity, be my guest.
      </p>
      <p>
       there's a simpler explanation for what NPC theory purports to explain: most people are
       <em>
        scared of consequences.
       </em>
       Anyone can do the sorts of things a PC would in a video game
       <em>
        in an video game
       </em>
       ; there are no consequences.  The fear response is stronger in some people than others, for a myriad of reasons.

       Absolutely agree here. It's like some kind of feedback loop, where the feeling would (often enough) be so minute and easy to deal with if only we didn't balk at having it at all. I've found in the past that it helps to just acknowledge it as another feeling, and trying not to assign any kind of positive or negative to it.
