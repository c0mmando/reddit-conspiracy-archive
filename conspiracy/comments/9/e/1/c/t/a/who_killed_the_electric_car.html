<p>It&#39;s just a transfer of wealth from the gas companies into the electric companies. All of which, are owned by the same people.

<p>i simply believe it is a business game, and once there are set gambits to make an even more lucrative business out of electric, then that will be when we see the end of gasoline powered cars. either that or we run out of oil/gas</p>

<p>Electric companies have monopolies just like gas companies so yes, it would.</p>

<p>&quot;Chemist and geologist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1759, with his collaborator, academician Joseph Adam Braun, Lomonosov was the first person to record the freezing of mercury and to carry out initial experiments with it.[27] Believing that nature is subject to regular and continuous evolution, he demonstrated the organic origin of soil, peat, coal, petroleum and amber. In 1745, he published a catalogue of over 3,000 minerals, and in 1760, he explained the formation of icebergs.[13]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1763, he published On The Strata of the Earth - his most significant geological work.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are your answers so vague? You were being similarly vague in another thread in this post about oil not being finite. Is there a reason you don&#39;t provide detailed answers? </p>

<p>These are just broad categories that in no way explain what you think makes electric cars not viable. What about fuel source, logistics, and physics do you find unviable in regards to electric cars?</p>

<p>I&#39;m also curious about your statements in the other thread about oil not being finite and oil being either the same as water or just as (in)finite or just as easy to find (your comment was a bit ambiguous). </p>

<p>This kind of seems like a rhetorical tactic used as a sort of &#39;war of attrition&#39; where others give up before disproving or even adequately addressing your &#39;point,&#39; while keeping the other in a position of asking you questions for more information, thereby putting you in a position of relative perceived power as you dole out small snippets of wise sounding information.

    <div class="md"><p>I think high costs, and the fact that ethanol is just as unsustainable as gasoline killed ethanol. It would require way to much farm land to produce enough ethanol to make it a viable option. Now assuming people still eat the same stuff, their would need to be a large increase in farm land, which would require the destruction of forests and natural prairie land. This would lead to ethanol fuel having a huge carbon footprint due to all the land that would be converted.</p>

<p>We also have a expanding world population, and we are going to need that farmland to feed people. The best chance is likely electric cars and increased use of public transportation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was the EV1, it had a range of about 60 to 160 miles, and could not be bought ( it cost between $400 and 500 per month to lease it. ) </p>

<p>The “fast charger” cost $2500 to install at your home and would charge your car between 3 and 8 hours ( as the battery size increased, and a few charging related fires cause them to slow down the charging in later revisions ) </p>

<p>If you had to “slow charge” you were stuck with a 18 to 26 hour charge time to get a full battery, </p>

<p>The reason why it got shit canned was because at the time California was pushing GM and other manufacturers to have a certain percentage of their cars be emission free ( 5% I believe ) and GM for really scared that if their car got enough traction then they would get forced to ease back on production of gasoline cars and be unable to compete with manufacturers which didn’t have the restriction. </p>

<p>Since they were all lease vehicles ( and only available in California and arizona ) GM just stopped people from being able to renew their lease. Due to the rules in those states for maintaining stock of spare parts for over a decade after sale, GM never allowed anyone to ever “pay out” at the end of the lease. </p>

<p>There are still some which GM was not able to round up.  Jay Leno was rumoured to have one in his garage, and some exist in museums around America. </p>

<p>From farm to pharmaceutical, diesel truck to dinner plate, pipeline to plastic product, it is impossible to think of an area of our modern-day lives that is not affected by the oil industry. The story of oil is the story of the modern world. And this is the story of those who helped shape that world, and how the oil-igarchy they created is on the verge of monopolizing life itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>George B Selden and GM killed the electric car in the early 1900&#39;s.  Electric cars were equally viable as gasoline cars during the infancy of the automobile with the Riker Electric Vehicle company winning the first auto race in the US in 1896.  There were several manufacturers operating electric taxi fleets with a battery swapping station infrastructure in Boston and New York, and the Columbia Runabout was both the best selling auto in 1900 and the first auto to exceed 1000 sales.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most of these companies were destroyed by litigation over a meaningless patent but by that time gasoline auto manufacturers had already bankrupted the competition and set the automobile back for generations.</p>

<p>The battery, electrical infrastructure and costs make Tesla in my eyes an image product for state agenda reasons or just to blow up the stock price to con investors.</p>

<p>Research why the experienced car companies didn&#39;t really push alternative cars while they have been working on concepts for decades.</p>

<p>In the case of electrical batteries, the global lithium resources/production will always make them a luxury product for a limited group of customers. The other car companies actually employee engineers which look at these things globally as their existence depends on making profits.</p>
