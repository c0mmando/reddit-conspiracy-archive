       How is it preschool when it’s just being equal? You don’t think huge corporations like twitter etc should treat each consumer fair? Jones did the same things that his opponents did but somehow gets banned while others remain in tact

      <p>
       I guess you believe that people should rule over others with a mighty fist just silencing whoever they disagree with. I truly feel sorry for you and the others who get so offended by other people’s WORDS and ideology that you agree with silencing them.

       Yeah? Western civilization is under attack by the Jews? Talk about a real conspiracy. People really believe jews have that kind of power and influence? If this is true and Trump is the hero, why is he so pro-Israel? 
The military and police and white males are under attack? The military has never had so much power as it does now. If you subscribe to mainstream conspiracies, the military industrial complex has been running our country for decades. Police almost never get indicted or convicted of crimes against society. And our entire government is run by white males. 
Why do you feel like you are under attack?

       is a video of a Jewish meeting at the Goethe Institute in Germany where they discuss ways to subvert Poland. Jewish groups absolutely have a disproportionate amount of power. AIPAC in the US has a crazy amount of power. You have to toe the line AIPAC has drawn or they will primary you in your next election.

       Legit question: how much have you used the word “projecting” online in the last month?
      </p>
      <p>
       A little? A lot?
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems to be the internet’s new favorite word of the month right now so I’m just genuinely asking. For my own research purposes.

       Wow, I’m shocked to see this upvoted here. Jewish folks are probably the biggest tribalism group in the world. They will do anything to make sure their people stay alive, as they are “gods chosen people”. There such a stigma when it comes to criticizing Jews. Catholics, Christians, Muslims, even Buddhism. But if you criticize Jews under any pretenses, you’re afar right Nazi fascist. You don’t have to be a Nazi to be critical of the Jewish faith. Historically, Jews have always been very subversive to ensure the survival of their people. People often forget, communism was created as refined  by Jews. Marx, Trotsky, Lenin etc,. They’ve built up this box around them that prevents them from being examined. If you are critical of Judaism you are either an anti-Semitic Arab or a Nazi. They are over represented in The media. They are over represented in politics. They are over represented in finance, realestate, and business. Is it because Jewish people genetically have a higher IQ and are just better at what they do than the rest? Are they protecting their own kind? It’s a good question to ask and even more to look into. This is a conspiracy forum after all.

       You're not really making your point when you actually
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       citing nazi propaganda about the spooky jewish communists. It's pretty hilarious anyways how they get shit when they are
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       capitalism, and they get shit when they are
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       capitalism, yet are still somehow part of one big jewish conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And communism being "created by jews"(never mind that Marx didn't create communism, which is a soviet product) doesn't really make any bloody sense considering how Marx is literally the "religion is the opium of the people" guy, yet you're still pretending to only be criticizing the jewish faith, never mind that Marx was
       <em>
        ethnically
       </em>
       jewish, but his parents converted to Lutheranism and raised their children thus, which practically broke relations with their jewish family. The idea of marxism being some sort of jewish front is
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       nazi propaganda no matter how you twist and turn it.

       See this is what I mean. Marx was some sort of an atheist but everything he believed in  was created from his young years and by the people he met while in college.Although his parents gave up Judiasm because of anti semitism , he was largely brought up in a Jewish household and was molded by it. Moses Hess the founder of Labour Zionism who he was inspired by in college, a socialist and a Jew. The poor Mosel-farmers, most of his closest acquaintances were Jewish. Being Jewish isn’t just a religion, its an ethnicity, a community, a way of life. To say Marx wasn’t influenced by Judaism is not only wrong, it’s ignorant. This is what I mean when I say when you criticize Judaism you are called a Nazi.

       Bullshit. He operated for years doing the same type of content, only now do ALL the media coordinate to purge him from every platform. This is a test. They're seeing how it goes over when they do it to a controversial guy, next time they'll try it on someone less controversial, soon it will be people you like being censored, then and only then will you realize how shitty this is.

       Indeed. This is a conspiracy forum so we all need to go a later deeper. Here's my take.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones and Infowars are a government psyop. His family is CIA. He has ties to Stratfor. He engages in cointelpro-style tactics within the truth / conspiracy community to make conspiracy theorists look like right-wing nutjobs. There are countries and groups he never criticizes truthfully.
      </p>
      <p>
       The censorship of AJ and Infowars is to normalize and justify censorship of all the real alternative media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google, YouTube, and Facebook already cut the guy offa while ago. Let's stop the outage against Apple and instead recognize that something else is afoot.

       I don’t think that’s likely Alex has exposed some real deal shit in the past despite his off the rails out there behavior as of late. People forget he exposed Bohemian Grove and was one of the first people to call out 9/11 and the Surveillance state. I think it can be more simply explained he probably just lost his mind and has some kind of underlining mental health condition rather than he is a CIA plant to make conspiracy theorists look bad even though he does.

       That's how a limited hangout works. He didn't sneak into Bohemian Grove, he was let in. And he was allowed to cover Bilderberg, you or I would have been arrested. With a limited hangout, there's a certain amount of true information to build credibility. Sometimes the deeper truths are withheld, and people think the limited hangout is the whole truth. Other times the limited hangout is mixed with disinfo so anyone who believes the factual parts looks crazy by association.

       I disagree I think it would only hurt them if they arrested someone of his status they were best off making him look crazy in the press. Arresting him just gives him credibility.

       How is that possible though? There's pictures of Alex Jones in high school under the same name. There's accounts from people that went to highschool with his saying he was always an attention seeking, loudmouth, loose cannon? I'm not saying you're wrong, but how do you explain that? Groomed him from high school to be a CIA shill?

       Yeah. As much as I disliked Jobs, he was a hardass. He never let his kids touch any Apple products, he knew better than anyone how influential they are on the mind when combined with social media. Some have also suggested he tried his hardest to resist the NSA's bullshit.

       I've been asking this as well, but Mike Adams theorizes that it may be more of a general and pre-emptive burial of AJ, to keep him from commenting on what's going on now and/or coming next. Also as a litmus to how we react to it.

       His server will always be active, if he decides to host his own. But an ISP can legally block traffic to his private server if the ISP wanted to.

       Lots of entities could effectively take down a website. Infowars could have their hosting service, deny them service. Even if they hosted their site themselves, their domain name could be blacklisted by ISPs and/or DNS services, such that the site cannot be accessed by the users of said ISPs or DNSs. Considering how few ISPs seem to absolutely dominate the US market, it´ll only take a few companies to effectively remove Alex Jones and Infowars from the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Changing your DNS service and/or using a VPN may get around this. But most people aren't going to be savvy enough to know about or do this.

       Too bad that this administration made it legal for ISPs to block servers. Like you said, with so few ISPs available nationwide, infowars could be easily be blocked off the internet for millions of Americans in an instant.

       DNS servers are controlled by the company that maintains the server. Most users are connected to their ISPs DNS Server by default. There are a few private DNS Servers that you can use if you don't want to use your ISP DNS Server.

       alex jones railed against net neutrality, he called it obamacare for the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       so he got what he wanted, didnt he?
      </p>
      <p>
       lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       he can host his own webpage, will he get traffic to it? maybe, maybe not.
      </p>
      <p>
       most things on the internet, dealing with the internet are privately owned.  he argued in favor of allowing google, youtube, apple, ect to censor their services at will.  he argued in favor of isps censoring their services at will.
      </p>
      <p>
       and guess what fucking happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       its hilarious whats happening to him, because he still has not publicly made the connection.

       Net Neutrality wouldn't have prevented Youtube from deleting his channel, nor would it prevent Apple from pulling an app from their store, so I'm confused as to your point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm for consumer protections, it's just that for these actions taken against him, net neutrality has no effect either way. ISP's would have to continue to sell him/his company internet access and not block any IP's he owns, but no private company would have to host his content or applications.

       I think the assertions that the media/money powers are censoring to boost his popularity hold much water anymore; they're trying to memory-hole this guy, and trying to keep him from commenting on whatever's happening now and next.

       This is only proves his point even more. If they can fully censor him who else will they censor? You may agree or disagree with some stuff he says. These companies want the internet to be regulated but they don’t want their sites to be regulated so people like Alex Jones are on their platform.

       Yes, Apple does decide what you get to download from their App Store.  They’ve been doing it since they had an App Store.  Do you think they should allow anyone to upload an app to their App Store?  Or are you just upset because you like Alex Jones?

       If they completely shut Jones out by shutting down his website, its full on censorship. Jones might be a loon and has done some scumbag shit, but he's not sooo dangerous that you need to box him out from society. If Sandyhook was the final straw, why didn't they shut him down in 2012? This is all very odd.

       <strong>
        <em>

      </p>
      <p>
       It's cool when he's on all the platforms, but when he gets banned from a couple big ones you might wanna jump on the train or you'll be left as the only platform for him. And with that attracts his audience, who you very reasonably might not want to attract.

       Perhaps. My gut feeling is simply that there's something more behind it. They start with this because they know that people will not react and when people have gotten more used to it they can start removing and shaping the internet into their liking even more.

       Sure, and they are entitled to. Just because they are dumb doesn't mean the news source should be banished. You have the right to be dumb here in America. There are lots of people's telling people the world is flat and don't get shut down. InfoWars has been spouting insanse conspiracy theories for 20 years. Is it because they had enough? Or because It was an opportune time to shut it down as others did? I think its censorship, Jones should be able to spout conspiracies on his own time so long as people are willing to listen.

       Joons is a croock and a freud. Selling you waterbased pills like its going to save you from cancer, smallpox, autism, and what not.

       Maybe.  What about Scientology? They are a far bigger, far reaching organization that rings their participators dry of all the money they are worth. Shit, you can find Christian churches that support anti vaccination that are far larger Thant Jone’s news. There are Facebook and Twitter communities that are bigger than Jones that preach anti vaccination. Hell, I support the right to be anti vaccination. To think you shouldn’t be able to be again any what the govt injects into your child’s body should be illegal? I’m not against vaccinations, but that’s crazy. They don’t get anything brought down on them You’re allowed to question things even if it’s stupid. Joe Rogan sells Alpha Brain and that’s literally almost exactly the same as Brain Force. They are targeting him for a reason we don’t know.

       I mean you were taking about autism and smallpox and what not and the stuff Jones sells that you said were against them. Jones questions vaccinations so I thoughts that’s what you meant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, I don’t know what you are trying to say. The fact that celebrities exist prevents the government from being shit down? That sounds WAY worse than InfoWars, and very dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, I don’t think the government should force you to let them inject your child with needle. I don’t think anything bad is happening right now, but I think outlawing it created a TERRIBLE precedent where the government can inject your child with anything they want. That’s all I’m saying.

       The matter of fact is that the rich can controle more. So if they decide that its time for jones to be gone from app store then he is gone. Apple will comply if not because there part its because they will get money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now yes aldo we need transparemcy on what is in the vactionations fair but... well there is currently a big rise in maisels (and dead because of maisels) co-insisdend with the trend of not getting your kid a vactionation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prob on not vactionating your kid is that its not only dangerous for him/her but also for others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aswell as there is very little proof people get autism form vactiontons.
The reson we have more "autism" now then back in the day is very simple. The spectrum of autism is so god daimbig. The DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders)
Is on nummer 5 as of 2013 since then there is a grow im autism since well a shit ton of things that where on there own a mental health issue have been scaled under autism. Back in the day a kid had lets say X it now has X wich is classed under A and A is Autism so the kid is Autistic.

       I mean, it’s not really the same. They’re NatSoc weirdos that actively and regularly made real threat against people. It’s not the same as Jones. Maybe sometimes he’d get riled up and talk about killing the globalists, but he never threatened the lives of innocent people. It’s totally different.

       That’s the issue with the big tech companies.  Should Google be able to remove websites that they don’t like from search results?  They have almost become public utilities at this point.  I know with the Google example that you can just use another search engine, but the average user won’t.

       i know what protected classes are. at the time that the concept of protected classes was proposed, it was controversial. each expansion of protected classes has been resisted. it is charming that your logic -- such as it is -- parallels that of segregationists.

       I made the decision because I was qualified to make it- it is no assumption. He is controlled opposition and the creepstate are doing this to get back his credibility in the truther community.Look how everyone is supporting the egomaniac now- ridiculous. We have known he is a shill for years. I thought he was under Rogue Clown control- but its Rogue Mossad.

       I think he’s a loon for sure but I don’t get why his site and etc are being banned/removed but websites like liveleak and what not who show legit death don’t. From what I know his is just words that everyone takes as more ridiculous than credible threats.

       I see your point and I would agree but I think it’s different when you have someone who is celebrity status it would only shine more light on bohemian grove if they arrested him. Unlike if you or me went because no one would say a word the media would ignore it.

       Yes, Apple does decide what you get to download from their App Store.  They’ve been doing it since they had an App Store.  Do you think they should allow anyone to upload an app to their App Store?  Or are you just upset because you like Alex Jones?

       DNS servers are controlled by the company that maintains the server. Most users are connected to their ISPs DNS Server by default. There are a few private DNS Servers that you can use if you don't want to use your ISP DNS Server.
