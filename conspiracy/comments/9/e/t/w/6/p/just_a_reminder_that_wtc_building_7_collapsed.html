       There wasn't a plane strike, but it took a 110 story building strike. Not saying there is no conspiracy, but the building wasn't untouched and pristine when it fell.

       So if one side was weakened and one side was pristine wouldn't it fall toward the damaged side? Why did it collapse straight down on its own foot print looking exactly like a controlled demolition? After seventeen years it looks like PNAC got clean away with it, now all you can do is bare witness effectively.

       It didn’t. Nearly every conspiracy videos cuts part of the building from the gram or starts it slightly after the collapse started. The pent house portion can be seen collapsing first in the full length videos.

       Can you explain why? It was burning all day, presumably the inner building was hotter and weaker. It also had no water supply.

       You weren’t aware that the centre dropped first until just then, doesn’t it seem likely that there’s more you’re not aware of that doesn’t fit

       It's impossible for the 2.25 seconds of freefall be sustained with such localized damage. The freefall requires ALL of the supports of the wall to be cut, simultaneously, and all resistence to falling 100% gone.

       I've always been confused about building 7 tbh. Why was it damaged like that in the first place if it had no contact with the planes? Or even debris from them? The buildings surrounding it were all good for the most part, but building 7 looked like it was, Idk.. damaged obviously. But what caused it???

       There is historical precedent for it.

       Are you aware of Operation Northwoods? One of the things they wanted to do with this false flag operation to garner the public and political support necessary for direct military intervention against Cuba, was blow a commercial airliner out the sky, "killing" all on board, I will quote and highlight the relevant bit;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with selected passengers,
        <strong>
         all boarded under carefully prepared aliases.
        </strong>
        The actual registered aircraft would be converted to a drone.
       </p>
       <p>
        From the rendezvous point [with the drone] the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft will meanwhile continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will being [sic] transmitting…a "MAY DAY" message stating he in under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       But ask yourself the question, if we know all three buildings were demolished via controlled demolition, what are the chances that
       <em>
        hijackers
       </em>
       just so happened to have flown two of them into buildings rigged to be demolished?

       These are great questions, but don't make the mistake of using them to say "see, since we can't answer this, it must be a crazy conspiracy." This is most often represented as

       I think you're confusing Weidlinger for the NIST Report. Weidlinger did not omit any structural features and included the bearing plates and shear studs that were not modeled by NIST.

       Why don't we take a look at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Finite Element Model Analysis? Headed by someone who has worked in building forensics for decades. This guy understands how and why buildings collapse much more than any other human being. The study determined that WTC 7 could not have collapsed the way it did due to fire.

       Has anyone seen the uncut video of the towers being hit? There’s actually no plane hitting the towers. The only plane seen is the one in mainstream news outlets. There’s also video of a reporter on the ground saying what happened and a witness said there was a bomb the wtc exploded and the reporter says it was a plane we saw a plane hit it on tv. And the man says what? There was no plane.

       Really? Cause all first hand witnesses say nothing about any planes. The only reason we think planes hit it is because it was played over and over on tv. There’s so many videos that have been scrubbed off the internet that I watched soon after 911 happened. There’s way more to the story than two planes hitting the towers.

       And WTC7 didn't just fall, it was blatantly demolished.

       <br/>
       Both sides of the building (330 feet apart) gave out at the same time.

       I'm not denying that the official story behind 9/11 is horseshit, but how are people proving that it was free-fall speed? I remember one guy here kept saying it was falling at 9.81 m/s, but that number isn't speed but gravitational acceleration. Speed is determined by air resistance, surface area, mass, etc.

       You clearly have not watched the video of the collapse. The penthouse collapses and as the internal failure moves across the building, the outer frame comes down. It is in fact the furthest thing from free fall and simultaneous collapse.

       It is factually incorrect for the reasons a engineer summed up which I will quote below
      </p>
      <p>
       __1. It ignores the reality that if girder A2001 was heated its lateral movement to the west would have been stopped by column 79’s western side plate restricting the lateral movement of the girder to about 3.7”.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It omits the ¾” thick x 18” high partial height web stiffeners on the column 79 end of girder A2001 which would prevent the girder’s flange from failing in flexure if the girder’s web could move past the bearing seat.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It acts as though the girder's flange would fail as soon as its web was beyond the seat, when in reality the W33 x 130 girder had a rather large 1.18" radius between its web and flange and stress analysis (knowing the girder had a 65 kip load share at its column 79 side of its total 130 kip load ) shows it would not fail until the web was .72" past the seat. This means the travel distance would need to be about 6" to the center of the web with a 12" wide seat + .29 inches to the edge of the .580" thick web + .72" = 7.01". This is room temperature. At 500C it would fail at 70% of the room temperature stress, which would make the travel distance about 6.87".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It originally said the girder bearing seat was 11” wide and that the lateral travel to the west was 5.5”. When told the drawing showed a 12” wide girder bearing seat the authors of the report changed the lateral travel to 6.25” but did not say where the additional .75” of travel to the west would come from. The longest beam to the east is K3004 at 53’-8 11/16” and it can only expand a maximum of 5.73” at 654 C, as after that it would shorten more than it will expand, due to sagging.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It does not consider any expansion to the east where the beams framing into the east wall at columns 38, 39, 40, and 41 have a ¾” space between their ends and the column web. If the shear studs broke on the beams the erection bolts on the beam seats should break and the beams would be free to expand to the east by that ¾” before even contacting the column. This would limit maximum expansion to the west to about 5”.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It does not consider the reality that if the girder flange did fail the girder could actually only fall onto the 2” thick x 14” deep x 18.875” wide support plate under the 1” thick x 12” wide bearing seat. The support plate would support the load at the girder’s web. In its model of girder A2001’s connection at column 79 it incorrectly uses a single stiffener or T type bearing seat like that at column 81 and girder B2011. The actual situation was a bearing seat with a large support plate spanning the width of the column. See Frankel drawing 9114.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It denies that there were shear studs on girder A2001, in spite of the 1986 paper by Frankel project manager John Salvarinas which showed there were 30 shear studs on the girder. Colin Bailey of Arup testified to the court in 2009 in the Aegis Insurance Co. vs. WTC 7 Properties case that he had learned there were indeed 30 shear studs on the girder.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It does not consider any effect from beam P3016 restricting the movement of the girder. Beam P3016 would have had 14 shear studs on it and would have certainly caused the girder to deflect differently than it would if its pivot was at column 44.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It does not consider any effects of friction from the floor slab on the movement of the beams and girder.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It omits the lateral support beams framing into beam G3005 and shows that beam buckling when it would not have had the support beams been included in the analysis.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It does not provide an analysis showing that even if girder A2001 could somehow fall off its seat at column 79 on the 13th floor that it could generate enough force to shear the welds of the support plate on the 12th floor and cause a cascade of floors and leave column 79 unsupported from the north. Analyses by researchers show the impact would only generate about 1/3rd of the force required.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It does not show analyses for breaking the connections of the other girders framing into column 79 for at least six stories. Column 79 had three girders framing into it (from the north, south, and west) and a column only needs lateral support from two orthogonal directions. It could lose lateral support from either the north or south and still remain stable. Column 79 could also go with no lateral support for five stories. The Arup FEA analysis shows the west and south girder connections remain stable. Arup did try to claim that the connections failed in fracture due to stress raisers in their welds. However, stress raisers are only very local and a large number of cycles are required for a crack to propagate before failing in yield.

       For evidence that it was a disintegration witnessed, and not just a collapse/demolition, refer to this video:

       It's honestly garbage, just like every other "skeptic's" take on it. They start off with a preconceived notion (which is also what the NIST did) and do mental gymnastics to make that notion work.

       And yeah I'd believe that we didn't identity loads of people. When a building crashes on top of a body, the immense pressure and heat and forces created is going to decimate Everything. Biological matter won't survive it at all. It's not like a crime scene where things are roughly preserved.

       It's funny... if you actually dig into the NIST report, you see that they admit that they can't prove this either.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Since fires were observed on the ground surrounding WTC 7, it is
        <strong>
         possible
        </strong>
        that
        <strong>
         potential
        </strong>
        ignition sources
        <strong>
         might
        </strong>
        have entered WTC 7 through openings created in the south and west face of the building during the collapses of the towers.
        <strong>
         NIST found no evidence to confirm this possibility,
        </strong>
        but the available data suggest that this was highly likely.” NIST NCSTAR 1-9, page 194
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They simply state that it is "highly likely" while simultaneously having "no evidence."
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you read further:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For WTC 7, however,
        <strong>
         the ignition
        </strong>
        and early course
        <strong>
         of the fires were unknown
        </strong>
        because they were presumed to have occurred in the damaged and heavily smoke-shrouded southern portion of the building" NIST NCSTAR 1-9, page 377
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So... NIST admits that they don't actually know the cause of the fires.

       The collapse made the old 7 World Trade Center the first tall building known to have collapsed primarily due to uncontrolled fires, and at the time, the only steel skyscraper in the world to have collapsed due to fire. It also was the location of NYC Emergency Management.

       I can tell see any way the plane would be able to hit that building. It was no where near as high is the twin towers. That would have been near impossible. Add in the fact there is just a hole and no wreckage at the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said it doesn't make sense that the had a fourth plane to crash into the ground. It only makes sense if the 4th plane was for the propaganda to say well hey ya it's super unlikely for a few guys and a knife to hijack an airplane. So guess what 25% of the planes fought back. Makes it seem less likely that 3 idiots in 3 planes can commandeer 3 planes by overpowering 100s of people.

       1 big Irish dude from fucking Oshawa could have stopped the highjacking.

       Putting aside anything else for now.  It is easy to forget after nearly 20 years of TSA security theater that 9/11 started in another metaphorical world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before 9/11 planes were not used as weapons.  They either were destroyed from a distance or used for hostages to get something.  If someone was going to kill all on board they did it remotely.  Not by taking it over.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was the school of thought back then.  If you are taken hostage it would be an inconvienance, but odds are if you just listened to the hostages you would live through it.  This was the world all four planes took off in.  Almost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flight 93 was delayed in taking off by 40 minutes.  The first tower was hit by whatever just four minutes after takeoff, fifty minutes before the hijacking is thought to have occured.  80 minutes before the alleged crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why, if you believe the official story, it makes sense that only Flight 93 would have fought back.  Cellphone signal debate aside, because of the delay in taking off they were the only flight where the passengers would have potentially had enough time to hear about the other crashes and realize this wasn’t a “normal” hostage situation as it was thought of back then.
