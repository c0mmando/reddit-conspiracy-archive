<p>I know most people here probably hate The Donald, but I want to give some kudos to them regardless. Say what you want, but Trump made a lot of people <strong>question the narrative</strong> which in my view is an incredible achievement. Just how much he moved in this regard struck me when a popular MSM host, Tucker Carlson, was allowed to bring a whole piece about the last <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=cSGf2ZpDENU">staged attack in Douma</a></p>

<p>Imagine if someone did that on CNN, MSNBC, CNSBC and how they&#39;re all called.</p>

<p>I see the accustions already flying and no, Im no Donald Trump shill. Im neither left nor right. Im just observing, making my own conclusions and I see potential in some of Trumps actions. </p>

<p>Bingo. This guy gets it. Despite Trump being a political novice and fairly ineffective, his redeeming quality is that he has made the Deep State/oligarchy/elite reveal themselves to the masses. Very few people trust the MSM news now and people, regardless of political affiliation, are realizing that their party and government only represents the elite. </p>

<p>Funnily enough these heinous acts of alchemical butchery always seem to happen when Assad is well in the lead in this war.

<p>3 times so far, and he&#39;s gonna do it again, once again so close to victory? Risk renewed action from the US and her allies?</p>

<p>The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him—
    the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding,
    the Spirit of counsel and of might,
    the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the Lord—
and he will delight in the fear of the Lord.</p>

<p>He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes,
    or decide by what he hears with his ears;
but with righteousness he will judge the needy,
    with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth.</p>

<p>He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth;
    with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.</p>

<p>Righteousness will be his belt
    and faithfulness the sash around his waist.</p>

<p>y22 “What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” Pilate asked.</p>

<p>23 “Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate.</p>

<p>But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”</p>

<p>24 When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!”</p>

<p>25 All the people answered, “His blood is on us and on our children!”</p>

<p>26 Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.”</p>

<p>Anyone reading the Bible can tell Jesus was killed by the Christ killing demon Jews salivating for his blood as they demanded Pilate killed him. Your Jewish deception may work on prots but no catholic would ever fall for this horse shit. </p>

<p>Tucker: &quot;Actually, I know you are sort-of kidding, but I agree with that, I think we are the only country, rather we are, that&#39;s absolutely right the only country with moral authority sufficient to do that.

<p>Can you list the wars you consider valid (I assume just Afghanistan and Iraq) and what years you consider him a &quot;pundit while in politics.&quot; Do you consider his time as Editor-in-Chief of The Daily Caller and any Op/Eds they publish as his view?</p>

<p>Also, warmonger isn&#39;t only defined as supporting current wars. Here is the first definition from a search engine &quot;a person who encourages or advocates aggression towards other countries or groups.&quot;</p>

<p>Can what Tucker Carlson said about Iran and their annihilation be considered encouraging aggression towards other countries? My opinion is yes. Therefore, techinically, he fits the definition of warmonger based on the Iran statement.</p>
