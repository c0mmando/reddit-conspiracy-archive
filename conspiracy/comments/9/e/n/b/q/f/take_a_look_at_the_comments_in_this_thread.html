        question the narrative
       </strong>
       which in my view is an incredible achievement. Just how much he moved in this regard struck me when a popular MSM host, Tucker Carlson, was allowed to bring a whole piece about the last

       I see the accustions already flying and no, Im no Donald Trump shill. Im neither left nor right. Im just observing, making my own conclusions and I see potential in some of Trumps actions.

       I think your observations are accurate. Even though people still follow MSM news and get upset when you question Trump, he still brought awareness to fake news and woke people up on a mass level. People who otherwise wouldn't have ever been the wiser.

       Another good thing to come out of it is that people are a lot more active and familiar with politics now. A lot of people didn’t even know who their senators were. People are looking into how politics works and who is representing them.

       There are people worth listening to from every corner of the Earth. Trump supporters are no different.

       I have friends who still go to mass and I have friends who are so liberal its almost funny. If they're good people, I dont really care what they believe in their heads (within reason obviously!), I'm sure they think I'm equally nuts.

       If you were familiar with my contributions you would know that I’m the opposite of hyper partisan. I’m not a trump supporter and I’m quite fact the opposite. I think he’s a puppet like the rest. But I can respect his supporters voicing out against the topic at hand.

       We need to stop picking sides soak all info start thinking freely and deciding for ourselves. I truly believe currently in a civil war and don’t know it. And I believe it’s manufactured to be this way.

       That isn't a new war theater though. I don't have high hopes after billion dollars deals with Saudi Arabia and Israel that pretty much guarantee more terrorism and retaliation.

       Isn't he trying really hard to open new war theaters in North Korea and Iran while expanding the conflicts we're already in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems a really weird thing to reward him for not starting any new wars when he's escalated military conflicts, very clearly breaking a campaign promise in doing so.

       OK well I guess my point is that if this person vows to vote for Trump as a reward for "not opening any new war theaters" during his term then does it not count that he's killing just as many people in the same countries despite promising to be "American First" and getting out of conflicts.

       So he's not cheering on war. He's just threatening them with war.

       I mean, if he is threatening with war to enact change, then couldn't the media's alleged cheering on of war also be for the same purpose as Trump... to enact change?

       Carrying a big stick is a non-interventionist ideal for foriegn policy. Display your might and power as a deterrent hoping to never use it. Threatening NoKo has worked. And no..the media cheering on war is exactly that, cheering on war.  The audience of the media is its citizens. They're so gleeful when it comes to reporting war.

       He does appear hawkish on Iran and Syria from his past decisions. Not gonna lie there. And as a TD poster myself and returning to OP's original comment, I can say that it hurts a lot of people over there when there are any inking of war or intervention. The vast majority of people in that sub are anti war. I would say 90%+.

       Bingo. This guy gets it. Despite Trump being a political novice and fairly ineffective, his redeeming quality is that he has made the Deep State/oligarchy/elite reveal themselves to the masses. Very few people trust the MSM news now and people, regardless of political affiliation, are realizing that their party and government only represents the elite.

       So, despite everything, you're still convinced that Assad gassed his own people, again?

      <p>
       Isn't it odd that every time he seems about to rid his country of the invaders and insurrectionists, his victory is within his grasp, that he gasses everyone and makes the US redouble their efforts to freedomize his country?

       That's a nice deflection. I thought we were talking about Trump's public views on Assad and his culpability in gassing Syrians and how you seem to believe he can't just call the "deep state" out. Which implies you think he is lying about Assad being an animal and you believe Trump is just lying to the public so he can covertly take down TPTB.

       The last 3 "chemical attacks" were false flags and seen through right away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funnily enough these heinous acts of alchemical butchery always seem to happen when Assad is well in the lead in this war. In other words, he's almost won, so decides to perpetrate war crimes against his own people and drag the powers he's managed to oust from his country back into it?
      </p>
      <p>
       3 times so far, and he's gonna do it again, once again so close to victory? Risk renewed action from the US and her allies?
      </p>
      <p>
       These attacks are being perpetrated by US-backed rebels to attempt to generate outrage so the people will be duped into supporting more boots on the ground in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not working. I think even some Americans are starting to question this whole "War is life" policy the US gubbamint has implemented.

        Carlson has stated that former U.S. president George W. Bush is not a true conservative. In an August 27, 2004, Washington Post interview, Carlson expressed his "displeasure with Bush". Carlson asked: "Why do so many antiwar liberals give [John] Kerry a pass when he adopts the Bush view on Iraq, as he has? The amount of team-playing on the left depresses me."[29]
        <strong>
         Carlson did not vote in the 2004 election, citing his disgust with the Iraq War and his disillusionment with the once small-government Republican Party.

       I think a lot of countries deserve to be annihilated. I don’t support policies that propose that and neither does Tucker. Also the website your linking, which purposely dedicates itself to misquoting conservatives and attacking them, cut up the quote used at least 4 times, not that it even matters due to my former argument.

       I like what Tucker has been up to lately in exposing the farmland murders in SA, and questioning the Syrian chemical attacks, but he is not anti-war, nor does he oppose the US-Zionist agenda.

       You really don't have to be such a dickrider. I said I liked some stuff Tucker does. But he has been known to support the same Zionist agenda in the past (see the clip and quote above) that he is supposedly speaking out against now.

       Isaiah 11:2-5

      <p>
       The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him—
    the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding,
    the Spirit of counsel and of might,
    the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the Lord—
and he will delight in the fear of the Lord.

      <p>
       He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes,
    or decide by what he hears with his ears;
but with righteousness he will judge the needy,
    with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth;
    with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.

       Righteousness will be his belt
    and faithfulness the sash around his waist.

       y22 “What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” Pilate asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       They all answered, “Crucify him!”
      </p>
      <p>
       23 “Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”
      </p>
      <p>
       24 When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!”
      </p>
      <p>
       25 All the people answered, “His blood is on us and on our children!”
      </p>
      <p>
       26 Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone reading the Bible can tell Jesus was killed by the Christ killing demon Jews salivating for his blood as they demanded Pilate killed him. Your Jewish deception may work on prots but no catholic would ever fall for this horse shit.

The only country that doesn't seek hegemony in the world. I do think, i'm sure I'm the lone voice saying this, Iran deserves to be annihilated. I think they're lunatics. I think they're evil. I do think we should assess the price of oil if we were to do that. I think that's a small factor"

       How did I change my argument at all? My original point was Tucker is not a war monger evident by the fact he’s literally never supported a war while in politics. You still haven’t provided one example that contradicts that.

       Can you list the wars you consider valid (I assume just Afghanistan and Iraq) and what years you consider him a "pundit while in politics." Do you consider his time as Editor-in-Chief of The Daily Caller and any Op/Eds they publish as his view?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, warmonger isn't only defined as supporting current wars. Here is the first definition from a search engine "a person who encourages or advocates aggression towards other countries or groups."
      </p>
      <p>
       Can what Tucker Carlson said about Iran and their annihilation be considered encouraging aggression towards other countries? My opinion is yes. Therefore, techinically, he fits the definition of warmonger based on the Iran statement.

       I asked you to name me one war Tucker has supported while in politics, if you don’t have answer to the question than your response is irrelevant. My follow up would be name one cable news pundit who opposed the War on terror and getting involved in the Syrian war. The only person who qualifies is Tucker Carlson.

       So the implication from OP here is that, despite Trump calling Assad a monster, he also “allows” a guy from Fox News to do a 7 minute segment. Therefore he is allowing people to “question the narrative” and that a hypothetical scenario with other, Non-Fox News MSM is proof also that Trump is changing the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is this really just saying good work to The_Donald sub for questioning Syria, despite Trump seemingly being on board of “the narrative”

       Everyone needs to have a look at this comment chain and accept the fact that, contrary to popular belief, people like this are completely self-aware.  They have to be aware of exactly what they're doing to be able to project this accurately.

       How about you just look at the CONTENT I pointed out instead of giving me shit over fucking memes?
You can disagree with a side but still appreciate certain viewpoints of them.
But oh no, I get it, it's either or, black or white, there are no grey areas.

       Just because Trump hijacked traditional conspiracy talking points to further his own agenda doesn't mean he's "fighting the good fight".  Trump might not be a career politician, but he
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       a career conman and anyone who can't see that he's currently running his biggest con ever is wearing blinders.

       You really don't have to be such a dickrider. I said I liked some stuff Tucker does. But he has been known to support the same Zionist agenda in the past (see the clip and quote above) that he is supposedly speaking out against now.
