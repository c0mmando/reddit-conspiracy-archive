       Mao Zedong supposedly destroyed all secret societies in China when he came to power and replaced it with the Communist Party, but what if he didn't? China is thousands of years old, and it's been insulated from Western politics for most of those years. What if he too was a puppet of a greater secret organization that supersedes geographic boundaries, much like what we call the Illuminati in the West? Is the Illuminati in a secret war with their East Asian counterpart? When the US rebuilt Japan, did the Western Illuminati take over? What about India?

       "the irruminati".  Censorship is really pervading everything now.  It was a fucking joke, and a hilarious one too.  People who are unable to laugh at jokes need to go get fucked, literally.  It might help them lighten up.

       They're not exactly a "secret society" any more than the Russian Mafia is a secret society. The rich and powerful of China are all in the Communist Party, but is there another more secret plan they're even more loyal too? The emperor of China is dead according to our history books, but who's to say that

        the Panchen Lama that was kidnapped by the communists and disappeared

       Read the book about the Skull and bones organization. It was written by the son of a CIA officer. Why do you think 18 cia agents were killed in China the other week? It’s because they’re trying to infiltrate military ranks so when ww3 happens they’ll control every aspect of it

       I dunno man, you'd think white people would stick out if they were trying to infiltrate the Chinese military.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for the sake of your idea, let's entertain that there are indeed ethnically Chinese Skull and Bones members that speak Chinese fluently. What are the chances that they're actually loyal to The Skull and Bones? What are the chances they weren't in fact sent by the unknown Chinese equivalent to infiltrate? What are the chances they can't be turned into double agents, by people who look like them, talk like them, and treat them without subconscious racial bias?

       well... do you remember the goddess cult in south korea a few years back that when exposed lead to the resignation of the nations leader? might be an interesting place to start. occultism and blood transfusions from children into the political goddess propped up by a cult exposed by a bunch of avid online college kid slueths...

       The Jesuits cozied up to the Qing Dynasty, which was Jurchen and opposed in by numerous Han Chinese secret organizations. After the Qing collapsed, did the bloodlines you describe join the Communists, the Nationalists, or both to hedge their bets? What's their current power structure?

       Communism was created by the Jesuits so they played all sides like they always do. I say the Jesuits but there are others groups like the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Masons, etc. There is a catch-all term for these groups and that would be the Black Nobility.

       Only the superficial conspiracies are US-centric or West-centric. The conspiracy for global domination and collectivism is, by definition, global.
      </p>
      <p>
       On an unrelated note,
       <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/167289/nanjing-jewish-studies">
        here is an interesting MSM article
       </a>
       , titled "The Chinese Believe That The Jews Control America. Is That A Good Thing?"
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Do the Jews Really Control America?” asked one Chinese newsweekly headline in 2009. The factoids doled out in such articles and in books about Jews in China—for example: “The world’s wealth is in Americans’ pockets; Americans are in Jews’ pockets”—would rightly be seen to be alarming in other contexts. But in China, where Jews are widely perceived as clever and accomplished, they are meant as compliments. Scan the shelves in any bookstore in China and you are likely to find best-selling self-help books based on Jewish knowledge. Most focus on how to make cash. Titles range from 101 Money Earning Secrets From Jews’ Notebooks to Learn To Make Money With the Jews.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Chinese recognize, and embrace, common characteristics between their culture and Jewish culture. Both races have a large diaspora spread across the globe. Both place emphasis on family, tradition, and education. Both boast civilizations that date back thousands of years. In Shanghai, I am often told with nods of approval that I must be intelligent, savvy, and quick-witted, simply because of my ethnicity. While it is true that the Chinese I’ve met are fascinated by—rather than fear—the Jews, these assertions make me deeply uncomfortable.

       It's interesting that the "ethnic English" sort of fit the mold ascribed to the Chinese and the Jews.  A large diaspora with a shared language and culture and rather than being just influential minorities, they also control a lot of countries and territory via political hegemony -- US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and to some extent South Africa, with the US being something of a recursive version 2.0 of the original, having its own colonial-like influence and diaspora.

       It doesnt have to do with last names.
It has to do with blood groups and blood lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can elaborate on specific points if you have questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this is only my opinion at the moment, dont take my word for it do your own research.

       That would take me days to type out but i could give you some pointers.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point in our past SOME of us have been altered genetically.
All RH positives are altered, RH negatives remain untouched.
      </p>
      <p>
       85% of the whole world is RH + now and this wasnt always the case as RH Negs were the majority in ancient times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here it gets a bit confusing but stick with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each blood group corresponds to a layer/realm of the heavens (we know them as Planets now) there are 7 in total.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sun and Moon (AB + and AB -) share the 4th middle layer, therefore theres 3 below it and 3 above totaling 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Below the Sun/Moon are Earth (A+),  Venus (B+) and Mars (O+) and above are Jupiter (O-),  Mercury (B-) and Saturn (A-)
      </p>
      <p>
       Jupiter is who the religions calls Lucifer/Iblis, he and his kind were a warrior class of beings (Grigori) that inhabited the 5th layer.
      </p>
      <p>
       2/3rds fell (kicked out) 1/3rd fell to Venus ( a place of darkness), 1/3rd to Mars (a place of torment) .. not great places to be.
The remaining third that didnt fall is still up there and thats your O Negatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you gotta understand that we dont all come here from the same place, we each are fastened to a layer in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       The so called "Elites" are usually O's which is the serpent seed.
As and Bs are children of Adam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not generalizing people because theres variation in all the groups but deep down theres a pattern you can find with certain blood groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       This might sound incoherent and i apologize since i didnt have much time to type out a more detailed response.

       The Rh factor is an antigen that is found in the blood of RH Positive people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its named after the Rhesus Monkey who also carries it. But in reality what it means is Rhea Zeus positive ( they always have to tell you the truth in some way).
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically the reason they were kicked out is because some of them had children with Earthly women and produced RH positive offspring.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a human female who is RH - had a baby with a RH + father, the actual body of the mother will attack and kill the RH+ fetus because the immune system considers it as a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       That alone tells you that we were never supposed to mix, but of course nowadays women just take some immunosuppressive shots and keep pumping out babies.

       This confuses me. Drugs get brand names that sound nothing like them all the time, so why did they leave clues of the truth hiding in plain sight?

       When they tell you the truth subliminally your conscious mind might not pick it up but your subconscious mind will.
      </p>
      <p>
       It relieves them of karma a bit when they tell you the things theyre doing to you.

       I reckon that communism came from somewhere, huh? I wouldn't be suprised if Mao was a puppet. If there was a pre-existing cabal, maybe it was replaced and Mao was an "agent" for a western cabal. I think Asia, i.e China, Korea, Vietnam etc. underwent an ideological molding, and the power play between US and Russia in particular played a huge part in it (which may have not been as clear and cut either given information alluding to the whole "they played both sides during WW2 trope.) Mao brought Maoism, or Chinese communism and a nearly united China in 1949, for the first time in since the opium wars, . So it was an idelogical molding that started after World War 2. Kind of makes sense?
