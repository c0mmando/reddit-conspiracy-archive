       The MSM is trying their best to keep this fact brushed under the rug, and the closer we get to complete biosphere collapse the harder it will be to keep covering it up.

       </a>
       (this article is a perfect example of blatant lies and pacification...the rising methane levels are from the planet heating up and massive methane deposits deep underground and under the oceans being released as the atmosphere and the oceans are quickly heating up)
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB are down-playing the severity of the situation. Using the words in Their articles like "could" "may" "might" and are trying to cover it up until the last possible moment, before it can no longer be covered up anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some minor research, look up "mass animal die off" or "methane levels rising" or "solar radiation management"
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB are spraying heavy metals into our atmosphere in an attempt to temporarily cool the planet because it's heating up very quickly. A massive snow storm in any major city during the winter months will have the entire U.S. population convinced that all is well - this is but another pacification making sure it seems like business as usual as the entire ecosystem around is dying BY THE DAY. TPTB are modifying our weather systems, some of you already fully acknowledge this yet would prefer to talk about staged political theater - NEWSFLASH, Trump is just another puppet POTUS he is not on your side, the U.S.'s side or any other side that benefits the common person. His administration is taking measures to rip apart the little EPA regulations we already had (the EPA is corrupt to the core like any other department of the U.S. government) and the world is suffering exponentially worse than anyone could have thought. If anything, Trump is actually working with the DNC and once again this entire political theater is a giant show, a staged performance and if you think every POTUS going back to at least JFK was a staged puppet while simultaneously thinking Trump is somehow different, you are delusional.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       But I digress, EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE THINKING ABOUT THE EARTH'S CLIMATE AND ECOSYSTEMS FIRST AND FOREMOST. Very soon, within our lifetimes (I am 28) we will start to see SEVERE 'weather whiplash' as TPTB continue to poke and prod the planet's natural weather systems with Their technologies. GeoEngineering is on the top of the list for issues we need to come together and expose or we won't have a planet to complain about politics on. THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, this is not some far-off 'thing' that you can push into the back of your mind while you watch football or go to a music festival and get high - the planet is on the brink of complete biosphere collapse. We are on track for a Runaway Greenhouse Effect, which means our planet will not be able to heal itself once inevitable (and very soon) climate collapse happens....and will essentially turn into Venus as all the methane that's beneath the arctic is no longer permafrosted. PLEASE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is more important than ANYTHING. We are facing certain climate collapse and what are you going to do when the trucks stop delivering food to our precious grocery stores?

       Hoooo boy your tinfoil hat must be big !!! Ahahah you're trying to scare people with green agenda, this is utter bullshit, man don't cause climate change, maybe we speed it a little, but hotter and colder phase are common on earth since the start !! Also, for the instinction, it's normal, but somehow, someday, a new specie will rise and will be adapted for "hotter climate" or "methanised climate" like you said !

       I agree with what you said about the political theater, but this is at its core an economical and by extension political problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we need is all of us to come together, organize and face the problem head on. I rather pretend everything is alright.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm convinced that for this to happen we need to remove all borders, remove all nationalism and pool our collective talents to see if we stand a chance, or if the great filter is gonna get us.

       However like I said I belive that all of these issues are economical / political at the core and environmental activist are easily labeled as "hippies" or in some cases "terrorists". Good luck man!

       No, this is a spiritual problem its core...which radiates out to politics and economics. Please, join me. Educate yourself on the world literally dying by the day, stop distracting yourself with stupid political theater!! Will you join the fight to try and sound the alarm?! Or will you keep going on business as usual, pretending everything will be ok?!

       This is insanity...we have people fully acknowledging this is a dire concern....yet are AFRAID of some weak label such as a hippie, and I don't even know how you got "terrorist" included in this topic.... fear fear fear.

       I think you missed my point. I'm just saying to fix this issue we gotta fix economics and politics. That's how we can save the environment.

       Look, I'm not trying to argue with you. I love you because you're a human (I am assuming at least) and we both collectively face a massive threat. Hiding behind your screen pretending you are doing something to discuss the political theater is a false hope Action must be taken, the reason nothing really changes for the better is because everybody is all talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will gladly be labeled some sort of domestic terrorist if it means trying to fight for our PLANET, not our COUNTRY. Fuck the FBI, I understand I stand little chance against a force such as the FBI, but if we all stood together, then it's a different story. We need to fix spirituality and if we can accomplish that, the politics/economics will follow. You have to pull the weed out from the ground, not just keep cutting the top off as you mow the lawn, otherwise it keeps growing back.

       Our leadership is corrupt to the core. Trying to vote more corrupt criminals in is not going to solve anything. Believe it or not, as soon as you cast your vote in the form of a ballot you have just surrendered 100% of your potential power into someone in the HOPES that they do something about, so you don't have to, so you can keep watching your sports, getting high, watching countless mindless forms of entertainment - and feel like 'you did your part.'
      </p>
      <p>
       U.S. "democracy" is a complete scam, entirely. It does not work for us. Wake the fuck up already.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I mean by it being a spiritual core problem is that our leaders are clinically insane and have no idea how to actually solve problems that They themselves have created. They have lost touch with the planet and the very thing which gives us life, to try and get rich/powerful over Their fellow man. If you have no positive spirituality with mother nature in mind you are completely lost because mother nature is what even allows us to be talking on Reddit right now, or complain about stupid politics. If we all get together on a local level and make immediate change in our local communities, it will eventually spread outwards to the federal level and that's when you start seeing change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire planet needs to get back to what it once had - a religion that worships Mother Nature, not some made up, debt-based God of fear and "or else" mentality. THEN, we will see change politically and economically.

       Yes we need to regulate companies that are huge contributors to the issue of carbon increasing in the atmoshphere which is a major cause of this extinction, corporations are the biggest culprits not geoengineering

       Hahaha I'm Texan. I hear it from my friends all the time if we start arguing about politics. I like to sarcastically say that because it sounds a lot like the rape defence where the victim was "begging for it". Those people use the Bible as their defence and have zero self control unless the Bible explicitly calls for it.

       In in my early 20s. Some friends are very religious and argue that everything in this world has an agenda against god and that the government has to fix it. They believe Disney and Hollywood is evil and shit. Idk. Something you don't want to go against on this sub, but you can't really on God for everything

       I think the gravest threat we face right now is corruption that is rampant throughout the world. It's the sole reason as to why we can't face our other issues. Even if we came together and agreed to work towards a solution to combat carbon emissions we would need the whole world to part take in the action. It simply is unfeasible. Without a new technology to sustain energy production.
      </p>
      <p>
       As others have stated as well, climate change is something that happens often in the terms of Earth's life span. The thing we need to focus on is adapting to the coming weather. Try to root out the corruption in society and work together to create a better future. Even if we were to reduce all carbon emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weather anomalies occuring also could be due to cosmic influences, the earths poles may be shifting. The truth of the matter is that it is likely a combination of things altering the earth's environment. Our best bet is to prepare, for the inevitable. It will happen at one time or another.

       I agree with you. Although I'm not sure if tptb are trying to mask  the problem or if they are the ones CREATiNG the global warming event. One thing is sure, the weather that's changed in the last 10 years and is more unpredictable than ever and the extremes are big

       Being mindless about the Earth - in general. Of course, we are taught this destructive behavior by our financial masters undoubtedly. But this will cause certain geological disaster due to greenhouse gases, as well as GeoEngineering and Climate Engineering. Look into "solar radiation management" and you will see that 'chemtrails ' are not just some silly conspiracy theory.

       I am referring to the 5th Mass Extinction according to the scientific data/theory consensus - the Permian mass extinction which took out the dinosaurs.

       I think the last mass extinction was 10-12K years ago that seems to have wiped out an advanced civilization and is speculated to have been a object hitting the northern ice packs in particular in N. America but caused a global event as well.
      </p>

       I don't think what you fear, a human caused mass extinction is impossible or entirely unlikely.

      <p>
       Research "mass animal die off" and "mass plant die off" and "methane levels rising"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then take that information and correlate it to the models in which popular science has theorized which killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago - it comes down to methane levels. The permafrost in the arctic region is no longer permanently frozen....releasing massive amounts of methane.

       I use it also. But there is a difference in using it a couple nights a week and keeping a fire lit 24/7. Also, here in America, replanting forests is mandated so we dont worry so much about depleating the resource. My main problem is with the full out ignorance of trash and littering. If these people do not/cannot underetand the impacts their populous creates then they should not be allowed to have products that contaminate the environment. Yes, I am talking aout them being forced to not have any plastics, glass, or metwl thwt they just use and throw into the ocean or river. The rest of the CIVILIZED world has progrqms and plans on dealing with these issues, but it seems like lsome countries flagrently ignore them as if its not their problem.

       I use it also. But there is a difference in using it a couple nights a week and keeping a fire lit 24/7. Also, here in America, replanting forests is mandated so we dont worry so much about depleating the resource. My main problem is with the full out ignorance of trash and littering. If these people do not/cannot underetand the impacts their populous creates then they should not be allowed to have products that contaminate the environment. Yes, I am talking aout them being forced to not have any plastics, glass, or metwl thwt they just use and throw into the ocean or river. The rest of the CIVILIZED world has progrqms and plans on dealing with these issues, but it seems like lsome countries flagrently ignore them as if its not their problem.

       So we can compel them with our military to do any goddamn thing we want in the pursuit of American hegemony but when it comes to pollution we have no leverage? Is that what you're selling?

       In in my early 20s. Some friends are very religious and argue that everything in this world has an agenda against god and that the government has to fix it. They believe Disney and Hollywood is evil and shit. Idk. Something you don't want to go against on this sub, but you can't really on God for everything

       Being mindless about the Earth - in general. Of course, we are taught this destructive behavior by our financial masters undoubtedly. But this will cause certain geological disaster due to greenhouse gases, as well as GeoEngineering and Climate Engineering. Look into "solar radiation management" and you will see that 'chemtrails ' are not just some silly conspiracy theory.

       I am referring to the 5th Mass Extinction according to the scientific data/theory consensus - the Permian mass extinction which took out the dinosaurs.
