       I just find it a bit dishonest that you've regularly posted on threads in this forum about how much you hate "shills" and "trolls" (heck, I'm pretty sure you've accused me, at one point or another, of being one). And now you're arguing that there's an effective and legitimate means of disseminating truth. It's...confusing...to say the least.

       Agreed. I'm quite capable of holding a conversation about rhetoric - but to suggest I've studied it, when I've never said anything in regards to that, is inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know a lot about Star Wars, too - doesn't mean I've studied it. Study has an academic connotation - it suggests a formal engagement with a topic.

       Absolutely - an ethical appeal is going to rely, almost exclusively, on the credibility of the author, or speaker. So, for instance, if I'm a doctor and I'm writing an article about how important it is to eat healthy, I'm probably going to include a line or two about my background in medicine. I'm going to encourage the listener to take my words seriously precisely because of my credibility as a speaker.
      </p>
      <p>
       A logical appeal is going to use measurable facts or statistics - if I'm arguing for the failure of the drug war, I'm going to use statistics that show how overdose deaths or incarceration rates have increased. If I'm trying to discourage drinking and driving, I might bring up the statistics related to deaths caused by drivers under the influence.

       There's some really great resources on the whole rhetorical triangle here:

       I came to this post because I wasn't sure why someone would encourage trolling. Especially since it seems to be such an issue nowadays.

       I come to this sub because, since I was a child, I've enjoyed conspiracy theories - everything from aliens to Bigfoot to MKULTRA. I enjoy alternative beliefs and I think it's important to support free thought and transparency.

       Trolling doesn't seem to me a very effective means of communicating a message. That's what I originally posted in response to OP's suggestion we "troll" people with different opinions. Mind you, my comment was not - in any way - negative other than to say I disagreed with the sentiment. Are you suggesting that we can't disagree with each other?

       OP's message wasn't to spread "facts" - it was to "troll any or all of these deniers and propagandists peddling and perpetuating false narrative".
      </p>
      <p>
       There's lots of ways to do things - I think doing it legitimately through authentic argument and credible evidence would be a cornerstone of conspiracy theory belief. But now you're telling me shilling/trolling is acceptable?

       It's not positive if it doesn't work and pushes people further away from the ideas you're trying to legitimize. If you believed in the truth, you'd want everyone to access that. Instead, you waste your time engaging in pointless back-and-forth's that further divide those who wish to learn more. It's really sad.

       I can agree 100% with that statement - but portraying the truth via trolling isn't going to win you any supporters. Which makes me question whether or not the purpose is to gain support or to simply enjoy the troll.

       To you what is "trolling". Trolling is a fishing term that just means putting it, as in the baited hook, out there to drag in the wake.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do know that right?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think trolling is?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the spreading of information. That's all.

       I've said this several times now - I used a hypothetical to suggest that people who are easily influenced by shilling are going to have a hard time in the real world. You took that as a personal attack - I can't help it if you're so sensitive as to not be able to separate hypothetical statements from personal attacks.

       <p>
        In Internet slang, a troll (/troʊl, trɒl/) is a person who starts quarrels or upsets people on the Internet to distract and sow discord by posting inflammatory and digressive,[1] extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the intent of provoking readers into displaying emotional responses[2] and normalizing tangential discussion,[3] whether for the troll's amusement or a specific gain.

       Okay clearly we are talking about different things, can you define shilling and trolling for me so that I can get on your level?
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought shilling was more or less advertising. I.e. "go to that play OMG it's so good! Sorry for shilling for it, I just loved it!"

       I consider a shill somebody that isn't intending to contribute to the conversation - there's no good faith effort. I'm aware of additional definitions, ones that pertain more towards marketing, but that isn't the context in which I'm using it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       A troll is somebody that's attempting to be edgy or provocative for no other reason than attention. They offer nothing but childish insults and continuously pick away at semantics.

       It's not positive if it doesn't work and pushes people further away from the ideas you're trying to legitimize. If you believed in the truth, you'd want everyone to access that. Instead, you waste your time engaging in pointless back-and-forth's that further divide those who wish to learn more. It's really sad.

        Wait, what? I posted about how I was concerned OP was encouraging trolling, a bannable offense by this sub's rules. You proceeded to reply to every single one of my comments - sometimes with repeated information - and yet you're going to suggest I'm a troll? Cute.

       More antagonism... Is the world fighting against you? We are all here to learn together. No need to be nasty.

       Why the need to call me "cute" I mean I'm flattered but a bit offended at the same time. I mean I know I'm cute, but I really feel like you're saying it in a way to belittle my existence.

       Asking me if I knew anything about it presupposes you have enough information in your head to carry on a discussion on the subject, .i.e. usually people who ask questions like that already know a little bit about the topic.

       Guess I shouldn't assume with you.
