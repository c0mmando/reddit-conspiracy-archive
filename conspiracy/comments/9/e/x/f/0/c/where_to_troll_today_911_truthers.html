<p>Agreed. I&#39;m quite capable of holding a conversation about rhetoric - but to suggest I&#39;ve studied it, when I&#39;ve never said anything in regards to that, is inaccurate.</p>

<p>I know a lot about Star Wars, too - doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve studied it. Study has an academic connotation - it suggests a formal engagement with a topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely - an ethical appeal is going to rely, almost exclusively, on the credibility of the author, or speaker. So, for instance, if I&#39;m a doctor and I&#39;m writing an article about how important it is to eat healthy, I&#39;m probably going to include a line or two about my background in medicine. I&#39;m going to encourage the listener to take my words seriously precisely because of my credibility as a speaker.</p>

<p>A logical appeal is going to use measurable facts or statistics - if I&#39;m arguing for the failure of the drug war, I&#39;m going to use statistics that show how overdose deaths or incarceration rates have increased. If I&#39;m trying to discourage drinking and driving, I might bring up the statistics related to deaths caused by drivers under the influence. </p>

<p>Trolling doesn&#39;t seem to me a very effective means of communicating a message. That&#39;s what I originally posted in response to OP&#39;s suggestion we &quot;troll&quot; people with different opinions. Mind you, my comment was not - in any way - negative other than to say I disagreed with the sentiment. Are you suggesting that we can&#39;t disagree with each other?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said this several times now - I used a hypothetical to suggest that people who are easily influenced by shilling are going to have a hard time in the real world. You took that as a personal attack - I can&#39;t help it if you&#39;re so sensitive as to not be able to separate hypothetical statements from personal attacks. </p>

<p>In Internet slang, a troll (/troʊl, trɒl/) is a person who starts quarrels or upsets people on the Internet to distract and sow discord by posting inflammatory and digressive,[1] extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the intent of provoking readers into displaying emotional responses[2] and normalizing tangential discussion,[3] whether for the troll&#39;s amusement or a specific gain.</p>

<p>So you would censor jokes people might find offensive as trolling?</p>

<p>Please inform me where I used the term &quot;censor&quot;.</p>

<p>Have you ever studied or read up on rhetoric? It&#39;s a pretty powerful tool people use in debate. It&#39;s much more effective than trolling. </p>

<p>Trolling is just spreading information. It is literally a from of rhetoric...</p>

<p>Wait, what? I posted about how I was concerned OP was encouraging trolling, a bannable offense by this sub&#39;s rules. You proceeded to reply to every single one of my comments - sometimes with repeated information - and yet you&#39;re going to suggest I&#39;m a troll? Cute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More antagonism... Is the world fighting against you? We are all here to learn together. No need to be nasty.</p>

<p>Why the need to call me &quot;cute&quot; I mean I&#39;m flattered but a bit offended at the same time. I mean I know I&#39;m cute, but I really feel like you&#39;re saying it in a way to belittle my existence. </p>
