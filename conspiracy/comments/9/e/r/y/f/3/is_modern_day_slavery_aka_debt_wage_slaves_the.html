       Your history is a little wonky. 30 years ago we had almost free and affordable college because govt was subsidizing the schools. Then the banks said why don’t we just loan students the money instead and the govt can stop the subsidies.

       You highlighted the biggest conspiracy of all when you said govt was subsidizing the schools. That's what they want you to think. Govt wasn't subsidizing the schools, WE were subsidizing the schools. Income taxes are OUR money the govt want you to think it is theirs just because they are supposed to appropriate its use.

       Its not the biggest conspiracy, but definitely an ongoing one. Theres just so much going on in our world, and more than 70% of it is being covered up or dressed as something else to fool the over all population. We are all slaves to the bankers and the elite few that control everything we see, smell, taste, touch, and do in our "free" time. They dont want us to know the truth behind a lot of things because it would take away their power and control over us all..

       No one is forcing anyone to stay a job that they feel is paying them less than they are worth. If you think you are worth more than what you get, then find someone to pay you it or you ain't worth it.

       What about the people who have hundreds of billions of dollars that outsource to avoid taxes? Paying off certain politicians to be able to avoid the law and run their business unlawfully?  The problem isn't poor people trying to find a better way of living. The problem is the greedy people who are sucking the world dry and the idiots who fall for all the things they say.

       I don't think the government should be taking taxes either. I can spend my money much better than they can and if whatever I buy or put it to doesn't deliver it's promises, I won't pay them anymore.

       So here in Ohio, we seem to have this cabal of business owners who feel like 13 to 15 dollars an hour is a living wage. Yes there is growth potential, but do the math, not everyone in these environments can make 80k a year through advancement in the same company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we have other states that impose non-compete orders or restrictive covenants. I know alot folks who have been forced to leave a job that they have worked at for years and not be able to work anywhere else doing a similar job.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in a way, they kind of are forced to stay, at an employer. I mean, because, they should just be thankful to have a job afterall.

       These same manufacturing jobs paid well over 20 bucks an hour before there were mass layoffs and downsizings. That was 10 years ago, plus benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
       People knowingly agreed? It doesn't work that way. You are forced to accept the deal you're agreeing to or you find another job. Even worse, as a skilled Craftsmen, once your salary hit certain levels, these companies would downsize and let them go. Who agreed on that?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about these right to work states or employment at will? It all comes down to pushing people to accept these deals at non-competitvely low salaries. Even fast food stores do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say these businesses formed a cabal, all you have to do is hit the help wanted ads at all these manufacturing jobs and how, for some strange reason their starting hourly rates are almost identical. They can't fill jobs and yet their salaries aren't rising enough to bring in employees.

       If the deal is that bad, don't accept it. Simple. No one ever forces you to accept any job.

        if no one accepted these manufacturing jobs, they would have to raise the price or have no workers. It's as easy as that.

       Hogwash. You think people are going to go homeless and watch their families starve while they refuse to go to work in the hope that will force higher wages? You think this is 1970's socialism with unions and collective bargaining or something!
      </p>
      <p>
       The modern workplace is not a free market, it is a corporate monopolized environment that controls staffing levels to hold a level of unemployment that ensures someone will always agree to accept that low pay.

       I wish I could find it again but there was an article that discussed the differences between slaves and the labor force in Ancient Egypt. There is an argument that the term slave does not necessarily fit into Ancient Egyptian culture, but rather it would be laborer or possibly serf.

       But basically, we are all born to serve the Pharoah, who in turn provides for us.

       Although the US is often compared to Rome and Greek life, in truth, we might be closer to Egypt in how the Overseers and Priests treat the workers. We are born to work and die for the Pharoah.

       Except in this current day the Pharoah doesn't even necessarily provide for us. There are large numbers of workers who are not paid enough to even rent a room in the high-cost cities where jobs are most abundant, and employers do not even provide dormitories as is common in China.

       if you have the patience, read debt by david graeber. its the history of money, or really debt. you'll see what we arrived on today is one of many economic systems to have existed, but totally unique in it's own way. there's an example of workers rioting in industrilized london when wages became only monies.
