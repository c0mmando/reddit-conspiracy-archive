<p>Notice this paragraph, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Assad deploys the chemical against the approximately 70,000 remaining opposition fighters in Idlib, President Trump has privately threatened to deploy a massive attack against him, people familiar with the exchange told the Journal.</p>

<p>Notice this paragraph, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. and France have warned an Idlib offensive would trigger a humanitarian crisis and warned that a chemical attack in Idlib would prompt a western retaliation.</p>

<h1>BUT</h1>

<p><strong>ONE DAY AGO</strong> - <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/syria-chemical-weapons-virginia-senator-richard-black-uk-mi6-assad-russia-a8529681.html">US senator claims Britain&#39;s MI6 is planning a fake chemical weapons attack on Syria</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fresh off a sitdown with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Virginia state senator Richard Black turned up on Arab TV last week making an extraordinary claim about one of the US’ closest allies.</p>

<p>Mr Black said Britain’s MI6 intelligence service was planning a chemical weapons attack on the Syrian people, which it would then blame on Mr Assad.</p>

<p>“Around four weeks ago, we knew that British intelligence was working towards a chemical attack in order to blame the Syrian government, to hold Syria responsible,” Mr Black said on Al Mayadeen, an Arab news channel based in Beirut.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let me get this straight</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Military operations ramp up in middle east</p>

<p>Syrian media totally wiped off the internet</p>

<p>Silenced from all forms of online media sharing</p>

<p>intelligence gathered about chemical attack, claimed to be false flag</p>

<p>chemical attack today allegedly by Syria</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is their silence from the internet staging to eliminate public communication, to get ready to stage something and provoke a new war in the middle east?</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/vfOWDnD.jpg">China has joined the ldlib offensive and begun military exercises</a> - Also took part in Russian Mediterranean drill </p>

<p>SOMETHING BIG IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN THE MIDDLE EAST</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SS: There are some serious red flags being thrown up right now and it all seems to be happening in a sequential order. Military operations have been ramping up. We were warned of ANOTHER false flag in syria a day ago from a man who spoke directly with Assad. Who also had intelligence of a staged chemical attach in ldlib. One day later, an alleged chemical attack is committed. Youtube and Google cease all syrian forms of social media before this all happens. China and Russian forces begin new military training. </p>

<p>This all smells like there is something big brewing!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so far, what seems to be the biggest theory behind this is the U.S is staging a reason to invade Syria to gain total control of the oil pipelines. Russia also has a pipeline there as well. if the U.S invades and gets control of Syria, they effectively gather total control of a HUGE portion of the oil market and could make even more money by having control of Russias too. it seems like this is going to be another war over oil and the chemical attacks are being used as reasons to invade. best theory as of yet</p>

<p>I really don’t want to believe that the US and/or its allies are using false flag chemical weapons attacks to justify a conventional military attack. But it is difficult to not to seriously suspect that they are doing exactly that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much does not make sense.  I just don&#39;t see Assad using gas in his people.  He knows the consequences.  He has a high approval rating and enjoys his stature.  Israel knows that the consensus between majority Muslims is to wipe them out, they really almost don&#39;t have a choice with the way things are going. I just look at how much humans lust for power and then its not so hard to infer that there are plenty of power struggles going on behind the scenes.  But the real top of the pyramid, in speculation, is just having a fun time playing the real life version of the sims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to leaked emails, you are right.  Israel expects Iran to have nukes in the coming future, Syria is allied with Iran so the nukes could be placed there right nextdoor to Israel.  That is the main reason behind the whole war on Syria, and of course rich people take advantage and prepare for a harvest (theft) of Syria resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure that Iran needs to put their nukes in Syria. The missiles can fly from Iran to Israel, I think.</p>

<p>I rather think that Israel looks for any chance to destabilize and/or control nations in the region. esp. immediate neighbors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a map to compare the difference <a href="http://atlantislsc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/map-syria-iran-download-syria-iran-map.jpg">http://atlantislsc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/map-syria-iran-download-syria-iran-map.jpg</a></p>

<p>So we can see there would be more chance to shoot down a missile flying from Iran than from the Syrian border, also there would be more warning time to get people into bunkers.  </p>

<p>Another point though, I remember in one of the leaked emails, it was discussed that if Iran had nukes, Israel would no longer feel as if they could perform conventional strikes on Syria and Lebanon as they do now.</p>

<p>I just looked up one of the leaked emails, here&#39;s an extract &quot;Iran&#39;s nuclear program and Syria&#39;s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. For Israeli leaders, the real threat from a nuclear-armed Iran is not the prospect of an insane Iranian leader launching an unprovoked Iranian nuclear attack on Israel that would lead to the annihilation of both countries. What Israeli military leaders really worry about -- but cannot talk about -- is losing their nuclear monopoly. An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today. If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself. Back to Syria. It is the strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel&#39;s security — not through a direct attack, which in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel has never occurred, but through its proxies in Lebanon, like Hezbollah, that are sustained, armed and trained by Iran via Syria. The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel&#39;s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests. Speaking on CNN&#39;s Amanpour show last week, Defense Minister Ehud Barak argued that &quot;the toppling down of Assad will be a major blow to the radical axis, major blow to Iran.... It&#39;s the only kind of outpost of the Iranian influence in the Arab world...and it will weaken dramatically both Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza.&quot; Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel&#39;s security, it would also ease Israel&#39;s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see it as free countries vs. an Empire. I do see the USA as the new Rome, and a new Dark Ages seems to have started, but it is global and not constrained to the west. The east doesn&#39;t deserve to be given a clean reputation, nor does the east fight for freedom. Both sides seem to only benefit the Central Authority. For more information on why I&#39;d think that, see: &quot;A World Effectively Controlled by the United Nations,&quot; written in 1961 and given to the US Defence Department in 1962 under Social Contract; written by Lincoln P. Bloomfield, who chaired the Political Science Dept. at I think Harvard, and who&#39;s son Bloomfield Jr. was part of the Bush Administration. Link is here, <a href="https://www.freedomfirstsociety.org/reference/a-world-effectively-controlled-by-the-united-nations/">https://www.freedomfirstsociety.org/reference/a-world-effectively-controlled-by-the-united-nations/</a>
I originally found the above document from the John Birch Society&#39;s website about 20 years ago, and it&#39;s the reason I began my blog, which admonishes and reports on the actions of tyranny worldwide. If you are inclined, see: joshua-ray.livejournal.com. My top post is called a sticky post, which means it was written a while ago, but I keep it on top, because it&#39;s a culmination of all of my ideas into one post. Thanks for reading!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fox News article did not &quot;confirm&quot; anything. It speaks about maybes and what ifs. The Ynetnews article is two sentences long, and refers to a US source&#39;s claims, which were alleged to the Wall Street Journal. As of yet, the Wall Street Journal has not written an article. I&#39;ve been waiting to see if this &quot;attack&quot; actually happened, but so far I feel what&#39;s being reported is mere &quot;yellow journalism&quot;. The Ynetnews article cannot be considered a &quot;report&quot;, as it claims. It supplies no details, and like I said, merely quotes a US intel agent. Why isn&#39;t there more news about this? It&#39;s a sham.  </p>
