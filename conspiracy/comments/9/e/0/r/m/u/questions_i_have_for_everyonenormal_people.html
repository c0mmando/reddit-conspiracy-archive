       When's the last time you relied on a public source for news/information? Oh? Most of all of your news and information comes from privately owned social media, websites and broadcasting stations? How do you know it's free of bias and uncensored? Private corporations dont have to honor the first amendment and might and can censor information we receive. Even select, public news like NPR can withhold information or publish a biased story, because public is in the name does not mean they dont have an agenda to push. Will there even be a Conspiracy subreddit in 10, 20 years? Can other countries freely browse conspiracy theories?..
      </p>
      <p>
       How unhappy do you feel if you're unable to buy something you want and are you happy when your needs are met? Do you think you need to upgrade something that is currently functioning as intended? Do you dream of luxury items or feel like you could have a bigger house or better things? Why does it seem that feeling discontent is tied in with our media outlets? Everyone is happy at their core, yet we continually are told otherwise. Silly, isnt it? Can you really live a wretched life with a warm bed and full belly, friends and family in tow and healthy? But why do so many of you seem to focus on the rich, and how toiling away, meeting your needs and living your life is so.. unfulfilling?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do so many people think like this? It's all connected, obviously media and advertising, but there is something more sinister at play. Almost as if a ghostly hand is lording over us, and not at a deep state or illuminati level either; it is fairly plain to see how we are being manipulated. It's right in front of us. This is why conspiracy theorists are sometimes labeled crazy, unstable or paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because there's no conspiracy. This isnt even getting into the medical field, this isnt getting into our education or prison system. There are people influencing my whole country to be unhappy when happiness is at every human's core.

       Yes as I get downvoted and before I delete this, there are conspiracies at play but do not let them be a distraction from what is so obviously happening right in front of us and so plain to see. Cheers.

       Ha, good point. Burying things does make them harder to find, yes?.. If someone really needs to find deleted files or text, more power to them. Would be a much greater concern for those with ill-intent, however, not a big deal for a post like this.

       Infowars and prison planet huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think something happened there. Around the time we had the massive swine flu outbreak back around 2010 I believe it coincided with President obamas trip to Mexico city which was ground zero for the outbreak. Prison Planet ran a lot of stories tracking the out break and degrees of mutation of the strains then all of a sudden it just dropped everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really want to know why they just walked away from what seemed like a huge story.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looked like they were on the path to proving the initial outbreak was man made before it mutated to a less lethal version.

       I was an npr listener and supporter for about 8-10 years as I felt it was an excellent source of news and information. This was about the time foxnews and CNN went all propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know Npr always had a liberal bias but during the last election they become full blown anti Trump pro Hillary. I was kind of surprised at how blatantly bias their reports and programs become and have not listened since.

       Isnt it great to delve into our ancestry? Wouldnt our greatest of grandfathers think we were a little bit spooky now?.. or awestruck at their sprawling lineages? Kinda weird to think we're just the combination of the combination of our parent's parents etc.. and yet it is all meaningless if we continue to pilfer away our planet for frivolous luxuries and other excess.

       I honestly don't know if this is sincere or ancient propaganda along the lines of, "blessed are the poor," and if you are poor now it is because  you were a bad human in your earlier reincarnations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because we are quite deliberately being driven into a politically powerless property and wealth free mass of very dissatisfied poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is that going to work out for the, there must be a profit from every human need, people at the top of the heap?  Everyone is going to be very poor, but being told to buy happiness when they are too poor to buy any.  Is it called social  unrest?
      </p>
      <p>
       And do they believe that this technology will purchase the necessary controls to achieve that without great violence?

       In America you can get any sort of treatment in the ER and be billed later. Other countries I am not so sure of, but yes, food and medicine are very important certainly - but that is an exception.

       That isn't true.  ERs only have to preserve life. 
What you are saying about the poor being allowed to receive treatment for anything but emergencies has not been true for years. 
Since the county hospitals were closed and replaced with for profit hospitals.  Some rural counties don't have a hospital.

       The hospital emergency rooms are only required by law to do that, intervene to prevent death, of course they can just stall around until death occurs and there are no consequences.

       I think pretty much 2/3rds of those articles are brainwash to just make you work harder for more money. The other article goes into education=healthier choices, less prominent addiction rates etc. Which is a valid point, but rich does not always=more educated.

       I think pretty much 2/3rdd of those articles mention, a lifetime of better than average nutrition and health care and lack of total despair.
       <br/>
       Stress is a real killer, and it is real stressful to not know where your next meal will come from, or having to work for an abusive boss, or never receive even minimum health care.

       But sure, let's go with the kumbaya, "happiness is all" delusion. That certainly doesn't mirror the life of a farm animal bread for slaughter at all.

       If we were bread to be slaughtered, we wouldn't know any different, we wouldn't even have basic language skills unless we received a formal education until whatever age humans would be, uh, edible at? So yes, it would be wretched, obviously, and obviously the meat industry plays a big part in resource destruction and heart disease.

       Happiness=contentment not happiness=hippies singing Kumbaya.  Another excellent example of how someone has forfeited their own emotion to a media stereotype of happiness, feel free to PM me if you need any guidance.

       Well if the people at the top aren't happy, they can start by reversing their parasitic bullshit system. Maybe it's archons or maybe they're just psychopaths. What point is there in an NWO? Satanic garbage.

       You can trust me when I tell you that fiber mixes with water in your gut to pull toxins out of your blood into your excrement. Ascorbic acid is very important for your immune system, as are the macronutrients for your energy and strength... you can freeze to death, humans need shelter; Sunlight is good, but not too much. If a pretty human is nice to you and advances on you, sexually, you can copulate and maybe even replicate yourself, imperfect but strangely even better..!which you get to feed and shelter until they make more replicants :)

       What more is there to know?Devastation? Terror? Unrest? Good things will find you in time, just like anything bad might.. :) be careful of distractions, good of you to not trust what is being broadcast anyway. Pointless information, pointless thoughts, pointless existence.

       To be honest, I go to Reddit. I am generally a liberal, so I have never been fond of Fox News. However, I don't believe CNN either. I work two jobs to support my family, so I'm not watching or listening to anything. I browse Reddit on my phone when I take breaks. I get the usual biased news from r/world, r/politics, etc, but then I feel like being subscribed to subs like r/conspiracy helps to keep it balanced.

       I couldn't agree more. I'm single and don't have people over very often.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have 2 of each silverware a couple plates and 4-5 glasses .
I go over to a friends house who is also single yet he has a set of 10 of everything...it's ridiculous.
Less is more to keep my life in order...

       Clutter and useless shit just take up space.
I'm in the process of saving up for a mid size RV. I've always wanted to visit all 50 states and am tired of the rat race.

       The first time I realized just how special our country is was camping in the Smoky Mountains. I spent 3 days on each side (TN-NC) and I had a religious experience.

       I highly recommend taking a trip by yourself. There is something about walking through the streams, hiking new trails and encountering bears, deer and other wildlife by yourself its invigorating and special.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing to take seriously if you are going to venture out by yourself is to bring along a GPS and let people know where you are going and when you expect to be back.
Make a waypoint for each mile traveled and send it off to a designated friend every so often so if you happen to have your scalp ripped off by a mother bear they know where to send help.

       When the majority of human lives in this world are consumed by simply trying satisfy their most basic needs and the pain and suffering of privation interferes with all the simple joys and pleasures they too should be able to have, while ours only come from being only slightly better off by working for a system that allows an elite of less than 10% of the population to own and hoard over 2/3rds of all the wealth and property there is on the planet and be the only ones who truly benefit from it, then I'd say that's basically the underlying reason for our general discontent, wouldn't you?
      </p>
      <p>
       We only work indirectly and peripherally to actually help one another in any real way while we focus all of our attention and efforts into working directly to help that 10% acquire even more wealth and property, which is another reason for our nagging discontent and general lack of satisfaction with even those simple joys we do manage to get out of life.

       I totally feel where you're coming from. Today I thought "if I could cruise on my skateboard for the rest of my life, I probably wouldn't mind". That's where I truly feel happy tbh. Status. Status is what makes people discontent. We're always seeing people with better things, seeing people steal from one another, everywhere. In the end everybody dies so, I'm just gonna do whatever till then haha.

       In the last 60 years technology has changed dramatically. The internet has completely changed the world. It has created a fast pace world and everyone seems to be playing the rat race. Trying to be rich and powerful.
But I don't want more money. That means more things, which means more problems, creating more stress. Stress is a killer and I don't want to spread myself to thin. 
The media is mostly a twisted transcript pushing a political agenda, some form or another. I trust my local news network but it is obvious the national news is at least said in a way that pushes a political view point. Social media is crap. I suggest staying away from that.  This website is obviously push a political view point too. But all in all you have to make the decision in what you believe and you can be on the fence about something. And Fuck what other people think. Say what you want to. Words don't matter but actions do. 
I mostly second guess everything. I trying to view things in different perspectives and try and see both arguments. If I feel confident about oneside of and argument I stick to that, but It's never cut and dry.
