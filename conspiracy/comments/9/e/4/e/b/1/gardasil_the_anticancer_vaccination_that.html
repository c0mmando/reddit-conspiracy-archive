       While  many doctors, citizens, patients and victims, have been trying to  inform the public for many years about the uselessness and the risks of  the HPV vaccine, a new offensive of the pharmaceutical lobbies and  politicians are trying to introduce laws to make vaccination compulsory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here  we have analysed the benefit-risk of this vaccine originally intended   for women, but boys are likely to be targeted as well and denounced  several times its uselessness coupled with its risks, both in women and  in men.
       <strong>
        The time spent since FDA’s  marketing authorization in June 2006 only adds new arguments against  this vaccination, the strongest of which is the increase in the number  of cervical cancers in the vaccinated population. This should encourage  these countries to follow the example  of Japan and Austria and to  delete the recommendation.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       «
       <em>
        There  are more than one hundred and twenty kinds of human papillomavirus  (HPV), and fifteen are considered to be at high risk because they can  cause cancers including HPV 16 and 18 causing 70% of  infections. »
       </em>
       <strong>
        This only demonstrates a statistical correlation between presence of HPV and cancer,
       </strong>
       <strong>
        without anyone being so far able to demonstrate a direct CAUSALITY link
       </strong>
       **.**
      </p>
      <p>
       «
       <em>
        There  are effective HPV vaccines. Current vaccines offer effective  vaccination against 70% of carcinogenic HPV, and a new vaccine will soon  increase this rate to 90%. »
       </em>
       <strong>
        But
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        what is meant by "efficacy"
       </strong>
       ?
       <strong>
        The  vaccine is effective on the infections of strains targeted by the   vaccine (only 4 to 9 of the nearly 200 listed strains) but
       </strong>
       <strong>
        there is no evidence that it can prevent invasive cancer let alone avoid death by this cancer
       </strong>
       **.**
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         «
        </em>
       </strong>
       <em>
        In Australia, where 80% of women and 75% of men are vaccinated, cases of HPV lesions have almost disappeared ».
       </em>
       <strong>
        This statement is outrageous, as the following presentation will show you, because in this highly vaccinated country
       </strong>
       <strong>
        the number of cervical cancers (and other cancers attributed to HPV) continue to increase.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       They  also deny the risk of serious side effects that have led to  protests  in many countries (Denmark, Ireland, Japan, Colombia) and legal  complaints from many  doctors.
      </p>
      <h1>
       A regular pap smear (every three years) better guarantees early detection of cervical cancer.
      </h1>
      <p>
       In  France, HPV infection is not a real public health problem in 2018,  neither for women nor for men. In women, since pap smear screening has  been used, the annual number of deaths from cervical cancer is  consistently less than 1000 in France, and the women who die are almost   exclusively those who have not been screened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Diagnosis  of HPV papillomavirus infection detected by systematic sampling should  be avoided! Positive results often lead to unnecessary  examination and  very early conisation (biopsy) which is often useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The &lt;1000 deaths per year from cervical cancer could all have been  prevented by screening
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Whilst efficacy of smear screening is proven, HPV vaccination not  been proven to prevent a single invasive cervical cancer.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The cancer registry records even suggest that this vaccine is sometimes likely to increase the risk.
      </p>
      <h1>
       INSTEAD OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CERVICAL CANCERS, IT CAN INCREASE IT
      </h1>
      <p>
       <strong>
        After  12 years of use and more than 200 million girls vaccinated worldwide  for a total bill of nearly $100 billion paid directly or  indirectly by  citizens , we can indeed draw a balance of effectiveness of vaccination  in two ways:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       1 °) By examining  the evolution of the incidence (annual frequency of new cases per  100,000 women) of the invasive cancer of the cervix in each country,  before and after vaccination, a method already validated in 2003.
      </p>
      <p>
       2  °) World Standardised Rates: gross Incidence reported as « Standard  World Population » to correct possible biases related to the demographic  characteristics of each country
      </p>
      <p>
       The  evolution of the incidence of cervical cancer before and after  vaccination with Gardasil can be traced in a perfectly reliable way in  the national cancer registries controlled and published by the  ministries of health of the concerned countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Australia
       </strong>
       ,  according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the  incidence  of cervical cancer declined by almost 50%, from 12(/100,000)  in 1995 to  7 in 2004 (before the vaccination campaign). Mortality also  improved, thanks to pap smear screening and treatment. However, since  the vaccination campaign started in 2007,
       <strong>
        there   has been no further decrease in either incidence or mortality. In  2017, the incidence of cervical cancer is estimated at 7.1 and cervical  cancer mortality has increased by almost 15% from 1.7 in 2014 to 2 in   2017
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The Australian Ministry of  Health estimates the number of new cases of cervical cancer is 912 in  2017 and 930 in 2018. Claiming that « cases of HPV lesions have almost  disappeared » in Australia is therefore not correct.  One cannot imagine  that these MPs lie  voluntarily, so we can conclude that they are  poorly informed and that they should have checked themselves the  information provided by the  experts related to laboratories before  distributing this « fake news ».
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Great Britain
       </strong>
       ,  according to Cancer Research  UK, the Office of National Statistics  (ONS), the incidence of cervical  cancer had decreased (thanks to pap  smear screening) from 12.4 in 1995 to 9.27 in 2004. But
       <strong>
        since  vaccination, there is no evidence of improvement, nor on the incidence  stagnating from 9.3 in  2006 to 9.6 in 2015 nor on the mortality  remaining at 3
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Canada
       </strong>
       .  According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the incidence of cervical  cancer has decreased (through  screening) from 18 in 1972 to 8.1 in  2008. But
       <strong>
        since vaccination, there has been no further progress on incidence stagnating at 8.3 in 2017
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        United States
       </strong>
       ,  according to the National Cancer Institute’s SEER cancer statistics  review, the incidence of cervical cancer reduced from 14.8 in 1975 to  6.66 in 2007. But
       <strong>
        since vaccination, there has been no decrease in the incidence of cervical cancer reached 6.68 in 2015
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Norway
       </strong>
       ,  according to the Cancer Registry of  Norway, Oslo: before vaccination,  the standardized incidence had fallen sharply thanks to smear screening  from 24 in 1965 to 7 in 2004. But
       <strong>
        since the vaccination, it has gone up to 13.9 in 2014 and 14.9 in 2015.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Sweden
       </strong>
       ,  according to the National Kvalitetsregister for Cervix Cancer  prevention (NKCx ): before the vaccination campaign, the incidence of  cervical cancer had decreased (thanks to screening) from 18 in 1967 to 7  in 2006.
       <strong>
        The  worldwide standardized  incidence of cervical cancer has increased significantly since  vaccination rising to 10.3 in 2012 and 11.5 in 2015.  This increase is  almost exclusively due to the increase in the  incidence of invasive  cancer among women aged 23 to 49, which has reached more than 50% since  2006 (11 in 2006 versus 17 in 2015), whereas it is those who have the  highest vaccination coverage rate (85%).
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus,  in countries whose populations have access to pap smear screening, it  has led to a considerable reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer  (from 40 to 60%). In contrast, the introduction of vaccination has not  reduced the incidence or mortality of cervical cancer. Contrary to what  is promised by laboratory-related physicians and by many global health  authorities, vaccination campaigns have even been followed by an  increase in the incidence of cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        France
       </strong>
       ,  with low levels of HPV vaccination,  can serve as a control country.  According to Public Health France, the  incidence of cervical cancer in  mainland France has steadily decreased from 15 in 1995 to 7.5 in 2007,  6.7 in 2012 and 6 in 2017. This decrease in incidence was accompanied by  a decrease in mortality from 5 in 1980 to 1.8 in 2012 and 1.7 in 2017.
       <strong>
        France,  with low use of Gardasil, has a much more satisfactory evolution for  both incidence and mortality than that of the countries cited as  examples for those who want to impose compulsory vaccination.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Comparison of recent standardized incidences with vaccination coverage rates.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Immunization  advocates claim that a high vaccination coverage rate reduces the risk  of invasive cancer of the cervix. Yet the comparison of incidence and  mortality rates with vaccine coverage rates shows the opposite:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Australia
       </strong>
       , HPV vaccination coverage exceeds 85% , but in 2017 the incidence of cervical cancer is 7 and the mortality is 2
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Great Britain
       </strong>
       , despite vaccination coverage exceeding 80%, the incidence in 2015 was 9.6 and mortality 3
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Sweden
       </strong>
       the vaccination coverage rate is close to 75% but the incidence 2015 reaches 11.5.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        USA
       </strong>
       , in 2017 the vaccination coverage rate is 60% for a cervical cancer incidence of 6.8 and a specific mortality at 2.3.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        France
       </strong>
       , in 2017, HPV vaccination coverage is  very low (around 15% ) for a  cervical cancer incidence of 6 and a specific mortality of 1.7
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        In  countries with high immunization coverage, the incidence of invasive  cancers and mortality are therefore higher than in France.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The harmful side-effects are difficult to deny
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Japan,  Austria and Denmark have stopped promoting this vaccination after  serious complications, sometimes even fatal and that families suffering  from these vaccines  organized public demonstrations in several  countries of the world  (Japan, Colombia, Ireland).  Danish doctors  lodged a complaint against the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which  refused to answer their questions, after the notification of severe  neurological events not listed in the EMA registers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In France, several lawsuits are in progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       « Among  the most frequently mentioned by the victims defended by M  pathologies  e Coubris include multiple sclerosis, lupus, disseminated  acute  encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system) and  myofasciitis macrophages (a disease that results in pain muscle and   chronic fatigue) ». A parliamentary commission of inquiry which could   hear experts, citizens and independent associations of laboratories,  having, from near or far, no link of interest with laboratories, would   be a first step to enlighten Parliament.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        IN CONCLUSION, the benefit-risk balance is not in favor of vaccination, let alone compulsory.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       A  compulsory health measure should not be based on faith in vaccination  or hidden conflicts of interest, but on proven facts, verifiable by  every citizen. However,
       <strong>
        the facts  established by the official records of cancer registries show that HPV  vaccination does not  protect against invasive cancer of the cervix but  seems rather to  maintain its frequency at a high level, and sometimes  even increase it.

       <p>
        A  team of researchers says it has found a direct scientific link between  smoking and lung cancer, a discovery that adds yet another piece to the  already substantial evidence that tobacco smoking is a cause of cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The  findings, published today in the journal Science, report the first   evidence from the cell biology level linking smoking to lung cancer. The  scientists say a chemical found in cigarette smoke has been found to  cause genetic damage in lung cells that is identical to the damage  observed in many malignant tumors of the lung.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         While  many scientists have long been convinced by statistical studies and  animal experiments that tobacco causes cancer, a statistical association  was not in itself absolute proof.
        </strong>
        This shortfall has allowed defenders  of smoking to deny that cigarettes cause cancer, and scientists have not  known the exact mechanism of causation that would put the matter beyond  doubt.
       </p>
       <p>
        ''
        <strong>
         This paper absolutely pinpoints that mutations in lung cancer are  caused by a carcinogen in cigarette smoke,
        </strong>
        '' said Dr. John Minna, a  researcher at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. ''It  is the smoking gun that makes the connection.''

       Smoking damages cells in your body which increases the rise of cancer developing from those damaged cells. But if your body is in tune and you have a strong immune system then your body will build back healthy cells. I have a strong belief if you a health person you will have to smoke a lot or have another variable in the environment you live in the create cancer.

       I'm not describing a correlation, I'm describing a molecular mechanism. Cancer is derived from the accumulation of a variety of mutations in the human genome, which faces challenges from a number of factors every day. Retroviruses are one among many challenges to the integrity of the human genome. This is an extremely well characterized fact.

       Duesberg has a conflict of interest. He embraces his aneuploidy cancer hypothesis beyond all reason and defends it against the mountain of evidence that indicates that oncogenic mutations are the major driver of cancer. To admit that retroviruses could be a major cause of cancer is to admit the role of oncogenes in cancer pathology, and Duesberg is one known to never admit to being wrong.

       I'm not saying that there is a specific type of cancer that is dependent on a virus, I'm saying that virus' are one among many contributing factors to any kind of cancer. I have no idea what point you're trying to make. Half of your sentences are completely incomprehensible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me break down the etiology of cancer to you slowly:
      </p>
      <p>
       There are (at least) six traits cancer must acquire in order to become cancer:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         They must be capable of self-propagation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They must resist signals that halt their growth.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They must resist signals that tell the cell to destroy itself.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They must be able to replicate endlessly.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They must develop a blood supply.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They must be capable of spreading in to other tissues.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Each one of these six processes are controlled by a large number of genes - the number of which increases on a daily basis. In order for cancer to occur, several genes within each category must be mutated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some might be mutated by exposure to UV light, or others might be mutated by cigarette smoke. Odds are, 99.99% of mutations caused by these carcinogens wind up somewhere of no consequence - but once in a while, you'll get one that hits an important gene.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same can be said for retroviruses. The truth is, our genome is already completely packed with viral DNA that has randomly integrated into it over an evolutionary timescale - about 8%, in fact!  8% gets passed on because those of viral DNA sequences did not get incorporated into any essential genes. Now, where the virus chooses to integrate itself is entirely random - just like mutations by other carcinogens. Sometimes, rarely, the virus will integrate in to one of the genes responsible for the six processes I listed above; in those instances, the virus is contributing to the development of cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, depending on the virus and its natural tendencies, it may be more or less likely than UV, or other carcinogens, to cause cancer. Research suggests that HPV is a particularly insidious retrovirus; but even if it weren't, we use sunscreen, we avoid smoking - why not vaccinate against another carcinogen?

       I've never changed my argument at all. I simply went more specific. All viruses mess with cell growth; they hijack cellular machinery to self-replicate, and sometimes they even kill the cell! But that has nothing to do with how a virus causes cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Viruses cause cancer through genomic integration.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the purposes of cancer, retroviruses and carcinogens operate on a very similar scale: They are both risk factors for cancer. I am not saying that they have a negligible impact on cancer - I am saying they have an impact that can be compared to UV exposure or smoking. That is not negligible in the least.

       Actually, after reviewing the literature, it looks like I was wrong: It's not just the simple act of genome integration, it's that the E6 and E7 protein in certain types of HPV function as proto-oncogenes by activating cell division and preventing the cell from killing itself. Genomic integration of the E6 and E7 proteins thus incorporate a cancer risk factor, regardless of where it integrates.

       Whenever you get run over by a vehicle that is not a truck, you can exclude a truck as the culprit.

       Gardasil is only indicated for women up to 26 years old. Widespread use was only initiated in 2006. Average age of cervical cancer incidence is 47. 12 years is too short a time to determine its efficacy. You'll need at least another 10 years to determine whether it truly was effective in lowering the rates of cervical cancer.

       I mean, average age of diagnosis for cervical cancer is 48 in the USA. ATM, the age range for women getting the HPV vaccine is 11-12 with catch-up vaccines available up to 26. It's rarely indicated for those above the age of 26. I don't think changes in cervical cancer rate should be noticeable for at least a few more years, with a peak in 2 decades. Beyond the issue of regurgitating data for times when cervical cancer rates aren't expected to change yet, these ignore the context of the individual healthcare systems of each country.

       Even for laymen, I don't think it's hard to imagine why a virus that can induce abnormal skin growths can also induce tumors. Everyone that takes high school science classes knows correlation =/= causation, but this is a pretty damn strong correlation and dismissing it entirely is nuts. Correlational data with theoretical causative mechanisms is the same reason why we removed lead from paint and fuel. Correlational data with theoretical causative mechanisms is the same reason why we just dopamine and DBS for Parkinson's disease.

       I mean, most of the people that got vaccinated were school age. So over a decade and combined with safe sex ed, they are certainly contributing to a decrease in HPV infections. This is expected because average age for STI's is teens-thirties. But cervical cancer as a result of HPV takes way longer to develop. I wouldn't expect the HPV vaccine to have significantly changed cervical cancer rates in Australia yet, and it didn't. You're going to have to consider other factors like poverty, healthcare access, generational changes in sexual activity, etc. Check back on cervical cancer rates in 10 years, and compare between people that did get the vaccine vs those that didn't.
