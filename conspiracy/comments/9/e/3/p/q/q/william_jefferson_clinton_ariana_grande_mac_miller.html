        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was thinking about this equation last night whilst discussing this bizarre sequence of events with someone else.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the connection here?</p>

<p>Approx a week ago the weird stuff happened at Franklin&#39;s send off, featuring AG as the centerpiece, including the Bishop and of course, Bill Clinton. </p>

<p>Then just a few short days later, a troubled young man and ex boyfriend/supporter of AG that was already known to be battling serious addictions is found dead from an apparent OD. </p>

<p>I&#39;m personally not versed on his music but after reviewing some of his work and his website, it seemed clear he knew he wasn&#39;t going to stick around long. Was this because of said drug use or because he made deals with extremely dangerous people to get where he was going?</p>

<p>I have no idea if it&#39;s connected in anyway, but the timing is super suspect. It&#39;s too easy to discard or possibly in this case, &quot;suicide&quot; someone when they have a known history of drug abuse. </p>

<p>My personal opinion is most all of these young people coming up in mainstream hip hop and pop scenes sell out or make &quot;deals with the devil&quot; to become unofficial spokespeople of the illuminati. Part of the job is to be a conduit that connects or brainwashes the next generation of young consumers using symbolism and hidden messages that are sympathetic to their cause. For this in return, they get on the fast track to unfold amounts or influnce, money and power. </p>

<p>Problem is that they&#39;re kids when they are recruited and most are either too naive to understand the deals in their entirety; they just want to be famous and have tons of Twitter followers. </p>

<p>By the time they figure out the depths of the shitstorm they are in, it&#39;s already far too late. That would also explain a lot of the drug addiction because faced with the realities of their life and the consequences of the deal the made, they don&#39;t want to feel anything and essentially become dead inside. If they happened to be redpilled along the way and don&#39;t want to play ball anymore then it&#39;s time to go and to borrow a line from JayZ, (which I also believe made a deal a long time ago), &quot;it&#39;s onto the next one&quot;. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great points. I think most people think of &quot;sacrifices&quot; in this context as something that happens on some shadowy alter, surrounded by cloaked men. </p>

<p>But in actuality, it can be anywhere, at anytime and not directly connected to a ritual - and someone still has to go, but it&#39;s more of a sacrifice in a sense that they have to lose someone they may or may not care about. </p>

<p>Thinking about it more since you brought it up, Kanye and his mom&#39;s routine surgery comes to mind. That was his sacrifice and it was designed to further isolate him from those that truely loved him. He agreed and then when he realized the cost, he pushed back, possibly lost himself and his mind in the process and that&#39;s when we saw his rather public meltdown on stage in Sacramento. </p>

Mac dying has no correlation with the public buying her record if anything Mac is gonna sell more albums which makes you think maybe he just pulled the same stunt as Tupac</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typing Ariana Grande into my search bar, the first suggestion is &quot;bishop&quot;. Now people will be talking about Mac Miller instead. Not saying anything is there but it is an idea. </p>

<p>A fair amount of shit surrounds Ariana Grande and her fiancé Pete Davidson. She was on Dan Schneider shows, her concert that got bombed, she fashions herself to look like a younger child, his dad died in one of the towers on 9/11 and he has emotional problems from that. He has admitted to ripping his hair out til he was bald and trying to drown himself. He has a Hillary Clinton tattoo. Then you have Clinton checking her out at the funeral and that bishop low-key groping her. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest issue I have with the &quot;Illuminati makes deal with _______&quot; theories is why would the illuminati take that big of a risk when they already run Hollywood? Why not raise multiple children and train them to be performers then send them out without having to worry they might leak the deal. Mac Miller was 26, had access to lots of money and lots of drugs, and was probably depressed or had some other mental illness. Rapping about death/depression/addiction is popular right now and the only thing that separates this from any other &quot;young rapper OD&#39;s&quot; is a very tenuous link to the Clinton&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, also great points. Which I believe would fit the sacrifice narrative - Meaning that after the sacrifice was made, get the media and others to propagate or amplify the message and then spring board off that for max exposure of their asset. More exposure for the asset, the further the message goes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly. i think it screams of sacrifice. not to mention, sept 7 is the day he died and that happens to be the the satanic holiday of the “feast/marriage of the beast” which people are often sacrificed during the ritual. (basically “a beautiful young woman is trained and presents herself to satan”) miller’s last two instagram posts were very crytpic, one he has his hands on his face showing only one eye next to his cross tattoo on his finger that’s upside down, and the other one he is sitting on top of a leather goat/ram decoration. the photos were taken for his last interview and i don’t think it’s just all coincidence.  there’s also plenty of gemantria related to his death as well that i wont even go into </p>
