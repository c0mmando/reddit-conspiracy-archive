<p>I dont think people talking in theoretical terms about how bad nazis are lead to concentration camps. This is silly alex jones-esque paranoia. I mean I know theres no sense in telling you this, your mind is made up on the impending civil war (lol) but hopefully someone with their logical faculties still intact will read it and recognize just how silly this theory is. Its not at all reflective of the real world. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why miscegenation is a problem and why people shouldn&#39;t mix.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is a problem. It means less White people #1, which I don&#39;t agree with and it leads to a host of family and life problems. It leaves people without identities, it leads to them not being accepted by multiple groups and it leads to not people having any idea about who they are.</p>

<p>I for one, love being around people of other cultures or ethnicities. You can learn a lot from people with different life experiences. </p>

<p>Since you said people are different in every way that you can think of. Shouldn’t you be separating from other white people who hold different views or cultures than you? </p>

<p>So you think that people of Irish culture should be separate from people of Italian culture? Since people are so different and different people shouldn’t intermingle, we should only be in a group of the people we are most similar with.</p>

<p>This pasta-potato Ameri-mutt, the chans might call me, is <em>triggered</em>! </p>

<p>But really you&#39;re pretty much right here - The only issue I see is that you really need both the US/Canada-style &quot;all welcome&quot; stuff <em>and</em> more ethnically-oriented countries to some extent. Can&#39;t get and maintain the former without the latter, after all. That doesn&#39;t that mean we need a (Trudeau&#39;s Canada)<sup>2</sup> and a Fourth Reich to balance each other of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish we saw more of this mentality being voiced on reddit. Unfortunately people on reddit, or at least the vocal majority, seem to think that squashing the other side is the correct course of action when you differ from someone politically.</p>

<p>I think one of the biggest failures of reddit this past election was how the platform was used as a medium to share the news being published by companies who provide a voice only to the most extreme left/right instead of using reddit as a place to have actual open discourse where the moderate left/right can hear eachother out.</p>

<p>There&#39;s good and bad on both sides, and simply no excuse to ever be all left or all right. The only responsible thing to do, in my opinion of course, is to attempt to support the things you agree with while fighting the things you don&#39;t, regardless of who is in office. That may seem like a completely obvious point, but many people seem to have stated very clearly that they want nothing to do with politics if their side loses, so it&#39;s a point that needs to be made unfortunately lol.</p>

<p>Hush child, you don&#39;t need to defend yourself. If you feel attacked by that even though you personally know you&#39;re not one of them, maybe rethink why you feel so defensive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right now in Ontario we have a new leader that is enacting policies that make literally no sense at all. When shot down by judges, he has enacted a clause that let&#39;s him do whatever he wants. The policy is senseless, and he&#39;s pushing his way through no matter what, effectively giving himself full rule no matter what. </p>

<p>His followers love it. They follow him blindly. There is no logic or reason to what they&#39;re doing other than following their leader and doing anything to &quot;fuck the libs&quot;. </p>

<p>We saw this same bullshit with Trump. We saw this same strange defensiveness. When they were called out for being dumb, they felt defensive and shifted even more. The damage these people are doing is madness, and when faced with facts, reasoning, or actual studies, they ignore it and hide in their headspace they created with their group. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, nah. I&#39;ve got to the point where I&#39;m angry. I&#39;m not going to sugarcoat my words just to be careful of some snowflakes. So in your case with your eloquence and willingness to speak I do apologize for treating you as I would a genuine Trump or Doug Ford supporter. </p>

<p>But for everyone else? Honestly fuck em. I&#39;m done. I&#39;ve seen this ridiculous brainwashing and blind following go on so much that I have no respect for these idiots. I don&#39;t understand how people can be such fucking sheep. </p>

<p>I&#39;m attacked endlessly by people in online communities for not being pro Bernier. I&#39;m also not pro Trudeau (though more pro him than any other choice). If people shit on me one way or the other I don&#39;t feel defensive and shift. I research the facts if any are presented. And if not, if they&#39;re just talking shit, I honestly don&#39;t care. I&#39;ll just fight either side. </p>

<p>People shifting politically because their views are called dumb is just dumb. Just think about why you&#39;re being called dumb. It&#39;s OK to be wrong. Its OK to admit you&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s OK to admit your leader is dumb as fuck. It&#39;s OK to admit your dumb as fuck leader has done some good things. </p>

<p>Crying because you don&#39;t like what someone said about you and then blaming their behavior for a shift in politics? Boy you gotta love the possible outcomes of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your response and I was really hoping this was where&#39;d we get to because you&#39;ve said some things that I think hold a lot of merit whether or not I agree with them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m admittedly not very familiar with Canadian politics on a provincial level. I&#39;m familiar with your governments actions in a more broad sense, but I&#39;ll have to pass on commenting on what&#39;s going on in Ontario at this time since I&#39;m just not familiar enough to have any type of fair opinion.</p>

<p>I agree with you on the topic of blindly following someone because it is, regardless of who&#39;s being followed, a very bad thing. We&#39;ve seen throughout history where it leads, and more often than not it does not end well.</p>

<p>Now the topic of sugarcoating your words I feel a bit differently on. I do agree that you shouldn&#39;t have to stifle your opinions to make someone else comfortable, however expressing your opinions in a way that makes others feel attacked often has negative repurcussions. You may be able to handle those attacks well and look at other opinions based on their merits and look further in to someone else&#39;s opinion, but I&#39;m going to assume that you&#39;ve also seen many more cases where this isn&#39;t the case. I don&#39;t think people make a conscious decision to shift further to a side when attacked by someone with an opposing point of view, but when you are forced to defend yourself against someone who may very well be making good points, but is choosing to voice themself in such an offensive and off-putting manner, many people end up blocking out the other person and feeling strengthened in their own beliefs. This then makes them more susceptible to believing more extreme ideas from the extremes on their own side since those extremists are going to be friendly towards them when the opposition failed to do so.</p>

<p>This is simply how people react and I don&#39;t blame them for it. It&#39;s exactly the reason I chose to respond to you how I did. I could have gotten offended and chosen to attack back and it would have just left both of us pissed off. The other option was to remain calm and recognize that you weren&#39;t attacking me out of anger with me, it was just out of anger. I chose the latter and now we&#39;re fortunate enough to have a conversation in a manner that allows an exchange of opinions and understanding that was not there before.</p>

<p>Everyone is responsible for their actions, I think you and I both agree with that, but that does not mean that we get to voice our opinions in a negative fashion and then shirk all responsibility for the negative response someone has to them.</p>

<p>Case in point, Trumps recent tweets regarding the economy. It&#39;s a great thing that our GDP is up tremendously while unemployment is down, there no denying that. Unfortunately he chose to voice this by making false statements regarding this being the first time it has happened in 100 years, and also that stupid wand comment. Sure, he doesn&#39;t <em>have</em> to sugarcoat his words, but now he&#39;s getting a ton of negative feedback and that falls solely on him for the way he chose to voice those statements.</p>

<p>Do you realize how much a tool that phase makes people look like? You could state solid fact but by putting that in your sentence it makes you look like an idiot.</p>

<p>Did it occur to you that people can be &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; but still not like the people that have been appointed leader? Or even not like the ways the current leadership are running things even though &quot;their&quot; party is in office?</p>

Every time I pop into the most downtown McD’s I hear groups of young black kids talking about how sick they’re getting from popping pills. I used to brush it off thinking it was opioids. I listened carefully a few times and it’s all gear. Being sold on the streets the same way you’d pick up some Roxy. I’m pretty sure they don’t even lift, they are just expecting results.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, just like all of those &quot;legal&quot; drugs, it makes things worse than they are. Like, if you want test, just take test. It&#39;s pure, and the only drug in there. But with these pills (because shots seem too &quot;hard&quot; even though they are worlds safer), test can&#39;t go through the liver, so they need to do all these crazy things to make it pass through, or work through doing it through other means. </p>

<p>There is a constant cat and mouse game going on with this market and these &quot;legal&quot; versions are always a nightmare. It&#39;s the bath-salts of the steroid world. I had some friends from highschool, all took them and got huge man-tits. They didn&#39;t even need them. They were already jacked off of teenage juice. </p>

<p>Luckily these things called SARMS are getting popular again, mainly because they are by and large side-effect free but used to be mainly used as an additive. But now dumbfuck teenagers found out about them and how they are easy to order online and are taking them expecting they&#39;ll just get buff. So now that they are popular every sketchy Chinese scammer is pumping out dangerous strange mixes just to sell, so now regulators are going to clamp down on that... I&#39;m sure just making matters worse because those sketchy Chinese suppliers don&#39;t just go away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s an argument to be made, and it is made often, that despite being privately owned organizations, social media has become sort of a town hall on a grand scale.  The ability for a single entity to shape thought and manufacture opinions is insane right now and I&#39;m not sure that the typical protections of private business should be applied anymore.  </p>

<p>This has been a problem for a while obviously since a handful of companies were allowed to buy out almost all television media outlets, but its worse now because now we have the echo chambers being built under the guise of organic, balanced conversation when in fact they&#39;re anything but.</p>

<p>I would argue HEAVILY in favor of federal protections for free speech on social media monopolies.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you might want to look up the definition of monopoly because they are almost certainly a monopoly.   They are a monopoly in the same sense that comcast is a monopoly.  There&#39;s literally 3 sites that control the flow of social media: reddit, twitter and facebook.  Twitter has control over celebrity social media without a doubt, anybody can see that.  It&#39;s a more natural monopoly than say comcast, but a monopoly none-the-less.</p>

<p>Im not sure why you think it being free disqualifies it from being a monopoly, because it doesnt?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>how is demanding a social media monopoly treat censorship fairly the same as forcing a television channel to air content you want?  That analogy makes zero sense.</p>

<p>If you want a television analogy, it would be like requiring a television station to report news impartially.  </p>

<p>lmao at your cherry picking, you&#39;re clearly just trying to push some agenda here but I&#39;ll bit.  Here&#39;s an exert from Merriam Webster:</p>

<p>&quot;exclusive possession or control
no country has a monopoly on morality or truth —Helen M. Lynd&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monopoly">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monopoly</a></p>

<p>is &quot;truth&quot; a &quot;service&quot; as you defined &quot;service&quot;?  Seems like you and Merriam Webster have different interpretations.</p>

<p>You realize words can be used in one or more ways, right?  Have you ever heard the phrase &quot;monopoly of thought&quot; or &quot;monopoly of information&quot; or similar?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Celebrity&#39;s saying stupid shit in 280 characters isn&#39;t a commodity or service in any way, shape, or form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As discussed earlier, you&#39;re using the word incorrectly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook don&#39;t have control over anything literally thousands of other sites don&#39;t have as well. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you not understand that they have LITERAL control over the flow of the VAST MAJORITY of social media content?  &quot;thousands of other sites&quot; don&#39;t control anywhere near the same amount of content as the big 3.  That&#39;s like saying comcast isn&#39;t a monopoly because Fort Worth Communication also provides internet connectivity to the greater fort worth area. lol.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Requiring news stations to report news &quot;impartially&quot; is also stupid. That&#39;s how you end up with flat-earthers debating the validity of space exploration and research against NASA employees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s obviously a spectrum of interpretation to this vague, made-up scenario i mentioned (which i only mentioned out of necessity since your analogy was so off base)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s people who think like you think the Internet popped into existence in 2008 or something. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m 35 and have literally been on the internet for 25 years, chief. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are other websites out there. They are not blocked or banned. You can use them. You can also easily create your own website.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You clearly don&#39;t understand what makes monopolies monopolies.  Let&#39;s use comcast again; <strong>anybody</strong> can create an isp if they want to, right?  There&#39;s literally hundreds of them all over the US.  You can move there and use them if you want.   You can create your own ISP if you want.  Therefore monopolies in telecom don&#39;t exist, right?  Almost any economist out there would disagree with you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one is entitled to a larger audience or a bigger platform. People getting banned from sites and forums has literally gone on since the days of BBS in the 90s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure where i lost you, but i clearly insinuated that private companies ban/censor people all the time.  My statement was that companies that have vast, natural monopolies over things like social media that influence millions of people and how they vote/think/behave shouldn&#39;t be able to silence only certain segments of the population.  It&#39;s really not that complicated of an idea.</p>

I&#39;m not being paid and I&#39;m not representing anyone other than myself. </p>

<p>Again, you want to redefine monopoly and compare having a large number of users to something like an ISP maintaining control over the infrastructure for a region/state/city, which I don&#39;t know if you know this or not, is an actual service you pay for where there literally isn&#39;t an alternative. Like I said before, you can go to myspace, one of the chans, or some other site if you want at any time, and nothing stops you from using those sites. So if you aren&#39;t being forced to use it, alternatives exist that you can easily access, it&#39;s not a necessity, and there isn&#39;t any kind of anti-competitive behavior going on that prevent other websites from growing... then you don&#39;t really have a case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why wouldn&#39;t you argue for their right to speak? It doesn&#39;t mean you have to like it. What&#39;s important is the bigger picture, which is we live in a society which protects the right to speech, no matter what. It&#39;s a safeguard to prevent guardians of speech determining what&#39;s okay and what&#39;s not. Look at South America... They all start censoring speech on moral grounds like yours, then once that lever is created, they slowly inch over banning more and more speech until pretty much any speech the ruling regime doesn&#39;t like is banned.</p>

<p>how is that the same as the &quot;imagine seeing that roll out of bed...&quot;? how is it racially based? I know it&#39;s a very old thing to say already, but it looks to me that you are projecting</p>

<p>You know exactly what I’m talking about. My example could be seen all over that sub. Discussions about how black people are objectively ugly, comparisons to monkeys, orcs (that was you).. etc</p>

<p>It’s not just about one time. One time, idgaf. It was a constant there and other subs by people like you. Do not think that I’m drawing these conclusions because of your comment here. It’s been a long time observing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t fell the need for anything, we are just talking. My point is that there is nothing racist in comparing Serena Williams with a uruk-hai: bot are muscular, have the same hair and both have angry face. The fact that both have dark skin has little to do with it. I wouldn&#39;t compare, let&#39;s say, Wilson Kipsang with an ork.</p>

<p>I only think it’s more likely this because Serena hate has been pretty widespread across reddit. T_D had also been pretty flagrant with Serena abuse and they haven’t been banned. </p>

She was getting coached illegally, then threw a tantrum about it, and finally slammed her racket on the ground breaking it.</p>

<p>Tennis like golf only has a small handful of marketable players, quick WITHOUT google, name me a male Tennis Player other Feder or Nadal!!! I imagine you came up with nothing. Tennis will bend over backwards for Feder and Nadal because you need that rivalry. Those guys get away with everything. Now Serena is equally successful but she doesn’t bring in the same revenue as Feder or Nadal so she gets treated like a normal player.</p>

<p>She chose the complete wrong time to try and make a point. He outburst hurt the moment for Osaka </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the videos are being pushed by conservatives, who i really doubt are that invested in womens tennis.  ive asked many people who follow tennis from across the political spectrum, trump supporters to green party and they are all on williams side.</p>

<p>its just the most ardent trump supporters and those that dont follow tennis who have been critical of her.</p>

<p>look at this video of john mcenroes behavior </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xea1KKEgOco">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xea1KKEgOco</a></p>

<p>he was know for his temper, and was fined and punished just as williams, but the difference was...the public didnt give a fuck.  there were no scathing editorials of his behavior written in the 80s.  he was praised.  he had a following because of his anger.</p>

<p>the people pushing these videos dont like williams because shes black, a woman, outspoken advocate of womens rights, and most recently featured in that nike ad.</p>

<p>it makes sense that mods of subs would be deleting majority of all these fucking videos, with the comment sections filled with racist/sexist nonsense.  its obvious their is a concerted effort to push a narrative to flood social media with videos and content condemning williams...not because of her behavior on the court, but to push a larger political agenda.</p>

I was alive in the 80&#39;s and remember there being many stories centered on his shitty antics.  There was as much focus on his behaviour on and off the court as there was on his ability as a player, if not more.</p>

<p>Here is a relatively recent article from Tennis Space covering his antics:
<a href="http://thetennisspace.com/2012/09/top-10-worst-moments-for-john-mcenroe/">http://thetennisspace.com/2012/09/top-10-worst-moments-for-john-mcenroe/</a> </p>

<p>You could easily say that there is more media coverage about William&#39;s antics than McEnroe had at the time but that would largely be due to the lack of internet exposure.  Media has changed.</p>

<p>Serena is the only woman mentioned in the list of ten.  In general, men who offended the tennis world&#39;s sensibilities tend to act like brats and call officials names while William&#39;s has the largest fine for directly threatening a linesman.  That&#39;s your poster-child?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol &#39;she&#39; didnt actively cheat, her coach made hand gestures and theres no evidence that she saw them.  while she is responsible for the actions of her coach, its entirely possible she was completely unaware of anything he was doing.</p>

<p>the rule the ref called her on is seldom enforced, and the severity of the penalty for calling him a thief wasnt warranted.</p>

<p>she was speaking of her own character that she wouldnt cheat because she was a mother and that would set a bad example for her child, she didnt say it was sexist to punish her because she has a child.</p>

<p>she played the sexism card, because professional tennis is sexist, she was criticized for having a child, she felt she was punished for having a child, her rank lowered for having a child.  officials considered her pregnancy an injury and would not allow her to keep her rank.  she herself rallied against sexism in the sport and got female players salaries increased.  the fact that when a man has made similar infractions in the past they received less severe punishments...thats what she was referring to.</p>

<p>so yeah dipshit, sexism.</p>

<p>im not even talking about her punishment or the fact that she lost her cool, im talking about williams treatment in the press and on social media.  when a male tennis player has an outburst and punished, they are not eviscerated and shunned in the media like whats happening with williams.</p>

<p>just because youre a racist/sexist nitwit, doesnt mean i am a far-left nazi or over-sensitive nitwit or even a social justice warrior.</p>

<p>all it means is i outed you for what you are, and you dont like that very much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Whataboutism&quot; is a poor argument technique. </p>

<p>Did you watch any of the US Open last week? How about the Final match? She lost 6-2, 6-4 to a younger, less experienced player from Japan. For someone as experienced and valued in the world of women&#39;s tennis, Serena had the opportunity to face the loss (which was not a close loss, mind you) with grace and courtesy towards her opponent. Instead, she donned her diva attitude and flipped shit. </p>

<p>My mom is a religious follower of both men&#39;s and women&#39;s tennis, and she always fills me in on the drama: according to her, Serena had gotten too big for her britches, and the tennis world agrees. We watched the final together. Serena absolutely deserves every ounce of criticism coming her way, and don&#39;t think this is the first time the tennis world has shaken their collective head at her behavior. </p>

<p>Real classy, such a good sport. /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, no, I don’t know if you notice, but her opponent was POC as well. </p>

<p>The reason they are bothered by Serena’s outburst, is because she is a liberal media darling who you can never say anything negative about.  Sponsored by Nike, who parades this whole, we do what’s right campaign everywhere right now. She immediately pulled the gender card, along with 99% of the media. When you actually go in to all tennis forums and actual talk to people who play and ump tennis, there is an overwhelming response that the judge did the right thing. Or at the very least, Serena is a spoiled brat. </p>

<p>It’s another example of the media painting the guy who’s doing the right thing as the villain, and the person who did the wrong thing as the victim. </p>

<p>What are you talking about? 14 year old redditors make 9/11 jokes to be edgy <em>constantly</em>.  I have heard countless 9/11 jokes on Reddit and elsewhere.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes and no...</p>

<p>Since regular users, including the shadowbanned user themselves, can&#39;t see the posts, it literally is up to chance that the shadowbanned user would comment in a subreddit with mods who are active enough to notice.</p>

<p>When looking through threads, particularly larger threads, we can &quot;see&quot; that some comments are removed. Usually it&#39;s because they are new accounts, but sometimes clicking on the user name will take you to &quot;page not found.&quot;  <em>That&#39;s</em> when you know there&#39;s a shadowban at play.</p>

<p>There seem to be slightly less shadowbanned users than in the past, but for every post on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that hits #1 and gets at least a few hundred comments, you can count on finding at least one shadowbanned user.</p>

<p>So yeah, it&#39;s trickier than you might think to find out...as someone mentioned one way is to see if your comments are there when you log out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole controversy is blown way out of proportion. As far as I&#39;m concerned the umpire did not make any illegal calls and Serena didn&#39;t know when to stop talking. People trying to defend Serena are basing it on emotion, and likely wrapped up in those sportcenter debates where there are always two sides. She is supposedly the greatest women tennis player ever, but that championship DNA wasn&#39;t present that day.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not. Some subs delete duplicates. Some people submit things without knowing the rules and posts get removed. Plus YouTube has taken down videos for copyright violations, which woulds result in some subs removing posts that now link to a removed video. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I believe it has more to do with the selective rule enforcement and the belief by some that a man acting as she did would not have been treated as she was, or portrayed as she was. I believe there are also some who think she would not have been treated that way were she a white woman. That I&#39;ve seen, none of the claims of discrimination have anything to do with the race or gender of her opponent. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Things like <a href="https://twitter.com/jbillinson/status/1038573594727645184">this</a>, I believe is what people are referring to. Where the same publication portrays a woman as having the &quot;mother of all meltdowns&quot; and a man as simply &quot;arguing a strike&quot;, when both are making a scene by pointing and verbally fighting with an ump over a call. The example is, of course, cherry-picked. This type of behavior from professional athletes in baseball isn&#39;t really uncommon, and people often either feel the man arguing  was cheated, or was acting like a giant baby, typically depending on what team they were routing for. A lot of people who really like Serena feel she is often treated unfairly in the sport, so they will be more defensive of her in situations like this just like baseball fans will get defensive of a player or coach from their team who was &quot;cheated&quot; by an umpire. </p>

<p>Different umps will make different calls. Cheating is a risk she took. She handled herself poorly, embarrassed herself and the internet is talking about it. She acted entirely priveledged. </p>

<p>The large majority of people are saying she handled it poorly, not worrying she was improperly treated cuz they see it for what it was. Crying on top of it is not a good look for a professional woman. I say this as woman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason for the third violation and loss of a game was because she already receive two code violations during the match. Her coach admitted he in fact was coaching her which justifies the first violation. She later on broke her raquette, which was a second violation and is regularly enforced and players get fined for doing so. She continually berated the chair umpire since the first violation, questioning his integrity and I think he rightly so had enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha wow that&#39;s pathetic. Almost as pathetic as her attitude after losing her game the other day.  And it&#39;s very disturbing people out there are supporting her. It seems these days you can just scream &quot;sexist&quot; or &quot;racist&quot; and you will have an instant group of blind supporters. How can someone <em>who saw the actual footage</em> think she is a role model for any one else? Including her own daughter? I love that she got fined. It might be pocket change for her, but it serves an important purpose. </p>

<p>Anyways. Congrats to Osaka; the legitimate winner. No one should ever have to apologize for being a better player or being a better sport. What a disgusting, backwards time we are living in.</p>

<p>lmao at your cherry picking, you&#39;re clearly just trying to push some agenda here but I&#39;ll bit.  Here&#39;s an exert from Merriam Webster:</p>

<p>&quot;exclusive possession or control
no country has a monopoly on morality or truth —Helen M. Lynd&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monopoly">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monopoly</a></p>

<p>is &quot;truth&quot; a &quot;service&quot; as you defined &quot;service&quot;?  Seems like you and Merriam Webster have different interpretations.</p>

<p>You realize words can be used in one or more ways, right?  Have you ever heard the phrase &quot;monopoly of thought&quot; or &quot;monopoly of information&quot; or similar?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Celebrity&#39;s saying stupid shit in 280 characters isn&#39;t a commodity or service in any way, shape, or form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As discussed earlier, you&#39;re using the word incorrectly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook don&#39;t have control over anything literally thousands of other sites don&#39;t have as well. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you not understand that they have LITERAL control over the flow of the VAST MAJORITY of social media content?  &quot;thousands of other sites&quot; don&#39;t control anywhere near the same amount of content as the big 3.  That&#39;s like saying comcast isn&#39;t a monopoly because Fort Worth Communication also provides internet connectivity to the greater fort worth area. lol.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Requiring news stations to report news &quot;impartially&quot; is also stupid. That&#39;s how you end up with flat-earthers debating the validity of space exploration and research against NASA employees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s obviously a spectrum of interpretation to this vague, made-up scenario i mentioned (which i only mentioned out of necessity since your analogy was so off base)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s people who think like you think the Internet popped into existence in 2008 or something. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 35 and have literally been on the internet for 25 years, chief. </p>

<p>There are other websites out there. They are not blocked or banned. You can use them. You can also easily create your own website.</p>

<p>You clearly don&#39;t understand what makes monopolies monopolies.  Let&#39;s use comcast again; <strong>anybody</strong> can create an isp if they want to, right?  There&#39;s literally hundreds of them all over the US.  You can move there and use them if you want.   You can create your own ISP if you want.  Therefore monopolies in telecom don&#39;t exist, right?  Almost any economist out there would disagree with you.</p>

<p>No one is entitled to a larger audience or a bigger platform. People getting banned from sites and forums has literally gone on since the days of BBS in the 90s.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure where i lost you, but i clearly insinuated that private companies ban/censor people all the time.  My statement was that companies that have vast, natural monopolies over things like social media that influence millions of people and how they vote/think/behave shouldn&#39;t be able to silence only certain segments of the population.  It&#39;s really not that complicated of an idea.</p>
