       In regard to your edit, the first google result for clonaid states that the raelien church believes cloning to be the first step toward humans achieving immortality. So i presume that is their intent

       So you have nothing to say about the information he provided in the interview? He said there are multiple companies cloning humans, and that they can transplant memories to the clones.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claims Gucci Mane was cloned when he was in prison, and that Michael Jackson was the first celebrity to be cloned. All of this links up with the weird memo on ClonAids front page saying they don't disclose who their clients are but Michael Jackson was really interested in Cloning. The memo also says most of their clients are from hollywood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you think that's weird?

       Im still new on the conspiracy train and didnt want to inject my opinion - just wanted to try to add on a little in regard to your edit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, since you ask - yeah it does it does sound weird. I can definitely see human cloning experiments happening behind the scenes despite its (i believe) illegality. However, a rapper no one has ever heard of with the majin buu symbol tattooed onto his forehead doesnt exactly seem like the most reliable source for information.

       Did you read the wiki on Clonaid? They literally had a room rented in an unused school filled with state of the art equipment. So, maybe not your backyard, but certainly within the confines of a private home.

       Oh I do recall that. I still doubt they regularly clone humans, but I’m skeptical about clones (considering most don’t survive very long)

       Considering the fact that scientists affiliated with Clonaid have asserted human cloning is easier than cloning non-human species? (Citations are numerous in the wiki, so I dont feel the need to relink what you can easily google)

       I think Clonaid is just some sort of money making scheme because theoretically it is just as easy to clone a human as it is to clone any other animal plus the fact there is not much proof that the people they claimed to have cloned are actually clones (in regards to the babies)

       There are loopholes. For instance, some countries allow the birthing of clones, wherein the donor/clone births themselves, or uses a surrogate to carry their clone fruition.

       I remember hearing about the Raelians and cloning in the early 2000s. From the little I recall, Dolly sparked their interest and set the path for their methods. Been a long time since I heard anything about them though.

       Well they have a pretty shitty website that's for sure. But this seems a bit off, and the interview in my opinion is pure PR. The process they describe on their website isn't "cloning" in the sense that most of us might think. You would need a womb, your own or a surrogate and the process takes nine months, then the child would grow up in a normal way. So when was Kid Buu cloned? He just seems drugged - maybe MKULTRA stuff? I don't know.

       Brings forth new questions regarding Micheal Jackson's kids... could one be a clone? If I'm not mistaken, "Prince" Jackson was born in 1997, and Paris Jackson was born in 1998. Blanket was born in 2002. Clonaid went public in 1997. Hmm...

       So basically if you jump on Wikipedia you can see that
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Vorilhon">
        Claude Vorilhon
       </a>
       was suspected of plagiarizing the works of earlier "ancient astronaut" type authors and although he was never charged I noticed that he actually won defamation cases against people who said he was dangerous or selling drugs and stuff to prop up his religion meaning that a judge at some point or another did agree he was not a dangerous man or procuring money through illegal means. I'm just trying to point at that although his ideas aren't to my taste at some point in history an educated person considered him legitimate enough to atleast award him damages from journalists saying he was a bit culty/gangstery.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOW BOI... Whats weird is the investments they've received. Initially a singular couple payed for the outfitting of a lab where they could develop and work on cloning technology, now I'm just guessing here buut THAT WOULD'VE BEEN VERY EXPENSIVE. It was said the couple donated after hearing about the project because they couldn't conceive for one reason or another, meaning they were rich enough to just donate what I'm guessing could be $100,000's to 1,000,000's of dollars of scientific equipment just in the HOPE they might be able to one day receive the benefit of this technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also find it incredibly interesting an arch bishop of the church of Rael (who did have a PHD in bio chemistry) was put in charge of the project. It was hard to tell from the way what I read was worded but I think she may have had two PHDs in relevant fields of science, however I just found it weird her previous job was head of marketing or something at a pharmaceutical company. Granted it would make sense for a qualified dr to make advertisements for medicine however I do feel it strange to switch from head of marketing to head of clone research as funded by the church of Rael, whom in turn can only do this because of the aforementioned donor.
       <br/>
       SOOO there were inconsistencies in things I read compared to Kid Buu's statements like I really dont think they've been operating as long as Kid Buu says. Then again
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ra%C3%ABlian_Membership_Estimates.png">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ra%C3%ABlian_Membership_Estimates.png
       </a>
       even independent estimates put the church of Raels numbers at 20k in 87. Considering the rate at which the religion grew as well as the fact there seem to be some very wealthy supporters of the religion considering one couple donated an entire lab AND THEN the donations apparently kept coming from there they could've formed clonaid before it was brought into the light of the public, at the very least for the company to actually form they would've had to have been talking about it for a fair while beforehand and given the politics around cloning at the time I could understand the apprehension of going public about a cloning facility or even researching it.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       So in conclusion I guess what I'm saying is although Claude V was suspected of plagiarizing materiel he was also deemed credible enough to be awarded defamation charges by a court of law when journalists said he was a cult leader who procured money illegally by dealing drugs, delving into selling porn and other "dirty" things of the time.
       <br/>
       Some very rich people must support; at the very least clonaid and possibly the church behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before clonaid was formed very educated people (apparently duel phd holders) were willing to be apart of the church to the point of being an archbishop (idk something like that its 6am and I haven't slept) so somehow highly educated people can see something worthwhile in this church.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also inconsistencies in what Kid B says although nothing that says DEFINITE LIAR or anything (from my point of view anyway)
       <br/>
       IDE ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT that Kid Buu seems to think very deeply about things, what said this to me was his unwillingness to glorify the violence of his past he also seems to have his own "slight of hand" remarks AKA he is quite content saying things with dual meanings and not explaining them.
      </p>
      <p>
       NONE OF THIS MEANS I BELIEVE KID BUU IS CLONE FROM CANADA CREATED BY A COMPANY WHICH WAS INTURN FOUNDED BY THE CHURCH OF RAEL. I just like thinking bout stuff and exploring possibilities.
