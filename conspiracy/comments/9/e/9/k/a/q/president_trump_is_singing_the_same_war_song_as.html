    <div class="md"><p>Im critical of both, in fact of the whole establishment system, but I think Trump is the lesser of the two evils by an order of magnitude. Im not a &#39;fanboy&#39; of him by any means but hes definitely not a warmonger in my opinion. Many things said on r/theDonald truly disgust me and Ive spoken up against their (often racist) bullshit just like I would call out a good leftist. But it just so happens that it was a good deal more people on the right were for instance doubting those previous chemical attacks, and generally questioning the narrative. Tucker Carlson has been slamming it recently.</p>

<p>This definitely possible. But I can&#39;t fathom Assad and his administration as being any kind of threat to the people of the US. Plus, we are there illegally according to international law, and to our own domestic processes, where congress determines who we go to war with. So, in your case, why doesn&#39;t President Trump go through the process the right way via congress. Even with that, we&#39;d still be considered an illegal occupation in Syria by international law. Assad was voted in democratically, just as Trump was. </p>
