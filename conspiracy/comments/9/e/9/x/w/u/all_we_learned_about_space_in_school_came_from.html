Who on earth would be stupid enough to believe something that goes against everything we’ve been taught since childhood. Then I came to a place of setting aside what I had been taught to believe and simply began questioning everything.</p>

<p>One thing led to another and soon I had seen enough evidence to change my beliefs.</p>

<p>1) There is a cooperative effort to misinform the general public.
2) The moon landing was such a ridiculous lie. The more you look into the facts, the more ridiculous it becomes.
3) The speed of the SpaceX rocket continued to climb well beyond the speed of a bullet on camera. Really?
4) The orbiting Tesla Roadster that was not specially modified to handle space didn’t freeze, melt, tired didn’t explode due to pressure, etc.
5) Any organization with that big of a budget can say and do virtually anything they want</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rocket is quite larger and much further away. A commercial plane travels 575 mph. When one flies overhead  way in the sky you can see it flying past for quite some time.  Now if you are sitting by a highway and a car passed by you at 575 mph you would barely see it for a few seconds. </p>

<p>A bullet is tiny. Tiny enough its hard to focus on. So say someone shoots a gun. The area they are shooting in is generally not very large. The space is so small that if you blinked the bullet has already reached its destination. Now shoot the bullet into the air. It keeps traveling above you so blinking wont make you miss it but the bullet being so tiny your eyes cant see it. So what if we made it bigger? You would still only see a blur in the original space but since it travels so far into the  air you would be able to make out what the bullet is the further it travels depending on its size. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re going down the general flat-earth rabbit holes, it&#39;s less about what&#39;s to gain and more about keeping certain knowledge hidden.</p>

<p>Theoretically, if the Earth was flat, it would mean many things we &quot;understand&quot; are half-true at best. How we understand gravity and orbits, what our &quot;solar system&quot; actually is, how it works, what it&#39;s doing, etc. - all of that changes with a flat-earth model, regardless of which one you choose (concave, convex, dual-world, snow-globe, etc.).</p>

<p>More importantly, it very strongly infers (or even requires) purposeful intelligent creation.</p>

<p>Depending on which branch you travel down, you&#39;ll get into things like aliens, ancients, demigods, Nordics, Agharta, etc., which all have twists on our fundamental roles here.</p>

<p>If those things were true, keeping that knowledge hidden would also hide knowledge about ourselves, our history, our purpose, our abilities, etc., maybe even how to directly manipulate some of the forces in play here.</p>

<p>If you have to word it as what somebody is potentially gaining from a &quot;lie&quot; like this, the answer would be cliché - power. But that does a poor job summarizing the situation in this context.</p>

<p>Interesting ideas to explore regardless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re completely misunderstanding my point about the horizon.  </p>

<p>Yes, the horizon appears flat, even at high altitude. That makes perfect sense on a globe. The horizon starts where your line of sight stops (think tangent cone to a ball). This will be roughly the same distance in all directions once you get high enough that local terrain variations no longer matter. The horizon forms a perfectly flat circle around you at all times. If you cut through the Earth in the plane of the horizon, you get a spherical cap. As your altitude increases, this spherical cap gets larger in radius quickly because your tangent cone to the horizon reaches farther due to the curvature of the Earth. In the limiting case where your altitude is large compared to the radius of the Earth, your &quot;horizon&quot; forms a geodesic circle around the Earth and the spherical cap is an entire hemisphere of the Earth.  </p>

<p>The next time you take off in a plane, don&#39;t look for the horizon to bend. That is completely missing the point. Watch the horizon <strong>grow</strong> from 10-15 miles to 150-200 miles. The increasing area bounded by the circular horizon is a <strong>direct</strong> observation of the curvature of the Earth. If you don&#39;t grasp why that is the case, then you are completely misunderstanding basic geometry.  </p>

<p>You won&#39;t see the horizon bend like the pictures from space because the size of your horizon is very small relative to the diameter of the Earth. Well, actually, you do see that all the time but you are not grasping the perspective. When you see the curvature of the horizon in the sense that you are thinking about, we are always looking down <em>towards</em> the Earth. If you do that even from an airplane, yes the horizon is extremely curved, so much that it wraps all the way around you as a circle. The only difference in space is that the horizon is still easily within your peripheral vision when you look down at the ground below, so you see large arcs of the circular horizon all at once. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately the dangers of censorship outweigh the dangers of looking like idiots. </p>

<p>So what if we &quot;look like idiots&quot; anyone looking for truth isn&#39;t going to get very far if you are concerned with the opinions of a programmed society. Most people still believe 9/11 and believe any conspiracy about it to be idiotic. There are a million instances of this theme. </p>

<p>We have to risk being idiotic because in the many instances we are not being idiotic it&#39;s incredibly important.</p>

<p>So imo let them psyop us with flat earth disinfo it only forces us to get better at research. Turning on fellow truth seekers who might not be &quot;the same power level&quot; as yourself and then seeking censorship from authority is exactly the response they want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with censorship of any kind. But, part of the reason why people think 9/11 conspiracy theories are idiotic is due to a subconscious conditioning that conspiracy theories are all the same kind of illogical rambling nonsense.

<p>But most importantly, again, you have no way of seeing this or verifying it. Just because they did a scene about it in Mythbusters (which is goofy and badly acted) doesn’t mean there are really lasers being bounced off reflectors that were put on the moon by astronauts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, I’ve already told you, in an article which has now been removed from Google search results, in a 1966 edition of National Geographic magazine (vol.130 number 6, December 1966), titled “The Laser’s Bright Magic” the author Thomas Meloy documents how the distance to the moon had been measured as early as 1963 by reflecting lasers off its surface which no reflectors. </p>

<p>Also, as I already said, if you believe in moon missions then you believe in rovers, and that’s all you would need to leave a mirror on the moon. </p>

<p>So never mind the fact that you’re not going to prove you even went to college let alone that you even did anything close to this “experiment,” it’s not even a worthwhile argument anyway. Trust me, I talk to a lot of NASA shills. They don’t even use it anymore for the reasons above. </p>

<p>Seeing the curve from that altitude depends on your FOV. Though, the funniest thing about the fish eye claim is that flatties will, ironically, use footage from a fisheye lens in order to make a curved horizon appear flat. Not like it matters considering that we can still see the curve of the Earth from that type of footage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first of all when you think of something freezing it usually will have a layer of frost- no water in vacuum so the car could be below freezing without any visible signs, also the build up of heat without a radiation method is dangerous, it&#39;s not an instantaneous thing. I imagine that the wheels were modified so they wouldn&#39;t explode. You&#39;ve got hundreds of engineers that could have caught it. That was a publicity stunt, so of course they&#39;ll want it to not explode the second it met vacuum. And yeah the rocket sped up to orbital speeds, what&#39;s so hard to believe there?

    <div class="md"><p>As an open minded conspirator I&#39;ve always given things a chance and questioned everything. I always do the research myself and make my own opinions on things regardless of how ridiculous things sounded (like Flat Earth). I&#39;ve thoroughly looked into it, I&#39;ve seen all the major documentaries and done extensive research into it over the last few months. The FE community is so dead set in believing it that I thought maybe there was something to it. Nothing so far has convinced me that the Earth is flat. In fact most of the arguments FOR flat earth make me disbelieve it even more since they all are disprovable and show a general lack of understanding of the basics. </p>

<p>I think one of the major problems with flat earth believers is that they have a hard time understanding just how absolutely gigantic the earth is. Just knowing this alone debunks every &quot;no-curvature&quot; claim. GPS systems alone which actually work and save the lives of stranded people every single day work flawlessly and that&#39;s because of the satellites above us that orbit our globe. </p>

<p>Does NASA and the government lie to us? Absolutely, the same way every other business and corporation in the entire world does. Do they lie about the shape of the earth? I reaaalllly don&#39;t believe they do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately the dangers of censorship outweigh the dangers of looking like idiots. </p>

<p>So what if we &quot;look like idiots&quot; anyone looking for truth isn&#39;t going to get very far if you are concerned with the opinions of a programmed society. Most people still believe 9/11 and believe any conspiracy about it to be idiotic. There are a million instances of this theme. </p>

<p>We have to risk being idiotic because in the many instances we are not being idiotic it&#39;s incredibly important.</p>

<p>So imo let them psyop us with flat earth disinfo it only forces us to get better at research. Turning on fellow truth seekers who might not be &quot;the same power level&quot; as yourself and then seeking censorship from authority is exactly the response they want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, I’ve already told you, in an article which has now been removed from Google search results, in a 1966 edition of National Geographic magazine (vol.130 number 6, December 1966), titled “The Laser’s Bright Magic” the author Thomas Meloy documents how the distance to the moon had been measured as early as 1963 by reflecting lasers off its surface which no reflectors. </p>

<p>Also, as I already said, if you believe in moon missions then you believe in rovers, and that’s all you would need to leave a mirror on the moon. </p>

<p>So never mind the fact that you’re not going to prove you even went to college let alone that you even did anything close to this “experiment,” it’s not even a worthwhile argument anyway. Trust me, I talk to a lot of NASA shills. They don’t even use it anymore for the reasons above. </p>
