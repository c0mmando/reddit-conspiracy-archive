       So I find it incredible that they just don’t learn their lesson. These senile billionaires who finance these groups to combat information with misinformation literally do not grasp the concept of how non-genuine it comes across.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example with the ShareBlue and 2016 Election, it was so painstakingly obvious. It’s why Clinton lost, because Trump was a way of saying fuck you to them, for better or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to bring it back to a micro level on this sub, I have followed this sub with various accounts since 2014. This sub used to have conspiracies, real legit conspiracies from all walks of life. People come to this sub to discover hidden truths and discuss with each other about these conspiracies/truths. People come to this sub for this reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       ..So when the entire comment section is flooded with people saying “wrong.”   “Nope this isn’t true nothing to see here.”  “Not a conspiracy your fellow government would never lie to you.”
      </p>
      <p>
       It is ridiculous. Why do they pay? In today’s age with technology everyone discusses everything via social media and it is what it is. What is the point of paying for shills and what not to argue and take over subs like this?

       The other problem is that they've been pushing their narratives for long enough now in the media and on social media that they don't need to pay 'shills' to preserve their gravy train any more, there are plenty of useful idiots doing it for them for free.

       Close. They turn loose the apprentices in this sub and journeyman shills will journey off mostly into larger subs. This place has up to 3 or 4 thousand people at any one time, and maybe a hundred thousand over a 24 hour period, so it's well worth the effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, this is the place where some inconvenient truths start and get hashed out, and from here they spread to larger subs. For efficiency's sake, they try to downplay and misdirect people at the source first so they lose the motivation to go off into larger subs, because if you are attacked so much here, you can expect that it'll be much worse in larger subs. If they can send you off into a more enticing wild goose chance that leads to nowhere, and you end up trying to spread their disinfo in larger subs, that's even better.
      </p>

       Reddit is a shill's playground.

       I don’t even like Alex jones but the fact one of the most we’ll known conspiracy theorist in the world cannot even be mentioned on a sub called conspiracy without being forcefully downvoted (loaded with predictably upvoted comments) is remarkable. It’s a bizarre form of suppression, and who ever is coordinating the suppression, seems to un-ironically believe they can convince casual occasional visitors that this sub is actually filled anti-conspiracy, left leaning, Wikileaks hating, establishment supporting, Russian-fearing independents

       Individuals knowing the truth isn't much of a threat to them. They're afraid of consensus. It only takes a small percentage of the population adopting a determined belief before the "tipping point" kicks in and the belief spreads across the whole population. There are terms for this, like the 100th monkey effect, meme magic, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why you notice all of the shills are dicks. Even if they can't convince us that information being presented is incorrect by insults (a logical fallacy), if they can convince us that this sub is nothing but a bunch of dicks that constantly attack anyone who posts good information, they have maintained the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why it's important, when faced with shills and brigades, that we expose and refute the use of
       <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">
        propaganda techniques
       </a>
       . Responding to a shills' dickishness in kind doesn't help us, but asking the shill why they are being a dick or using straw men, or refusing to acknowledge evidence that is presented helps people to realize that the problem here is propagandists, not the actual community.
      </p>
      <p>
       And once people realize the problem is propagandists, they can unite around opposing the use of their propaganda methods (i.e. consensus). That's what you've been seeing around here for over a year now, consensus forming around the knowledge that shilling is occurring and determination to continue to do what we do no matter how hard they shill.

       This is on point in my experience. Often short, snarky, “dickish” comments which aren’t even clever are upvoted — artificially I assume — which is to provide both a feeling of hopelessness to the authentic truth-seeker and the appearance of a group of distasteful and quarrelsome children for Redditing passers-by.

       No. It sounds like you're trying to misdirect from the proven fact that shills are flooding this subreddit, break up the consensus that has formed against this flood, and gaslight everyone in the vain hope that we will somehow un-know what we all know if you just lie hard enough.

       Makes it easier to sort out what’s solid and what’s a distraction. If you haven’t noticed, nothing makes it to the front page unless it’s at least half-disinformation, political doldrums, complete garbage reposts, or boring and innocuous pablum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only the nonsense or half-nonsense is allowed to achieve prominence. In this way, the aim of this subreddit is not to cultivate a place of critical discussion, but to curate a paddock of “conspiratards” or else very dull fluff posts, for other Redditors to reference or stop and observe as they would fish in an aquarium.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of the occasional interesting and hard-hitting posts that appear in /new, you must be aware of so-called
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/90s3qu/shill_spotting_101_the_myth_of_the_reddit_user/">
        “Reddit users”
       </a>
       who appear as though assigned to certain topics, always to dismiss the idea of any trickery or fakery, and always to defend official narratives and government agencies like NASA.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s really not that hard to check a user’s post history and get a good picture of whether it actually makes sense for them to even be in whatever obscure thread they are in vehemently deflecting blame from culpable governments and organizations, upholding the mainstream status quo as if they have nothing better to do.

       Why hire an army of shills when useful idiots are free?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you'll notice there's a lot of people bashing this sub and calling content in it paid shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something I think paid shills would do. Create distrust in the sub and it's community. Then call real people who say "dickish" things shills while completely unable to self reflect.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a joke. All a joke. But even if the shill has 1% belief in shill words then defeating them is just awesome.
