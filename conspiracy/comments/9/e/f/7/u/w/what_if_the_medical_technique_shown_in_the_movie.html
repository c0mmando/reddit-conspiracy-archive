        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ever since I saw the movie this idea has been on my mind. If you’re not familiar, the climactic scene in the movie revolves around a doctor doing a surgical procedure to transplant the brain of one man into another.</p>

<p>In the film, we learn that a group of wealthy elites have figured out a way to achieve immortality in a sense, by transplanting the brain of a dying person into the body of a young, healthy person. The consciousness of the transplanted brain comes along with it, and takes control of the new body, thus allowing the person to be “reborn” inside of a new body.</p>

<p>The film makes a big point of the fact that the original consciousness of the person who’s body is taken over is not totally lost, but is instead persevered in the brain stem where the original person can still observe the world around them but has no control of the body. This is called the “sunken place” and the wife of the doctor character has the ability to hypnotize people and put them into this trance state or sunken place. </p>

<p>The whole “sunken place” idea reminds me a lot of MK Ultra stuff and mind control. The way she is able to hypnotize the main character with certain questions and the rhythmic tapping of her spoon on her tea cup. Then the scene where he is strapped to the chair and forced to watch the videos on the tv was very reminiscent of the scene in “a clockwork orange” where Alex is forcibly rehabilitated. There is also a pretty pointed reference by one of the side characters to “eyes wide shut”, another movie that people think gives a glimpse into the secret lifestyles of the elite. </p>

<p>The brain transplant thing got me to thinking about Egypt. Remember how we were taught that during the mummification process, the Egyptians would carefully remove each of the organs and store them in separate sealed jars. Except the brain. For the brain they just stuck a long metal hook up the nostril and scrambled it and pulled it out though the nose to be discarded because they believed that it wasn’t important. </p>

<p>Now this never really sat right with me. The head is obviously a really important part of our bodies. With the eyes, mouth, ears, and nose, the Egyptians surely understood that the head was the “control center” of the human being. So why would the organ inside the head be considered worthless? It doesn’t add up. </p>

<p>So what if the whole scramble the brain thing is a lie? And what they were really doing was transplanting the brains of the dying pharaohs into the bodies of willing acolytes who believed they were becoming gods?  That somehow before modern medicine and modern surgery, they figured out a way to do this procedure and thus grant immortality to the pharaoh? </p>

<p>This leads to the idea that there are “immortal” beings that have lived on in different bodies for thousands of years, possibly playing the roles of multiple different people throughout history. And that members of this secret society that protect the secret, when they are close to death, are given new life in a young body, and that they are able to control the world because politicians  and businessmen will do anything or pay any price for a chance to join the group and be given a chance at eternal life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn’t it crazy how this is being normalized right before our eyes? It’s going from “that’s crazy conspiracy nonsense” to “well of course injecting yourself with young blood will make you live longer. Why wouldn’t the rich do it?” </p>

<p>Notice how people defend it by saying “drinking the blood or bathing in it won’t give you any medical benefit” but the rich elite of centuries past didn’t know this. I personally believe all folk tales about vampires and monsters who snatch children from their beds are deeply rooted in elites taking children from poor people for sex or blood sacrifice. It’s not far fetched to think people a few hundred years ago would drink the blood and think its giving them unnatural long life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some two years ago I read where Italian medical doctors were ready to do full head transplant&#39;s. Apparently they can make successful transplants onto young bodies, but are having problems with the spinal cord connection. In the article I read, this transplant program was relocating to China. Also within the same time frame I had read where babies without brains could be brought to full term. Does anyone have more recent news on either subject?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you and had those exact same ideas. I believe the physical procedure was more metaphorical than anything else. But wtf do I know?</p>

<p>What I found interesting is that I watched the movie with my partner who was physically abused at a young age. She explained that the &quot;sunken place&quot;/hypnosis state they showed in the movie is extremely similar to how she felt while the abuse was happening.</p>

<p>If you can connect that with some musical artists claiming to have multiple personalities, MK ULTRA which is basically abusing someone to give them multiple personalities (I know there were many different methods but essentially that&#39;s what it can be broken down to) , and what you see in Get Out you just have to ask some hard questions. This is all connected and possibly Get Out was the Peele&#39;s way of saying this is what&#39;s going to happen to me whether I like it or not. </p>
