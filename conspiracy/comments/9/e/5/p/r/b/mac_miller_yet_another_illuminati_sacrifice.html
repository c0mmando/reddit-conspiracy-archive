        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In Mac Miller’s last music video, for the song “Self Care,” he was in a coffin (direct Kill Bill 2 reference.)</p>

<p>He carved into the coffin “memento mori,” which literally translates to “remember that you must die.”</p>

<p>In 2pac’s last music video, “I Ain’t Mad,” he gets shot to death.</p>

<p>In XXXTentacion’s last music video, he’s at HIS OWN funeral... and he’s talking to a “demon” in the video.</p>

<p>Biggie’s last album is titled “Life After Death” and the cover is of him standing next to a hearse.</p>

<p>Do you believe in coincidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prodigy also knew he would die shortly before his death. He was battling with Sickle Cell, though reports say he died choking on an egg. </p>

<p>Anyhow, his last album shows signs he knew it was coming. The song &quot;The Good Fight&quot; for instance </p>

<p>&quot;And I&#39;m fighting the good fight. Rather die swinging, everybody dies. And life too quick, I got a lot of things to do but I ain&#39;t done yet&quot;. </p>

<p>Macs last  album was also basically a surprise. It didn&#39;t get promoted or anything a year before like most albums do.  It just dropped after a month. Seems like he may have been pushing it out as a goodbye of sorts. </p>

<p>You’re on “conspiracy” subreddit and you’re getting OFFENDED that we’re talking about conspiracy stuff. It’s legitimately fucking retarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.</p>

<p>I provide facts and in return I’m get strawmanned.</p>

<p>And then the strawman gets upvoted while I get downvoted.</p>

<p>Foreshadowing and predictive programming is REAL, and it’s ALL OVER MUSIC VIDEOS... </p>

<p>XXXTentacion’s last music video, released after he died, was of him at his OWN FUNERAL, and in the video, he was literally talking to a “demon”-like figure. And this wouldn’t even be a problem if not for the fact that this kind of thing is done all the time in Hollywood and the entertainment industry.</p>

<p>Am wrong for pointing this out? Or are people just fucking stupid for refusing to acknowledge stuff that’s right in front of their face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those questions I do not know the answer to. And these are often the questions that get asked as a rebuttal. I have a friend who, in the end, always asks “why would they do that though.” I have no idea why our rulers and the cults and the government and the banks and the corporations and these controllers do the things they do, but it’s clear that the are doing them.</p>

<p>Shedding light on the darkness is the first step.</p>

<p>I mean was he necessarily a “sacrifice”? Idk. But his death was clearly foreshadowed in his last music video... i mean he carved “memento mori” into a coffin he was trapped in... like, who told him to do that? WHO even thought of that idea? It’s stuff like that which people would rather turn a total blind eye to...</p>

<p>All I know is this world is very, VERY sick. As sick as it’s ever been.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Of course not.</p>

<p>XXXTentacion literally talked about being a “sacrifice” in a snapchat/instagram video. He said “if I die or end up a sacrifice”... like who even says that? Normal people would get locked up in a mental ward if they started talking like that... then he ended up dying... then his last music video was released, and it was of him at his OWN funeral, and in the video he was even talking to a “demon”-like figure.</p>

<p>The foreshadowing/predictive programming is off the charts.</p>

<p>And he was only like 20 or 21. </p>

<p>The “27 Club” isn’t a real thing.</p>

<li><p>He lies to investors all the time.</p></li>
<li><p>His Tesla cars catch on fire and have tons of problems-they’re literal death traps. A Tesla test-driver even died in a crash where half the car was completely totaled.</p></li>
<li><p>He FAKES HIS ROCKET LANDINGS—just do minor research into this. They have these big events where they attempt to land a rocket on a barge in the ocean. And EVERY TIME, the live feed CUTS OUT as the rocket is about to land. This is HILARIOUS actually, and it has happened numerous times. They even have announcers like it’s a sporting event and they act surprised each time. I’m not sure if they have since been able to land a rocket without the feed cutting out, but there is literally a compilations worth of the rocket landings being fake.</p></li>
<li><p>He’s running Tesla into the ground (and giving Nikola Tesla a bad name in the process)</p></li>
<li><p>He’s being sued for stock manipulation.</p></li>
<li><p>He misses important deadlines all the time and it infuriates his business partners.</p></li>
<li><p>He accused someone of being a pedophile and I’m pretty sure the guy wasn’t at all. This is important because pedophilia is RAMPANT in our society right now, and there are pedophiles in positions of high power. So when you accuse people of being pedos who aren’t, it actually empowers the people who are pedos.</p></li>
<li><p>He’s constantly doing things that lead to his companies stock plummeted. </p></li>
<li><p>He took a puff of weed on Joe Rogaine’s podcast and DIDN’T EVEN INHALE—this is his worst offense honestly. He smoked weed but didn’t inhale. The dude is weird for that one LMAO.</p></li>
<li><p>He handles criticism poorly and acts like a child in the process.</p></li>
<li><p>His “ideas” mostly suck and are almost always FAR from original.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Seriously tho I may be missing some stuff but Elon Musk is a total fraud.</p>

<p>(And Elon Musk has a massive CULT FOLLOWING online btw. It’s very strange. They are blindly following this guy off a cliff... people will come out of the woods and accuse you of being a “troll” and a “conspiracy theorist” just for criticizing him. It’s very odd and actually funny.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is legitimately interesting!  Look at the last song Chris Cornell played before he died..<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yTC6hM3nYw">.In My Time of Dying</a>. </p>

<p>I predicted a couple of years ago that the demons were going to &quot;come out and play&quot;.  Maybe it&#39;s just the internet and spread of information that makes these things easier to identify, but when there&#39;s stuff like Azazel&#39;s sigil stuck in a Justin Timberlake video, things are awry.  </p>

<p>To what end is it all?  Well...maybe some people do pierce the veil.  Maybe it works both ways.  Most of the musicians we are talking about make decidedly negative music (Linkin Park even too), and maybe that is something that demons like or assist...same thing goes for horror movies and such (Asia Argento and dad).  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry &#39;bout the downvotes...they aren&#39;t a coincidence either.  :)</p>

<p>Anyhow, here&#39;s a Cornell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbckIuT_YDc">jam</a>.  </p>
