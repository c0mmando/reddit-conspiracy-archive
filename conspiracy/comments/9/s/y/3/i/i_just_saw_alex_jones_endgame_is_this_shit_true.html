The trouble is, there is too much info out there for one person to see it all, and attempting to can seriously impede a good life, as in having time in the day for work and play. It&#39;s important to stay happy, to be one&#39;s full self, becouse becoming an info-zombie is also letting &quot;them&quot; win. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>federal reserve bank and system, 1912-13</p>

<p>1933, private ownership of gold beyond $100 dollars-worth is made illegal, and gold is gathered by the USGOV</p>

<p>1938, the UCC system of laws and statutes replaces the Common Law system--no legal precedent allowed in top courts before this date--and, now, i&#39;m certain, even in the smaller, local courts</p>

<p>(short aside; the birth certificate, social security card, and drivers license--all legal documents that hold your signature, as well as the all-capital-letter corporate strawman name of the holder, and establish the agreement of the bearer on trading inherent Rights for government-granted priviledges (also trades Self-Responsibility for Social Obligation/Duty, etc)--are instituted throughout the country over this time frame plus a decade, or so; the drivers license was more difficult to get the states to go along with, at first)</p>

<p>40s-through-60s, serious shake-ups, both politically and socially, in national and global circumstance, condition, and situation are brought about by covert, manipulative means; <em>perhaps</em> beginning with Hitler&#39;s International Bank-driven quest for world domination; eugenics ideologies openly discussed, but <em>secretly</em> implemented, by individuals, institutions, and states/nations,  world-wide; covert policies and actions of subversion against some foreign, democratic- and US-modeled governments and the replacement of those governments with despotic and tyrannical dictators (see: Kermit Roosevelt, Mohammed Mossadeq, Mohammad Rezā Shāh Pahlavi, and the CIA-backed Iran revolution)</p>

<p>1980&#39;s, Rex 84, CoG (Continuity of Government), and <em>more</em> (including Iran-Contra/drugs-for-money-for-guns, all government operated), are documented, and evolved, government programs and security directives</p>

<p>1960&#39;s-to-the-present, the UN&#39;s Biodiversity and Sustainability Report, Wildlands Project, Codex Alimentarius, UNESCO, and <strong><em>more</em></strong>, are documented, evolved, and already implemented and emplaced, both openly <em>and</em> covertly, to a large degree</p>

<p>2001, the &quot;attacks&quot; of 9/11 were, at the very least, known about in advance, and the intelligence was not acted on, <em>it was hidden</em> <strong><em>and lied about</em></strong>, to allow that series of events to happen--and there is serious question as to even further complicity, which the USGOV simply refuses to look into--of course...</p>

<p>2008, oct 1, american troops--3rd infantry division, 1st brigade--was assigned to tour the US homeland, doing at home what they did in iraq for 25 months; more troops have been allotted for duty by 2012 (up to 25,000); the request has been made for an <em>additional</em> 350,000-plus troops</p>

<p>2009, june, NLE 2009 was an exercise in surveillance, information gathering and dissemination (within law-enforcement peerage, not public), that entailed the integration of the intelligence communities within local, state, and federal law-enforcement, the military, and <strong><em>foreign law-enforcement and military</em></strong>, all guided and directed by Homeland Security</p>

<p>there is more, more, <em>more</em>--i, and others such as Jones, could go on for a very, <em>very</em> long time</p>

<p>please, do yourself a favor--use google, or scroogle, or startpage. com, or yahoo, or the local library, or the memories and knowledge  of old people, or <em>whatever</em> you can to <strong><em>research</em></strong> for the verification and validation of all the above info and <strong><em>MORE</em></strong>...</p>

<p>look for links to government sites, libraries, universities, even MSM--there are plenty of citable, serious sources for this verification, believe me...and trust <em>yourself</em> to be able to find them!...</p>

<p>then <em>act</em>...perhaps we still can establish...</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not where AJ stops. I think I would agree with the way you put it there, but all the conspiracy folks take it much further, thus alienating rational fact-based folks. I like the goal, but the means have to be logical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>frankly, i, personally, believe it does go way further--but the clear and readily available <em>facts</em>--without further investigation--only <em>appear</em> to support prior knowledge and lies that allowed the events to take place...(edit--not only does it go further on 9/11, it goes further on the NWO conspiracy, as well; at least decades, probably centuries, and, perhaps, <em>millennia</em>...)...</p>

<p>however, i have done my own due diligence and have found sufficient &quot;evidence&quot; that it <em>does</em> go further...i once did not even believe there had been any subversion or misdirection, and i willingly took part in the &quot;system&quot;--now, i know better, through pursuing <em>my own due diligence</em> by researching...and i let others know what conclusions i have reached and how to do for themselves the same thing...)...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>may I ask what evidence suggests that it goes further? I&#39;ve watched a lot of &quot;documentaries&quot; and they all have various theories about what happened. But mostly it seems like what is suspicious is the lack of evidence to support any claim about it, even the mainstream version. Like Bush/Cheney being power-hungry autocrats and using it for their own means still doesn&#39;t mean that there weren&#39;t Muslim hijackers involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you just did ask, and my reply is this--DYODD...</p>

<p>sounds to me as if you already have drawn some conclusions on your own, based on whatever level of knowledge you believe you have...that&#39;s fine, and i&#39;m not here to debate with you; my only goal is to present small bits of factual info, suggest you look into them, <em>deeply</em>, then come to your conclusions, and act accordingly...</p>

<p>a might add that this particular subreddit, as well, as <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/CommonLaw/">http://www.reddit.com/r/CommonLaw/</a> , in their entirety, are priceless in the amount <em>and</em> quality of much of their content--one could do worse than beginning research right where you already are!...just remember, however--actually click through on the links, <em>then</em> actually read or view the material presented!...</p>

<p>good luck, and...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>say, I have what may be a few simple question for y&#39;all.</p>

<p>From what I understand the &quot;New world order&quot; to be, the invisible hand of the non-accountable power elites ruling the world from their banking chairs; what&#39;s so &#39;new&#39; about this?  I don&#39;t mean that in a flippant way either.  Hasn&#39;t this been the way things have been run since we moved out of tribes and into civilization?</p>

<p>Also, I hear the term &quot;one world government&quot; thrown around a lot.  Is this what is sounds like?  I mean, that sounds kinda like a sweet deal to me.  I can&#39;t think of a more peaceful world than one that was able to govern itself fairly and collectively.  Does this term have another meaning or connotation that I haven&#39;t picked up on?  I can see where it could be kinda a pain from time to time, say if you wanted do offshore banking or something but I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s got this boogie man status attached to it.  </p>

<p>ps: i have a friend that works at the Bohemian Grove.  Talking with this friend I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as sinister as one might have you think.  Sure, they can have conversations about increasing their control, but they can do that over the phone as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With a &quot;one world government&quot; where are you going to go if you disagree with the leadership? That is the main thing I pull out of Alex Jones and his fear mongering. &quot;Someday we are gonna have only one government and they will make all the rules and you will have no choices&quot;. It really hits a chord with almost all people. </p>

<p>In regards to the Bohemian Grove you are right in a way, its members could be meeting anywhere and probably do meet in other places among themselves. What bothers me is some of the alleged acts preformed at the Grove that really could not happen anywhere else. Murdering effigies of children and some of the other rituals seem quite strange for mostly christian men to be practicing. </p>

<p>In closing, I think Alex Jones brings up good points but his alarmist journalism really causes more unrest than information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find that AJones really plays off fear and suspension and tops it with a dab of conspiratorial fallacy (Just coined the phrase but its akin to the creationists insistence that there is no transitional fossil record, that god exists between each one and that when a transitional fossil is found that god still exists between the two smaller gaps).  That said, I agree that he brings up points that are worth resolving.</p>

<p>With regards to the BG, I help burn an effigy of a man every year.  Or rather, I go to a place where like minded people gather and then we burn it.  To burn it has a symbolic meaning but that is up to the participant to create their own.  I would venture a guess that BG is much like a power brokers burning man.  Come for the people and give them something to do aside from sitting on a lawn chair.</p>

<p>As for the OWG, yeah, I fully agree.  That cord hits me as well; I want to be free.  Then I think about the scale of things.  Which would I find more distasteful, ensuring that I am free to switch citizenship if i want or ensuring that there will be more and continuous war between nations?  I&#39;m shooting from the hip here but, I&#39;ll bet a penny that there have been more lives lost in national warfare than in revolutions and civil wars.  </p>

<p>This is just my hypothesis here but hear me out.   History can be defined as the struggle between the people and the rulers.  That they want total control, we want total freedom.  That if we map the progression of this conflict we can see early on that those in control held it too tightly and it blew up on them.  The next form of control that filled the void learned a bit from that and gave us more freedoms and it blew up less quickly and violently. Repeat this process until we the worker bees don&#39;t want to revolt, this means they get to keep the power they have. This seems to be a process that is headed towards equilibrium.  They give us enough freedoms so we feel free enough to not want to risk it, give us enough property so we feel connected and don&#39;t want to risk it, give us a vote so we feel represented, give us stuff to buy so we want to work.  The point is, assuming that this power dichotomy holds to be true, if the OWG gives us just enough so that we are fulfilled, fat and free enough not to want remove them from power, then isn&#39;t that the best we can expect?  Isn&#39;t that what we as the workers bees want?  Don&#39;t we want safety and security?  Don&#39;t we want the ability to pick the puppet on the right or the puppet on the left?  It sucks and I&#39;m bitter about it but in many ways I would rather the population has an invisible hand than an invisible hand and die in national warfare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right. But also factor in the importance of the ritual itself. The purpose of the &quot;Bohemian Grove&quot; and other such meetings reinforce for the elites that they are better, that their control is justified by God in some way, and that they are the masters of the masses. </p>

<p>You might want to look up some of Adam Curtis&#39; BBC documentaries, specifically, <em>Century of the Self</em> and <em>Happiness Machines</em>. In the last century, the elites actually believed it was their mission to improve all mankind. They tried so many things. Now, they have thrown off that quasi-obligation. They now just don&#39;t give a shit.</p>

<p>Killing off 11 of every 12 humans on Earth is not a sane idea but they seem very much ready to implement such a plan because they have set up so many different methods to carry that out.

    <div class="md"><p>I assume everyday that there are controlling powers beyond my influence and vision.  I assume that any control I have over a situation of any consequence is illusionary and yeah, that sucks.  But on the other hand, I have had access to a nice education, freedoms and swarms of people that will fight for my them as well as a nice life expectancy and dental plan .  But I think the ability to vote out the powerful disappeared long ago if it existed at all.</p>

<p>While it&#39;s likely true that there are some crazy kids pulling the strings up there, I think overall it&#39;s fairly rational, highly skilled and greedy group that get get together to hatch plans about making more money and gain greater control. I would fight them to create global economic equality and shared global influence but as hard as as try, I can&#39;t think of a single rational reason (baring the lizard people idea, that shit makes total sense) why they would want to chop off the hand that feeds them.  They need me to control, otherwise, what&#39;s the point of having control?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? You think they need MONEY! They can just print that. here&#39;s how it has worked lately, I got this description here on Reddit.</p>

<p>Quote,</p>

<p>Here is a very quick explanation of the $700 billion bailout within the context of the mechanics of our monetary and banking system:</p>

<p>The taxpayers loan money to the banks. But the taxpayers do not have the money. So we have to borrow it from the banks to give it back to the banks. But the banks do not have the money to loan to the government. So they create it into existence (through a mechanism called fractional reserve) and then loan it to us, at interest, so we can then give it back to them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s Just like that Monopoly game I talked about. 
They have all the property and  all of the money  but they won&#39;t quit the game  and they insist on loaning us money to pass Go again. Insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You talk a lot about what they want and what they intend.  I say, prove it.  It&#39;s all too easy for me to look and ascribe a supposition to a person.  But in order for me to be a reasonable person in any debate, I must prove that supposition.    </p>

<p>&quot;they&#39;d like to have their &#39;friends&quot;, if any, and about half a billion slaves to produce...&quot;,  yeah?  Prove it.  Note, AJones method of A did X which implicates all that are like A, is not valid.  Note, saying something in an ominous voice does not prove anything, nor with screaming.  Note, stating intention as fact is not proof.  Note, stating a fact and not citing is not proof.  It&#39;s fun for 4th grade book reports to cite events in a long chain and then to state the &quot;actual&quot; reason they happened, but it&#39;s still not proof, until then its only a projection of your belief.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pedantic, given the top down inverted tree of power structures, to point at what one power system has done as an implication of all other power systems merely because at the top they vacation together.  The whole of global actions is controlled from the top.  Granted, it&#39;s a very small top.  However, association is not damnation.  Proof is damnation.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, it could be going on but, you haven&#39;t proven anything or even made a slightly interesting argument.  If you wish to break down the arguments into points that can be discussed I would happy sit down and help you refine your logic, until then good luck with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice stance, bold, demanding, dishonest,  in denial.</p>

<p>Which  do you deny?
That the creation of  the new world order is in progress with subsequent lessening of the value of the American voter?
That those who want to be the new rulers of the world are  malevolent?
That those who want to rule the entire world believe in Darwinism and or eugenics?</p>

<p>I have been around the block with many like you.  Nothing at all will be considered as proof of anything at all.</p>

<p>If I lay before you bleeding, with 7 bullets in my head you would swear that, the presence of those bullets didn&#39;t prove I had been shot. In fact it really doesn&#39;t prove anything. I had those bullets surgically implanted today just to impress you.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to prove a damn thing to you. take what you believe and move along to something &#39;interesting&#39;.</p>

<p>The proof is in the history of banking and the associated purveyors of power.. They now seek to exercise  their power without restraint.
 The proof is in their statements to each other and to all of us.</p>

<p>I have no interest in expounding on the litany of abuses or statements that have occurred. They are almost endless and you will easily nay say them away as not being proof because only one person spoke at a time.
 I can much more readily discuss, and care a lot more about, cause and effect for those abuses and I can  point to the way this can all be dealt with which is something that  no one else at all has been able to do.</p>

<p>The desirability of  radically reducing the population has been stated by many of the powerful. a belief in eugenics has been supported in the same group 
In a somewhat carefully worded speech, Richard N. Haass, President  of the The Council on Foreign Relations  is on record, here,
<a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9903/sovereignt">http://www.cfr.org/publication/9903/sovereignt</a> 
, speaking to and for his membership  expressing the treasonous desire to reduce  the sovereignty of all nations so that they ( CFR members )  can be the over-riding world power, which obviously would relegate the U.S. into a secondary and subservient  status. </p>

<p>They openly  intend to take the role of world leaders and leave you powerless to defend yourself against their whims. take a look in the news, even before they have that power, at what happens to anyone who opposes them by showing up to WTO or G20 meetings to  complain about it.</p>

<p>The Georgia Guidestones, which I recently visited, state the 500 million population figure and that jives closely with statements made in public by those at the top over the last hundred years. There has been a plan extant for at least 15 years to slowly increase the size of national parks as the population is reduced until the national parks, which you will no longer  be allowed to visit, take almost all of the land.</p>

<p>I point out  the evil that is contemplated pursuant to those statements about world government  and the visible preparations and systems  that have been prepared  to carry them out.  and then provide a plan of action rather than just recite the past. If the public was ever to take umbrage against extreme greed, those at the top would stand in stark contrast to humanity and be stripped of power.  6 billion souls vs. a couple of thousand.
 The mindset at the top is that they accomplished their towering positions and those who did not are vastly inferior and should just get out of the way. I bet you yourself feel this way.</p>

<p>They feel that Darwinism demands that only the fittest survive. </p>

<p>I heartily disagree with them concerning  the idea that their greed equals fitness. It more closely equals insanity.
As if after winning at Monopoly they refused to  end the game. The are so greedy that they oppressively LOAN you the money to play another losing round, while they own all of the property, railroads money and utilities and then another round , and another with no change or chance of anyone but themselves winning, descending to a higher level of insane greed after each round. Play again, they demand, here&#39;s a loan.</p>

<p>Unbridled greed threatens the entirety of humanity in many ways. It is therefore a human weakness of theirs , not a personal strength.
 They are thus, demonstrably not the fittest. They are just the greediest.</p>

<p>Some years ago I read a lot of the history of those  lineages  which are still in power  and there is much in the past to predict the continuity of plans that have been  in the works in fairly complete form for hundreds of years
. 
I watch what is done and ignore what is said to excuse what is done. No use quoting them, they lie, extravagantly and continuously.</p>

<p>I then apply logic and some knowledge of human motivation such as the obvious extreme greed and disdain towards &#39;lesser&#39;  mankind required  for these persons to have reached their world power status in the manner in which they have reached it.
I consider what  sort of mindset might  lead to those sorts of actions that we have recently seen and my view is then extrapolated and concatenated  from the visible actions taken.</p>

<p>I claim no personal knowledge of those at the top, but I know their characteristics by their actions. they make little  effort to conceal their motivation. I&#39;m not wrong.</p>

<p>If not effectively opposed they will claim rulership of the Earth and they will not want as many people on it as are now living </p>

<p>World government by those with a butt load of greed and evil intent is imminent. They plan to simply buy and threaten their way to overthrowing our national sovereignty with money that they are able to create out of thin air and loan to us for another losing round of Monopoly.</p>

<p>Hopefully we will not allow this to succeed but it will take a level of public attention that, so far, doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>You are disingenuous  in demanding proof of anything when you know well that you would  reject the testimony of God  himself and a host of angels that we are in mortal jeopardy from the above government elite. 
You are visibly dishonest when you state that I haven&#39;t even made a slightly interesting argument.  your dishonesty can be seen there in your many  words. The proof is, that you didn&#39;t write that long response because what you read was uninteresting,  but you said that nevertheless. Maybe you ARE one of the elite after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it wasn&#39;t, the top one percent wouldn&#39;t be hoarding so much of the total wealth. I think it IS the antonym of humanitarianism. When extended to its logical higher level of expression capitalism is pure greed without any  care for humanity left. I do understand that the richest capitalists do give to charity but that is overwhelmingly  tax rate manipulation or social manipulation.</p>

<p>A purely capitalistic system is purely anti humanist and pro greed.</p>

<p>For all of the increase in productivity of the computer age the working class has seen no reward. That is the clear result of capitalist greed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have drifted from the subject of Alex Jones. I apologize.  I&#39;m glad He&#39;s doing what he is doing but he seems disingenuous therefore I&#39;m skeptical of his motivation.</p>

<p>The creation of the &#39; humanitarian &#39; edifices you mention was mostly societal manipulation to get more attention, power and  money and to keep it coming for as long as possible. In  short it&#39;s the same reason as all else they do , greed. </p>

<p>They practice three kinds of greed.
There is greed for attention. 
There is greed for power.
There is greed  for money. </p>

<p>Those are their only motivations as proven by the lengths they go to in order to get more than they deserve. No one has EVER worked hard enough to become a billionaire. Becoming one  is a result of using unethical leverage ( such as outright crime ) to get that amount of remuneration, along with simple inheritance and gouging.</p>

<p>Globalist capitalists  at the top  are most notably currently interested in two vastly inhumane efforts. First is world hegemony, they are plotting to rule the world for their own benefit. The second is a vast depopulation to get even more of the total resources of the world for themselves. That includes attention, power  and money. They don&#39;t seem to understand the value of humanity except to serve themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are one of the most fortunate people in the world but that is no excuse for backing those who would have you enslaved or dead. Apparently they would like to be more than in control. They are many things, one of the chief among them is bored. </p>

<p>There is only a small supply of endorphins, to produce pleasure in your brain, that&#39;s  available to you no matter how rich or how much in control you are so to get beyond the level of pleasure those are able to produce one must seek stimulation by negative acts rather than positive ones,bringing down others rather than bringing yourself up any farther .They have won, Like a Monopoly player who owns all of the real estate they can only get more pleasure by ruining the game. they&#39;d like to have their &#39;friends&quot;, if any,  and about half a billion slaves to produce for them and get rid of the excess population which , for them, only get in the way and uses up resources. </p>

<p>The world is not theirs no matter what money  power and control they have </p>

<p>Your position of peace and personal power is fleeting at best in these circumstances. Your complicity in or apology for  your own demise is unhelpful since it will assist in bringing permanent  misery to the overwhelming majority of the worlds population.</p>

<p>There are only a couple of thousand of these individuals and they are mortal, so far.</p>

<p>We can have peace and plenty, or we can have them.</p>

<p>For humanity, their greed is a weakness. Without excessive greed we can all live much better lives but we have been taught to dislike happy endings haven&#39;t we? Good luck with you temporary peace and privilege. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? You think they need MONEY! They can just print that. here&#39;s how it has worked lately, I got this description here on Reddit.</p>

<p>Quote,</p>

<p>Here is a very quick explanation of the $700 billion bailout within the context of the mechanics of our monetary and banking system:</p>

<p>The taxpayers loan money to the banks. But the taxpayers do not have the money. So we have to borrow it from the banks to give it back to the banks. But the banks do not have the money to loan to the government. So they create it into existence (through a mechanism called fractional reserve) and then loan it to us, at interest, so we can then give it back to them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s Just like that Monopoly game I talked about. 
They have all the property and  all of the money  but they won&#39;t quit the game  and they insist on loaning us money to pass Go again. Insane.</p>
