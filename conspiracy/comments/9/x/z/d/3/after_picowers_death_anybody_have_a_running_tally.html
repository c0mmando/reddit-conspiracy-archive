<p>Rene-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet. He was the first Madoff related death that I can recall.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/02/business/02madoff.html">Madoff Investor’s Suicide Leaves Questions</a><br/>
January 1, 2009</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the night of Dec. 22, Mr. de la Villehuchet, 65, locked the doors to his office on the 22nd floor of a Midtown Manhattan office building. Then he swallowed a dose of sleeping pills and slashed open his left arm with a box cutter. The police found him dead the next morning.</p>

<p>In a note to his brother written shortly before his death, Mr. de la Villehuchet said that he needed to be held accountable for the losses, his brother said. “If you ruin your friends, your clients, you have to face the consequences,” Bertrand said, explaining what his brother believed.</p>

<p>Some 10 days after Mr. de la Villehuchet’s death, crucial questions about him, his firm — Access International Advisors — and his relationship with Mr. Madoff remain unanswered.</p>

Jan. 6, 2009</p>

<blockquote>
<p>German billionaire Adolf Merckle committed suicide after his business empire ran into trouble in the financial crisis, throwing himself in front of a train near his home, authorities and his family said Tuesday. </p>

<p>The 74-year-old’s business interests ranged from pharmaceuticals to cement, and its troubles had recently been compounded by losses on shares in auto maker Volkswagen AG.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.finalternatives.com/node/8427">CFM Chief Aguilar Dies In Gliding Accident</a><br/>
July 6, 2009 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jean-Pierre Aguilar, co-founder and CEO of France’s largest hedge fund, died in a gliding accident over the weekend.</p>

<p>Capital Fund Management, which Aguilar helped set up 18 years ago, broke the tragic news to its investors in a letter yesterday. Aguilar, a passionate glider, was killed during a flying contest in the south of France sponsored by CFM. The accident occurred during the final flight of the six-day event, and also took the life of his co-pilot, the head of the Gliding Club of Barcelonnette, France.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those who doubt the inclusion of this one. It could have been an &quot;accident&quot; or could have been sabotage. This guy was involved in HFT (High Frequency Trading) and this happened just after the revelations about Goldman Sachs HFT operations. There is more to the story, but I won&#39;t go into the details here. Obviously this is highly speculative.</p>
