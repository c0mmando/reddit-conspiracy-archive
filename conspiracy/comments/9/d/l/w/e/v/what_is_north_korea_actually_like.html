       I've spent months and months on and off trawling through youtube to try and see if I can make a balanced view of what North Korean life is actually like.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       You have your NK propaganda videos that show it as a lovely dreamland, you have your American propaganda videos that show it as a creepy distopian prison state but surely the reality is somewhere in the middle?
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I understand, their middle class is a lot bigger of a proportion of their population than you would find in the western world and you can easily take footage of poor families and pass it off as poor living conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm just trying to feed my own anti-propaganda confirmation bias but does anyone have any sources that show what it's
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       like in North Korea? Preferably places outside of Pyongyang...

       Great question. There's really no way to ever really "know" outside of going there for yourself. There's just as much US propaganda about NK as there is NK propaganda about NK.

       I've watched a lot of videos about North Korea and I feel the same as you. It's a perfect society to people who have escaped and describe horrors.
Honestly somewhere in the middle is the best I can guess.

       Just read the comments from people who have been there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a steaming pile of crap. The people are starving. You can look at satellite photos to see it’s very rural. Any photos you see of the cities they’re mostly run down except the government centers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Chinese have made statements about the conditions and they’re allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       North Korea can’t even finish the hotel they’ve started in the capital.

       I never thought to google maps NK before. There are a few spots on Pyongyang where you can actually street view and it’s incredible drab and eerie. Everything is concrete slabs. Very bizarre, probably gonna spend an hour looking around Pyongyang lol

       I know I know before I say this but Vice had a travel guide to NK from more than a decade ago and at one point they kind of stuck the camera around a corner and saw what looked like life anywhere else.

       Excellent questions.    I lived in Moscow from 58 to 61 and Zagreb Yugoslavia from 66 to 70.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, I was a kid,  and my parents relatively well off,  but especially Yugoslavia,   US expats were starting to move there,  and folks who left for Germany for work generally came back.    Russia was definitely more difficult,  more austere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact remains that far more people would have chosen to come to the US if they could have and in the case of North Korea,   a huge number would have flooded into South Korea if they could have,  primarily for economic reasons,  and few would have gone in the opposite direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much of the hardship in North Korea is the result of US policy though,   just as was the case in Iraq during the sanctions,   or in Russia during the cold war?    The US vertually blockades the countries where it wishes to overthrow the government,   always called "regime".
      </p>
      <p>
       The US was not trying to overthrow the Tito regime in Yugoslavia,  so Yugoslavia,  not being part of the Soviet bloc,  could and did prosper comparatively.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think you should underestimate the starvation that has happened in North Korea.    The west definitely propagandized,   and some in North Korea lived decent lives,  but the amount of emergency aid to North Korea from the Soviet Union,   China and others would not have been happening if things had not been extremely dire.
      </p>
      <p>
       US policy is largely to blame for how dire it was in North Korea and also what drove North Korea to take extraordinary defensive measures.

       How much is US policy responsible? I don't know. I do know US bombed the ever loving fuck out of them which would have a lot to do with conditions there.

       US bombed Japan and Germany just as much,  and its been 50 years.   Policy was also the difference there.    Compare what happened in West Germany from East Germany based on the Cold War and the relative positions of the Soviet Union and the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should read up on the effect of economic warfare,  blockades,  on places.    The extremes of North Korea would not have come about if not for US policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spread of US empire has its winners and losers.    South Korea or Japan would be considered winners,   but then they are also an extension of the US plantation.   Living on the US plantation seemed ideal in the 50s and 60s,  but except for the wealthy,  in the US even,   we can see that the US empire is capable of running a plantation and abusing its subjects.    An iron fist in a nice looking glove.    For places that resist US empire/plantation,    the leaders are killed,   and the country distroyed,  gloves off.   Iraq,  Syria,  Libya,  soon Iran,   and maybe North Korea if it doesn't submit.    Probably Russia too.    China is the one that will be the biggest challenge long run,  and will likely win.

       not directly on topic, but always thought this look at US propaganda, from a DPRK standpoint (but actually not made by DPRK) was both extremely eye-opening and entertaining
