<p>I prefer cannabis, I feel like it&#39;s a much more active kind of anti depressant if you want to consider it as that. Right away I&#39;ll feel better and more uplifted (I mean there are tons of instant benefits)  however that mindset/effects don&#39;t last forever (perhaps antidepressants are better as a &quot;long term&quot; solution?). I suppose you gotta work to maintain the frame of mind you get from cannabis into your normal life while not using it.</p>

<p>It took switching up between a few to find the right one and working with my doctor but they really changed my life for the better. The first few I was on didn&#39;t work well and made me feel sick and have a few side effects but I was vocal and expressed this. We changed them around to find the right one that worked for me. Quality of life now is MUCH higher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not quite as black and white as good or bad, and a lot of it depends on the person. </p>

<p>Here’s the thing about anti depressants. Let’s say a person is extremely depressed and is just about to give up and commit suicide, what would be the reason to not at least try anti-depressants? There is nothing left to lose if you are already planning to commit suicide. </p>

<p>Now, there are plenty of issues with them, as with most forms of medicine. They are not a 100% thing, and many times they give people who are unmotivated, the drive to actually go through with suicidal thoughts, but is that not a risk someone should take if they are planning on ending their life anyway? </p>

<p>I believe all other forms of help should be exhausted before resorting to any sort of SSRI, but they have hurt many people, but have helped countless others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>he only reason a lot of those drugs are available is because the drug companies behind them hid the increased suicidal ideation/attempted suicides and completed suicides that occurred in the clinical trials from the regulators to get them on the market. Prozac, Paxil etc.</p>

<p>For example the biggest difference between the SSRIS is the half lifes. Prozac being the longest and Paxil being the shortest.</p>

<p>Eli lilly and GSK hid the increased suicides that occurred in their clinical trials from the regulators.</p>

<p>GSK had evidence paroxetine increases the risk of suicide by older users by as much as 670 percent, yet failed to include that on the warning label.&quot; (if you wondering why it&#39;s 670 percent its because they only looked at his age group. if you actaully look at all the suicides in the clinical trials there were I believe 22 and 0 in the placebo.) That doesn&#39;t include increase in unsuccessful suicide attempts and increase in wanting to commit suicide. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gsk-lawsuit/gsk-must-pay-3-million-in-generic-paxil-suicide-lawsuit-u-s-jury-idUSKBN17M2SH">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gsk-lawsuit/gsk-must-pay-3-million-in-generic-paxil-suicide-lawsuit-u-s-jury-idUSKBN17M2SH</a></p>

<p>&quot;a July 1985 in-house analysis by Eli Lilly in which the company found a large statistically significant increase in suicide attempts for patients taking Prozac during their placebo controlled clinical trials&quot; prozac. 12 - 0. that doesn&#39;t include increase in attempted non completed suicides or increase in wanting to commit suicide.</p>

<p>Michael moore on eli lilly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpinCRaAQOk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpinCRaAQOk</a></p>

<p>OH and GSK also hid the increased risk of suicides in children in part and were sued 3 billion for it.</p>

<p>Because of SRIs the regulations got stricter. (that was in the 80s and 90s. the standards were EVEN lower in the 50s 60s and 70s. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/27/prozac-next-psychiatric-wonder-drug-research-medicine-mental-illness">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/27/prozac-next-psychiatric-wonder-drug-research-medicine-mental-illness</a> &quot;Pharma giants have cut research on psychiatric medicine by 70% in 10 years&quot; That was in 2016. Because they can&#39;t get away with the bullshit they used to get away with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said cocaine wasn’t one, if you’ve ever had experience with it, you would know that immediately after you come down you feel absolutely awful, because it has used up a generous amount, of not most, of your serotonin. It’s a very fast acting, strong stimulant that doesn’t have a long half life, making it close to useless as a conventional antidepressant. </p>

<p>I absolutely agree,  people are now figuring out how many users actually get better vs. worse/suicidal, which is already causing significant backlash in these drugs, than it might turn into the same situation as the “Opioid Epidemic”, in which doctors stop prescribing them unless there are no more solutions. </p>

<p>My point wasn’t that they are a great solution, or even a solution to many people at all. The fact of the matter is, these things are responsible for a lot of harm because of their misuse and doctors not fully understanding what they’re prescribing. But if it’s your last chance of feeling better, and you are suicidal already, then there’s NO reason not to take them, because there are many cases where they do help people, and that shouldn’t be ignored. </p>

The initial withdrawal symptoms from stopping were awful, a huge zap of energy in the center of my brain randomly but normally when looking side to side, it was enough to make you stop what you were doing every time it happened and almost make you forget what you&#39;re doing. Restlessness, random twitches, insomnia and zero sex drive are still a problem 3 years after stopping. Psilocybin mushrooms and marijuana are what truly helped my depression in the end</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of people have already said it best - it works for some and it doesn&#39;t work for others. But the idea that they&#39;re absolutely unnecessary and should never be used ignores the reality of depression and how it impacts people. There&#39;s this narrative going around that depression is just something simply cured by exercise, diet and/or lifestyle changes - not only is that ignorant, it&#39;s dangerous. I&#39;ve always thought about it in the same way as any other medical issue - if your liver or your heart or your kidneys are in trouble, you&#39;d take the necessary medication in order to address that. You&#39;d make lifestyle changes, sure, but you wouldn&#39;t expect a healthy diet to &quot;fix&quot; your heart problems. Your brain is a part of your body, just like every other organ - if it&#39;s not operating correctly, you need to address it. </p>

<p>The best advice I can give you is research and learn about the anti-depressant you are being prescribed (if that was the reason for this post). Don&#39;t be afraid to tell your doctor, &quot;No, I don&#39;t want that drug&quot; - be an active participant in your medical sessions and be your own advocate. In addition, don&#39;t expect an anti-depressant to fix all of your problems - it absolutely won&#39;t and chances are you&#39;ll need therapy as well (I think the success rates are higher for those who address depression through medication <em>and</em> therapy). In addition, exercise and diet <em>is</em> an important element of your mental health so you&#39;ll want to make sure that&#39;s being addressed as well. Best of luck on your path and don&#39;t be afraid or ashamed to take the steps you need to take in order to feel better. You deserve it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I usually just browse this subreddit, but I have personal experience on this subject. </p>

<p>I suffer from cyclical depression. It comes and goes, but it&#39;s pretty steady and doesn&#39;t cause a whole lot of issues for me. I only really suffer from fatigue and lack of motivation. I never have had the sadness and suicidal thoughts usually associated with depression. </p>

<p>Come my freshman year in College I hit a massive depressive spell and went on anti-depressants to help me get through class. I took Abilify initally then switched to Trileptal. Ultimately all the two meditations did was make me zombie and gain weight. It didn&#39;t really help me get through my day in the long run. </p>

<p>I think that it can help people who honestly need it and their body handles properly. In my case, I was worse off. I ended up dropping the medication and have been fine since.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a love hate relationship with them</p>

<p>I hate big pharma but I do have a chemical imbalance (born with it/&#39;cause drugs, dont do drugs kids, especially when you are a kid) so I find it to be good for me</p>

<p>however its not for everyone, nor are every anti depressants.</p>

<p>i recently went back on mine recently, called cipralex. it gives me serotonin that i lack, and i feel less psychotic then when I was neglecting them</p>

<p>So basically it just depends on why you need it and what you are taking.</p>

<p>If you feel you need some but are afraid of big pharma, I suggest saffron, an all natural rare herb that helps depression and anxiety. It is more expensive than cocaine but it works </p>

<p>Whether it helps may depend on your perspective as much as anything else. If you&#39;re severely depressed, probably any relief you can get seems helpful. If you&#39;re only depressed at certain times or mildly depressed, taking antidepressants everyday might be an overreaction and expose you to side effects. So individuals have to determine what level of help they require and how those needs will be met.</p>
