I think we have a whole generation of losers raised to receive rewards for mediocre performance. A generation of snowflakes who believe they are the most important person on earth.

    <div class="md"><p>It isn’t <em>all</em> men’s fault. You’re missing the point. I’m saying we as a society have failed an entire generation of young men and we are reaping the tragic results. Statistically speaking, the majority of mass shootings are committed by men. This is not condemning <em>all</em> men. There are plenty of men who are good people. This is simply pointing out a fact. Just like if I stated “the majority of infanticide in our country is committed by women.” I’m stating a fact rather than condemning <em>all</em> women. There are plenty of women who are good mothers. Please don’t read some anti-male agenda into my words. 
Yes, personal responsibility factors in here too. I’m not excusing the actions of these mass shooters. 
I’m trying to say that our country is last in living conditions amongst its peers but first in mass shootings and this correlation needs to be addressed. Just because you’re lucky enough to have a decent life doesn’t mean you can write off the emotional suffering of other men as due to them being “pussies.” It’s this kind of attitude that is part of the problem in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it depressing that the idea of paid sick leave, a livable wage, and the right to have a safe work environment is somehow “socialism.” No, it’s called basic standard of living and human decency and it has nothing to do with socialism or any political system for that matter. Yet generations of people have slowly accepted their working environment become worse and worse yet feel “free” because “at least we ain’t got no suhshalist bullshit like those lame ass f*ggots in the EU er Canada.” It truly is the genius stroke of corporations and politicians in this country...chipping away at our standards of living while inflating theirs but convincing us we are so much better off than other western industrialized countries (when we are not if you look at any study ever done in the past 40 years).</p>
