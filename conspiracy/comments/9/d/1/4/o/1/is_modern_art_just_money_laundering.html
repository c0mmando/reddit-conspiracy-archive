    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always wondered about the mechanics of this, so I researched a little and found this great example for &quot;long game&quot; money laundering through art. </p>

<p>You start with a sum of dirty money.</p>

<p>You visit some really famous artists and buy up all their paintings with your dirty cash.</p>

<p>You assign an auction house to help you in auctioning these art pieces that you have bought.</p>

<p>The art pieces you sold off at the auction will be paid by the buyer or the auction house, depending on the arrangement. (I am not too sure).</p>

<p>You now have clean money by selling off your art collections.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-launder-money-using-art-work">https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-launder-money-using-art-work</a></p>

<p>There was an estimated $63.8 billion worth of sales in 2015 so these are probably big players in this game...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is used for money laundering, but it&#39;s also a good way to &#39;hide&#39; your money if you&#39;re rich. You invest x amount of dollars in a famous painting, and it&#39;s pretty much ensured to increase in value over time. It&#39;s easily liquidated, and I don&#39;t believe you have to pay as much tax on it if you just had in some account.</p>

<p>Growing up I worked construction on super rich people&#39;s homes, and I remember this one family (Oil heiress and pharm CEO) had a bunch of original Chegal&#39;s just sitting in their garage, wrapped up in plastic.</p>

<p>Also easy to buy/sell something on the private, secondary market while keeping it discrete. I remember there was some chinese businessman a few years back that paid something like 25M over the accepted price for some picasso or something. I&#39;d bet my hat there was some other agreement in place and some other thing that the &#39;extra&#39;  25M (or whatever it was....I don&#39;t remember) was for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly. the accountant is keeping a second set of books and that hypothetical 100$ painting will go in cash out as four or 5. And the artists are curated first by everyone in the chain: Press Agents, Gallery Owners,  etc The only way to be caught in this is is the SEC audits a fishy transaction or the IRS audits the eoy filing. The laymen working to audit have very specific triggers to address. We all know the feds are in on it.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh it&#39;s been well established, art is just marketing. There are A TON of great artists out there, but only a few make it. The rags to riches for artists is rare. </p>

<p>There are realistically 2 ways to become a top tier artist. The first is by having deep connections within the industry. Some are able to start out at the bottom of the scene, and slowly build connections as they go up, but most people in the art world already start both financially well off as well as connected within the world. From there, your network of friends will try to prop up and push your art to build value. They are sort of like the early investors who have an incentive to make you blow up, so they can cash in on all your early stuff</p>

<p>Then there is the dead artist. For instance, Picasso was sort of known at the time, but he wasn&#39;t &quot;PICASSO&quot; until after he died. When he was alive, he was selling his art for cheap wherever he could make a buck. But once he died, he was &quot;discovered&quot; by someone who just so happened to stumble upon a massive collection of his who realized this guy had a really interesting life story to use to market the stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Picasso died in 1973.    The market for art in 1973 was nothing like what it has become since then,  it was not as influenced by money laundering and the fabulously rich have gotten a lot richer.     The supply and demand scenario has changed.    Additional supply ended in 1973,  but the demand curve has been going exponential much more recently.    Same thing with collectible cars,   the supply ended and price moved,   but the exponential increases have been much more recent.    Those with money to bury in collectibles,  real estate,  etc.  have much expanded means since they rigged the system with increased corruption across the planet.    The wealth is increasingly concentrated in a few hands who compete (demand) in a way that was not there in the seventies or eighties.    There should be a graph tracking the collectibles that have been affected.   Its truly and amazing shift.</p>

<p>For instance, Picasso was sort of known at the time, but he wasn&#39;t &quot;PICASSO&quot; until after he died. </p>

<p>Bullshit.  Picasso was super, super famous for forty years before he died.  I remember a funny story from the 70s or 80s when someone sent their kid with a piece of paper to get a drawing from Picasso on a beach, and instead Picasso drew on the kid&#39;s stomach - so the parents were freaking out about washing their kid and erasing this &quot;masterwork&quot; (which was a 2-second scrawl).</p>

<p>Indeed, you can make the case that Picasso was the first living superstar painter.</p>

<p>Evidence of sale is easy. You just sold your read canvas, you probably gave a reciept. Valuation is easy of it is small potatoes. If we&#39;re talking millions there will be issues, but you can do it in smaller amounts to get it through.</p>

<p>In this example I think the real issue is to get the money to the buyer. The buyer might be required to explain how he got the money that was paid for the artpiece.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You left out a few intervening steps.</p>

<p>The money may be dirty or clean. What matters is that the money can be transferred from Party A (the buyer) to Party B (the artist lol) and be taxable and visible to the IRS. In this fashion, money can be exchanged between parties without it being subject to corporate law or scrutiny.</p>

<p>The perfect example is the &quot;artist&quot; Basquiat.</p>

<p>Here is a guy with zero talent, a wannabe graffiti artist (in the way that Banksy made popular in the late 90s) who wandered homeless and drug addicted around New York City in the 1980s and basically plastered paint on canvas worse than Jackson Pollock.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say I take this degenerate off the street, dress him up, write articles in the newspapers I own as the &quot;new hot thing&quot;. Then, I organize  a gallery showing of this &quot;artist&quot; arranged by my money laundering friends. I write all of this off as taxes.</p>

<p>The pieces of toddler spray paint shit on canvas in the gallery all gets bought out by my friends for 2-10 million per painting. The artist is instantly a &quot;star&quot;.</p>

<p>All my friends in the media (that I control) write pieces about this fantastic new artist. The artist, a dim heroin addict, loves the attention but has no clue what&#39;s going on. He proceeds to overdose and dies.</p>

<p>JACKPOT!</p>

<p>Every money launderer who paid two million for shit pasted on canvas at the gallery now has a 10 million two by four on his wall. And the IRS can&#39;t tax it! Now that money you earned surrepticiously becomes legal. You and your friends have created a store of wealth that appreciates in value on your wall.</p>

<p>Even better, the paintings are so shit, devoid of skill or artistic value that you can hire anyone to make a new one. Pay a kid to spray paint diarrhea on a a stored 80s canvas and call it the long lost painting of &quot;Basquiat&quot;. Sink 30 million into it, wait 10 years and sell it for 200 million.</p>

<p>The gains destroy inflation.</p>

<p>The entire art market is a racket beyond the dreams of avarice.</p>

<p>Wrong, that&#39;s Andres Serrano.</p>

<p>If you actually see the original work, it&#39;s actually very beautiful in a weird way.  </p>

<p>Yes, the urine thing is at least partly an attention-getting idea, but if you ever travelled through e.g. Italy at some point you get thoroughly sick of seeing yet another Jesus, yawn... and this is clearly a reaction to the overexposure of Jesus in western art.</p>

<p>Overall, you seem to believe that art is all one big fraud.  There are aspects of fraud, but there are also aspects of great value.  Don&#39;t throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>

My theory: take said cash to casino, buy chips, play games, withdraw cash against &#39;winnings&#39;.  A second theory is to open a cash intensive business (newsagents, coffee shops, car wash) and integrate the cash into the business. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You start with a sum of dirty money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok.  Let&#39;s say you have some illegal drug money you made.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You visit some really famous artists and buy up all their paintings with your dirty cash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, stop right there.  You CAN buy expensive stuff with illegal cash if the seller is stupid enough to not care about your identity.  Some idiot artist may sell you a painting for $100k, but he&#39;s now in a buttload of headache from the IRS because they will demand to know where he got the $100k from.    In other words, the artist will now be questioned on end where he got that $100k, and if he can&#39;t provide proof that he sold one of his work for $100k, he&#39;s in a lot of trouble now.  I&#39;m assuming this will be the case since you want to hide your id from the artist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You assign an auction house to help you in auctioning these art pieces that you have bought. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, stop here.  The first and foremost concern for auction houses is that 1. the piece is authentic and 2. it is not stolen.    How are you going to prove that you actually bought the art?  Did that idiot artist give you a cash purchase receipt?  But wait, then now you have a problem.  There&#39;s a paper trail now.  If the IRS asks where you got the money to purchase this art for $100k, you have to provide a legitimate source for the income, which you don&#39;t have.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The art pieces you sold off at the auction will be paid by the buyer or the auction house, depending on the arrangement. (I am not too sure).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m assuming you mean the seller (and/or buyer) does so anonymously.  You know, like in the movies when they say, &quot;the item goes for $1 million to an anonymous bidder.  Congratulations&quot;   But wait, you know that they aren&#39;t really anonymous, right?  The auction house knows very well who the 2 parties are (or else, how the heck would they transfer the money and the item?)  Anonymous just means they won&#39;t disclose the name of the parties to the public.  But guess what?  If the IRS comes to them and asks who the parties are, they are not only required but would be happy to disclose the names of the parties.  Can you guess why?  Yup!  To stop money laundering!  </p>

<p>If you REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to, you could come up with a viable way to launder money thru auction houses or art by going through international money havens.  But why bother?  Setting up a simple cash business, like a restaurant or a laundry (hence where the name comes from) is a far more easier and safer way to launder money.  </p>

<p>Yeah. They put their stuff in a diplomatic pouch (which can be as large as a container shipment), and they no longer have to declare anything nor can it be searched. </p>

<p>To say they don&#39;t have to go through scrutiny is disingenuous. They don&#39;t. And this loophole is routinely exploited in order to ship many illegal things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a common strategy to get blackmail on people like that. It reminds me of a story where some foreign diplomat was staying at a hotel in russia and had a few hookers visit his hotel room.</p>

<p>He was later confronted by people who threatened to blackmail him with the tape. He got very excited when he realized there was a tape because he was very proud of his performance and stamina with the beautiful girls.  I wish i could find the actual story but only trump pee tape stories are coming up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, painting anyway in my opinion. &#39;Drip painting&#39; had been used by other painters of the time (maybe most notably Hans Hoffman), but Pollock was the first to make the <em>act</em> of painting the work itself, simply a recording of his movements  - and conceptually define it as such. of course, this would apply to all painting before and after, but philosophically, this could be argued to be the birth of postmodernism in the artistic context. simple action, but profound in art history.</p>

<p>i should also say i was unaware this thread was under the conspiracy subreddit when i first posted :)</p>

<p>in regards to not liking someone&#39;s art vs. getting riled up and calling them untalented, consider Pollock&#39;s words on the subject, “It&#39;s just like looking at a bed of flowers. You don&#39;t tear your hair out over what it means.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As wealth continues to accumulate and we see more and more billionaires CLASSIC ART only appreciates in value. This is just basic economics as supply will never increase but demand does. This is why art is suddenly worth so much more after an artist dies. You can see these high value items be used as a store or money, a way to legally invest black market money, a way for tax avoidance in a way ect.</p>

<p>Now with Modern &quot;art&quot; the real conspiracy is more a scam. Sure there are famous people whose stuff sells well, but there are a lot of fringe artists who either make it or break it based on who will invest in them. These investors will try and manipulate something that was worthless into something that is worth a lot by making this new artists desirable. &quot;Oh his last painting sold for $50,000&quot; this signals that his art must be worth that much, and they try and get you to believe that there art will someday be worth millions. </p>

<p>Well, that movie does depict her getting buried alive in a coffin and raped while in a coma. You may not believe me, but the fact that I enjoyed that depiction in the context of a piece of art doesn&#39;t imply I&#39;d want to do it in real life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see, that is a fair point. but that neither invalidates stocks nor does it discredit the fact that there is more places to spend your coin with each and every year that passes by. </p>

<p>And I will also contest about the &quot;Hoops&quot; thing -- it&#39;s as simple as sending an email: Open program(like google chrome/outlook), paste address (analogous to email-address), type in amount (analogous to message content) - hit send. Bing. You transferred any amount of money without a trusted third party for (currently) $0.77 in under 15 minutes. This is valuable even with current volatility because it can be used as a settlement-layer (i.e. retailer accepts crypto for good, but has bots that sell at-market to limit their exposure to volatility - retailer gains crypto-savvy customers while protecting their profits in this tumultuous market) </p>

<p>I have found that anyone saying it is difficult to send a transaction either hasn&#39;t really tried, or is so technologically inept that they&#39;re lost in the digital age as a whole anyways (See: elderly people). </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in crypto when there <em>actually was nowhere to spend it at all</em> so for you to come in and essentially say that nothing has changed in the last decade is simply ignorant. I mean, the hardcore advocates like andreas antonopoulos <em>literally</em> live entirely on bitcoin. That was not really possible until the past year or two. The hoops are getting bigger and closer to the ground until the metaphorical hoop will look just like any of life&#39;s other hoops, is my forecast. Too much future global-turmoil for crypto to disappear... Venezuelan bolivar, Turkish lira, both in the shitter. bitcoin holders/buyers in those countries preserved their wealth, though. </p>

<p>Sorry to ramble or come off as heated, that isn&#39;t my intention; I am just passionate. I promise it will be an interesting next 5-10 years, anyways :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I was being a bit snarky. But bitcoin&#39;s value can fluctuate wildly. I think the correlation is political instability. If there&#39;s a place in the world where rich people need to hide or protect their wealth, they&#39;ll turn to art   and or bitcoin. It&#39;s that sudden demand that drives the prices up. When the event is over, prices settle. This drop tends to affect bitcoin more so than art. And it&#39;s really not that terrible of an analogy because there are a relatively small  number of high profile artists  whose work is desirable, but there is fixed number of their works because they have passed. For example, there aren&#39;t going to be any new paintings by Salvador Dali.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with your explanation for why bitcoin price rises or falls, but I&#39;ll agree that bitcoin and fine art are alike in that they&#39;re &#39;worth&#39; whatever someone is willing to pay for it, like any other commodity. </p>

However, branding necessitates differentiation and therefore a deviation from what was formerly considered both objectively and subjectivity beautiful.

<p>People buy them, because they&#39;re expensive and recognizable. You don&#39;t wear them cause they look nice, you wear them to impress other people, who know how much they&#39;re worth.</p>

<p>It explains why people buy oversized and overpriced jackets made by Kanye or Supreme, brand-name wrist watches and in-game item skins. But you have to be somewhat educated on the field, because unless you&#39;re interested in it, you don&#39;t know how much it&#39;s worth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. </p>

<p>There are foreign entities that have &quot;diplomatic&quot; type immunities in warehouses across the world, USA included. These art freehold&#39;s are basically a sovereign area. When 2 parties wish to transact with each other, they do so on paper only, and the physical asset never actually moves locations, therefore there is no TAXABLE event or sale in the eyes of most countries. </p>

<p>Its also a tax loophole. But yes, ALL MODERN ART IS PURELY A MONEY LAUNDERING TOOL. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think money laundering is a significant contributor to the phenomenon, but I don&#39;t think it sufficiently explains the cause. Is modern art a racket? Meaning a small minority (launderers) know what&#39;s really going on while a significant majority are dupes and useful idiots? Maybe. But if there is a racket, I think the racketeers are opportunists. </p>

<p>Significant wealth disparity is another contributor. Just like a 12 million dollar bottle of wine tastes better than a 12 dollar bottle of wine until after the blind study tells you they both cost twelve dollars.</p>

<p>Ultimately I think it&#39;s just human nature. People want to believe in high principals and deep connections. Jesus, Karma, the Tao... The story of the emotions a red canvas evokes together with the hubris of belittling others that aren&#39;t having the same emotions about it... It just sells better than &#39;canvas, red, 5x5, $12&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The short answer is YES! </p>

<p>Ask yourself why the Podesta bros have such substantial perosnal art collections? Also the same with Saudi royalty and other power brokers. The &quot;art&quot; is everything to those people; in this context calling it &quot;art&quot; is a bit of a stretch. </p>

<p>But heres my theory. They use art sales as a cover to move money around. For all sorts of crimes: Laundering money and quid-pro-quos as you&#39;ve suggested, but also some other super nasty business, like lets say, payment for human cargo. </p>

there are dirty margins of every field - politics, religion, sports just to name a few. I guess main reason this question arises is because modern art, especially high art is indecipherable and in most cases very far from everyday understanding how beauty and art should look (quite an effort to write ugly, right?). but imagine you are chief. and you know how to make best omelette in the world. you make it every day. every year. you reach perfection. ..and you get sick of it. it gets boring. so you start experimenting. you add cinammon or strawberies. definetelly not everyone will like it. but there will be food critics (also bored to sickness of &quot;perfect&quot; omelette) who will loud you for your original and refined taste. now food is very closelly bound to our physiology. you can not add cyanide for example (but think of the fugu fish!). however creativity has no physical limits, so you multiply that experimentation to bazillion and you get modern art. another reason people can detest modern art is inate tendency to compare technical skill to ours. that ugly painting?! my kid could have drawn that! well maybe he could. as Piccasso famously said - &quot;I drew my whole life just I could learn draw as kid&quot;. thing is, after photography, and mass production  technical skill stopped being so cherished in art. so naturally modern art became ugly
and impossible to understand. but same applies to most fields - i don&#39;t grasp high math or modern physcis, but it doesn&#39;t stop me from using computers or electricity.
hope that clarifies subject a bit, thanks for long read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is much harder than that in my experience in the art world/community. </p>

<p>easiest way would make a similar body of work - 20 to 50 pieces - and have them professionally photographed. then contact as many mass-producing print sellers (check the tiny distributor names on prints at your local boutique frame shops) and tell them you&#39;re interested in selling rights to your images, preferably contractual so you get repeat business with them. this method does not require a degree in fine arts, gallery representation, exhibition history, etc </p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>if you want to make the big bucks, be born rich, get an MFA from a university with a respected college of art (not the expensive ones though because there will be a heap of suspicion in your early career that you just paid for it in lieu of actual ability). being successful in the art world is 85% who you know, 5% ability, 10% conceptual and philosophical understanding. get to know the zeitgeist and conceptually align your shtick to the cultural flow - like how identity politics and intersectionality has reigned for the last 10 years or so (its shifting now, finally). give artist talks as much as you can, meet and sell yourself, apply for grants and artist residencies - especially ones that engage the community (free publicity). do this for 10 years and THEN you&#39;ll finally be able to sell your work for five figures or more. galleries generally take 50% and famous galleries take the first $xx,xxx in sales and 50% after that. those numbers are negotiable once you become a B-list or higher artist though. A-list artists may even sell directly at an auction house, though it will likely draw ire from the industry at large.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Besides the actual paintings like Van Gogh, Warhol, Dalí, etc. and the occasional good pieces the MoMA was such a disappointment.  </p>

<p>For example: One piece was literally a broken iPhone in a display case. Another one was an old tv with some static and occasional 90s music video segments with no sound. Just looked like some old Much music stuff. There’s another one that was at least 20 feet by 30 feet, and it was just layers of white. Another was just circles, now it was a “target” so if the guy lived through the war, sure, cool. But, it honestly looked like anyone could paint it. </p>

<p>There were definitely tons of amazing pieces in that museum. It’s just that I like art that seems impossible.  Like the Metropolitan. I couldn’t make anything that was in there. But the MoMa has paintings that look like I child could make it. How could I be immersed, by the known? </p>

<p>And yeah, I think that stuff is money laundering for sure. Adam ruins everything, and a few other people have made decent videos about it. </p>

Some of them may have been simply because he wanted them, because he is a billionaire, but at the same time, the money laundering question popped up in my head too... </p>

<p>A Veblen good is a luxury item whose price does not follow the usual laws of supply and demand. Usually, the higher the price of a particular good the less people will want it. For luxury goods, such as very expensive wines, watches or cars, however, the item becomes more desirable as it grows more expensive and less desirable should it drop in price.&quot;</p>

<p>Someone smart with money would not leave their investment up to an auction to clean their money where they could easily lose a significant sum. They would buy something that has a steady resale value like real estate or a fixed cost like owning a service business. </p>

<p>Source: I had a friend that was well connected and he bought expensive art because he liked nice art. His money was cleaned well before he purchased any art.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t believe how people still don&#39;t understand how this really works.  Here, I&#39;ll break it down eli5 style.</p>

<p>You have a child you want to sell as a sex slave.  The going rate is 200k.  Big Billy wants to purchase the child, he has the money, but can&#39;t just put money in your account because it&#39;ll just show a TX for 200k and would raise a red flag in the bank.</p>

<p>So, you buy a smearing of dogshit on canvas for next to nothing.  Put it up for auction.  You have a couple of plants at the auction and Big Billy is there too.  Between them they push the price up to 200k (or slightly over to cover auction house cost).  Big Billy wins the painting and behind the scenes you throw in the child as a freebie.  </p>

<p>The records clearly show a fully legitimate purchase of a painting for 200k.  No red flags and no link to purchasing his sex slave.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a simple process. You could just as easily use eBay. Find something that&#39;s almost worthless, but let everyone in your little network know it&#39;s for high quality cocaine.  You advertise a worthless hairbrush, it sells for $60, you send the winner a gram of coke and a hairbrush.  Keeps all the money legit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt some people use art as a cover for illegal exchanges of money.  </p>

<p>But modern art does actually fetch a pretty price when you find the right buyer.  I have a friend who paints abstract art that sells for $1,200 a piece.  I personally think the paintings are pretty good, but I know many people would say it just looks like someone vomited on the canvas.  Those prices scale up even higher as you get more popular.  Collectors pay millions of dollars for this stuff as a status symbol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is much harder than that in my experience in the art world/community. </p>

<p>easiest way would make a similar body of work - 20 to 50 pieces - and have them professionally photographed. then contact as many mass-producing print sellers (check the tiny distributor names on prints at your local boutique frame shops) and tell them you&#39;re interested in selling rights to your images, preferably contractual so you get repeat business with them. this method does not require a degree in fine arts, gallery representation, exhibition history, etc </p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>if you want to make the big bucks, be born rich, get an MFA from a university with a respected college of art (not the expensive ones though because there will be a heap of suspicion in your early career that you just paid for it in lieu of actual ability). being successful in the art world is 85% who you know, 5% ability, 10% conceptual and philosophical understanding. get to know the zeitgeist and conceptually align your shtick to the cultural flow - like how identity politics and intersectionality has reigned for the last 10 years or so (its shifting now, finally). give artist talks as much as you can, meet and sell yourself, apply for grants and artist residencies - especially ones that engage the community (free publicity). do this for 10 years and THEN you&#39;ll finally be able to sell your work for five figures or more. galleries generally take 50% and famous galleries take the first $xx,xxx in sales and 50% after that. those numbers are negotiable once you become a B-list or higher artist though. A-list artists may even sell directly at an auction house, though it will likely draw ire from the industry at large.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The movie is one thing. How much do you like uma? Some have uma in bruce Lee yellow jump suit. Another level would be to have uma in her panties in red shoes. Another level would be to have artwork where she is tied up.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I mean when I say podesta level creep. He has art depicting children not just holding umbrellas and puppies, but in sick perverted twisted ways that reveal his depravation and possibly (not undeniably) his wicked behavior behind the scenes. . . It&#39;s not the evidence itself. The evidence is on him in other ways.  . . Perhaps in incriminating emails and paper trails. But this thread is about the art connection.</p>
