    <div class="md"><p>This is accurate and is currently used in computing.  Quantum entanglement is this thing.  Even Einstein called it “spooky” action at a distance, because it’s pretty flipping extraordinary.</p>

<p>Assuming we could only travel back to the point where a time machine was first created, would it be possible to somehow “push” that creation date back sooner, to be able to travel back further and further?  The repercussions in time would look like technology seeming to advance at a more rapid pace than previously.  </p>

<p>I’m curious what you think, but I’m also going to vomit my theory :)</p>

<p>It may be impossible to physically travel further back than time machine creation, but it may be possible to mentally travel back further, since the mind is not necessarily bound by the same physical laws of the universe.  See also: what is mind/thought/psyche/consciousness/the all?  In this way, we could spark inspiration for scientists earlier in hopes they’ll advance technology sooner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It raises an interesting question that I have long wondered about in regards to whatever the true nature of &quot;reality&quot; itself is. </p>

<p>The possibility that things aren&#39;t actually located in the same  physical spaces we perceive them to be at all but rather &quot;in Time&quot; instead, and that the physical spaces all the versions of them throughout their entire existence from start to finish exist and are constantly folding and unfolding themselves throughout and across an expanse of that Time, just as we ourselves are. </p>

<p>So we leave a place and return to it as a future versions of ourselves to future versions of that location that the way we physically perceive it hides all the folding and unfolding three dimensional spaces by how very rapidly they pass or rather by how very rapidly our consciousness passes through them and in doing so makes that folding and unfolding happen as we do.</p>

<p>I was led to that idea when I was struck by the thought that &quot;animation&quot;, and by that I mean the real kind that applies to living world around us isn&#39;t any more possible in a single three dimensional frame of space than we can artificially create it in any single two dimensional one and have to resort to a stream of such frames that pass swiftly enough that they aren&#39;t seen, either.</p>

<p>Something to muse about or ponder for any so inclined.</p>

<p>Time does not exist. It is as real as the number &quot;1&quot; is real. It&#39;s an imaginary tool to organize real phenomena, as they unfold for our perceptions to make sense of, with our advanced ape brains. We call it space-time for a reason. It&#39;s because time is really just a descriptor of space. There are scientists that view time as the 4th dimension, as a temporal dimension, but there&#39;s really no such thing, at least not how I can see it. Time moves in one direction. First of all, spaces don&#39;t move, they are not directional, they just are. However, lines connecting two points can be directional, if you draw an arrow for one of the points. In physics that would be a representation of velocity, which is a spatial descriptor of acceleration, which occurs over time. </p>

<p><strong>Imagine our 3 dimensions as a single point in space, 0 dimensions</strong>. Now draw a line connecting that point to another point. Now draw an arrow. Now we went from zero dimensions, to one dimension, and it has a trajectory. Time is not the next dimension, time is the trajectory of our three dimensions. The next dimension is the line on which we are traveling, and the one beyond that is a geometric shape (two dimensions), minimally a circle. The dimension beyond that is a sphere (three dimensions). Correspondingly, we have our three dimensions as a point, the line is the 4th dimension, the circle is the 5th dimension, and the sphere is the 6th dimension, and everything we perceive is nothing more than a single point, moving in a linear trajectory, in that vast expanse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously someone thought all of those extra dimensions up and must have had some kind of a rationale for their existence to be necessary, but at that level almost anything becomes possible. </p>

<p>We are stuck with only being able to imagine or visualize and describe objects in a physical space and have a tough enough time as it is dealing with invisible &quot;forces&quot; and &quot;energies&quot; at our own level as it is. Things with some undefinable form but no substance by which we discern what that form is.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with the work of D.B. Larson or his theory that it&#39;s a &quot;Universe of Motion&quot; and that everything can be determined and defined in terms of &quot;motion&quot; including some of the most perplexing questions that science is faced with. He was as most engineers are, a very sharp, practical and extremely intelligent fellow.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not familiar with that, but it seems quite insightful at a glance, I&#39;ll have to look further into it.</p>

<p>Yeah all this is speculation of course, but this study is at the forefront of mathematics and physics. We are only just now breaking down the concepts phenomenologically and projecting what little we can. It&#39;s fascinating stuff to say the least. I&#39;d say, phenomena like quantum tunneling are artifacts of the higher dimensions. In what way, we do not know, but by all means, quantum tunneling should not be possible. There is no rational explanation, it simply defies our fundamental explanations of reality. You&#39;re talking about subatomic particles becoming waves out of nowhere to teleport across things they shouldn&#39;t be able to teleport across, and while they are waves, they literally exist at two places at once. This is observed as a copy of the particle appearing having teleported prior to the disappearing of the particle from its place it teleported from. I get that this is largely linked to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, but this facet of wave particle duality is still inexplicable nonetheless. We know it happens, but have no explanation as to why it happens.</p>

<p>You have to be moving at near the speed of light (C) for relativistic effects to occur.</p>

<p>You need an amount of energy near equal to that contained in the entire universe to accelerate any mass to near light speed.</p>

<p>Mass is multiplied as you accelerate so more and more and more energy has to be put into the system to try and reach light speed so it is impossible to accelerate any mass to near light speed due to energy limitations.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not proof though. They could have simply observed a discrepancy, say the atomic clock in space is +0.000002 ms faster than the clock on Earth, so they apply a constant (fudge factor) of -0.000002 to that space clock and now they know it matches up. This doesn&#39;t &quot;prove&quot; time moves slower on Earth.</p>

<p>Have they done actual tests, such as having several atomic clocks positioned different distances from the Earth, and then comparing all the readings to discover some kind of distance-to-time ratio or formula? And did they try it with satellites orbiting other celestial bodies, not just Earth? Now that would be getting closer to a proof. Because there could be other things or conditions in low Earth orbit which affect atoms in ways we don&#39;t yet understand, causing the &quot;appearance&quot; of time moving faster because of an unknown effect on the atoms.</p>

<p>So as you approach a black hole time slows down, and as you escape a black hole time speeds up?</p>

<p>Our solar system orbits around the Milky Way which is thought to have a black hole at the center. It takes 230 million years to do so. If the orbit is not perfectly circular, there would be times when the solar system is closer or further from the black hole, which would cause some sort of time expansion/crunch? Does anything correllate with this slow but sure time discrepancy, such as geography or archaeology records I wonder.</p>

<p>Yeah. General relativity has been very thoroughly tested many times. Of course this isn&#39;t really time travel, it&#39;s just that time isn&#39;t absolute, but can seem to move forward at different rates. Still moves forward, though.</p>

<p>&quot;Such time dilation has been repeatedly demonstrated, for instance by small disparities in a pair of atomic clocks after one of them is sent on a space trip, or by clocks on the Space Shuttle running slightly slower than reference clocks on Earth, or clocks on GPS and Galileo satellites running slightly faster.&quot;</p>

<p>If you went very very fast but not quite the speed of light, you can turn the time dilation up as fast as you like.  For example, if you wanted one day to elapse for you for each year elapsed at home, you&#39;d have to travel at 99.86% of the speed of light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignoring all of the normal paradoxes and science. You&#39;re going to have multiple answers depending on multiple factors.  </p>

<p>Number 1 - Is the time travel device stationary in time or does the device move itself through time. There is the one we are familiar with, the one where the time traveling device moves itself through time, like the Back to the Future Delorian (a Time Vessel), you sometimes see a rarer type, one where the device stays in place in normal time and sends a traveler back in time like the device on SyFy&#39;s 12 Monkeys (a Time Projector).  </p>

<p>Number 2 - Does the Time Machine require something unavailable today like Exotic Matter, Strange Matter, Dark Matter, or any of the other theoretical matters and there are theoretical forms of Energy as well.   </p>

<p>Number 3 - The universe might have some sort self corrective mechanism to avoid paradoxes, large or small. This could remove knowledge of how to construct one through unknown means.  </p>

<p>Number 4 - There is a theory that Time Travel doesn&#39;t work until it&#39;s made.  </p>

<p>If 4 is the case, then no, time travel isn&#39;t possible right now<br/>
If 3 is the case, then while it might be possible right now, you couldn&#39;t get hold of a time travel machine or the knowledge of how to build one. Perhaps even the knowledge OF one. Meaning you could be running into Time Travelers all the time.<br/>
If 2 is the case, then while we might be able to make or have time travel, it might be only TO us from the future as we can&#39;t supply the energy needed.<br/>
If 1 is the case and it&#39;s a Time Projector we could have travelers come to use, they might even be able to be retrieved, but we couldn&#39;t capture one.  </p>

<p>Obviously you could combine different ones to get specific types. You could have a Time Vessel that needs to be plugged into a special energy source or use a particular type of fuel and that fuel is only available past a certain date.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of theories on how it should go, but I think the most likely scenario is it creates a separate timeline like a tree branching out. I also think time travel can only go in one direction, into the future; which is why if time travel did exist(&gt;1 year) we wouldn&#39;t have any idea of it in the present. So back to the tree example, it would be like a dying tree branch redirecting its growth in a new branch that has sprouted from it. It carries all the DNA of the dying branch but it can never look back.  </p>

<p>Of course I&#39;m no physicist, but I think this goes more in line with the theory that time can only move in one direction from our conscious point of view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its called a space time continuum.Meaning as time moves forward the space changes. Our planet, spins, with forces interplay with other planets around the sun, hurtling through space around the milky way, whilst the milky way moves through space. When that is accounted for, we still have the issue of microplay of all the internal forces of the planet and how it warps due to interplay with other planets and moons and the sun. </p>

<p>Then because space itself is not a uniform density and possibly also expands contracts (dark matter). This means that time travel will only be possible once either two machines are linked, or the mathematics of finding the location to move the time to or time to move the space to, will never be known until humanity has gone intergalactic. Meaning they can have exact relative position of the point in space wit respect to time (accounting for all forces in the universe). </p>

<p>Going back in time totime before such precision, is impossible as in no way can we know where the earth was in respect to its current position on a cosmic scale. When two machines are built, it will need to be linked so that space is not a factor. </p>

<p>If we are talking multidimensional theory, then time travel will not be within the single universe. </p>

<p>We will be able to suspend cells and make people travel forward in time with respect to their own perception. </p>

<p>But classic space time travel will not be possible until we have intergalactic ships, some sort of spaceal travel device/mechanics to make &#39;space&#39;-time travel. then the time travel will need to use the space component to place itself in right coordinates of space. </p>

<p>Now why cant it be done, because even now our physical position in space is moving, as mentioned in first para. until we can accurately do that, slipping a new entety into space time is impossible to do backwards. (then there is the whole issue of creating a spacial matter, creating a void to substitute the matter from another time/space. (thats like splitting the nucleus for nuclear bombs level of tech, we just dont know what will happen) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s... certainly a lot of words. But a lot of it doesn&#39;t make sense. Let me just say:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what a space-time continuum is. A continuum is a mathematical construct similar to the real numbers. A space-time continuum is a 4 dimensional combination of normal 3D space with a time dimension.</p>

If travelling to the past was possible though, then it would most likely only be possible to only go back as far into the past as when the travelling device was created. However, if this were true, you could argue that an advanced alien race created a time travelling device in the past and you could use it to travel as far back in time as to when there&#39;s was first created.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s possible for time travel in the future, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s possible in the present. Likely something has to happen to make it possible. For example, with specially-made wormholes you could go backwards, but not to before the wormhole was made.</p>

<p>Also, it may be possible to look backwards in time but not to travel backwards. Worse, any effort to actually travel backwards could result in becoming out of sync with existence-- you could end up unable to see, hear, or even breathe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and No. </p>

<p>We all share a general frame rate in time and space due to our relationship with earth. </p>

<p>Rate of frames experienced per second are therefore similar to us all. Yet, when traveling +lightspeed, ones frame rate is equal to <strong>-1 = 1 x T</strong> </p>

<p>I think timeloops are often created re erasing and installing information via a frequency vibration similar to a mandela effect. We cant experience it unless we are the party creating the change. This loop will take place only for the &#39;fixer&#39;. Its a hyper frequency within the standard matrix of time and space. Everyone past the observer&#39;s point of space will see reality B. Everyone withins realities become A B
Everyone before lived on plane A. </p>

<p>It is a literal loop maybe taking hundreds of years to complete. </p>

<p>I imagine its seen as a gravity wave striking the planet. A simple flash which will upset the earths frequency enough to transmutate it between paradoxes. </p>

<p>What might seem instantaneous to an outside observer likely would appear instantaneously to those that experienced it on earth. </p>

<p>Probably the &quot;hyperstate&quot;. </p>

Gas, liquid, solid, fusion, and hyper-</p>

<p>Hyper being of multiple frequencies which allow them to resonate in and out of our various states of existence (in time)-</p>
