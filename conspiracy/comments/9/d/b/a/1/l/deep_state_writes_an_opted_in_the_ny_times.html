<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><em>The Times today is taking the rare step of publishing an anonymous Op-Ed essay. We have done so at the request of the author, a senior official in the Trump administration whose identity is known to us and whose job would be jeopardized by its disclosure. We believe publishing this essay anonymously is the only way to deliver an important perspective to our readers. We invite you to submit a question about the essay or our vetting process</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/reader-center/oped-questions.html"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>President Trump is facing a test to his presidency unlike any faced by a modern American leader.</p>

<p>It’s not just that the special counsel looms large. Or that the country is bitterly divided over Mr. Trump’s leadership. Or even that his party might well lose the House to an opposition hellbent on his downfall.</p>

<p>The dilemma — which he does not fully grasp — is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.</p>

<p>I would know. I am one of them.</p>

<p>To be clear, ours is not the popular “resistance” of the left. We want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous.</p>

<p>But we believe our first duty is to this country, and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic.</p>

<p>That is why many Trump appointees have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/us/politics/woodward-trump-book-fear.html?module=Uisil">vowed to do what we can</a> to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.</p>

<p>The root of the problem is the president’s amorality. Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making.</p>

<p>Although he was elected as a Republican, the president shows little affinity for ideals long espoused by conservatives: free minds, free markets and free people. At best, he has invoked these ideals in scripted settings. At worst, he has attacked them outright.</p>

<p>In addition to his mass-marketing of the notion that the press is the “enemy of the people,” President Trump’s impulses are generally anti-trade and anti-democratic.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. There are bright spots that the near-ceaseless negative coverage of the administration fails to capture: effective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military and more.</p>

<p>But these successes have come despite — not because of — the president’s leadership style, which is impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.</p>

<p>From the White House to executive branch departments and agencies, senior officials will privately admit their daily disbelief at the commander in chief’s comments and actions. Most are working to insulate their operations from his whims.</p>

<p>Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails, he engages in repetitive rants, and his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back.</p>

<p>“There is literally no telling whether he might change his mind from one minute to the next,” a top official complained to me recently, exasperated by an Oval Office meeting at which the president flip-flopped on a major policy decision he’d made only a week earlier.</p>

<p>The erratic behavior would be more concerning if it weren’t for unsung heroes in and around the White House. Some of his aides have been cast as villains by the media. But in private, they have gone to great lengths to keep bad decisions contained to the West Wing, though they are clearly not always successful.</p>

<p>It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room. We fully recognize what is happening. And we are trying to do what’s right even when Donald Trump won’t.</p>

<p>The result is a two-track presidency.</p>

<p>Take foreign policy: In public and in private, President Trump shows a preference for autocrats and dictators, such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and displays little genuine appreciation for the ties that bind us to allied, like-minded nations.</p>

<p>Astute observers have noted, though, that the rest of the administration is operating on another track, one where countries like Russia are called out for meddling and punished accordingly, and where allies around the world are engaged as peers rather than ridiculed as rivals.</p>

<p>On Russia, for instance, the president was reluctant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/world/europe/trump-russia-diplomats-expulsion.html">to expel</a> so many of Mr. Putin’s spies as punishment for the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. He complained for weeks about senior staff members letting him get boxed into further confrontation with Russia, and he expressed frustration that the United States continued to impose sanctions on the country for its malign behavior. But his national security team knew better — such actions had to be taken, to hold Moscow accountable.</p>

<p>This isn’t the work of the so-called deep state. It’s the work of the steady state.</p>

<p>Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment, which would start a complex process for removing the president. But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis. So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until — one way or another — it’s over.</p>

<p>The bigger concern is not what Mr. Trump has done to the presidency but rather what we as a nation have allowed him to do to us. We have sunk low with him and allowed our discourse to be stripped of civility.</p>

<p>Senator John McCain put it best in his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/us/politics/john-mccain-farewell-statement.html">farewell letter</a>. All Americans should heed his words and break free of the tribalism trap, with the high aim of uniting through our shared values and love of this great nation.</p>

<p>We may no longer have Senator McCain. But we will always have his example — a lodestar for restoring honor to public life and our national dialogue. Mr. Trump may fear such honorable men, but we should revere them.</p>

<p>There is a quiet resistance within the administration of people choosing to put country first. But the real difference will be made by everyday citizens rising above politics, reaching across the aisle and resolving to shed the labels in favor of a single one: Americans.</p>

<p>This is a pretty substantial anonymous source, as far as anonymous sources go. It&#39;s not just &quot;An anonymous source says...&quot; or &quot;An anonymous source who says he&#39;s close to the matter&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say the real question would be if the events the source says are true, or if they&#39;re making it up for their own political gain. But yeah, I trust that the source is who they say they are. </p>

<p>Well to me it seems that &quot;record numbers&quot; is more of a talking point because most graphs show steady progress from the Obama era. You seem to not like this.</p>

<p><strong><em>Trump</em></strong> is the person referencing unemployment numbers, so are his followers but confronted with a graph of unemployment and the simple task to mark where Trump did the magic you flinch. What is it now is his record low unemployment relevant or not. Trump appears to think so.</p>

<p>Yeah that is all nice and dandy but you referenced record breaking numbers. The record-breaking number Trump referenced the most is unemployment and you immediately stopped caring about those numbers the moment you saw a graph. So which record numbers are you speaking off and if we look at graphs will we find the same phenomenon of steady improvement under Obama in Trump reign?</p>

<p>Btw Trump said unemployment is as high as 4x% in 2016, do you believe he created dozens of millions jobs within months? Or are his number &quot;skewed&quot;?</p>

<p>What happens the next time a staffer seeks to dissuade the president from, say, purging the Justice Department to shut down the Mueller investigation? The author of the Times op-ed has explicitly told the president that those who offer such advice do not have the president’s best interests at heart, and are, in fact, actively subverting his best interests as he understands them on behalf of ideas of their own.</p>

<p>He’ll grow more defiant, more reckless, more anti-constitutional, and more dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually my impression from interviews that he is dumb. Not the mentally challenged dumb, but the kind of dumb that gets you clobbered in discussions with actually smart people. I watched quite a number of them because I find them facinating and noticed that he is completely unable to show depth of knowledge about any subjects he talks about. Everything is platitudes and superficial stuff. Rambling in circle about talking points. He appears to have no deep understanding of anything he talks about. So to me what all those &quot;anonymous&quot; sources say mirrors completely what I feel when I see him. Like an old &quot;dumb&quot; person who finessed a style that overcomes the lack of knowledge. Ask him about the atomit weapons and he starts &quot;my xyz was professor of nucular, nucular is powerful, I will be careful with nucular, I can&#39;t go into detail but it will be great, believe me&quot;. He does this with everything he can&#39;t answer anything with depth. But that is besides the point.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sure sure but you deflect a bit. Let us not play silly. You don&#39;t believe that all of them lied or are made up or some stuff? The question is why all of those sources centre around him being a mongrel. Do you think they orchestrated this? Normally this common theme would lend credibility to the claims, wouldn&#39;t it? Many different people from different angles describe him as an idiot. Like I said you really don&#39;t want to face the question. I believe you that you believe he is not dumb but have you ever seen a politician having so many people come out in different styles over years to say the person is straight up a moron? Take his  ghostwriter, yeah sure you believe he is fake or whatnot, ok but he aswell had the major theme, Trump is an amoral mongrel. That is the same what the times article says. Isn&#39;t that fascinating? </p>

<p>Like I said it is not about your explanation why he is totally smart. I wonder what your explanation is for so many people always describing how he is an idiot. They don&#39;t say he is &quot;evil&quot;, he wants to destroy the US, they also don&#39;t say he committed treason. All of them say he is a dimwit.</p>

<p>maybe we should talk about the low unemployment number? </p>

<p>Lowest unemployment since 1969
Lowest Black unemployment ever
Lowest Hispanic unemployment ever
Lowest Female unemployment ever</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, ask the Amazon worker who has to piss in a bottle on the work line and needs food stamps to eat about that number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because Amazon is subsidized by taxpayers.

<p>That&#39;s some sideways BS logic right there. For the record I hate Obama and Trump equally. Enjoy the coolaid while it lasts.</p>

<p>Colluding with foreign nations, threatening to jail political opponents and attacking a free internet, a free press and our rights to protest and speech is most definitely treason though. </p>
