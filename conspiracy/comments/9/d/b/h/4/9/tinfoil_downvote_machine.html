<p>I&#39;ll certainly bring it up (and then pass it on).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what they are gonna do (squat) but I think it&#39;s a new test of the digital <em>teams</em> that are using the BK SCOTUS hearing as a demo to fine tune things.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my same-room view of it but admittedly I also need to distance myself and walk around and consider other perspectives.  </p>

<p>The next thing to do is identify any trends.  Is it subreddit wide? Focused on threads? Users? <em>Kinds</em> of threads?</p>

<p>for some reason (tinfoil abound) the reddit admins do nothing and let groups like TMOR continue to openly do it, and at times it seems like they even support the cock suckers.</p>
