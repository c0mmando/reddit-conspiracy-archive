       This is something I don't see talked about much, which should be fairly obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every immigrant, legal or illegal, needs somewhere to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the boomers getting older and eventually dying off, they and their families would be selling off their houses. And since there are a lot less Gen Z babies being born, there would be more houses available than people who need them. This would mean an increase supply and a decrease in demand, which would lower the prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, with millions of people pouring in, demand increases and prices do not go not down.

       SS - I see a lot of people complain about housing prices, but I see very few people addressing the root cause of it - millions of people coming in to replace the older people dying off. The US has added 47 million immigrants since 2000 and those people need places to live. Without them, we would see atleast 20 million or so places go up for sale and rent, bringing down the prices.

      <p>
       "The majority of baby boom household dissolutions will not take place until after 2030. It will not be until 2060 or later that the last of the baby boomers, born in the early 1960s, will die. Between now and 2030, new construction will still be needed to meet the housing demand from the large cohorts under the age of 30 that are currently in the pipeline, and which will be further inflated by any future immigration. Where that housing will be located and what it will look like is far less certain."

       I'm a landlord myself and most will tell you that they'd rather have more wealthy people in their places. That way even if they do destroy the place, the extra they pay in rent will be able to cover damages, whereas when you get a situation like I had. I had a tenant in one of my places who didn't pay. This person played every game possible with the legal system and ended up getting to live for free for 8 months. It has taken an additional 4 months to clean up all the damage this person did, so now I'm out 12 months. And when I go to sue this person, even when I win, this person isn't going to be sitting on the now 5 figure fee that they owe me to pay me.

       This rings very true for where I'm working at right now. There is an extremely large Hispanic presence here. Greeley CO has insanely high rental prices for such a shitty city. There is nothing to support these exorbitant prices. A 2br 1 bath place costs roughly 1200-1400/month yet the wages here dont support that in the least. I live in Florida a half mile from the water in a very desirable location and 1200-1400/month will get you a beautiful 4br 2.5bath home in a great neighborhood.

       My retired mom just moved from San Antonio to Loveland to be close to my aunt and it seems unless you're into winter sports and are likely a trust funder there isn't much there. There are zero jobs in my field even in neighboring Fort Collins, most of the jobs seem to be low paying customer service shit. My 65-year-old aunt just got a job at Walmart. Most rents in Loveland seem to be in the $1200 range on up.

       Loveland and Greeley are night and day. Fort Collins is insanely expensive compared to the other two.  Go to the walmart on 23rd ave in Greeley on a Sunday. Youd think you were in San Antonio. Nothing at all against the Hispanic community but there is definitely an insanely large influx of immigrants to the area. I work with them every day and they all have stories of migrating here.

       The Powers That Be are artificially keeping real estate prices high . . . and it's hurting millennials. After the 2008 financial crash (precipitated by the real estate market), the Federal Reserve raced to come up with ways to artificially prop up housing prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       In the actual free market (which we no longer have), housing prices are tied to demographic trends. As a population ages (as it is in Japan and the West) people downsize when their kids move out, or they die and their houses go on the market. This glut of houses has a deflationary effect, and the price of houses goes down. This is good for the younger generation, because now they can buy in.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Federal Reserve panicked, knowing that millions of pensions are tied to inflated real estate valuations. If the price of real estate goes down, then people's pensions will be hurt. The average American will feel poorer, both in terms of his pension and his net worth (as his house shrinks in value).
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Solution? Pump trillions of dollars into the real estate market. And use mass migration to place criminal aliens into as much housing as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       No units can remain empty.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Fill them all!'
      </p>
      <p>
       There's only one problem (and it's a huge one). Because the Baby Boomers don't want to take a hit to their pension funds, Millennials are priced out of housing and stocks (which are also artificially inflated). They can no longer buy into the system, as they could have under the normal business cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Fed doesn't believe in organic business cycles and capitalism. It believes in corporate socialism and controlled economies.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       What they're doing now is claiming that we don't have to have business cycles . . . which is like a doctor convincing you that pooping is a thing of the past. "Just eat and eat and eat. There will be absolutely no health implications if you never poop again!"
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       (Under those conditions, the patient will of course die as the toxins build up in his system.)
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Without the business cycle, we can never flush out the toxic assets and get real price discovery. And, sociologically, we're screwing over the upcoming generation, who are all living in their parents' basements because they can't afford a house.

       CO has seen a massive influx of Texans and Californias over the past 5 years.  They bring Californian and Texas money and pay CA &amp; TX prices.

       That's probably the primary factor in the increase to you cost of living.
