<p>It&#39;s possible it&#39;s just rich, famous people getting together but Mac Miller was admittedly different during and after dating Grande. Same goes for most who date some of these women. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;n swayed to think she was also someone who was about/started to expose what has happened to her within the industry and the others she witnessed get abused etc. I know my original list of things to do with her wasnt all of it, but maybe its all to make sure she is kept silenced ? and maybe she was forced to split with Mac over similar reasons ?? if they keep stripping her of everything she wont bother to fight back</p>

<p>this is all theory, of course. i definately believe there has been some sort of mind control</p>
