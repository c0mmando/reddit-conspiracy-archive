       She’s a MK Ultra Beta Kitten so I’m not sure the powers to be are trying to silence her.. maybe they want to silence those in their circle who know her truth (this is, she being a Beta Kitten Monarch Slave for the Illuminati/Reptilians)

       There are many "roles" and many "layers" to MK programming. The article I'm gonna link will take you down a very deep, very dark rabbit hole. But buried within its copious information is an expansion to the answers which you seek.

       I've always theorized those like Britney Spears, Madonna, Ariana Grande, the Kardashians, etc are used to help break down those who get fame but haven't necessarily been brought into the inner circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible it's just rich, famous people getting together but Mac Miller was admittedly different during and after dating Grande. Same goes for most who date some of these women.

       For real...honestly its pissing me off that people keep blaming her without actually looking into the matter. Mac had done a couple interviews since their breakup discussing how it wasnt a big deal they broke up. Life goes on and he wasnt upset.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you bring up Ariana being targeted but dont even include the time fuckint bombs exploded in the crowd in London while she was performing? Stfu you dont know shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm very much willing to entertain a articulated response but you're grasping at straws here. Fucking ridiculous. Let them man RIP you probably never even listened to Mac besides Donald Trump when it blew up years ago. Sheesh

       I'n swayed to think she was also someone who was about/started to expose what has happened to her within the industry and the others she witnessed get abused etc. I know my original list of things to do with her wasnt all of it, but maybe its all to make sure she is kept silenced ? and maybe she was forced to split with Mac over similar reasons ?? if they keep stripping her of everything she wont bother to fight back
      </p>
      <p>
       this is all theory, of course. i definately believe there has been some sort of mind control

       Just stay away from her, she is dangerous. Don't go to her concerts, don't listen to her music (it sucks anyway), don't read interviews with her. Same for most of those hollywood people. They're sick, evil and have no morals. Stop the fucking celebrity worship.

       Nah, she's just a tool who drugs herself all the time to escape what she's been put through. No different than many predecessors before her. She's too incapacitated and in deep to stand up for much.

       For real...honestly its pissing me off that people keep blaming her without actually looking into the matter. Mac had done a couple interviews since their breakup discussing how it wasnt a big deal they broke up. Life goes on and he wasnt upset.
