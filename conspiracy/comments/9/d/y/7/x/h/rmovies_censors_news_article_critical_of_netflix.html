<p>The article pointed out that Netflix removed its user review platform because of the increasingly bad reviews their content was receiving.</p>

<p>The top comments were are all in unanimous agreement that the quality of Netflix original content has been declining drastically over the years.</p>

<p>It is apparent that the mods have censored this because they are Netflix/Hollywood shills.</p>

<p>This type of censoring is rampant across all of Reddit.</p>

<p>No, it hasn&#39;t been. It&#39;s literally at the top of the (un-pinned) page <a href="https://i.imgur.com/HsKDCnO.jpg">right now</a>, followed by a second thread criticizing Netflix, hours after you made this post. All they did was tag the article as misleading (which is true, it&#39;s an unverified report).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s apparent that you rushed here with a narrative and didn&#39;t even bother to check to see if it was accurate. Neither did many of the people commenting in this thread. They just took your claim at face value, even though it&#39;s demonstrably false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much every single time a post gets removed and someone posts about it here, as long as the post was eventually reinstated by the mods some dickhole will come in here and claim the post was never removed by the mods. Despite this bullshit eventually getting corrected most of the time, these users persist in lying about how the mods never removed the posts that get talked about here. </p>

<p>In my humble opinion, these persistent lying, moderator-supporting user accounts who do this are moderator alt accounts. They come in here to lie straight to our faces every time. </p>

<p>That right there is proof the post was removed by the mods when OP said it was. The fact that the mods had to reinstate the post after there was backlash doesn&#39;t mean the post was never removed. </p>
