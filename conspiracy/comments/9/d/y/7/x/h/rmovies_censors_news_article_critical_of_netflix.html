       The article pointed out that Netflix removed its user review platform because of the increasingly bad reviews their content was receiving.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top comments were are all in unanimous agreement that the quality of Netflix original content has been declining drastically over the years.

      <p>
       It is apparent that the mods have censored this because they are Netflix/Hollywood shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       This type of censoring is rampant across all of Reddit.

       It's becoming increasingly obvious that anything on the top 100 (And likely more) is carefully curated content. Instead of feeling like I'm browsing peoples creations and thoughts, I feel like I'm browsing the @reddit instagram feed where everything is there on purpose.

       90% of the content on the former default subs that hits the front page is propaganda or content being pushed by advertisers. Anything that goes against the narrative or advertisers will be removed. It is very naive to think the 3rd most popular internet site in the country would be immune to the practice that the rest of the internet profits off of.
      </p>
      <p>
       The covert advertising on this site will only get worse as Reddit gets closer to an IPO.

       <em>
        never

       related to reviews, it was just how much Netflix thinks you'd like the show. They replaced it with a percentage, because people (rightly) thought the stars were a rating system.

       Pretty much every single time a post gets removed and someone posts about it here, as long as the post was eventually reinstated by the mods some dickhole will come in here and claim the post was never removed by the mods. Despite this bullshit eventually getting corrected most of the time, these users persist in lying about how the mods never removed the posts that get talked about here.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my humble opinion, these persistent lying, moderator-supporting user accounts who do this are moderator alt accounts. They come in here to lie straight to our faces every time.

       That right there is proof the post was removed by the mods when OP said it was. The fact that the mods had to reinstate the post after there was backlash doesn't mean the post was never removed.

       Fuck netflix. I canceled when they came out with Bill Nye and his provocative show feating songs about sex and eating ass. His interview claiming his show was suitable for 12 year olds was my last straw. Canceled.

       No matter how hard Netflix tries, they aren't going to be able to hide the fact that 98% of Netflix Originals are steaming piles of excrement.
