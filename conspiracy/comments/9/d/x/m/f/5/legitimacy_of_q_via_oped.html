       If this Op-ed is truth and not a psyop by either sides (whether it be John Barron, or the intelligence community), would this give any legitimacy of the existence of Q. At the very least, the fact that this individual claims to be apart of a secret cabal against Trump, it lends validity to these Qultists to believe the antithesis; that there is a secret cabal "draining the swamp".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a consequence of releasing that Op-Ed is that now Qultists can go ,"See! See!", whether or not they actually formulated the true nature of either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I still think Q is CIA, and this Op-ed is Trump Admin. This is just my own skeptical perspective, not a decision based upon consequence. But I'm curious about others opinions on this topic.

       S.S.: The recently released Op-ed should raise questions about this entire Q debate. To me, it only gives higher odds to an already low chance of Q having

        any

       Jack Posobiec has reported on Q recently. Apparently, a guy called Microchip says that he created Q but passed it on to some other people in November last year. He has released Discord chat logs from last year where he is talking about it and they're planning on what to put in the Q "drops"

       If anything, I am asking you to keep an open mind, check out Jack Posobiecs tweets and video on it, the posts made by Microchip on Gab and then make your own mind up.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone uploads a picture to Twitter, does it retain the original filename? Even if it does, what does it conclusively prove? Does Trump have sole control over his tweets or do staffers tweet stuff as well? What if they are aware of the conspiracy and just want to keep it going because it benefits Trump? What if Q is someone close to Trump but they are bullshitting us (i.e. it's a psy-op)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you even consider the possibility that it may not be true and what that would mean? That there may not be this heroic group secretly fighting and winning? That we may have to get off our asses and try to improve things ourselves?

       Here are some links to check out and what information has been provided. Q and the followers seem to have gone into overdrive to try and debunk this (with Q accusing them of being Mossad!). Microchip also says he has more proof which he will release in the future. He says he's letting Q dig his own grave by trying to debunk the current accusations.

       He recorded his iPhone screen and showed his Discord chat logs from August 2017 to October 2017. They are linking to their 4chan Q posts and discussing what they should post next based on how much traction the other various 4chan "insiders" and topics got.

       Microchip has issued a challenge to Q:

      <p>
       He linked to a Q post on 4chan, from 28th October 2017. 
Apparently, the ID of each post on 4chan is created from the IP address. 
Microchip has issued the challenge - post again from the same IP address (so that the post ID matches the one from 28th Oct 17) to prove that he is in fact the same person who posted 28th Oct 17.
Microchip claims that he was the one who posted it, before he passed Q on to whoever is running it now. 
He says that he used a throwaway VPN when posting so Q won't be able to post again from the IP address.

       I've come to my own conclusion about Q. Should the time arise that Q is undeniable, I'll deal with it then. At this time Qs nature is irrelevant (for me). As it pertains to this discussion, I am looking for discussion on the ramifications this Op-ed may have.

       The way it's worded and the spin that the news organizations have put forth would have you think it's a cabal. I'd probably agree with you, but my question still remains.
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't his coworkers. Even if what they are doing is the right thing to do, they are still undermining him as a collective effort. No matter the justification, Trump is actively being sabotaged from whatever agenda he may have, covertly.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I understand the extraordinary nature of Q and his/their claims. Even still, the idea of a camp for, and a camp against, remains the same. So my question persists.

       I don't even think it's that deep. Trump isn't bright enough to have a serious agenda. There isn't much to undermine, I think they're are just trying to put out the small fires this buffoon causes every single day with his own stupidity.

       Listen I can agree to that, but the simple fact is that Trump holds an office and is not receiving what is to be expected of his staff,
       <em>
        regardless of his actions or behavior
       </em>
       . Removing a paper that Trump intended to sign is subversion, no matter through which lens you view it; even if for the betterment of this country. That's all I mean by undermined.

       All of it is theatre to keep the masses both divided amongst themselves while simultaneously supporting TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s like both entrenching Q types and Trump supporters who will see it as validation and it gets everyone else to basically support the idea of a deep state against them. The entire establishment wins and the people lose in the end. No matter what crap Trump pulls hell have his support and the other side can pull whatever crap and half the public will support them for being anti Trump. It’s a way of making it possible for the elites to basically get away with anything.

       Sorry but I think this is a naive view. When you take a step back and really look at Trump, his past, the things he says and does, it’s hard not to see someone doing his part to create division, and someone who at his core basically stands for much of the same old shit. The ‘resistance’ is a pile of shit too. The only people all this division benefits are the elites.
