    <div class="md"><p>I sincerely looked into Flat Earth. Because I thought there might be something to it, since no one wants to touch the topic. And I found it has a few things that can&#39;t hold up to criticism:</p>

<p>1) If the Earth was flat, wouldn&#39;t you be able to see the Sun at night, if you had a powerful enough telescope?</p>

<p>2) If you take a timelapse of the stars in the night sky, they all rotate around a point, which suggests that there is rotation. Now Flat Earthers may argue that the dome is rotating, not the Earth. However, no matter where you are in the Northern Hemisphere, all the stars are rotating around the same point (North Star), which suggests that the Earth is rotating instead. If it were not the case, there would be no universal point of rotation because each vantage point would be different. Also, the Southern Hemisphere has a completely different set of stars, that rotate around a different central point (Southern Cross), and the North Star cannot be seen. This phenomena can only be explained by round, rotating Earth.</p>

<p>Also, Flatearthers, at least the ones I met (no offense if this doesn&#39;t apply to you), are bad at arguing. Whenever, I ask a question. They always respond with a different question and completely railroad their point without even addressing my concern. They have no politeness in the art of argument, and so it&#39;s hard for me to even sincerely seek the truth from them.</p>

<p>None of the following reference NASA and still no flat earther can show me how they are wrong.</p>

<p>Orbital satellites prove the Earth is a sphere as do the following: placement of light houses, placement of radio transmission towers, trade routes, wind and weather systems, the rotation of the Earth as supported by laser gyro and apparent movement of stars in the sky, different stars in the northern and southern hemispheres, adjustments to ballistic targeting calculations to account for the curve of the Earth, large constructions projects like some bridges, and lots and lots more.</p>

<p>The ruling elite who practice dark magic. Depending on how far down the rabbit whole you want to go, they are either the immortals or a lineage/bloodlines of dark magicians stemming from Sumer and before. </p>

<p>It would prove intelligent creation and that there is more to all of this and us. Same with a few other theories like hollow earth, growing earth, electric universe, etc. </p>

That theory, in combination with the evolution lie, are meant to make you think think that we just appeared here randomly by chance and there is no meaning to life and nobody is watching.

If you discovered the earth was a flat, enclosed dome, you might realize that we are in the center of the system, which was artificially constructed for us.

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think the flat earth idea is being pushed by NASA. Some of the footage especially from the ISS looks odd. If they can conflate anybody who questions the footage as believers of flat earth then the general public will dismiss any idea that the footage should be examined as being faked. If it’s thought that thinking the footage might be faked is mainly pushed by flat earthers then it’s pretty easy to ignore.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched a lot of flat earth theory videos. There is the religious angle, the experimental angle, and Eric Dubay.</p>

<p>There are many bible thumpers who are of the belief that science is a religion that is trying to trump all other ones. That science is rife with belief systems rather than gathering evidence with a solid method. They believe the bible says the earth is flat and covered with a dome. That the earth is significant. They believe science is attempting to make us all abandon God and accept the belief system that we&#39;re just an insignificant pebble in an endless, meaningless universe. That there is no creative force behind any of it. It&#39;s all random. </p>

<p>The experimental angle are videos that do things like take zoom cameras and bring into view things that they believe shouldn&#39;t be able to be seen because of the curvature of the earth, like a ship that has gone over the horizon being brought back into view, or a landmark at a certain distance that shouldn&#39;t be able to be seen. There was a series of videos put out by someone questioning the physics of the orb earth. He used math and physics to show what couldn&#39;t be so. Some of the experimental videos are interesting, and at least they&#39;re trying to find out the truth and not just believing one way or the other.</p>

<p>Eric Dubay is the king of the movement. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiBJBVBez_w">200 truths That The Earth Is Not A Spinning Ball</a> video includes all the ideas and beliefs as to why the earth is just not what they tell us it is. </p>

<p>If you like conspiracies and rabbit holes as a study, and for fun, it&#39;s worth a dive to see what all these people have to say and what they are doing to prove it to themselves.</p>

<p>Part of the way through my investigation, I did realize that I believed the earth was an orb because I was told it was. I had never proved it to myself with experiments or math. I still haven&#39;t. Either way, flat or a ball, it&#39;s all pretty miraculous that I&#39;m even here and am able to create experience, art, love, and so much. I choose not to spend my time calling people idiots for their beliefs in this regard.   Just not time well spent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat Earth concepts have originated from a late 1800&#39;s paper and have been a running joke ever since. You can find old 70&#39;s episodes of shows, like Dr. Who, making fun of &quot;Flat Earthers&quot; by name in the same breath as UFO crazies.</p>

<p>It is just a joke exploited for identity politics tricks. Find something really off-the-wall crazy, like believing something so nonsensical, then associate that with your opponents. &quot;Do you question your government? Then you&#39;re a crazy Flat Earther!&quot; See how easy that works?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the FE youtube community is a money-op. From a post I have made in the past. Interest in FE on youtube and FB is down and they are desperate for views / $$$</p>

<p>If you look at Google trends you will see that interest in FE is way down. They main people behind pushing it these day (for $$$ in my opinion) are Mark Sargent / Patricia Steer / Robbie Davidson (Runs the various Flat Earth conferences), FECORE see the board members list on their website (checking how it has changed via the WayBack machine is interesting), Jeranism, Bob (Globebusters), and a few others.</p>

<p>Attendance at the recent Canada conference was way below expectations. It was so low that they streamed it for free despite saying it would cost and taking money from a few for the ability to watch the streams.</p>

<p>Everyone I mentioned uses their real names on their websites and youtube channels. I haven&#39;t doxed anyone this is all public knowledge.</p>

<p>For example Jearn, according to his own words, bring in 67% or more of his income from his Pateron subscribers so he has a vested interest in pushing FE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mentioned it in another response.  I agree that the flat-earth introduction came at a time when it felt like a psy-op just to lump discredit people that spoke on conspiracies.</p>

<p>My mental timeline over the attempted narrative takeover...</p>

<ul>
<li>r/politics taken over by 100% pro-hillary narrative.</li>
<li>dnc primary generates obvious turmoil and distrust from voters (especially Bernie supporters).</li>
<li>r/BernieSanders subreddits, even Facebook starts to shutdown, and content/mods turn to anti-negative hillary, &quot;blue no matter who&quot;, lip service.  While also saying &quot;we need to vote local for a grassroots democratic revolution&quot; (possibly just a talking point for legit revolutionaries).</li>
<li>Introduce pizzagate and spirit cooking from the podesta wikileaks.</li>
<li>Trump wins.  I have a theory that pizzagate-esque data/evidence was used to strong arm hillary&#39;s team into retracting possible fixing of votes in certain states.  And why Podesta stood up there for Hillary&#39;s concession speech, like a dunce, because his email leak was a big factor that implicated many.</li>
<li>r/pizzagate is shutdown, insert Russia-gate which I feel was mainly a reaction to the pizzagate findings.  Yet it doesn&#39;t take.  So then the encroaching into r/conspiracy and other places that discuss conspiracies openly.</li>
<li>insert Flat-Earthers which has always been a tongue n&#39; cheek topic in the conspiracy world.  Even if only started as a psy-op I presume there are plenty of trollers that find entertainment in the topic.  And we all like a good troll, so Flat-Earth is back into the mix.  And now any pizza/pedogate talk is discredited because it&#39;s lumped in with Flat-Earthers.  Even though it&#39;s not, but TPTB can keep telling themselves that.</li>
