       Browse the google news, count the "negative" keywords. Check the business section. Losing money, not doing well.. You know, sorta like how Tesla is doing lately. Elon burning himself out sleeping at the office under desks.. haha.. All of it, usually more negativity. Entertainment news? Oh, it's only mentioned when somebody screws up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where's the bit of positivity? Oh, Amazon and Apple being worth a trillion. The technology section, they make you think the smart phones are the only bit of positivity around.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd think the world is going down the hole. You guys too around conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Browse the internet. You feel like "garbage" compared to whatever 'gifv's on imgur and here. Meanwhile, just being human, is kinda neat. So, never think you're "garbage".
      </p>
      <p>
       But.. look around the internet, the news, especially here in conspiracy.. it's this paranoia about how it's all, "bad" out there. No, it's not. Look at how many people there are, and you'd think there'd be way more chaos. All of this, seems to be manufactured by the media companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politics are the worst because it stays the same whichever side you vote for and eventually it's gonna go bankrupt. Nobody fixes the problems in the world. Nobody cares about all the starving people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do, about all this negativity, is tune that out. Shut 'er down. Work on how you can win at the game of life. That's probably money. So think of how you could get that power. It's all about long term projects and patience, persistence. If you can become a billionaire, now you have the power to do things about these "conspiracy" topics. Uncovering things in the real world, with boots on the ground. You, surfing around the internet, powerless, will not stop the bad guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how much things look like it sucks out there, in the meantime, you stay positive. Whatever's going on, is gonna happen, so being negative on top of it, is not cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also watch bad habits, things that make you tired. Getting out of the hole, is all about the energy levels. What makes you tired? Eating crappy foods like garbage you find in a 7/11 or bad food that tastes good but you know is unhealthy. Stupid things like sodas, the sugar and what not. Make sure you get enough sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this conspiracy stuff.. you can't do anything about it. I spent years doing research. The school type research is done.. You know what's going on out there. It's kinda "quiet" in recent years too with not too many terrorist events. Shut all that off.. there's nothing new. Don't get irritated by politics because you know what's going on there.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you do instead of all these "distractions" like surfing around the internet.. watching movies, stupid TV, sports.. video games.. Shut all that off. Throw out your TV like I did a decade ago. Work towards how you can get the power to stop these bad guys running the world. Beat 'em at their own game, the business. Make cooler companies compared to theirs. They're all corrupt with greed. You can beat 'em, you know. They treat the customer like dirt. So it's easy to beat these guys. I remember when google started, they were lame. Same thing with the Amazon guy. Then, Apple.. those suck cause you can't change the batteries. So, they all suck. What you wanna do is work towards how you can be one of those guys. Not waste time bickering about conspiracies. Ok, I gotta go to work.. see ya guys.. stay positive.

       oh, I don't know.. I've just had enough, in my own life in recent years. Can't do it anymore the bicking about everything like everybody else. At work, what do they do with co-workers whenever they talk. Complain about the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       On and on. And then, if things get rough in your life, like between jobs.. or low on money. It's like, enough with the woe is me attitude if things suck. Can't do it anymore the losing.. haha.. So, even though I get the runaround whenever I attempt anything.. it's like, doesn't get to me anymore and get riled up. It's like, whatever.. not gonna get all fouled-up. Like picture, going to a store to try and get something. You already know, it'll be like 3-4 stores before you maybe find something close to what you thought you'd be getting. Now, I don't even get fouled-up about "the runaround".

       Sure, but in the search for truth, personally I've found extra positive people to be the most blind to the reality of the possibilities that get posted on this sub... And they'll be the first to diagnose other's "depression" when they don't like what they hear.

       There aren't positive or negative emotions. It certainly isn't the case that only positive feelings are valid and "negative" ones aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Negativity and pessimism come from intelligence and foresight: people who are looking to the future and see many bad paths to go down. As great as "positivity" is for your mental well being, I personally would not unplug from reality to the extent op suggests, and allow those unpleasant realities to take place. You should probably be grateful for smart people making grim predictions, they save us from ourselves more than blind optimism has ever done.

       I've always enjoyed the topics on that sub, but worry about the long term health of people in it.  The collapse, if it comes, however it comes, will be what no one expects, just like the recovery and the collapse after.

       Somebody mentioned that.. what goes on over there? I bookmarked it. Are those guys like paranoid that it's the end of the world? I glanced down a bit. Are they worried about things like "global warming"? haha.

       A lot of these problems in the world, though.. if you were at that billionaire level where you had a bunch of chain stores.. you would then have the money and power to do things, new ways compared to how things are done. Have money to put into scientific research for new technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like the robots. Then no union wages.. haha. You be the guy who brings them in. What I really like is when you think about a scenario where you'd own like your own country. No taxes. Have the robots do the mining. Whatever "objects" in front of you, they would create them. Don't need any other countries for imports. Think about no humans in the mix. Then no need for money. Why would you need it, the robots get the materials and grow things. No humans to pay. Need an object like even a Ferrari, it'd technically be "free".
      </p>
      <p>
       Have the A.I. think for itself. Can maybe develop new propulsion methods. Think about outer space. Do this type of concept out there. It can go get materials from who knows where. If everything's free, then even if it's gigantic, robots can move fast to build it. So, now you can even do odd things like terraform Mars. How's that grab ya. Then get whoever many people outta here and deal with the overpopulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Haven't looked over at the collapse subreddit, but these super paranoid guys aren't thinking on my level, where you can actually solve global problems and it's fuck all for a big outfit. lol.

       Those that frequent it are constantly reading about the world ending as we know it in the coming decade.  I've seen threads there that warn people to take a break for awhile, go outside etc.  If I'm not mistaken they've had a couple suicides.   Your original post would do them some good I think.  If you end up posting there, let me know.  Thanks man!

       The thing is, I don't do "comments". You know how it goes in today's politically correct society. It's this "fluff" or they'd get reported. Here on reddit it's different. But places like youtube, that's to get traffic to their own channel. So it's just this brainless type comments all over. Soundcloud is the worst. they don't even talk about what the content is about. It's all them trying to get traffic to their own stuff.

       Shills.. who cares. I don't have time for it. I spend most of my spare time offline. Can't do it anymore the "distractions". That's going nowhere with your life. Sitting there scrolling down on imgur. Jeez.. But, been there for years, the "distractions".

       What gets on my nerves though is those who get obsessed about anything to do with political characters. Ever notice whoever gets voted in, they get all flustered about them now. Analyze whatever and try to get them impeached. Well, even if they did, you know the next that'd get voted in, would also be corrupt. Yet, this is all those types of political buffs do, is get all obsessed about it. They're kinda like those who watch sports on TV with all their spare time. haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah.. what you were talking about.. more money, less problems. Those who can't figure out how to get rich, try to comfort themselves with this idea that, money won't buy happiness. Yet, if you don't have a job and don't make enough to survive, it sure is a lot more problems. A lot of this misery going on, can be solved with a bunch of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you could be a billionaire who really gets it going, now you can actually fix problems in the world. A lot of the ways these companies all operate the same, they all lose. This public stock where, if it doesn't do well, it craps out. And then they all have to keep the stock graphs pointing up, even though it's unrealistic. I don't know.. but seems like the solution is a bunch of money.

       I know what you mean. Point out what they observe of possibly "fishy" stuff going on. But, I did that for years. I noticed nothing's changing much in recent years. You see them still talking about 9/11. It's like, move on. And then it'd be like whatever terrorist event. They'd think, oh it's not like how it was told it was. Had to be something fishy about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, you digging around the internet, trying to uncover the truth, by using google. You think you'd be able to find any actually "classified" information on the internet? Probably not. Certainly not classified videos on youtube.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, what do these conspiracy guys do, more research. It's like educating yourself all the time yet never working towards some type of solution to the problem.

       I been down this rabbit hole long enough it almost feels like home. I rarely go spouting about this stuff out in public. Nobody wants to hear it. It’s ugly and depressing until it all sinks in and you realize this is the way it’s always been. I guess the only real difference in my life is I no longer see the future as a certainty, and I am powerless to change anything. In the end, you just feel thankful to be alive at any given moment. Keep on keepin on 😎

       You can have ideals and be realistic.  The world has always been run by a collection of psychopaths.  For the most part, life isn't as horrifying as it was in the past.  Think of the wars that swept across the gobe, or imagine the huge portion of earth that suffered through the Chinese revolution or the soviet era. At least now there  is more information flowing around and there might be more skeptical folks out there.  There's always reason for optimism.

       Never heard of this r/collapse. Gonna bookmark that. Seems like this is the way it's gradually heading. Like how about that US debt. That's not sustainable. But no political parties every do anything about it. It's like imagine if you had a major debt and pretty much just ignore it. Some people pay down their debts and don't roll like that.. but I guess not the governments. Seems like most of them operate that way. So, something's "fishy" with the way all these governments operate. It's not sustainable for future generations. Seems like it's gradually heading towards this "collapse" way. So, gonna keep an eye on that subreddit and check it once in a while.

       governments are not there to make any big decisions or steer nations.  the role of the government is to act as an interface between the unruly, cannon fodder / debt slaves and between the owners, royalty and clergy.  the government will use its monopoly on violence to manage and tax the plebs in a way that facilitates maximum wealth extraction and productivity on behalf of the ruling class.

       since the us industrial production is outsourced and the technology transfer to commie china is complete, and now that all the gold is gone from fort knox (i assume), the united states is ready for the trashbin of history to give way for their 'multipolar' new world order.  unmanagable national debt, the fed, unaccountable military spending and balkanization of the american society takes care of this.

       and the real reason for this is that the elites are not only satanist pedofiles, jetting to and from tropical islands, but also communists (david rockefeller was educated by the fabian socialists in london) who work relentlessly towards achieving their world revolution and thus utopia, the nwo..
