       Not just defaulting on loans. Less people are buying cars as we have already reached the peak of the market (as far as people buying cars). Car companies have to decide to stop making cars, or give bigger discounts on their cars. Also longer loan terms are being given out. Which means less per month. So of course, people buy more expensive cars and features when they really can't afford it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you noticed how many nice newer cars are on the road? ANYBODY can get a nice car these days. Go to a used car lot and you will see mostly nicer and newer cars. People are also losing equity on their older cars because the newer used cars are so damned cheap.

       In the UK they now impose an astronomical VED tax on vehicles purchased new, each year for 5 years. For a 40k+ vehicle which is pretty normal these days, you will have to pay £500 a year car tax for 5 years. This tax alone will massively cut new car sales and see people hold off on those vehicles or lease.

       It wouldn’t necessarily be the auto industry crashing. It would be defaults on the loans that were used to buy cars already. Similar to a 2008 mortgage crisis where loans were made to  borrowers at too low of rates given their risk of default. It could hit banks hard but not so much as defaults on mortgages just given long term value of the underlying asset. Would be a shit show for GM given they have their own financing wing, GM Financial.

       It would be bad but not to the level of the mortgage crisis. The reason why the mortgage crisis was so bad was that the mortgages were rapped up into securities (that “couldn’t fail” might I add)

       Agreed. And you are talking about huge assets when you think about mortgaged homes that are not going anywhere. I would caveat it with the fact that it wasn’t the securities themselves that could not fail but the banks who owned them.

       It’s interesting. A lot of funds are popping up investing in student loans hoping to profit off a similar crisis.

       Seriously, selling weapons left and right, not helping Flint etc, doing whatever it wants. Everyone, fucking everyone was looking at the new internet rules. At the treatment of Assange and other whistleblowers. And it just kept on going.

       I think we're at the point where the world bank united all the countries and made them dependent on each other and we're either going to realize that the world relied on the USD which was never a measure of value added and simply a labor based trade.  Meaning if you have $100m in the bank, it doesn't mean you created $100m of value to the world.  I think hollywood and their copyright laws show nothing needs to be gained by the paying party, even if their money was earned for creating something of value.

       Agreed. And it's not just citizens in general, but specifically people on conspiracy theorist sites who are full of themselves. I hear it all the time, a shocking number of people think flat earth posts are made one or twice a month by the CIA to distract everyone here so we don't inflict too much damage on the powers that be. What damage, when?

       The very term "conspiracy theorist" was invented by the CIA to discredit anyone questioning the official narrative of the JFK assassination, how is it strange to believe flat earth is the same? If you question 9/11 people will ask you if you believe in flat earth and lizard people - this stops people from asking questions about 9/11.

       If it wasn't flat earth or lizard people, it would be something else, like "You think 9/11 was an inside job, I bet you think the Moon Landing was fake, too!"

       The other theory I hear is that it distracts conspiracy theorists. How does it even distract the regulars around here if a post about flat earth is made every few weeks? There has been 0 exactly 0 pro-flat earth posts to ever reach the first page of r/ conspiracy so you can't even say it's meant to distract anyone, anyway, as if ten minutes commenting on it even

       something else. Flat earth and lizard people are just the extremes. There are plenty of real people that believe flat earth and lizard people, so there is an organic force as well. If there is any manufacture by TPTB, I'd suggest looking at the posts/points which draw the most legitimacy to those theories. Creating an organic, independent movement of crazies is the most effective deterrent imaginable.

       When was the last time you think the perpetrators of a crime of the magnitude of 9/11 were remotely worried from the public "asking questions?" People come here to this sub to solve mysteries and uncover conspiracies, but it doesn't threaten anyone in power in the slightest. When you use the Overton Window, you're talking about legitimate government passing policy. Criminal conspiracies don't care about what the public finds acceptable.

       First of all, I'm a conspiracy theorist myself. I know conspiracies exist. They get exposed all the time in things called "trials" and many, many more go unexposed. That's just a fact that I'm ready to defend, even if I don't understand how one could argue against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are people, who I consider "Deep-enders". People who have dabbled in the arts and gone too far.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Paranoitic. The real ones, to be treated. The paranoia is there before any conspiracy theory. When you are younger, you see dark shadows in places. You know everyone is laughing at you. You know something is not right. And then you find conspiracy theories and you finally know what is not right. And it fits. No one else believes, just you. You and your small circle of confidants. Who make it worse. So if you now smell something funny? It's the CIA. If now someone follows you? It's the KGB. If now the lights flicker in the room? Mossad.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Religious zealots. It has all the aspects of religion when you think about it. I'm dissatisfied with the world. It's fucked. Why is it fucked? Well, I read this
       <del>
        bible
       </del>
       webpage and here, there is a conspiracy. But what can I do? Oh, I have to do nothing. Because
       <del>
        the rapture
       </del>
       something will happen that will blow it all out of water! The Great Awakening! The exposition! And they will all get what's coming to them and it will all be alright then. Whoever is against that is just an
       <del>
        Satanist unbeliever
       </del>
       shill and fuck him. I'm absolutely impotent and powerless against the huge chaos of the world, but it will get corrected and then everything will be fine. So I'll just sit here, smug, cause being smug is my only line of defence against the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Self-worth. I've amounted to nothing, I'm worth nothing to no one. Why? Jews. But I got something you don't know. I've got the feeling that I've got it all figured out. My failure is my hobby, my mistakes are my projects. I inspect them and find the faults of others everywhere. If I'm so smart, why ain't I rich? Jews. Come, I'll show you the graphs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are more in my mind now, but I've already given it too much thought, you know. It's sometimes just tiresome. You find someone who shares your beliefs, but, again, he is not looking for the truth, but for a hole to bury himself in. Also, shut the fuck up, shill, I have my safehouse to return to.

       Paranoid Schizophrenia is a real mental disorder, and anyone who has it will have conspiratorial machinations well before being exposed to the conspiracy community. Equivocating the two is irrational. Now, if you mean to say that there are paranoid people in the conspiracy theory, I'd agree. Some rationally so, some irrationally so. Some may have had paranoid predispositions, others not. If you feel the government or some criminal, violent entity is after you, and you don't have any sway or power, you're irrationally paranoid. Joe Rogan once said, "if you aren't paranoid..." (or at least cynical, IMO) "you're not paying attention". That doesn't mean you should go off the deep end, you don't have to take yourself and everything so seriously all the time.

       This is a defense against fear, making use of blind faith in the improvement of the conditions of being. This is not endemic to conspiracy theory, it's endemic to the human condition, and conspiracy theorists are also humans. Hopeless, desperate humans, with little locus of control-most people in the world are. Their religion is not the conspiracy theory. Their religion is hope, and they attach it to their worldview, which in this case happens to involve conspiracy theories. You're describing most people on earth. You can see this kind of person in every society in the world.

       Again this is not endemic to the conspiracy community. Racial based, class based, intelligence based, economic based, and even ethical based posturing and ranking along social hierarchy, internally and externally, is a feature of every society on earth, every individual on earth. In this case, it has been attached to Jews specifically. There's a reason for that by the way-it's a reactionary, defensive response to assault. In the case of Jews, it is a cultural and political policy assault. I don't believe, "it's the jews" as some put it, but there are some very interesting polls on public opinion of different demographics along ethnic, religious, political, racial, and gender criteria, that reveal what Jews think about non-jew whites, and evangelical christians in particular. What's more, the Israeli lobby in the U.S. is profoundly influential. Since your example was so specific to an existing conspiracy theory, I felt the need to refute a particular assertion.

       and trying to refute(?) what I said, just to repeat everything and then stand victorious(?). I'm kind of confused here, but then again, that's a given.

       You may as well just state that people in general have the things you stated, and are attracted to conspiracy theories and thus, people fill the community. I personally find little that is profound in your statement. The people in this community are the same as anywhere else in the world.

       <p>
        I mean, either we both have different definitions of "endemic" or you disagree that people who look for secret explanations are drawn to places that offer secret explanations.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       False dichotomy fallacy. There are plenty of other explanations. In my case, I am arguing that the pathologies you've noted are not remarkable or exceptional. These kinds of people don't just come here. They go to every community you can imagine. They inhabit all places, and they are going to inhabit this one. That is to say, there is nothing about the conspiracy community that attracts them in particular. This community attracts all kinds of people from all walks of life, of all kinds of pathologies.

      <p>
       People who look for secret explanations also turn to cults, religions, the forefront of scientific research, law enforcement etc.

       Alright, that's that then. Here is the thing. While I characterized the people I mentioned, I will now take a jab at you so you understand why I am going to go do something else, ok?

       Some people like the sound of their voice. You like to write. There is a high possibility that you reread your own comments and marvel over them. In all of this you have not addressed anything and you have spent most of your time repeating what I have said. I am absolutely sure you enjoy it. Because, at the end of the day, in your own eyes you come out as smart.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you have done is stated that people who like conspiracy theories are everywhere. Which is, well, true. That's how the world works. It seems like you do not consider people who are attracted to conspiracies and believe in them as part of the conspiracy community. And then you have argued against the fact that people who like conspiracy theories are drawn to conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just, again, stating this so you see why I don't feel the need (or wish) to continue, just to reread everything I've said with some superfluous info springled on top of it.

       Incorrect, I have only explicitly acknowledged that they are in fact here and are a part of the community as much as anyone else.

      <p>
       Even if I made this argument, which I did not, it doesn't say anything. People that like conspiracy theories are drawn to them? How is that not equivocal? You may as well have said that people that like conspiracy theories like conspiracy theories, or that people that are drawn to conspiracy theories are drawn to conspiracy theories. There's no difference.

       for one thing, we’re all talking abt Nike’s ad campaign instead of their history of exploitation and unethical treatment of their sweatshop workers. THAT’s a non-partisan, American reason to boycott Nike...but Nike wants us to think about our ideological differences, as opposed to the material, tangible pain and suffering huge corporations like them enable &amp; cause.

       30 years ago, that guy's football career would have been over. Today, because he's controversial and draws attention to himself, he gets a contract from Nike.

       What they do is usually is 3 fold if not more. Meaning its not only a distraction but has to do with covering, and concealing at the same time. Pushing Bill's through government, down playing upcoming legislation being proposed or sidebar to some other antics(political) going on. Nike pushing Kaepernick stance and Levi's pushing gun control all while Kavanuagh confirmation goes on. George Webb is nicely covering server gate. Pompeo is in Pakistan. Google in front of Senate hearing. Go to different countries news they usually offer different views on the US news cycle.

       the lives of the poor (which is the majority) will never improve until they fight for it.
during the Great Depression communists, socialists, and workers unions banned together and forced FDR to take from the rich and give to the poor, create social security and unemployment benefits. 
today the poor have no teeth. it's like they're resigned to be service sector slaves

       It is entirely possible that these events are meant to distract from specific events, and I believe I may have witnessed that before, but in general the primary distraction is not just from the growing wealth gap and siphoning of wealth into the hands of fewer and fewer people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more than that. It's not to just delay an inevitable class warfare, actually I'd say it's more to modify the inevitable class war, to direct it, shape it, and become a part of it. Every authoritarian government in the world is founded on extreme, widespread violence, which the people participate in willingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       These "distractions" are more than distractions.

       said it best, "The US citizen is pretty full of himself if he thinks anyone is trying to distract him while fucking his mother in plain view." It isn't as much about fleeting distraction (there is an element of that) as it is about transformation, which is just a permanent or long lasting distraction in this context.
      </p>
      <p>
       The information war is rooted in the age old divide and conquer strategy. This has always been the case-it's never changed. The difference is that today, society is far more liberal, so the tools of manipulation have become more liberal. This also makes them more effective, because they can now operate under the guise of empathy and compassion as well, as a proactive force-instead of just defense of established paradigms as a reactive response. In this way, the dominant culture can assail selected groups with impunity and sew more widespread, lasting division.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find there are many "socialist" or "liberal" policies that are effective and reasonable measures. However, identity politics, and radical progressivism, present an existential threat to humanity for a number of reasons. For the sake of this conversation, they present the most effective tool for division ever exemplified in human history. You hear people say stuff like, "eat the rich" without recourse, as if it is okay demonize and assail one another not by the merits of one's actions, but rather by identity alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the greatest distraction, and partisanry, and ideological enslavement make it impossible for many people to acknowledge this and address it.

       it really isn't fair they downvoted you for such a well-thought out response.
it's probably a reflection of the rising tide of socialist fervor that's becoming mainstream. just the other day Tucker Carlson on Fox News started to echo Bernie Sanders and pointing out the ills of income inequality that has gotten out of hand. I thought i was in Bizarro World-- Fox News was championing the cause of the poor? He was asking Jeff Bezos to pay Amazon employees more.
Makes you wonder how bad things have gotten...
IMO without some form of scary identity politics based in class--with the masses of poor banding together--the powerful will never make policies that help common people but will continue to reward their donors. There have been times when our elected leaders feared Americans like Nixon feared the Vietnam protestors, and FDR feared the radical leftists and workers' unions during the Great Depression. The problem is today our elected officials don't fear the people anymore so they try to get away with the most outrageous acts of corruption and greed. I don't know if they will enact policies to help working class folks by us asking Nicely. That hasn't worked. We got to scare our leaders.
Who knows... it could be fun.  ; )

       Too much of anything is a bad thing. In the past, massive income equality was absolutely necessary to organize capital, but today with the internet, crowdfunding has removed the necessity. We can objectively look at massive income inequality as a symptom of our freedom to organize ourselves economically. Everyday it becomes less beneficial. More success procures more opportunity which in turns affords greater success, in a feedback loop that logically can not be sustained and creates social problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fighting income inequality has not been something the right has been opposed to for as long as I can remember. The right merely employs different policies to address the inequality, and IMO, some of them are very logical and efficacious.
       <em>
        Perhaps Tucker was championing progressive policy and that is what you were referring to?

      <p>
       I've never known Fox News to not "champion the poor" as you put it. There are plenty of poor Republicans, it's objectively in their interest, and in the interest of The Republican party, to devise policies that appear to benefit, or just outright benefit, the poor.

      <p>
       I don't see what is wrong with that. There's nothing necessarily not conservative about asking for better wages, whether as an individual, for your own sake-or as an organization, for the sake of others. Now, if Tucker called for the government to raise the minimum wage, that would not be very conservative of Fox News.

       Or we could just agree to blacklist anyone that has ever been elected a representative for state of federal government, worked for the bureaucracy, lobbyist organizations, or fortune 1000 companies in an executive capacity, or as a consultant. That'll eliminate at least 70% of the crooks. Vote them all out and never elect them again. It's actually pretty simple. I'm not saying it would solve all of our problems, but it'd give us a chance. In fact all anyone needs to do, at least to start, is vote for people that aren't running in the RNC or DNC. It's not hard, people are just afraid.

       I don't know if fear is the right word. You don't want your representatives afraid of the people. You want them to love the people, to respect the people, to work for the people. We care too little for quality of character, and are too easily swayed by propaganda.

       Class stratification could, however, cause people to put aside other differences like race, sexual orientation, and such to come together and fill in what is missing.

       I think it's more of an example of the slumber most people live in. Walking, talking sleepwalkers who think that the dramas in their minds are reality. The opinions in their minds. The beliefs. These filters are how they see the world. Where's the creativity? Where's the present moment? Seeing things as they really are? Loving the one you're with? Look closely at people and you can see the slumber.

       When the Malaysian flight went missing it was literally all anyone talked about.  Then a month later they were like ... oh yeah by the way Russia invaded Ukraine ... but yeah more about this plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane went missing on March 8 2014, and yes that’s a big deal but, an entire country’s government crumbled and got overtaken on April 15th, and it barely got any media coverage at the time, they just started rehashing the same info about the plane.

       Not just defaulting on loans. Less people are buying cars as we have already reached the peak of the market (as far as people buying cars). Car companies have to decide to stop making cars, or give bigger discounts on their cars. Also
       <em>
        longer
       </em>
       loan terms are being given out. Which means less per month. So of course, people buy more expensive cars and features when
       <em>
        they really can't afford it
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you noticed how many nice newer cars are on the road? ANYBODY can get a nice car these days. Go to a used car lot and you will see mostly nicer and newer cars. People are also losing equity on their older cars because the newer used cars are so damned cheap.
