       We all know Joe is controlled. I have just started realizing this more and more over the years. I am convinced "Joe Rogan questions everything" was completely planned in order to keep his career going. Seeing as the show was nothing but quackery with no real conspiracy discussion at all. He says talking to all these people who believe in bigfoot cured him of all conspiracies.

       Its because he was podcasting for fun in the beginning and now he's pulling $20k-$100k per episode of JRE. It's now a multi million dollar business that has exposure to over 100million people worldwide. Each episode hits millions of ears nearly everyday. TPTB had to.... make sure he wasn't pushing too much truth out there, god forbid it upsets the status quo.

       Have you guys ever heard of running a business? You think the cia is gonna let him have Carlson and hancock amongst many other debunkers of the lies they tell us. He makes at least 200k off each episode. You think he’s gonna go down the ALEX jones road? You must must not have any responsibilities in real life if you think you can grow and learn more about stuff. You still believe in everything you when you were 12? No? You’re a cia shill. Smh

       Please explain billionaires to me. Why didnt they stop at 100k in the bank. You would be happy to have that. Why didnt they stop at 1mil in the bank?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didnt they stop at 100mil in the bank? You could live comfortably for the rest of your life with that, and so could generations after you.

       How do you know “he doesn’t need the money”? Why are you assuming that his interest are the same as yours? There’s people who make MILLIONS every episode, what if he want to get on that level? Isn’t that more realistic than that movie you imagined? Again do you have similar operation in real life? If not don’t speak for others.

       Well he’s certainly not going to admit it himself. Neither would the CIA. The evidence is that he’s flip-flopped many critical positions in favor of the establishment view, this being after his podcast’s rise to fame, so it is highly suspicious circumstantial evidence.

       I don't disagree, but you saying he
       <em>
        admitted
       </em>
       to being a "CIA Op" when he insists it was a one semester internship doesn't lend your argument any credence. Saying he admitted to being a CIA OP is simply misinformation and we should try to be as factual as possible if we want to be taken seriously.

       Right, but this is when you have to bring logical conclusions into the mix. He admitted to working with the CIA as an internship. That’s a fact. The man is originally a Vanderbilt (fact) and is a huge news anchor for a giant news corporation that’s owned by a handful of companies that have ties to the CIA (fact). So in conclusion he pretty much admitted to being a CIA op indirectly as what CIA op would admit to it directly? They’re going to leave bread crumbs so we have to follow them.

       Again, I agree. But it's important to make the distinction between postulation and facts. You postulated and presented it as a fact. This description you gave is how you should explain it, rather than just saying he admitted to being a CIA Op. I agree with your conclusions, but you should frame them as postulations through reasoning and facts rather than framing them as admissions that never happened.

       I have been speculating that he is TRYING to break up or at least put a nice financial dent in Tesla lately...It seems almost scripted and timed like a play the way he is shooting off at the mouth about edgy subjects and well that freaking cave diver...Could he be self sabotaging?

       I watched a clip someone made of him in the early years talking about how there was no way the moon landing was real. Then fast forward to new joe and he’s saying there’s no way the moon landing was a hoax. Yeah I understand that people change their beliefs when they come across new information, but all the arguments he made for why the moon landings were hoaxed still stand. It’s not like they just disappeared and there are no more red flags. He just is acting like everything is all good and for the people who watched his show regularly, they saw through the change.

       That’s not really an accurate assessment of his current views. During one of the podcast with NDT they discuss all the evidence for how it could be hoax. At the end of that discussion he said he thinks that it probably did happen but that they faked a lot of the footage and pictures during it. No where has he said that there is no way that it’s a hoax but that it’s more likely that we actually went.

       The strange image phenomenon was replicated by a photographer taking images in the desert.  The rest of that has been addressed. There have even been probes that have taken pictures of the landing sight.  The rock samples were verified of lunar origin by other countries.

       He may not be deep state but he's definitely controlled at some level. There's an easily discernable change in his behavior, and it occurred right around when he talked to Neil Degrasse Tyson. He was far more open-minded about stuff like the Apollo hoax, but pulled a 180 and started making fun of people who believed in conspiracy theories. My guess is they threatened either his family or to pull his funding if he didn't fall in line. Which he did and suddenly got more popular. So I think he sold out but he probably had a pretty good reason.

       A great question about TPTB, why do these individuals draw out our scrutiny more then others.   Did we draw a genuine conclusion or were we directed to participate in collectively sowing doubt?
      </p>
      <p>
       We so easily refer to g-men conspiracy, but fail to evaluate the situation as if we were actually dealing with skilled, trained and equpped intelligence groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems more plausible that in the same way we view societal norms,  those among the wealthy and elite all share unspoken fears of what they have witnessed happen to those among them that have crossed TPTB.
      </p>

       What are the presumed effects of considering the JRE podcast as a deep state narrative?
      - guests and their material are being aired to create falsehoods or present targets for others
      - similar to the engineered early UFO propaganda, creates a misinformed community that continues to self generate falsehoods
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the polar opposite side of this view look Like?
     - Joe Rogan is just a human being, who was successful enough to find a way to make a profitable show out of just sitting and talking to people he finds interesting.
       <br/>
       - Radio and talk shows promote things for sale.  Not directed by malicious intent,  instead the shows guests being relevant to those who have current shows, books and programs available for sale.
     - As his sponsor base grew his ability to be as sensational as he was in the beginning narrowed
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more important then either of these views is that the fact that we have to ask these questions is the real product of the engineered state that the availability of truth and transparency has left us with.  This is the area we need to be calling out the CIA for.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we can be tempered, decisive and truly investigate rationally, we can defeat any societal engineering tactic.   I believe this narrative about Joe Rogan is making us overlook the bigger picture.   If this truly was a deep state production, there's no f@%#&amp;$ way they would have people like Stamets, Hancock, McKeanna

       I'm not going to bother replying to anyone because the conclusions I've come to I have come to and there is no changing that...
      </p>
      <p>
       My instincts on Joe is that he is compromised.  I'm not some raging conspiracy theorists either, I don't know what to believe about the moon, I'm pretty sure 9/11 was scripted, aliens who the fuck knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       His demeanor has changed.  He literally at point point (I didn't save or time stamp the episode) but he's literally pleading with the government to let him know about aliens, he looks into the camera and says "I will sell out today if I get the truth, I will tell my audience whatever you want me to tell them just fill me in".  That's aside from his rude, deamining, and arrogant behavior that's gotten even worse as of late.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like Joe, I never really did but I at least enjoyed his conversations... Now he's like a shell of what he was even a year ago... Something changed.   He's unfunny, even his reoccurring guests know it and dislike him.  Neil degrasse took shots at him last podcast, Ben Owen, and a few others I can't remember off the top of my head.   Joe is dead to me. I've unsubscribed.

       How do you know “he doesn’t need the money”? Why are you assuming that his interest are the same as yours? There’s people who make MILLIONS every episode, what if he want to get on that level? Isn’t that more realistic than that movie you imagined? Again do you have similar operation in real life? If not don’t speak for others.
