    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s def a new one.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a troll with a script using about 15 accounts to do immediate downvotes to certain comments. (Is that possible? I&#39;m not too reddit savvy) </p>

<p>What type of comments? Idk
Why? Idk</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very possible. You basically create a simple browser interface that handles multiple sessions, each on their own VPN channel to mask IPs. So it would look like you just have one web browser open, but behind that all these accts slaved to it. So, you downvote a comment, and all the other sessions send the same message to reddit&#39;s servers.</p>

<p>Thing is though, I would put a randomized delay on them, so all the votes don&#39;t hit at the exact same time and do basically what we saw today: a comment on a brand new post swinging by 15 votes instantly. That is why I called them an amateur and assume they are new. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny that you say this, OPs immediate response was to jump to a call to authority vaguely stating &quot;considering what I do for a living&quot;.     </p>

<p>Nonetheless, we aren&#39;t talking about the equivalent of him calling a travelator an escalator by mistake or calling a tomatoe a vegetable.        </p>

<p>Plague is a specific bacterial infection, just like gonorrhea or salmonella are. He said the equivalent of saying </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s with all these airport genital herpes </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Get it? That is a fundamental misunderstanding of the subject material. When someone misunderstands the subject this much, it is fair to say they are not experienced enough, and lack enough understanding of the subject to be able to make inferences on the subject.      </p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest irony of your comment however is the dunning-kruger effect explicitly describes people like OP </p>

Since I was an &quot;adult&quot; at 18, I&#39;ve never had the flu. In fact, I got sick three times from 18-21, so about once per year. I&#39;ve only been sick once in the last 7 years and that was during a cocaine binge which obviously weakened my immune system.

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody makes you get a flu shot, so just don&#39;t get one. Why do you feel the need to dictate voluntary medical decisions for other people by insuintating they are idiots or plotters?</p>

<p>The only people who get downvoted here in regards to vaccines are people who don&#39;t get their understanding of vaccines and disease and contagion and epidemiology from Jim Carey&#39;s ex-wife. This post will be down voted to oblivion for that.</p>

<p>Your cavalier attitude is because you have never known disease. You have lived in a world of vaccines and antibiotics and disinfectants. I&#39;m genX. Even though we all had to get our MMR shot to start kindergarten, the vaccine wears off over time. It is meant to dry the well, so you don&#39;t need a suit of armor, not provide a suit of armor. </p>

<p>In highschool, a classmate came back from a trip to Switzerland with the measles. He infected 6 of his friends and a baby. He and 3 of his friends ended up dying from measles-induced meningitis, the baby died of meales-induced pneumonia, his three other friends were in the hospital for weeks recovering from measles-induced pneumonia. </p>

<p>As soon as the school was notified, every student, staff, parent, and sibbling was given a booster in a mass vaccination push in the school gym. No one else got sick. No one else died. I had gone to school with those 7 kids since 1st grade. It wasn&#39;t a plot, it was Switzerland being an irresponsible asshole. They still are the chief source of measle infections for Americans. Maybe you should go there, test you theories, you&#39;ve nothing to fear, right?</p>

<p>Measles kills teens, adults, and babies.  If I was that man in the hospital in Houston with measels from that crazy Southwest airlines person, I&#39;d already be on the phone to sue for gross negligence and assault, and if he dies, wrongful death. If you gave me measles, I&#39;d make sure your life was a shitty as mine. Tort is the great equalizer.</p>

<p>Sorry about your friends measles’s outbreak &amp; loss, death is never easy. </p>

<p>I was not proposing antivaxx. I was merely pointing out the heavy push we see today for vaccinations. When I see billboards all over town pushing the flu shot, I find that to be over the top. The vaccination decision should be up to each individual, I’m not implying anything other than that here. </p>

Seriously, no symptoms, just a load of non itchy, non painful red spots..  All my friends also had measles... absolutely nobody died or was remotely ill.</p>

<p>Which measles did your friends get?  Because it sounds entirely different to what we all had in the UK.  I&#39;m Gen X too, but I was born two years before MMR was introduced.  I had mumps too, that was not nice.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flu shots only work for around two weeks from the moment they are released.  Such is the rapidity of flu mutation.  You are unlikely to get flu anyway.  In a 10 year period the likelihood is you&#39;ll get flu once.   I know,  you think you had flu last year, because you felt very poorly, had a temperature, sore throat, tired etc and the doctor gave you tamiflu and told you it was the flu.</p>

<p>It wasnt the flu.  The doctor peddled some drugs to you because that&#39;s how he makes money.  You had a cold, go and read the symptoms.  Oh and stop being such a wuss.</p>

<p>like anything the most vocal usually know the least about what they are talking about so you&#39;ve got to take it all with a bag of salt.</p>

<p>i will say there are some pretty concerning problems with vaccines and how they are approved. if i have kids i will only be getting them the vaccines that were around when i was a kid, and doing an ass load of research on the rest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is exactly it. We must have read the same stuff haha. I have more than a passing familiarity with the biochem here too. It is just reckless to stimulate these radical immunoresponses like this. The idea these combination vaccines haven&#39;t even been tested together is in...fucking...sane. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a scientist, not some lofty white tower acedemic, but I do it for a living, and have for a long time. I use science. I love science. I test things. I ask questions. Usually, I have a pretty good idea of the outcome, but I still test, and evaluate, and try to improve the quality of my results.</p>

<p>What they are doing is not science. It is witchcraft. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a bunch of people are returning to the west from a pilgrimage to mecca it could just be people in the west have different immune systems he&#39;ll just moving from one state to another I got a cold like 6 times in the first year and I generally get it once a year. Same when I moved to Germany the first time and when I deployed. </p>

<p>It could just be that. Or it could be something else. </p>

<p>I&#39;m leaning most are just that. But I think the old adage never let a crises go to waste applies. What better way to push flu vacvines than this foreign flu thats made its way here and will infect us all.  And you&#39;ll probably die. Better get this vaccine. Oh yeah you&#39;ll prob die from that too but we wont say anything </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting thought but probably not how population-wide DNA scans will be implemented.  Just my opinion.</p>

<p>There is no blood test that I am aware of that can test if you sick with an acute illness.  You can do targeted tests, and some bugs you can find very early on, but if you want a quick &quot;catch-all&quot; then I don&#39;t think we have it.</p>

<p>DNA databases are being constructed by collating data from genetic analysis companies like 23andme as well as from routine collection from prisoners.  This will suffice to scan a fairly large segment of the population, enough to identify a person by family relationship if not direct match.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the technology to actually perform checkpoint DNA identification is being developed by the military for use in active warzones.</p>

<p>Eventually that technology will be implemented in domestic policing, then combined with the domestic databases that are being assembled now.  It will be integrated into a biometric identification system such as that being piloted by the TSA precheck program for rapid identification, with secondary sidelining of anyone not in the system for DNA analysis and identity verification.</p>

It was 99 and right after he tried going metal and had an MTV special where spazzed out and tore up the set. So we were excited to spot him, but too scared to approach him for an autograph </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if this is related, but I was on a flight from San Diego on Tuesday that got cancelled.  We had backed away from our gate and were taxiing out to the queue to take off when we stopped.  After about 15 minutes they said they were trying to debug a problem.  A few minutes later said crew members were feeling sick and we were taken back to the gate and immediately deplaned.  In the jetway as we were leaving were some sort of incident response team with paramedics, Alaska airline exec and a half dozen totally militarized TSA agents in full gear.  One passenger had air administered to him behind the gate agents.  The door to the jet way was closed off and guarded by a TSA agent.  We were eventually told it was a mechanical problem.</p>

<p>Near as passengers could tell, there was a smell that made some people sick and they brought us back and cancelled the flight.  I didn&#39;t see anything mentioned in the news.  Who knows what we were potentially exposed to.  No seemed to be worrying about all the passengers that got off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh shit. Wonder why it took so long for this to come up lol?</p>

<p>Cholera isn&#39;t really communicable, which doesn&#39;t explain the quarantine-like measures. But, unknown pathogens probably initiate some kind of protocol designed to capture anything before it gets loose. And 2 of these flights were on UAE flights. Not sure how easy it is to travel from Yemen &gt; USA, but this is a good Occams Razor. </p>

<p>It is transmitted by water contaminated with the bodily fluids of a sick person, or direct contact with those fluids. It can be transmitted by food that has been exposed to the fluids as well.</p>

<p>It does not travel well. The latency period is 1-2 days and the sick person is completely immobilized by non-stop diarrhea and vomiting. Cholera doesn&#39;t look like anything but Cholera.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are EXACTLY the threads I have been taking about. Take the news that is &quot;out there&quot;, stick it in a mega thread, and we have a perfect place to discuss things without being fragmented.</p>

<p>Now, have you heard about the quite recent pesticide system they have introduced on planes? They saturate the air with a mist that supposedly is to kill bugs. The problem with any pesticide is that it&#39;s poison. Low enough concentration not to affect humans they say. Harmless. Until you stick them on a plane for 12 hours and just so happen to dial up the pesticide system just a bit more. Maybe someone saw some cockroaches and dosed the plane once too often? </p>

<p>What are done common side effects of pesticide poisoning? </p>

<p>Headache, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, restlessness, nervousness, perspiration, nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite, loss of weight, thirst, moodiness, soreness in joints, skin irritation, eye irritation, irritation of the nose and throat.</p>

<p>Sound familiar?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently flew overseas and as we exited the airplane a teenage boy began projectile vomiting on the ramp. 
When we returned from our trip some people in our group were sick on the plane and had to throw up mid-flight. When we were all back in the USA they remained sick for about 2 days before feeling fine again. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not stating this was by any means the same thing but figured I&#39;d give a first hand account of my recent experience while traveling. Many people were just outright sick on the planes - sneezing, coughing, vomiting, and so on. Perhaps the germs on on the airplanes themselves and spreading the same stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing better specifically the past couple of days perhaps.</p>

<p>This is news, with <em>maybe</em> a conspiracy tone to it. Instead of flooding r/conspiracy with a lot of topics with random thoughts and links, why not keep them all focused in one place? With all the info in one place we can pick through it and easier combine different viewpoints and perhaps deduce what is going on - and do it much faster than we otherwise could if the topic was fragmented across dozens of threads.</p>

<p>Also, if it was a few planes only... nothng much to say. But I think we have 8 planes already that have been grounded, quarantined with people getting (seriously) ill. We are talking about thousands of passengers that have been exposed to something with hundreds falling ill and barely a peep from anyone that should answer the questions.</p>

<p>Just I noticed this as I was looking at the news, thought it might be pertinent to this conversation ....</p>

<p>&quot;A British man has died after needing medical attention on a flight to Ibiza.</p>

<p>The Jet2 flight from Manchester diverted to Toulouse on Saturday evening due to the medical emergency.&quot;</p>

<p>But I&#39;ve also noticed a Qantas non-stop Australia to London flight was turned back after a passenger became &#39;hyper-aggressive like a cornered animal&#39;  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/qantas-nonstop-australia-to-london-flight-turns-back-after-passenger-became-hyperaggressive-like-a-a3931111.html">https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/qantas-nonstop-australia-to-london-flight-turns-back-after-passenger-became-hyperaggressive-like-a-a3931111.html</a> </p>

<p>Totally understand and empathise that a long haul flight can be hellish on the mind,  but this flight was returned to Perth just two hours into the 17-hour flight.</p>

<p>I would suggest just two hours on a plane is a relative short time to  make someone, &#39;hyper aggressive, like a cornered animal&#39;. </p>

<p>Yes, if a person was real scared of flying I can see it - but if a person was just <em>that</em> scared of flying why would they jump on a 17hr flight?</p>

<p>&quot;The pilot made the decision to alert the New Zealand Ministry of Health as a precautionary measure to check the health of some passengers who felt unwell ...</p>

<p>.... appeared that a significant number of people on the flight had returned from a pilgrimage to the Hajj where earlier in the week there was an outbreak of influenza.</p>

<p>Earlier, a Virgin spokeswoman said &#39;&#39;quite a few&#39;&#39; of the 157 passengers on board the flight from Melbourne began feeling &#39;&#39;quite unwell&#39;&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man. Hmm, measles? That would help the vaxxer&#39;s cause. I am of course treating this like there is an angle to all of this. Obviously 5 planes could randomly come down with biological problems in a week.</p>

<p>Measles outbreak would be really bad news. Especially if some of the reports are true that the vaccine is sometimes ineffective. It would explain why they are being relatively quiet too.</p>

<p>I wish we had passenger manifests and 30 day travel histories for all the people on these flights. Bust out the tin foil, yarn, and cork board and do this old school haha. </p>
