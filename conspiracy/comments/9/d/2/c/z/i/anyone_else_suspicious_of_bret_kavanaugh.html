       As you may know Brett K. worked under George Bush. Many Trump supporters are not fans of GW. There are a lot of files being sealed regarding his time under GW. I know that a lot of Trump supporters are big on transparency, as with the FISA court warrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is why aren't Brett's files unsealed to the public? He is going to be a judge for the rest of his life, why not see the docs? What is hidden? And today, Condaleeza Rice gave an introduction speech for Kavanaugh!? That should ring some alarms by default, no? What are your thoughts?

       Yes, I am. His blind, sometimes unsolicited support of presidential authority reeks to high heaven of a desire for a part in despotic rule. It's a nasty combo with
 Trump. We've been dealing with presidential overreach for a long time, and it is time to rebel. The Court is already in favor of corporations over people; so why would we support a Court appointee by a shit president who is firmly indebted to a number of global conglomerates? Trump is a failed businessman making decisions for our country that are destined to fail. Somehow, though, I think that's exactly what TPTB want. I'm utterly fascinated that we've put up with all this shit from our Presidents for the promise of a Dollar.

       I know the msm hits on this a lot, but it is important. Kavanaugh is unique because he is one of the few if not only federal judge to rule on net neutrality. His position was that Verizon has a first amendment right to block or prioritize traffic if they want to iirc..
      </p>
      <p>
       He will be the first on scotus to have ruled this way, and that is what got this guy here. The globalists are taking control of our country and NN is their biggest target.

       He has turned over 500,000 pieces of documents. More than the last five sc appointes together. The document the democrats are wanting or Bush presidential papers. As the staffer he did not author these papers,besides they are very hard to get released. Democrats are playing for the cameras.

       You know what we lawyers call releasing that many pointless documents?

       Flooding. That’s what he’s done. Flooded. Everyone has to spend tons of time reading these documents.

       In doing so everyone is overwhelmed and distracted from the real meat. Or they never get time to get to the good stuff because everyone is busy trying to digest the flooded documents.

       They did it so they can claim that the don't have time to read them all and the hearings should be delayed, but the truth is that they aren't reading them.  They just run them through a search engine and look for keywords.

       Very interesting but in the request which I just read from the senate they gave specifics. They asked for very specific dates. His response included documents from basically everything but those dates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m sure both sides are playing the games here sadly. I am really seeing more and more the differences in party are purely on paper. They are truly the same.

       He's kind of in a no win situation. If he doesn't send the documents then he will be accused of hiding something bad and if he is transparent then he's accused of document dumping. All documents should be digital these days so that they can be searched with ease.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public should probably prefer that he do the document dump. Even if it takes a year to go through all the documents, if they find anything he can still be impeached

       The Obama administration did the same thing during Kagan's confirmation (withholding documents related to her time working for the Clinton admin) so it looks like this is a normal thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's ok for the Obama administration, it should also be ok for Trump.  No double standards.

       Ok with what?  Withholding documents?  Sure.  It's the same with both Kagan and Kavanaugh.  The opposing party certainly has enough documents to come to a conclusion about whether or not they will vote to confirm the nominee.  All the bitching and moaning about needing more documents and more time to read them is just a delaying tactic.

       Well if you're so down with precedent then there is literally no greater delaying tactic than what the Republicans did with Garland, so the Dems should be able to do whatever they want without any conservatives complaining.

       Anyone can complain about anything they want, but do you honestly think the Democrats won't just do whatever they want if they have the numbers?

       Thanks for the link.  I appreciate you at least trying to back up your claim, which the article does to some extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two things I noticed.  There were approximately 1600 documents not released at the time of the article vs. over 100k for trumps nominee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sessions complained that they didn’t have enough time to review the documents, yet here the GOP is trying to ram trumps pick through without providing time to review the documents.  If you’re gonna raise a stink when Obama’s did it, then you should do so with trump.

       Kavanaugh was involved in the creation of many more documents than Kagan.  The number of documents requested by they Democrats for Kavanaugh are greater than the number of records requested for the last few SC nominees combined.  ~170,000 were reviewd for Kagan, and Dems have requested over 1 million for Kavanaugh.

       Turnabout is fair play.  The Dems are basically making the same argument now that the Reps did back then.  The Reps were ignored, now it's the Dems turn.

       If the Dems want to behave a certain way, they shouldn't complain when the Reps do the same thing.

       The bottom line is that this is just a stalling tactic.  It didn't work for the Republicans in 2010 and it won't work for the Dems now.

       The Dems didn't delay confirmation in 2010, so why should the Republicans do it now?  If we're trying to make sure that everyone plays by the same rules, the Repubs should just confirm Kavanaugh now.

       Agreed.   Very skeptical of this guy and the entire candidate selection front line.   Trump is being fed scrupulous names for so many roles.  He should rely more heavily on his two sons to apply 2nd and 3rd levels of intuitive sensing during candidate vetting.   Should have chosen Rand Paul.
