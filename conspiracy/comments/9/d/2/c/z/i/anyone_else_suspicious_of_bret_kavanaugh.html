        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As you may know Brett K. worked under George Bush. Many Trump supporters are not fans of GW. There are a lot of files being sealed regarding his time under GW. I know that a lot of Trump supporters are big on transparency, as with the FISA court warrants.</p>

<p>My question is why aren&#39;t Brett&#39;s files unsealed to the public? He is going to be a judge for the rest of his life, why not see the docs? What is hidden? And today, Condaleeza Rice gave an introduction speech for Kavanaugh!? That should ring some alarms by default, no? What are your thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I am. His blind, sometimes unsolicited support of presidential authority reeks to high heaven of a desire for a part in despotic rule. It&#39;s a nasty combo with
 Trump. We&#39;ve been dealing with presidential overreach for a long time, and it is time to rebel. The Court is already in favor of corporations over people; so why would we support a Court appointee by a shit president who is firmly indebted to a number of global conglomerates? Trump is a failed businessman making decisions for our country that are destined to fail. Somehow, though, I think that&#39;s exactly what TPTB want. I&#39;m utterly fascinated that we&#39;ve put up with all this shit from our Presidents for the promise of a Dollar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the msm hits on this a lot, but it is important. Kavanaugh is unique because he is one of the few if not only federal judge to rule on net neutrality. His position was that Verizon has a first amendment right to block or prioritize traffic if they want to iirc..</p>

<p>He will be the first on scotus to have ruled this way, and that is what got this guy here. The globalists are taking control of our country and NN is their biggest target.</p>

<p>They did it so they can claim that the don&#39;t have time to read them all and the hearings should be delayed, but the truth is that they aren&#39;t reading them.  They just run them through a search engine and look for keywords.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok with what?  Withholding documents?  Sure.  It&#39;s the same with both Kagan and Kavanaugh.

<p>Kavanaugh was involved in the creation of many more documents than Kagan.  The number of documents requested by they Democrats for Kavanaugh are greater than the number of records requested for the last few SC nominees combined.  ~170,000 were reviewd for Kagan, and Dems have requested over 1 million for Kavanaugh.</p>

<p>Turnabout is fair play.  The Dems are basically making the same argument now that the Reps did back then.  The Reps were ignored, now it&#39;s the Dems turn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.   Very skeptical of this guy and the entire candidate selection front line.   Trump is being fed scrupulous names for so many roles.  He should rely more heavily on his two sons to apply 2nd and 3rd levels of intuitive sensing during candidate vetting.   Should have chosen Rand Paul.  </p>

<p>Flooding. That’s what he’s done. Flooded. Everyone has to spend tons of time reading these documents. </p>

<p>In doing so everyone is overwhelmed and distracted from the real meat. Or they never get time to get to the good stuff because everyone is busy trying to digest the flooded documents. </p>
