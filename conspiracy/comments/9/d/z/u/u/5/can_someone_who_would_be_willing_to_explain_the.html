    <div class="md"><p>why is it shocking?</p>

<p>You obviously have a rather naive view of the system. A system run by humans is never bias free. Of course no one is ever going to admit that politics can affect publishing but it does happen in sometimes. I am not saying it&#39;s common or the rule but it&#39;s not impossible.</p>

<p>Something else that is not related to politics but to bias:</p>

<p>You say there are zero studies showing a link. If that were true how do you explain this. Medical science is not exact and you would expect to find a link simply by chance if you do enough studies.</p>

<p>Where are the studies? There must be some, finding an association by chance.</p>

<p>A system that is free of bias? </p>

<p>peer-review can not eliminate all biases. Publication bias for example. Perhaps half of studies are wrong despite peer-review.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>you either didn&#39;t read or understand the studies then. They have never shown that vaccines don&#39;t cause autism for example.</p>

Also there is aluminum, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium, thallium and zinc in vaccines. 
Again this is her answer to my question of why she chose not to vaccinate. </p>

<p>The second argument is that is &quot;causes&quot; autism. Personally, I feel like autism is in absolutely no way worse than childhood disease could be but again I vax so that&#39;s just my decision/perspective of that argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personal reasons for anti-vaccination: possible reactions, chemicals unhealthy, unnecessary and unnatural. Don’t really trust recommendations/pharmaceuticals all the time, especially for young children. What do we know? What components make them? Who backs them and what is their effectiveness? Do we really know the truth? Studies and information always come out over time. I do know there’s a time when you may just need to trust what doctors and medicine do but trying to do things most naturally is probably best. Improved living conditions are believed to have a lot to do with less disease and illness. It’s also said that sugar (especially in hot summer months) caused more illness and disease in children in earlier years. You can look into the books: Vaccines Are They Really Safe and Effective?, Immunization: Theory vs. Realty. Also, Dr. Sears (not the author of those) is a pediatrician (from a family of doctors) who discusses vaccines and alternative schedules. Some information may or may not be of interest, again- I find information changes a lot and there’s just so much we can’t be sure of but at least, things to consider.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are some of my considerations:</p>

<p>A) Vaccines save a lot of lives from very horrible diseases.</p>

<p>B) Not all vaccines are the same.  Some are safer, and/or more tried and tested than others.</p>

<p>C) New vaccines will be developed.  You can&#39;t generically state, &quot;Vaccines are safe&quot;.  It is amazing how many people assert that.</p>

<p>D) People really do have all sorts of adverse reactions to vaccines, ranging from minor side-effects to death, but that is not the norm.</p>

<p>E) Developing, manufacturing and distributing vaccines is a  business industry. There are some groups pushing for mandatory vaccinations.  That is a scary precedent to me.</p>

<p>I was vaccinated as a kid for the major diseases and am glad that I was. The protection is worth the risk.  At the same time, I find a less compelling risk/reward argument for getting an annual flu shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m seriously contesting that. I&#39;ve looked at the research on this for nearly 20 years. They do quite the opposite: They destroy immunity, cause the diseases they are supposed to prevent, create allergies and other auto-immune disorders, increase the likelihoods of cancer and other long-term illnesses, initiate mental debilitation, harm fertility – oh, and occasionally just outright kill people.</p>

<p>The &quot;data&quot; that backs up their efficacy varies from being tweaked to support hypotheses to outright fraudulent, largely financed by pharma companies and researchers who depend on them for their livelihood. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent question, and there are many ways to do this. One is to catch a disease going down the curve as the population develops a natural herd immunity to it, introduce a vaccine, then claim that the vaccine is responsible for the &quot;cure.&quot;</p>

<p>Another is to re-define the criteria of the disease and/or relabel it, as with what has happened in India; I&#39;ve seen articles on this being the case in Africa as well, but haven&#39;t looked into it. In India&#39;s case, they re-defined &quot;polio&quot; as &quot;acute flaccid paralysis&quot;; it is actually a part of the DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA that you can&#39;t have polio if you&#39;ve been vaccinated for it. So, the vaccine was giving everyone polio, but they couldn&#39;t call it &quot;polio.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/smoke-mirrors-and-disappearance-polio">http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/smoke-mirrors-and-disappearance-polio</a></p>

<p>Those are the two methods that come to mind immediately, and those two articles are a great place to start.</p>

<ol>
<li> Quality control can drift over time, what is going into your body?</li>
<li> There are side effects to vaccines. Far less common than the illnesses they prevent, but nonetheless some pretty terrible side effects are documented. Who gets to choose whether you are taking those risks?</li>
<li> malicious intent has been demonstrated and may happen again. I am reminded of the sterility claims about vaccines in Kenya. Or the birth control deployed by Israel during vaccinations of immigrants.</li>
<li> government mandates remove consumer choice. Choice is the best driver of quality and price. Without choice, big pharma can push almost any vaccine onto the mandatory schedule with some cheap lobbying dollars. I expect we are going to see vaccines for everything in the near future—most of it unnecessary or of dubious value.</li>
<li> we still don’t understand why first world countries have higher rates of diagnoses like autism. Vaccines were a theory, but shot down without much proof or research. I am NOT saying vaccines cause autism, so hold your shit.  I am saying we have an abnormally high rate of autism, much of it suddenly onset after tracking normal development milestones—and we don’t know why. I find it difficult to believe we can rule out something so thoroughly without identifying the actual cause. When you hear people say they do not know why something happens, but they know which of the correlated things it is not... you are dealing with politics or religion, not science.</li>
<li> in light of not knowing what harm vaccines may be causing our children, many parents are going to a delayed and spread out schedule of vaccination. The theory being that early vaccination may be worse than later and that multiple vaccines may aggravate more than one at a time. Both of these theories lack any basis in science, but they are different than what we have been doing and therein lies the value. It becomes a large study group. Vaccination records are maintained and could be collected. Outcomes of the standard schedule group and delayed schedule groups could be compared. The data could reinforce the harmlessness of early vaccination or suggest changes to the schedule are warranted. All through voluntary experimentation. I expect this practice will be outlawed next.</li>
<li> individual choice, especially over one’s body, is one of the most fundamental rights and freedoms we have in this life. We hold it sacred when it comes to the murder of unborn children (yes, that is an inflammatory description of abortion). Why is our right of individual self-direction sacrificed over vaccination because one <em>might</em> become sick and <em>might</em> infect another who was unable or unwilling to take the risk of vaccination for themselves and unwilling to quarantine or wear a mask? I cannot help but wonder about the motives of those who would take away our rights so cheaply so they can regularly inject an unidentifiable clear liquid into our veins on an annual basis.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a topic that I am very interested in, if for no other reason than being so divisive. The CDC states themselves that vaccines can/ have caused side effects ranging from mild to severe. It happens. The idea that vaccines cause autism is a big jump from the evidence, in my uneducated opinion. I have listened to some great interviews with pediatricians that disagree with the CDC schedule, for reasons that are scientific and understandable. These doctors are becoming more prominent in my area. They are not anti-vax, not PROVAX either. I gotta stress most people are not one or the other, simply just questioning the current schedule that is very aggressively pushed onto the public. Also I think the idea that anti-vax proponents are anti science morons who are trying to make money is a little far fetched. Especially compared to the multi BILLION dollar vaccine industry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first confusion which a lot of people have with the so-called anti-vaccine movement is that they have been wrongly labelled, the majority of them are not against vaccines, but they want to see a major improvement in the quality of the science used to back vaccines up. It is more accurate to say they want better vaccines with less side effects, ideally without the toxic ingredients used as preservatives and adjuvants.</p>

<p>They are unhappy with the industry refusing to fund the necessary studies to find out if vaccines are bringing a net benefit overall, the industry doesn&#39;t want to find the harm their products cause as it can mean loss of confidence, sales and also huge compensation payouts. Anti-vaccine people do not agree with it when industry whitewashes their products, plays games with data and uses statistics to lie or misrepresent.</p>

<p>I will provide some examples below of the things they are concerned about:-</p>

<p>A recent study found that the Tetanus vaccine was actually reducing life expectancy rather than increasing, yes, the vaccine was making people more likely to die.</p>

<p>&quot;the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere was violated.&quot;</p>

<p>Follow the money!! (see below)</p>

<p>How Much US Pediatricians Make From Vaccines</p>

<p>&quot;So how much money do doctors really make from vaccines? The average American pediatrician has 1546 patients, though some pediatricians see many more. The vast majority of those patients are very young, perhaps because children transition to a family physician or stop visiting the doctor at all as they grow up. As they table above explains, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays pediatricians $400 per fully vaccinated child. If your pediatrician has just 100 fully-vaccinated patients turning 2 this year, that’s $40,000. Yes, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays your doctor a $40,000 bonus for fully vaccinating 100 patients under the age of 2. If your doctor manages to fully vaccinate 200 patients, that bonus jumps to $80,000. V But here’s the catch: Under Blue Cross Blue Shield’s rules, pediatricians lose the whole bonus unless at least 63% of patients are fully vaccinated, and that includes the flu vaccine. So it’s not just $400 on your child’s head–it could be the whole bonus. To your doctor, your decision to vaccinate your child might be worth $40,000, or much more, depending on the size of his or her practice.</p>

<p>If your pediatrician recommends that your child under the age of 2 receive the flu vaccine–even though the flu vaccine has never been studied in very young children and evidence suggests that the flu vaccine actually weakens a person’s immune system over the long term–ask yourself: Is my doctor more concerned with selling me vaccines to keep my child healthy or to send his child to private school?&quot;</p>

<p>Under Freedom of Information we see that CDC experts privately admit the dangers of vaccines, they admit that vaccines are causing neurological problems, speech delays and they warn the information must be embargoed.</p>

<p>Key quotes below:-</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Johnston, pg. 14-15 &amp; 19-20: &quot;The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: &quot;This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... &quot;I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Weil, pg. 207: &quot;The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Brent, pg. 229 &quot;we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: &quot;that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: &quot;just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The questions should be far more nuanced: </p>

<p>Which specific vaccines have a proven track record of success? Some may sign up for polio vaccines but shun the rotovirus shot or flu shot. </p>

<p>What is the probability that I will contract the disease vs incur adverse effects from its vaccine? This may be a reason why some people don&#39;t want to take the polio vaccine, since it&#39;s been eradicated.</p>

<p>Knowing vaccines can and do cause often-undisclosed side effects, what is the harm if one were to contract the illness the vaccine is intending to fight? This might be why some vaccinate for diphtheria but not the flu, or even measles. </p>

<p>Is the current vaccination schedule--which has greatly increased the number of recommended vaccinations since the 1950s--safe and effective, or is there a way to space them out?</p>

<p>What is the trustworthiness of the literature and the bodies governing the matter?</p>
