        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I finished watching bits and pieces of this podcast and I can&#39;t help but feel a sense of hope. Elon is a billionaire and arguably one of the most powerful men in the world as far as influence goes. He just went on the record stating the &quot;Love is the answer.&quot;</p>

<p>As Joe pointed out, that is a very vulnerable thing to say as someone in that position as it requires the person strip off their facades and speak from the heart. I&#39;m also incredibly proud of Joe for how he well he responded to that in a sincere and honest way. That was a moving moment for me.</p>

<p>If you believe in this sort of thing, Elon Musk is a man with a destiny and perhaps one that is closely tied to the destiny of the human race as a whole. Not to mention that in my opinion, I believe Joe is also a &quot;somebody&quot; that is living up to his destiny of being the greatest podcaster in the world. It&#39;s really fascinating to see the two worlds colliding and perhaps witnessing the universe manifesting its great plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah as long as I see a billionaire saying “Love is the answer” on a fucking Joe Rogan podcast while he unsuccessfully takes a hit of a blunt, then I’m convinced there’s hope in this world.</p>

<p>/s</p>

<p>The only thing the billionaire Musk cares about is making his pockets bigger. The only thing billionaire multinational company Nike care about is making their pockets bigger. The second you try convince yourself these billionaires are trying to do good, and not just appear that way for PR/profit, you’ve fallen victim to TPTB and Late Stage Capitalism... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&gt;  Or a electric car company that is losing money </p>

<p>So you&#39;re implying he wants to lose money, and thus is not concerned with profits, like any normal business owner would be? </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&gt;   Or working so hard he loses his mind almost </p>

<p>Abusing ambien and mixing it with other drugs (like alcohol) will do that to you. </p>

<p>I think he&#39;s the perfect target :)</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve gathered, the &quot;mark of the beast&quot; relates either to its name or number - the latter of which being 666. </p>

<p>So this idea of the Beast is at the very foundation of what we are. I&#39;m not saying it should be worshiped, but it&#39;s not something we should repress or be fearful of, either. Either extreme would only lend more power to it.</p>

<p>The Beast should be understood and tamed. From within the individual. Only on this level can we sort out the chaos and create order.</p>

<p>His point of view we are already a cybernetic organism in symbiosis with AI, and our thumbs/fingers are the interface with that electronic &quot;consciousness&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Tbh I think neuralink is a great idea. I understand the hesitation with it, but here&#39;s my way of looking at it: currently there is research being done on cellular computers - computers that run off of chemical reactions of cells rather than electrical signals. They work the same as regular computers, except the input and output signals are in the form of chemical reactions rather than electricity. Just like we may one day be able to create an AI robot from a computer, you theoretically should be able to do the same thing with a cellular computer. And that is what we are - AI that runs on a cellular computer rather than an electrical computer. </p>

<p>So my line of reasoning is: it would be totally reasonable for a robot to upgrade its software if it were able to, so why not for us?</p>

They can be hacked and you&#39;d practically become a robot. They can be used to telepathically connect, or for that matter to have your thoughts read. As Joe was saying, there is no privacy once neuralink is installed because we get access to what&#39;s in eachothers&#39; brains. This isn&#39;t a software update, it&#39;s a hardware update. I like being part of my own consciousness, not a physically augmented collective consciousness.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao jeez he bases a lot of the first 60 seconds on ignorant understandings of physicists theories. I think the 12 dimensions thing was an attempt to explain away the newly emerging quantum physics theories in favor of string theory. Einstein refused to believe in many quantum theories, even so far as to call the idea of quantum entanglement (which we now know for a fact is real and observable) &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;.</p>

<p>And the dark matter thing, also just a theory that there is matter between galaxies because of the way galaxies move. The idea is that there has to be an outside force affecting galaxies in order to make them behave the way they do. But it&#39;s not extra-dimensional or gravity bleeding nonsense, the theory is just that there&#39;s no light being reflected off the matter and therefore to us it&#39;s &quot;dark&quot;.</p>

<p>Even anti-matter is just particles with a spin opposite its counterpart, not some sort of magic. We use anti-electrons in brain mapping, more widely known as positrons.</p>

<p>Also studies show we don&#39;t actually have free will, our brains perform automatically like our other organs, and consciousness only emerges to us as a perpetual retrospective analysis. If I were to live my life over again, without any knowledge of the events to come, I would still make all the same choices that led me to where I am now.</p>

<p>The way our brains work is incredible, but their speed only reaches to about 28 hertz. A modern PC is capable of over 5.0 gigahertz, so as soon as the singularity happens, shit is going to take off and change at at least 5 billion times the speed we think in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I wouldnt call Neuralink or other BCIs Artificial Intelligence at all. Though they would likely operate in conjunction with AI, I&#39;d use a term like Intelligence Augmentation or Amplification. But I think they are still a cause for concern. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ridiculous to assume that once some people start getting them, there will be a threshold population percentage, (maybe 51%) where when a certain amount of people augment their intelligence, those with &quot;natural&quot; intelligence will simply have to give in or fall behind society. We see this today with phones and internet access. You pretty much need a phone and internet access in some capacity to carry a job or go to school. </p>

<p>Navy Lieutenant Carl Governale wrote in his white paper on BCIs: &quot;connecting BCIs to a network will pose ethical, health, and operational risks. If a BCI becomes a two-way street, then anti-tamper, spoofing, intercept, and brain control are all considerations that must be incorporated in the performance parameters&quot;. That to me is a reason to take a big step back and ask if that&#39;s something we really want to be getting ourselves into in the first place. But at the end of the day I understand the answer to that will always be &quot;then someone else will do it.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look up the quantized inertia theory by Mike McCulloch. Explains away dark matter, as well as many other unknown physical phenomena. Most things I see like this are ridiculous, but as a physics BS I seriously think quantized inertia could be a big discovery.</p>

<p>An overview as I remember it: in order to preserve conservation of energy, where a inertial observer would see empty space, an accelerating observer would see EM radiation coming from the same spot. This is called Unruh radiation. But an accelerating observer also forms what is called a Rindler Event Horizon, because since he is accelerating there is a spot behind him where light will never reach him. And there is also a horizon in front of him, of the Hubble scope. The Unruh radiation from behind him must fit perfectly within the event horizons, because if they extended beyond it then it would not be a horizon. So since the event horizon behind him is shorter than in front of him, less wavelengths of EM radiation are able to fit behind him than in front of him. This difference in density of Unruh radiation can then be calculated to impose an effect equal to that of inertia. </p>

<p>For small accelerations (~10<sup>-10m/s<sup>2),</sup></sup> the Rindler event horizon approaches the Hubble horizon. Then, since the amount of EM wavelengths that can fit between the horizons are integer amounts, it leads to inertia being quantized for very small accelerations.</p>

<p>Using the value of inertia given by this for the small accelerations of the galaxies on the outer edge, rather than the regular equation for inertia, then outputs the correct rotations of galaxies without the need for dark matter. Galaxies spin too fast, so scientists tried to add more matter to make it work, but the theory also works if you decrease inertia, as is done here.</p>

Musk has been surrounded with controversies about not treating his employees at Tesla nearly as well as they have the right to be treated (+ there have been a few more instances where he acted in an unsavoury manner) - let us hope he can change that and follow through with his actions as well.</p>

<p>I do have a feeling he is good at heart and not a psychopath like the rest of them. I could always be wrong, but that is simply my feeling for Musk (as well as Rogan).</p>

<p>No Doppler shift is taught in middle school science classes. Not College level physics.</p>

<p>Why are you so incapable of looking up anything before you speak about it?  You just assume things then proceeded as if you are an expert in the field.</p>

<p>See here.  Raw data / info / setup until around 7:00 IIRC</p>

<p><em>These are the results of a group project which took place during the September Equinox 2017. 23 participants in 9 different countries conducted a simple scientific experiment similar to that of Eratosthenes over 2000 years ago.</em></p>

<p><em>The test is simple. Using the Latitude of each participant (as Longitude will be either 180° or 0°) The sun&#39;s elevation angle was measured during Solar Noon. These angles were then placed across both a Flat Plane and a Sphere to see which model the angles correspond to.</em></p>

<p>You will ignore the above and attack most likely.  You know you can&#39;t risk actually doing experiments because you appear to be incapable of admitting you are wrong about something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, Musk started everything when he did a PR stunt and acted like he was the next Messiah. He promptly went on to not contribute a single thing towards the actual rescue efforts, and still tried to take credit and act like he was the Chosen One. </p>

<p>The person leading the rescue mission stated that Musk doesn&#39;t understand how small some of the passages/entrances are to the caves (some as small as 60cm) and that his sub was completely unfeasible. He labeled it a blatant PR stunt (which it was), and yes, said on record that Musk could stick the sub where it hurts. </p>

<p>If that&#39;s grounds for a billionaire to start throwing false accusations so his cult fan base can have an excuse to run with instead of facing the actual truth, then I guess, we can agree to disagree lol.</p>

<p>The leader of the rescue mission stated they were going through with their plan, and if unsuccessful, they would &#39;consider&#39; Musk&#39;s. He basically implied they didn&#39;t give a shit about Musk&#39;s sub, which of course, rubbed Musk the wrong way because he wants to put his brand name in the middle of everything, which then led him to make another false accusation that the man was exaggerating his position (he wasn&#39;t, he was literally the leader of the rescue mission and had close to 20 years of experience navigating that exact cave system that the children were stuck in). </p>

<p>So we have 3 false accusations from Musk, to divert attention from his obvious PR stunt... also, whilst Musk was trying to defend his sub, he said he would fly to cave itself and record a video of his sub working successfully! You might&#39;ve guessed it, we&#39;re still waiting on that video... </p>

<p>&quot;He added Musk was &#39;asked to leave very quickly&#39; after he turned up at the cave entrance.&quot; That&#39;s your innovative hero? Got asked to leave very quickly lmao.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, with tesla specifically it was out of his desire to see electric vehicles come to fruition imho. Profit would&#39;ve been a side-benefit, not his primary motive.</p>

<p>Think about it. If he wanted to make money there are million other companies he could&#39;ve purchased. Maybe he was thinking in some extremely maniacal, long-term plan where he is successful and everyone is driving his cars, and then he has control like the current oil industry and makes a lot of money, but instead, he&#39;s invested his own money time and time again and almost saw the company fail.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was then the sole investor in their $40M Series E round in mid-2008, during the financial crisis, and arranged a $40M bridge loan in late 2008, saving the company from bankruptcy; and took the reigns as CEO.

</blockquote>

<p>I dunno... there&#39;s a lot of bullshit in politics and the media, and I see Musk as something different. He would be a better president than Trump, no doubt, and imho, would be better than Obama. What about &#39;president of the world?&#39; Would you even trust anyone for that job? Hard question, I&#39;d probably so no... but there is some merit to the argument. At this point, I feel like it&#39;d be a smart move making Musk President of the world just to get us out of this shit hole we&#39;ve dug ourselves into. </p>

<p>Okay, honestly, please take this circlejerk back to <a href="/r/Futurology">/r/Futurology</a> LOL. I am rationally analysing Musk’s actions while supporting evidence to claims of his lies and deception, while people tell me their ‘feelings’ on how they think Musk should be a global dictator... reality truly is stranger than fiction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, but it&#39;s not like the Tesla we have today. He put a lot into it, and it was probably smarter for him to buy a company than start one completely from scratch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Elon Musk became CEO of Tesla by virtue of (a) being the best candidate for the job, (b) co-founding the company, (c) financing the company,  (d) bailing out the company during the 2008 financial crisis, and (e) fighting for the job.</p>

<p>Elon Musk is considered a co-founder of the company. The company was incorporated in July 2003. Elon joined as Chairman of the Board in February 2004, investing in their Series A. He participated in their Series A (2004), Series B (2005), Series C (2006), Series D (2007), and Series E (2008).</p>

<p>In 2007 he converted 8 million preferred shares into common in order to control enough votes to remove Martin Eberhard as CEO, and then also participated in a bridge loan to avoid an attempt by Vantage Partners to dilute him with a new round.</p>

<p>He was then the sole investor in their $40M Series E round in mid-2008, during the financial crisis, and arranged a $40M bridge loan in late 2008, saving the company from bankruptcy; and took the reigns as CEO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just can&#39;t believe the flat earth theory. It makes no sense to me from what I personally understand from the physics I&#39;ve observed on the world around me.</p>

<p>I believe in the theory that space is a vacuum, and it&#39;s fairly simple to understand why objects in a vacuum naturally form a spherical shape. It&#39;s the shape with the highest face area to volume ratio and is the &quot;easiest&quot; shape to form (no edges)... it&#39;s why bubbles are spheres instead of any other shape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve only seen one thing that could potentially disprove the flat earth theory. and I&#39;ve done a lot of research on it in the past. I guess the issue is your view that the Earth is flat with space surrounding it. Thats not the actual view of the flat Earth model, its that theres the Earth, which is circular, and Antarctica is on the outer rim of the circle. Then there is essentially a dome covering it, called the Firmament in the Bible, and the Heavens above that. Stars aren&#39;t actual astronomical bodies as we know it, instead they&#39;re smaller objects (or even living things as described in the first book of Enoch, the only trustworthy one imo) on or close to the firmament.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the clarification. Is that all that exists? What is beyond the heavens or this firmament?</p>

<p>I tend to take issue with such an egotistical, humanistic type of view in that we are the center of everything. It just doesn&#39;t make sense from any perspective that I look at it from.</p>

<p>How was this flat disc thing made? By a god?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything was made by God, just like the Bible says. The heavens mean actual Heaven like the Bible says, where God and the Angels reside. Thats all that exists according to the theory.</p>

<p>The only other worldview of some flat Earthers is that everything is a simulation. However that has no actual substantive evidence to back it up, and it drives people away from the Bible. I guess another thing that got me believing in the Biblical flat Earth view was the stuff on nephilim and the (1st) Book of Enoch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. I was excited to just experience him in longform, and while he definitely exhibits that high genius aloofness, look at what he is doing. He has an altruistic big picture vision and he is moving forward with that vision at blazingly fast speeds.</p>

<p>I wanted him to be more emotional, engaged, and laid-back, but that is just not his style. He is NOT a PR guy, and nor should he be. That type of mind just keeps innovating until there is nothing more to improve. I&#39;m kind of suprised he&#39;s being &#39;allowed&#39; to progress as far as he has by shadow elements, giving the nature of his goals. Maybe he cracked a deal with them? I don&#39;t know, but if he means what he says, I think ultimately we as a species will be better for it.</p>

<p>I also definitely think that Joe&#39;s had a &#39;talkin to&#39;. Years ago, he would have been digging at N. Tesla conspiracies and that interview of Ol&#39; Musky&#39;s where he kinda downplays Nikola&#39;s AC current, we wouldn&#39;t be where we are today without it, so it begs the question of what he really thinks about Tesla in terms of the fringey-conspiritorial side of things. I&#39;ve been a big fan of the renewable energy push, as he puts it, there is a fuckin giant nuclear reactor in the sky that can power everything we do 100x over, if we just harness it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s things to dislike/hate about anybody. I disagree with the employee treatment for sure. I just don&#39;t think its sinister or malicious by nature, revolutions are not often peaceful in nature, and if it takes some sacrifice to get to a better and more proficient level of sustainability, I&#39;m for it. The human species is not scaling up economies, and we are exponentially increasing in population. At some point, we will come to resource choke points, then resource wars. The types of innovation he is bringing to the collective table are the types that might actually put a dent in the aforementioned issues of fast growing population and an ever shrinking resource pool. We just might have a chance, but its a precarious ledge we rest upon.</p>

He constantly was referring to the bandwidth of our connection to our technology, which in stupid-speak is essentially how fast can we give and receive information through our phones/computers/etc.  Though he did not specify I believe he&#39;s got people working on making typing obsolete, a.k.a. some sort of direct brain link to the internet where we can transmit our thoughts into typed format.  </p>

<p>This was on the front page of reddit and everyone agreed that Elon is human filth who treads his employees like shit!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, Musk started everything when he did a PR stunt and acted like he was the next Messiah. He promptly went on to not contribute a single thing towards the actual rescue efforts, and still tried to take credit and act like he was the Chosen One. </p>

<p>The person leading the rescue mission stated that Musk doesn&#39;t understand how small some of the passages/entrances are to the caves (some as small as 60cm) and that his sub was completely unfeasible. He labeled it a blatant PR stunt (which it was), and yes, said on record that Musk could stick the sub where it hurts. </p>

<p>If that&#39;s grounds for a billionaire to start throwing false accusations so his cult fan base can have an excuse to run with instead of facing the actual truth, then I guess, we can agree to disagree lol.</p>

<p>The leader of the rescue mission stated they were going through with their plan, and if unsuccessful, they would &#39;consider&#39; Musk&#39;s. He basically implied they didn&#39;t give a shit about Musk&#39;s sub, which of course, rubbed Musk the wrong way because he wants to put his brand name in the middle of everything, which then led him to make another false accusation that the man was exaggerating his position (he wasn&#39;t, he was literally the leader of the rescue mission and had close to 20 years of experience navigating that exact cave system that the children were stuck in). </p>

<p>So we have 3 false accusations from Musk, to divert attention from his obvious PR stunt... also, whilst Musk was trying to defend his sub, he said he would fly to cave itself and record a video of his sub working successfully! You might&#39;ve guessed it, we&#39;re still waiting on that video... </p>

<p>&quot;He added Musk was &#39;asked to leave very quickly&#39; after he turned up at the cave entrance.&quot; That&#39;s your innovative hero? Got asked to leave very quickly lmao.</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t blocked me because then you will not know what I am saying.  You should block me then I would still be able to respond to you and you would not know.  It would save me time.</p>

<p>And yes, the Doppler effect is taught in college physics.... should I link you a video lecture, PowerPoint presentation, or just speak from experience when I myself learned about it in college physics class?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never said it wasn&#39;t taught in college physics did I.  You strongly implied it was a college level subject to which I corrected you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, well now that you have admitted you’re not going to ether show your work, give any hint of knowing what you’re talking about, or do anything except continue your parasitic echolalia, you can stop spamming this and every thread with non sequitur references that mean nothing to anyone unfortunate enough to witness your bizarre obsession with my every comment. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny you never show your work.  You honestly want me to post my GPS coordinates so people like you can know my physical address???</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s a difference between telling a middle school student “hear the way a car horn gets higher as the car approaches and lower as it passes you? That’s the Doppler effect” and a college physics class learning about mechanical waves. But then again, all you require to consider yourself an expert is to be able to regurgitate a few words. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since when are EM waves &quot;mechanical waves&quot;?  The Aether isn&#39;t real you know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All you can do is say “spend 80 dollars;” no jackass, I’m not going to spend 80 dollars because my NASA loving stalker said to. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You won&#39;t even do simple geometry experiments that require zero money.  You basically appear to not have done any experiments at all.  </p>

<p>All you have are feelings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I wouldnt call Neuralink or other BCIs Artificial Intelligence at all. Though they would likely operate in conjunction with AI, I&#39;d use a term like Intelligence Augmentation or Amplification. But I think they are still a cause for concern. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ridiculous to assume that once some people start getting them, there will be a threshold population percentage, (maybe 51%) where when a certain amount of people augment their intelligence, those with &quot;natural&quot; intelligence will simply have to give in or fall behind society. We see this today with phones and internet access. You pretty much need a phone and internet access in some capacity to carry a job or go to school. </p>

<p>Navy Lieutenant Carl Governale wrote in his white paper on BCIs: &quot;connecting BCIs to a network will pose ethical, health, and operational risks. If a BCI becomes a two-way street, then anti-tamper, spoofing, intercept, and brain control are all considerations that must be incorporated in the performance parameters&quot;. That to me is a reason to take a big step back and ask if that&#39;s something we really want to be getting ourselves into in the first place. But at the end of the day I understand the answer to that will always be &quot;then someone else will do it.&quot; </p>

<p>All of it. I’ve specifically asked you numerous times now to show your work in gathering this data, explaining the steps of how you obtain, process, and interpret it, showing any math you use. It’s not that hard to upload a photograph of some math problems or equipment and write your username on something in the corner. This is an easy way you could back your claim that you’ve done this experiment “many times.” Make a YouTube video. Post it to a space fan boy or Scientism fanboy subreddit. But no, you can give no evidence that you even understand the sentence fragments above, let alone that you have performed the experimentation which you claim. </p>

<p>You will just say it is Photoshopped.  Well you will probably type photoshop because proper nouns are difficult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just can&#39;t believe the flat earth theory. It makes no sense to me from what I personally understand from the physics I&#39;ve observed on the world around me.</p>

<p>I believe in the theory that space is a vacuum, and it&#39;s fairly simple to understand why objects in a vacuum naturally form a spherical shape. It&#39;s the shape with the highest face area to volume ratio and is the &quot;easiest&quot; shape to form (no edges)... it&#39;s why bubbles are spheres instead of any other shape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve only seen one thing that could potentially disprove the flat earth theory. and I&#39;ve done a lot of research on it in the past. I guess the issue is your view that the Earth is flat with space surrounding it. Thats not the actual view of the flat Earth model, its that theres the Earth, which is circular, and Antarctica is on the outer rim of the circle. Then there is essentially a dome covering it, called the Firmament in the Bible, and the Heavens above that. Stars aren&#39;t actual astronomical bodies as we know it, instead they&#39;re smaller objects (or even living things as described in the first book of Enoch, the only trustworthy one imo) on or close to the firmament.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything was made by God, just like the Bible says. The heavens mean actual Heaven like the Bible says, where God and the Angels reside. Thats all that exists according to the theory.</p>

<p>The only other worldview of some flat Earthers is that everything is a simulation. However that has no actual substantive evidence to back it up, and it drives people away from the Bible. I guess another thing that got me believing in the Biblical flat Earth view was the stuff on nephilim and the (1st) Book of Enoch.</p>
