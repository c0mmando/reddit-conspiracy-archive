        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Slavery never went away.  There&#39;s just different levels.</p>

<p>The majority live pay check to paycheck for a reason.  You make just enough to keep yourself well enough to go to work and make your slave owners rich.  Only difference today is that we buy our own shelter and our own food with the little money we are given rather than our slave masters providing it for us.  We believe this means we are &quot;free&quot;</p>

<p>Now, if you dont make enough to even live pay check to pay check well you&#39;re in luck.  The state will come and fill in the blanks for you.  How nice of them!  They keep you dependent on them for survival, while using you to scare the people living pay check to pay check into falling in line.  Oh, they also use the working vs freeloading narrative to keep you from teaming up.  &quot;freedom&quot;</p>

<p>But hey, not everyone is poor or lives pay check to pay check.  Some people are actually pretty well off.  You might have it &quot;better&quot; than those on the lower levels but you&#39;re still working to make someone else rich.  Just because you&#39;re given extra luxuries doesnt mean you&#39;re not dependent on your slave master for survival.  </p>

<p>Some even own their own companies though, and that means they don&#39;t have a master to answer to.  When you get to this level you might think you&#39;re truly free but lets be real here.  You&#39;ve only graduated to being an &quot;uncle tom.&quot;  You now own your own set of slaves who work for you, but you&#39;re business still relies on the laws and regulations that the real masters put into place.  One audit, one change in the stock market, one new regulation, or one new breakthrough can end you all the same.</p>

<p>Slavery never went away.  It just learned how to trick you into thinking it did.</p>

<p>I realized this morning that for most people at the bottom, working a low-wage job, the ROI on the misery endured is comparable to being homeless.  The living conditions affordable with a low-wage job aren&#39;t worth the security.  People in low-wage jobs are receiving less and less stability for the amount of dignity given up.</p>

<p>For people without kids <strong>or parents</strong> <em>(that&#39;s how fucked up our country is)</em> to watch, homelessness might be the more rational choice.</p>

<p>If you think that is solving the imbalance of power....you have a ton of living to experience yet. You are showing your naiveté by writing that statement.</p>

<p>Have ran multiple &#39;successful&#39; businesses..... you realize one thing after awhile:</p>

<p>1) You can never compete with the people who supplant labor laws because they have special access to slave wage labor. You do to but not at the levels/prices they have access to.</p>

<p>2) Those same people if they deem your product/service profitable enough can/will come in &amp; rip your team apart &amp; hijack your business/intellectual property without recourse.</p>

<p>3) Those same people have access to funds at rates you will never be able to touch even with an excellent &#39;credit rating&#39;.</p>

<p>Anything less than that is just masturbating yourself into thoughts that &#39;you made it&#39; because you have money, housing &amp; time to take vacations.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still a massive imbalance of power &amp; democracy because your vote/wishes have nothing to do with the puppet stage act/propaganda that directs it all.</p>

<p>Unless you are ready to kill, cheat &amp; steal you are a slave to a supplanted system of sociopaths in multi-generational power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>depends on where you draw the box, man.  we&#39;re all slaves to something.  for instance, we&#39;re slaves to the limitations of our physical bodies, or our minds, or our perspectives, etc.  the fact that we are limited beings will not change.  there&#39;s strength in this too, however, when We figure out how to use our collectiveness to test theories out and report back to the crowd.  so we got that going on.  really i think the whole slave thing ultimately comes down to how do we minimize our limitations - and that&#39;s a question of better design. </p>

<p>also, in the design sense, hierarchies (aka slavery) are ripe for lulz enacted via the device of slack.  good times, you know.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just an illusion created by the fact that true self-reliance is fundamentally impossible - even more so if your goal is to enjoy a long, healthy modern life. In no way are conditions for the overwhelming majority of Americans at all similar to those... enjoyed by actual slaves. Who were owned by people who themselves, by your logic, were slaves to those above them.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, the only thing 99.999% of us are slaves to are consequences. We enjoy the freedom to do so much, but never free of consequence.</p>

<p>Not that the uberwealthy aren&#39;t trying to rob us blind and turn the clock back to the starvation wages and inhumane practices of yesteryear, though. They surely are. They&#39;d be locking us into the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory until our shift was over, if they could.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re confusing colaboring and isolation as a dichotomy for self reliance when self reliance can be utilized with either. It just depends on circumstances. Some wild men in the woods get by self reliantly. Others use some social constructs of the modern world while still maintaining self reliance. Self reliance doesn’t solely equal no man made contact or cave Manning it in nature—at the end of the day efficient methods would also still be used, and most likely tools invented to make quality of life easier. The view of self reliance you’re talking about sounds like some strange world where someone has no need beyond themselves—they are born and immediately begin gathering their own food, building their own shelter and creating their own tools with no outside contact or knowledge borrowed—this as you say not relying on any others. You’re treading on philosophical statements on ontology and epistemology that go beyond the concept of colloquial self reliance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously. This post is an insult to the millions subsisting in actual indentured servitude. Legit slavery is alive and well. 40.3 <a href="https://polarisproject.org/human-trafficking/facts">million people</a> are victims of trafficking with 80% of those in trapped labor. </p>

<p>Conditions are horrific: just ask any Nepali who was shipped off to Qatar under the guise of getting stable work, only to have their passports stripped and forced to work in brutal, inhumane conditions for free (because they were told they had to pay back their plane tickets). Many don&#39;t return home because they are then organ harvested. The brutality repeats itself all over the world, in which entire villages are told to go work in mines or else expect to be murdered. </p>

You could make the same argument going to the beginning of man.  You have to provide for yourself and family to live. If you view that as slavery then it’s all just how you interpret life itself.  I wonder what true freedom would mean to you then?  Just dicking around with zero responsibilities your whole life?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You make just enough to keep yourself well enough to go to work </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve worked a variety of low-wage and middle-management type jobs.  I&#39;ve been homeless twice.  I realized this morning how much most peoples&#39; sheer <strong>level</strong> of misery isn&#39;t lower than that of most homeless.  Wage-slavery is just a different <strong>type</strong> of misery.  </p>

<p>For people without kids or parents to support, is the money worth the hassle?  Most of what we need money for is conveniences.  Are the conveniences worth the misery to maintain?  Is the job at McD&#39;s or Wal-Mart or cleaning hotel rooms worth the apartment the job is barely paying for?  </p>

<p>And how much dignity did that paycheck cost you? What bizarre-ass schedule change did you accept for an extra 20 or 60 bucks?  There&#39;s not much pride to be found in homelessness, but at least you can pee when you want. How many Amazon workers can say that?</p>

<p>Something else about being homeless is how much easier it is to go somewhere else.  How many jobs in the U.S. provide reasonable expectation of being able to move upward from one&#39;s current circumstances?  In other words, at the end of the week, how much of your paycheck can you put in the bank?  And, incidentally, while you were living under self-imposed austerity measures hoping for a better future, how much of your efforts &amp; time went to people leeching off of you <strong>now?</strong></p>

<p>For the benefits provided relative to the amount of work done and misery endured, homelessness is becoming the more rational choice.  YMMV, but, given some basic trapping, hunting and camping skills, spending the rest of my days bicycling everywhere that isn&#39;t developed seems a helluvalot more fulfilling and <strong>moral</strong> than what U.S. society prioritizes.  </p>

<p>Being homeless also means contributing less to the misery our conveniences cost everyone else.  No soldier died for the oil I didn&#39;t spend not commuting.  No place to store crap means less crap bought.  Not buying less crap means contributing less to the likelihood of some Chinese factory girl killing herself.</p>

<p>I find it hard to imagine starting out in my early 20&#39;s again.  For alot of younger people, the rational choice might be <strong>not</strong> investing energy in non-homeless society&#39;s illusion of stability.  Its pretty obvious our society is more interested in feeding off people who are starting out rather than providing them a place to grow and take root.  </p>
