<p>I have NO fucking reason to trust our intelligence agencies considering what they&#39;ve done in the past (Waco, MKultra, crack epidemic of the 80s, Fast &amp; Furious, non-existent &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot;). No fellow conspiratard would trust these agencies. </p>

<p>I voted for the SCOTUS nominations, possible immigration reform, 2nd amendment protection, and low taxes I would be guaranteed by <em>voting</em> (not supporting) for the Republican candidate.

<p>No he isn&#39;t. Trump doesn&#39;t have an ideology. He just jumps from one stupid idea to another stupid idea. He also listen to a lot of idiots like Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller and Alex Jones.</p>

<p>Trump is merely a puppet. He is the idiot clown who was so tempted by the corruption of the Presidency he was willing to trade exposing his own crimes and the crimes of his family for the accolades of people who think the world in 6000 years old and the 1950s were the glory days because they watched television programs.</p>

<p>Conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy with a hostile foreign power and conspiracy to defraud a Federal election. all this has already been admitted by Trump and Trump associates both in public and in various court filings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I certainly lean right but anyone with objective reasoning or centrist beliefs can see that this Russia narrative is fucking nothing (it&#39;s fucking nothing even if Trump gets charged, look at John Edwards). </p>

<p>Even socialists/independents on the political spectrum like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHZXVWUxxDU">Jimmy Dore</a> (Bernie supporter) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnPAxdII5PU">can see through this insane facade</a>, that it&#39;s simply a reaction from the establishment because they wanted war with Russia, and Hillary would have gone to war with Russia had she been elected. </p>

<p>Beyond political parties, beyond domestic corporations, beyond the establishment media, the power that lies at the top is the military-industrial complex. Much of it is zionist-controlled, pushed by neocons and neolibs. This Washington establishment has neocons (McCain) and neoliberals (Clinton), a grasp in BOTH parties. Many of said neocons are now trying to infiltrate and subvert the Trump administration (Bolton, Sessions, etc). </p>

<p>Both the RNC and the DNC are fucking corrupt to the core. And in the past 3 years, more people have been exposed to this fact than ever before--thanks the two outsiders who created a new movement and energized the people--Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. I would never vote for Bernie or support his policy, but holy shit we needed him. Same with Trump. They both excused the establishment core of both parties.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing that people should be criticizing Trump. I&#39;m arguing that people won&#39;t stop complaining about Trump <em>supporters</em> in this subreddit, when their candidate is genuinely being fucked over by the Washington elite at this point. Their presence on this sub is completely justifiable.  </p>

<p>Your misunderstanding of what I was trying to say with my post is a perfect analogy for how chaotic and confusing the Information Age has caused our society to be. </p>

<p>PLEASE CRITICIZE TRUMP!! We need it for our democracy. I sure as shit wouldn&#39;t want to continue supporting Trump if I learn from a post I see on here that he&#39;s screwing me over. Knowledge is power. I&#39;m just defending the Trump <em>supporters</em> in this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really simple: there are zionist-controlled puppets grasped in both parties. </p>

<p>They were banking on either one of their Neoliberals (Hillary) or one of their Neocons (Bush, Cruz, Rubio, etc.) on getting the presidency and giving them their war with Russia and Iran. Not an outsider like Bernie or Trump.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simple. If the two main political parties can be easily controlled/manipulated by nominating/funding an establishment-approved candidate (regardless of the voters&#39; preferences), then they don&#39;t have to worry about the outcome of the general election.  </p>

<p>Both parties have nomination processes with candidates <strong>of the party establishment&#39;s choosing</strong>, and they aren&#39;t even legally obliged to nominate the candidate with the most votes in the primaries.</p>

<p>It could all be political theater cognitive dissonance via the &#39;us vs them&#39; narrative while the deep state continues to rape &amp; pillage in the background.</p>

<p>It isnt purely Conservative vs Liberals. There is a 3rd party profiteering/robbing the system in the background.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been waiting since 9/11 for someone to call out the absolute complete bullshit from the alphabet agencies and the media. Look, some of you are young, But I was 18 when 9/11 happened and was already trying to read everything I could find online. I guess you could say I was &quot;awake&quot; from an early age. </p>

<p>After 9/11 the script was already written and every single day on the news, you were bombarded with &quot;Weapons of mass destruction&quot;, and &quot;smoking gun&quot;,  this shit went on for like well over a year. You see the sheep were easily convinced to go to war with Afghanistan, because, well Bin Laden. However, everyone disagreed with war in Iraq, initially. &quot;Wait a minute didn&#39;t we put Saddam in power, back in the the late 70&#39;s&quot;?</p>

<p>When the U.S finally went to war with Iraq the average person wasn&#39;t angry. They were happy.</p>

<p>COUNT DOWN TO IRAQ COUNT DOWN TO IRAQ
That&#39;s all you&#39;d see for over a year on the news. The same characters from the same agencies said the same thing on the same media.</p>

<p>Does it sound familiar? This shit with Trump is the same playbook. RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA COLLUSION COLLUSION COLLUSION. When evident pops up that contradicts the narrative, quick switch to some whores, or some internal bullshit... New newscycle ok boys back on the Russia narrative. Trump might do shit I don&#39;t agree with but the fact that the Media and the Alphabets are against him; tells me straight up he is on my side. Wake the fuck up people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s all theater. If you take a side, it’s like acting in real life based upon characters in a play. At the end of the day, both sides are putting on a production, so both sides should be criticized. Just because it appears that the intelligence agencies don’t like the president, doesn’t mean it’s truth. When they don’t like someone, they don’t become president, and if they do, they get assassinated. If not, they served a greater purpose to screw over Americans.</p>

They spam pro-Trump videos and articles, astroturf the comments, and eventually infiltrate the moderation teams. They’ve admitted to doing this on multiple occasions, and I’m sure you can find posts outlining this here from the past couple years.</p>
