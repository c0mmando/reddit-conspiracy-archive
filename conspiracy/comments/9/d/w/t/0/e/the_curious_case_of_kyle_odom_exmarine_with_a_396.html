        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-09-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/WestworldStainnnnnn.html">WestworldStainnnnnn</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For those who have never heard of story before, do a little quick searching Kyle Odom. You may or may not remember, but before shootings became considered a common occurrence in society, Odom was the man who fired 12 shots point blank towards a prestigious pastor by the name of Tim Remington.</p>

<p>It only gets weirder from here..</p>

<p>Let me make a quick disclaimer: I am not what one would call your typical conspiracy theorist. I probably flat out annoy conspiracy theorists because I’m so damn pessimistic and quick to shoot things down because there is generally a quick explanation to most things.</p>

<p>I have always dismissed theories of Martians living amongst us and even more so, super intelligent reptilian beings. </p>

<p>Before you read any further, please read Kyle Odom’s short Manifesto <a href="https://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message3113527/pg1">Manifesto</a></p>

<p>This is no ordinary tin foil battery suspect nonsense. This guy was ex military, extremely smart and educated, finishing a Master’s in genetics with a 3.96 GPA, had just been accepted into a PhD program, and then supposedly  all of the phenomena started. In his manifesto (that he threw over the White House gate to make sure persons of importance obtained the information) he provided his college transcripts, marine honorable discharge forms and was hell bent on telling the public he’s not crazy.</p>

<p>Long story short:</p>

<p>-gets on plane after being accepted to Doctorate program</p>

<p>-is told by random plane passerby to obtain a burner cell phone (Odom at this point believes he is being recruited by a government agency such as CIA due to his achievements in Genetics research.</p>

<p>-nothing happens for a month or so, then his is contacted on the burner phone by a man named John, who works for Tim Remington, the church pastor who is eventually shot by Odom.</p>

<p>-these beings turn out to not be CIA, but are actually different beings that use human minds as a host to do their bidding here in our earthly realm. </p>

<p>-they have came from Mars, am the human population is nothing more than a huge experiment that is part of something bigger than we can currently comprehend.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>he becomes increasingly screwed with by these beings who are so advanced they have ways to manipulate bodily functions like heart rate where they continuously torment him, but don’t want him dead)</p></li>
<li><p>the guy giving commands and telling him about all this is none other than Tim Remington, the pastor, who says there is no heaven or hell, and these beings are our creators.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>-once Odom gained this knowledge he became frustrated in his PhD studies because he began to see all the flaws in his professors works and the things we got wrong about genetics and dna and apparently the reason he became a threat was his mind crossed the threshold of our current understanding of genetics.</p>

<p>-long story short, this goes on and he is continuously tormented by this Man Until he takes matters into his own hands and fired 12 shots point blank at the pastor with a .45, one of which hit him directly in the skull, and he made a VERY miraculous and immediate recovery, and has sense faded out of the media spotlight. Upon Odom’s sentencing he claimed no hard feelings against Odom and he was simply confused. </p>

<p>This is probably the craziest conspiracy I have stumbled on in recent years. I have no idea where the theory of reptilian Martian species ever came from, and have never subscribed to any of it. But cases like this do at least open up the possibilities in my mind of the unexplained.</p>

<p>This guy was a strenuous academic with a perfect criminal record who served his country with excellence in arguably the most strict military group (marines) we have. What’s your guys’ thoughts on all of this? Whether you think he’s schizophrenic or he’s not lying, one things for sure: he is not making this up and was willing to shoot someone else and have his own life taken if that’s what it came to. Not just another nut job spreading bs on Internet forums.</p>

<p>Jumping ahea</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s a lot of holes in the story and an ex-marine very high IQ genetics guy &quot;meditated&quot; and got fucked over by Reptilian overlords with super tech?? I hope it&#39;s bullshit and it sounds bullshit. :D</p>

<p>Could be real....or could be schizophrenia or he got MKUltra&#39;d by some evil fuckers.
I can&#39;t say for sure but for now......I&#39;ma just meditate. (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖) ( ͡◉ ͜ʖ ͡◉) </p>

<p>(Seriously wtf? Since when has meditation ever hurt anyone? Genuine question though.)</p>

<p>On this sub I have seen a website linked that looks like it was created by
a person with schizphrenia, seeing things in weird patterns/over focusing on word spellings or whatever
so I don&#39;t know if all schizophrenia cases are similar, this manifesto is written far more coherently than that website I mentioned. Maybe it was just MKUltra. <em>Shrugs</em></p>

<p>&quot;It was a smell I had never smelt before. The only thing I can compare it to is a reptile and vinegar. After smelling it, I became very uncomfortable.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont have it anymore as lost it on dead computer but at one point i had the un edited manifesto he wrote and uploaded to the net. Crazy stuff. What always gets me about this case is how he stated that he shot the guy in the head point blank and all over the rest of his body, there should be no way the victim should survive but he did. He said that proved he was right that the guy was an alien being of some kind</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading the manifesto, it is obvious that Kyle Odom is mentally unstable. The question is how did he get so screwed-up. Did Kyle lose it because of school and stress? Maybe it was some form of PTSD or over medication of PTSD? Perhaps government mind control? Or, you can believe his story is a combination of all three possibilities. </p>

<p>The out of body experience he relates is not implausible. He may have been exposed to the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf">Gateway Experience</a> and used it as his method of meditation.</p>

<p>The voices and music in his head may have been <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/12/the-voice-of-go/">The Voice of God Weapon</a> -microwave device.</p>

<p>Dr Barrie Trower&#39;s interview on this subject:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMMEQNnSZIo">Microwave Weaponry Use on People</a> is a great introduction for this topic. </p>

<p>The Martian-reptiloid-shape-shifter, well known to David Icke fans, could be an induced hallucination. By the way, his drawing looks like a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_the_Frog">Pepe the Frog</a> and a <a href="http://landofthelost.wikia.com/wiki/Sleestak">Sleestak</a></p>

<p>The manifesto names many politicians and Israelis. </p>

<p>The story has so many conspiracy references. Almost, as if, fabricated to discredit all of them. The whole story smells fishy...or like vinegar and reptile? </p>
