    <div class="md"><p>Just because you have an OPINION, doesn&#39;t mean that anybody wants to hear it, when you say incredibly stupid shit like &quot;sandy hook is 100% a hoax&quot;.
If a person actually did want to have a real conversation with you about Sandy Hook being a hoax and take you seriously - they would not at all be a healthy and balanced individual.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t they prove Sandy Hook happened?</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t they release proof that the school had electricity?
Why don&#39;t they prove that the school had an internet hookup?
Why don&#39;t they prove that the school passed its quarterly health inspections?</p>

<p>They have been asked IN COURT PROCEEDINGS and they have not been able to.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yah that&#39;s exactly what I am saying.</p>

<p>Wolfgang Halbig took Newtown to court... they not only couldn&#39;t... they wouldn&#39;t provide evidence that Sandy Hook was a functioning school.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a wacko asking dumb questions... this is Wolfgang Halbig... State Trooper, School Super Intendant and National School Safety Policy Writer and consultant.</p>

<p>He pointed out CLEARLY that the photographs of the &quot;crime&quot; scene showed that Sandy Hook was in such disrepair they would never have passed their quarterly school health and safety inspections.</p>

<p>Not even close.</p>

<p>There was mold, rotting wood, broken door handles, junk cluttered rooms... any of this would cause them to fail their inspections.</p>

<p>This EXPERT asked to see the reports. He asked Newtown to provide the evidence that the school had an electrical hook up... they could not and would not provide the evidence.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t new. You just don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>Question for you - Have you personally seen the photos of Sandy Hook school? </p>

<p>Did you notice the flood damage everywhere?</p>

<p>How about the mould growing up the walls? Did you see that?</p>

<p>Would you send you kid to a school that looked like that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? You litterally just have to go into a school with a gun and shoot unarmed fucking kids. It&#39;s so easily doable that it&#39;s an American tradition at this point. </p>

<p>The other thing requires such absurd amounts of planning, resources and people. You have to pay off hundreds of &quot;actors&quot;, make up a fake school, make fake news, etc etc. the sheer fact that you think that those are the same people running the world is evidence enough against it, because the idea of faking it is fucking retarded. Just imagine the illuminati board meeting where the guy was pitching his ridiculously complex plan with so much shit that could go wrong. Who the hell would greenlight that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay if it&#39;s so simple let&#39;s count how many people should be involved: </p>

<p>First of all we have the parents. If the parents are actors they have to stay &quot;in role&quot; for the REST OF THEIR LIVES. Already pretty complicated there. Now what about those actors&#39; family? They would also have to be paid off some how. Again for the rest of their lives. </p>

<p>Then we have every single police officer at doing the reports, we have the doctors doing autopsies, forensical experts, lawyers etc. etc. to get the legal ball rolling. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Then we have the neighborhood. None of those people who live near the school. In towns like that everyone knows what schools exist, so you also have to make sure that none of the neighbors spill the beans about it. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how many people we are on at this point, but it&#39;s probably near a thousand. Fucking simple, eh? </p>

 Its like the info on this movie is being hidden. Weird huh. </p>

<p>Youd probably say, &quot;so what, they had no internet searches for the school before 2012?&quot; </p>

<p>It gets better, but youre the type to call sandy hook, pizzagate. Thats what they want. Dont look into details, nothing to see here. Your attitude is why we have a world like this. Ignorance and dismissive blanket statements with no understanding of the situation. Good thing the tv tells you what to think or you&#39;d be lost.</p>

<p>Do you have a cute nickname for the child training center in New Mexico? Did snopes debunk that for ya yet? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you saying that the elementary school that the shooting occurred is actually supposed to be a town? </p>

<p>I literally just looked at the readout, checked the right most bar labeled &quot;city&quot;, googled &quot;Sandy hook elementary&quot;, found that it was in &quot;Newtown&quot; CT, and then cross referenced &quot;Newtown&quot; to the graph.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I went to check the data collection methods because the violent crime statistics for &quot;Newton&quot; were low. I found that the data for the graph is given by local law enforcement. Since Sandy Hook was handled at a State Law enforcement level (like most mass-shootings) the data was submitted for this particular graph.</p>

<p>Here is a better source of data, because it handled both local and state law enforcement statistics. Refer to page 12 and it lists 27 deaths in &quot;Newtown.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dpsdata.ct.gov/dps/ucr/data/2012/Crime%20In%20Connecticut%20COMPLETE%202012.pdf">https://www.dpsdata.ct.gov/dps/ucr/data/2012/Crime%20In%20Connecticut%20COMPLETE%202012.pdf</a></p>

<p>When making a claim on the internet, this is an example of how you should conduct yourself. You are not deepthroat. Your argument is not strengthened by vague bullshit red herrings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently whatever I have is better than whatever urinal you dug your narrative out of. I get it,  &quot;CNN is fake news&quot;, yadda yadda heard that shit a million times, even though Trump says fake news whenever something disagrees with his sensitive palette. (you made it political when you tried to discredit me by bringing up CNN.) </p>

<p>Except the problem with that line of thinking is that it wasn&#39;t just CNN that reported it correctly. It was pretty much every other forum of media that&#39;s not trying to sell you medicinal boner pills.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that where-ever you&#39;re getting your information is garbage. Not only were incorrect in trying to suggest that the government didn&#39;t record the gun-deaths, but you were also incorrect in asserting that the shooter carried 3 guns inside. That is correct. But you asserted that it was improbable for a 120pd (oddly specific) kid to carry in 3 rifles. He <strong>DID NOT CARRY IN MORE THAN ONE RIFLE.</strong> Investigators found 1 rifle and 2 handguns. A shotgun was found in his car.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a better source of data, because it handled both local and state law enforcement statistics. It is the SAME AGENCY that handles the table you linked, with more depth in it&#39;s data &amp; research. Refer to page 12 and it lists 27 deaths in &quot;Newtown.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dpsdata.ct.gov/dps/ucr/data/2012/Crime%20In%20Connecticut%20COMPLETE%202012.pdf">https://www.dpsdata.ct.gov/dps/ucr/data/2012/Crime%20In%20Connecticut%20COMPLETE%202012.pdf</a></p>

<p>When making a claim on the internet, this is an example of how you should conduct yourself. You are not deepthroat. Your argument is not strengthened by vague bullshit red herrings.</p>

<p>So if your entire argument that &quot;Sandy hook is a hoax&quot; rests on the fact that you&#39;re looking in the wrong-place, then you should seriously reconsider your stance.</p>
