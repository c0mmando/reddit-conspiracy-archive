<p>Came off as desperate to me. Talking about the dark times we live in, Nazis, racial nationalism, we must stop Trump, KGB is taking over, Trump must not let the FBI/DOJ target his opponents, etc. Very long, dramatic awkward pauses with only talk about how evil and wrong everything is and we must rise up type of talk. Have never seen a former President do something like this.</p>

 before I could post my reply so here&#39;s what I had written. </p>

<p>I found the quote as I hadn&#39;t seen the speech.</p>

<p>I think he was exactly right in what he siad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This Congress has championed the unwinding of campaign finance laws to give billionaires outside influence over our politics. Systematically attacked voting rights to make it harder for young people and minorities and the poor to vote. Handed out tax cuts without regard to deficits. Slashed the safety net wherever it could, cast dozens of votes to take away health insurance from ordinary Americans, embraced wild conspiracy theories like those surrounding Benghazi or my birth certificate, rejected science, rejected facts on things like climate change, embraced a rising absolutism from a willingness to default on America’s debt by not paying our bills to a refusal to even meet much less consider a qualified nominee for the supreme court because he happened to be nominated by a Democratic president.</p>

<p>And we have never seen a sitting president behave like Trump. </p>

<p>I am a Democrat voter, but I didn&#39;t listen to the speech, and probably won&#39;t, I don&#39;t need reinforcement or bias confirmation, and I prefer humor, wit, snark and smirks to, &quot;serious.&quot; It helps me stay rational in dismal times. </p>
