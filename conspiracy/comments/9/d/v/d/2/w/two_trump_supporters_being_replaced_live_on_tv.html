       So if you’re there to disrupt the event why would you politely leave when someone comes to replace you?  And what about the other two who were replaced?  Both wearing MAGA hats and replaced with blonde girls.  They DNC plants too who politely left?

       They're pussies and chickened out.   Daria was the only one wearing the hat,  and they were there together.  None of the three looked like they were having a good time.

       That doesn’t make them plants... that makes them bored.  They prob didn’t realize they’d be expected to stare at the back of Trump’s head and pretend to be excited about every single thing he said.

       So your pet theory is that Trump's security is so absolutely shitty than DNC plants were able to not only get into his rally but to get seats directly over BOTH of his fucking shoulders in relation to the camera?

       No that's not my theory at all,  I never once said they were DNC plants.  If I had to make a wild guess,  I'd go with them being some ANTIFAggot wannabes.

       Trump is a master of Branding. This was done for the appearance factor. Same with the woman behind Kavanaugh all this week for his hearings. They just wanted someone more presentable to be directly behind. All part of the Trump show

       Absolutely. Some might say that the current branding war between the two parties is being handily won by the Republicans. The last memorable branding from the left was 'Yes We Can'. Since then, not much. But again, Trump is the Master at branding, no denying it. He spent a decade on television staging after a lifetime of experience with personal branding. The man knows how to set a stage.

       When I was in 5th grade my school won some excellence award and the newspaper came to take a picture of the administration and some selected students. I was on the student council so I was in the picture. I distinctly remember overhearing my principal say to the vice principal "Could you get some Asian students? They're our largest minority." This happens at all levels.

       Great point, I have no idea, maybe they replaced them to look better on camera, maybe they were there to disrupt the rally, maybe they were just in the wrong seats. But if the people behind trump are selected by somebody I assume they wouldn't do that selecting during his speech.

       Seating is coordinated. If you arrive with friends the people running the event will split you up and have you sit in different sections to get a more diverse look (and to keep you isolated from chit chat I’m assuming).

       At least this is how it is in a few major Illinois cities. Right leaning events, never covered left but I’m assuming the same

       I think the ladies who replaced them may have been secret service agents. There's a picture on twitter of an agent and she looks like the first girl who replaced the guy.

      <p>
       I'm not sure a random paid supporter would be able to go up to someone who is obviously on camera and get him to move without him objecting to it so the secret service theory seems most likely

       I watched this. They were there for 90% of the speech, and they were distracting. I think they were protestors that lost their nerve. Glad they got removed.

       I thought the "supporters" in the back get vouched somehow. Or do they pick people in the crowd.

       This is what all

       do.

       I worked production for many years and this is a very common occurrence, especially for free events.

       There are prime seats and there are VIP's. Sometimes you swap people out. And
       <strong>
        YES
       </strong>
       if there is a person that is in view of the camera and they are not enthusiastic, or even just ugly, sometimes you tell them to switch with someone who is better looking and smiles more.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is only a conspiracy to people who never worked production or live events. For people how have, it's just business as usual.

       I mean this is just ridiculous. Jesus Christ people, this isn’t a conspiracy that people are “placed” where the camera will be pointing. Democrat, Republicans, they all do it. Movies.. TV shows, and yes even your previous reality TV is fully controlled and scripted. Not really even relevant in this case, but I’m just saying, did anyone in this fucking thread, with your reasoning and logic thinking skills, think for one second people behind the fucking POTUS are going to be random?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I was interested in what happened as I saw still screen grabs of him online as it was happening, so I went and skimmed through the entire speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dare any of you to watch it and tell me if he was a “supporter”. Clearly not a supporter. He had your classic wide eyed like the Aurora shooter, he was fidgety, he kept shaking his head in disagreement when Trump was talking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who I ask you?!? In their right mind, would allow someone like that to sit behind a live broadcast? Even more importantly what kind of shitty SS would allow this to go on behind POTUS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly not a conspiracy here, the 3 were also outed as part of a socialist group who had planned a peaceful protest at the rally. My guess is they got cold feet and didn’t go through so they sat there and were awkward during the speech.

       When I worked for Obama they absolutely did this, they made sure the crowds behind him were demographically what they wanted and would not hide it or be subtle, they'd straight go up to whoever and say "we want an ethnic person right here for the speech" and change their seats

       Worked for a paper during college and photographed political events:

      <p>
       Seating is coordinated. If you arrive with friends the people running the event will split you up and have you sit in different sections to get a more diverse look (and to keep you isolated from chit chat I’m assuming).
      </p>
      <p>
       At least this is how it is in a few major Illinois cities. Right leaning events, never covered left but I’m assuming the same
