       Gas lighting is my pet peeve.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had it done to me by numerous people.  It is the most frustrating experience in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       People use it to deny one another assets, freedom, dignity, respect and explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to be the favorite weapon of evil doers and liars to turn their bad behavior into something the victim 'deserves".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think gas lighting is a tool that we would all find rampantly at use in at least three fourths of all American conspiracies.

       Gaslighting is telling me that I was "CTR" and "paid" during the entire 2016 year on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaslighting is telling me now that my upvotes are real, &amp; my downvotes are real.  Gaslighting is telling me that this sub is "under attack" only when anti-Trump stories dominate the front page (they don't, today or ever, and you can prove me wrong with archived daily snapshots of the front page at archive.org or archive.is).
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaslighting is telling me that only "Soros" has "infiltrated" this sub, and not that Reddit itself has Pentagon ties.  Gaslighting is telling me that "Koch Bros" or any right-wing private organization has ever been accused of "infiltrating" this sub.  Gaslighting is telling me that
       <em>
        I should gaslight myself
       </em>
       into presuming the front page is a reflection of "consensus opinion."
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting you to gaslight yourself is the ultimate goal.

       Let me ask you though, do you see massive downvote brigades on anti-Trump content. I don't. Please point it out if you have seen it. But I see it all the time on any content which could be characterized as pro-Trump. There are even subs dedicated to brigading that sort of content. So maybe you can understand why people say stuff like this:

       They aren't trying to gaslight you. Its an observation that many have made, myself included. If you want to tell me I'm wrong about my observation, then I think
       <em>
        you're trying to gaslight me

       Has it occurred to you that a lot of people simply think Trump is insane and dangerous?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, Reddit isn't just America.  I live in Europe, and almost
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       here, even the right, thinks that Trump is a dangerous nutcase.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of questioning, open-minded people who see Trump - a man unable to speak a coherent English sentence, a man who literally contradicts what he has said a few moments before, a man who seems to rejoice in his own belligerence - and reject it as madness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I certainly do.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the same way, there's a good reason we downvote the "Hillary is about to be arrested posts" - because we've been hearing it for twenty years and nothing ever happened except endless hearings that showed Hillary to be another incompetent, militarist tool of Wall Street just like everyone else.

       Sorry, but that doesn't explain an instant 15 or more downvotes on relatively unpopular threads. And it happens time and time again. Its definitely votebotting, and it only happens on the threads I described.

      <p>
       I'm sure that you only feel that way due to all the propaganda, your media is possibly even worse than ours. My sister and brother in law both live in England and they tell me a very different story.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that explains why you don't really notice the votebotting and shilling and brigading. Because it confirms your biases. I and many others here see it and have pointed it out time and again, and I have no doubt in my mind about it.

       The irony of this comment

       Notice how people calling out "T_D brigades" are always ipvpted but people calling out
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       or TMOR brigades are always downvoted
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how comments about CTR or shareblue are downvoted but comments about Russians are upvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how many posts on this sub mirror
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       If every thing calling out Donald brigades are always (like on every post) upvoted isn't it more likely that is just how the regular user feel?

       Could you try to explain why you think this sub should be pro-Trump? His disapproval rating in the US is 53%, his popularity abroad is even more abysmal. If this sub represented a random selection of people then the prevailing attitude should be anti-Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean this sub absolutely hates Jeff Bezos’ guts for not paying enough taxes or wages, but Trump has openly bragged about not paying taxes and is under constant lawsuit from stiffing contractors. Trump’s given tax cuts primarily to the rich, deregulated rules that protect workers and the environment, installed a war hawk as his Secretary of State, had a cabinet of corrupt people like Wilbur Ross and Alex Azar, unqualified people like Rick Perry and Ben Carson or corrupt AND unqualified people like Betsy DeVos. That’s not to mention the people who have already resigned over bad conduct. He himself is under criminal investigation and continuously attempts to obstruct said investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub declared itself the_donald’s refuge sub when the mods there threw a tantrum. Now those Trump cultists have returned to their own sub, moved into cbts_stream and now greatawakening.

       They should just remove all comment sections from all websites. None of this shit even serves a purpose other than to troll and argue with people. That’s all anyone ever does on any site. Politics, sports, celebrity news etc. It’s nothing, but one condescending, snarky comment after another. It reminds me of Gaza Strip in text form.

       I notice whenever I even debate with people in person, I can give them evidence after evidence or show them something obvious and it's like they know they can't explain it away and will pull a "well, whatever, you keep your tin foil hat tight". I will, because conspiracy theorists are what patriotism USED to represent. People seem to forget the whole reason we had a revolution was because a group of me challenged the norm. They questioned the rules and laws and realized corruption when they saw it. They then, despite being a small community, spread information and ended up changing the world for the better. I personally think that questioning everything is honestly the most patriotic thing you can do.

       I just supply Operation Northwoods. They thought that through enough to present it to the president. That means they had no quarrels committing false flag terrorism upon the American people then, even so much as to vote airplane attacks as an example. That was in the early 60s. Why wouldn't they do that now? Not to mention the president that turned it down was assassinated.

        Gaslighting or gas-lighting is a form of mental abuse in which information is twisted or spun, selectively omitted to favor the abuser, or false information is presented with the intent of making victims doubt their own memory, perception, and sanity.

       Gaslighting is users pretending not to notice this sub (and all of reddit) doesn't come under attack via vote manipulation

       Gaslighting only works if you have a weak mind. Those who are steadfast in their beliefs see gaslighting as what it is; pathetic attempts from weak people that are trying to trap your mind.

       On a person-to-person  level I agree. I've known a few people who claim they've been gaslighted by various people. I don't doubt they've been taken advantage of, but I also know that each was diagnosed bipolar at one time in their life. I don't know if there's a correlation, but if I had to guess, they were more or less trusting of others (possibly too trusting) depending on their mood.

       Now mass gaslighting (masslighting? 😁) is a completely different beast.

       Gaslighting is quite frequently discussed in the conspiracy community, as far as I've seen. Yes it's definitely horrible to be on the receiving end of it and our socio-political arena combined with the media that represents it is full of gaslighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be aware, trust yourself and don't fall for the lies. Your self-confidence and awareness needs to be high - that and trusting yourself is the antidote.

       There's just as much gaslighting if not more done within the "alternative" media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, "trusting yourself" is a dangerous suggestion to make, given how bad most people are at recognizing truth, researching anything or seeing through the nonsense that BOTH sides of all spectrums push.

       Let me ask you though, do you see massive downvote brigades on anti-Trump content. I don't. Please point it out if you have seen it. But I see it all the time on any content which could be characterized as pro-Trump. There are even subs dedicated to brigading that sort of content. So maybe you can understand why people say stuff like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Gaslighting is telling me that this sub is "under attack" only when anti-Trump stories dominate the front page

       They aren't trying to gaslight you. Its an observation that many have made, myself included. If you want to tell me I'm wrong about my observation, then I think
       <em>

       or TMOR brigades are always downvoted
      </p>

       Notice how comments about CTR or shareblue are downvoted but comments about Russians are upvoted.

       <a href="/r/politics">
