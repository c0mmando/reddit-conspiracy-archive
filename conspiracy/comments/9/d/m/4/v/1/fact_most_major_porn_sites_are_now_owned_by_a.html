        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Porn has become a major problem in society, pushing sexual degeneracy on the masses like never before. Notice how the front page of every porn site has material that would be considered incredibly disturbing even a few years ago? Simulated children, simulated incest, cuckolding. etc?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked into it and found that the heart of the porn industry lies within a secretive company called MindGeek, whose main office is in Luxembourg, but has an office in LA. They&#39;re an &quot;influencing company&quot; (<a href="https://www.mindgeek.com/">https://www.mindgeek.com/</a>) whose main goal seems to be to push certain types of content to the masses. Notice how their website doesn&#39;t actually say what they do and uses so much evasive language? Because they actively push certain content onto porn sites to try to influence the masses.</p>

<p>They own PornHub, Brazzers, XVideos, and a whole lot of other familiar names. Porn stars get blacklisted from the industry when they even mention MindGeek.</p>

<p>If anyone more disgusted by porn than myself reads this and wants to take action: MindGeek is your target. Not the small puppet names they use such as PornHub.</p>

<p>Imagine a pitch black room. Now poke a tiny hole in the wall and let a spec of light shine through. No matter where you are in the darkness, you will see that light. Our room MUST go into full darkness before the light can shine through! </p>

All these new categories being pushed are detrimental and seen as disgusting to  anyone with a healthy attitude towards sex.

<p>What are the negatives of watching porn?</p>

<p>Ofcourse in excess it&#39;s a problem, that&#39;s what addiction is, like how you can be addicted to drugs or whatever. </p>

<p>Saying it hurts you just to watch porn every now and then is an opinion not a fact, you&#39;re mixing those up.</p>

But the facts are that science is often wrong, often messy, facts suppressed and the fact that science is conducted my man, so it’s no perfect; let alone science is behind the times in so many areas...we can’t devise a way to prove cosmic energy when scientists are recommending the healthiest cigarettes, vaccines or opioids.

    <div class="md"><p>You are right that science has often been wrong, but if you think that means you cant trust science, then your missing the whole point of science in the first place. </p>

<p>Religious institutions, on the other hand, have a very specific answer to all the big questions and offer nothing to support the claim. 
It is not the right answers that bring you to enlightenment, it is the ability to admit that you were wrong (which the church would never do).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imo this is a big issue in modern society. Urban/suburban life has become isolated (because of many reasons). People aren’t meeting each other naturally as they would in the past by talking to their neighbors, walking to the market, etc. Commuting by car is a big part of it. Everyone is encapsulated socially for much of the day. If you never have the chance to meet new people, how are you going to have sex and form relationships without the Internet? Which totally alters the dynamic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, this. I&#39;m in the process of moving back to Japan because in America I literally could not interact with more than the same 1-2 coworkers every day unless I forced myself. I&#39;d just sit in a car, sit in a desk, repeat. In Japan I walked or train rode everywhere and I was forced to interact with people way more and it was obviously positive in my life. Even just forced market type interactions or wandering into a random bar or restaraunt I met so many people. In America I&#39;d never drive to a bar, leave my car overnight or whatever, all the hassle. I get that this isn&#39;t America or Japan specific it&#39;s just anecdotal but yeah, car commuting made me feel so alone without even realizing what was happening </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that odd considering how prevalent divorce now is as well as remarrying people that already have children. There are arguably more step-relationships now than there ever have been in the past so this shift towards incest porn isn&#39;t surprising to me at all. Just like the other guy said: it&#39;s just a natural extension of the inherently taboo nature of porn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.  Pretty fun of the mill compared to the kinds of porn around these days.  And add to it therate of divorce and how many people have step siblings...</p>

<p>Chuck porn on the other hand...  that is fucked up.</p>

<p>Also, I have a (controversial, oh no!) theory that porn addiction might be leading to the trans explosion.  Lonely, isolated guys watch porn to the point of not even fetishizing women anymore, but literally fetishizing vaginas and breasts alone.  Add to that the desire they feel for women, and a weak mind, and then <strong>poof</strong> the come to some conclusion that  “if only I had breasts and a vagina, people would desire me.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re defending its existence rather than condemning it, implying it exists because the majority of people enjoy watching &quot;hypothetical incest&quot;. The entire point of this post is to bring to light the fact that there is a company behind pushing this &quot;hypothetical incest&quot;, rather than it genuinely being based on interest. At the root of this issue is a society that isn&#39;t absolutely disgusted by this and turned away from pornopgrophy all together. If this bombardment of disgusting &quot;hypotheticals&quot; doesn&#39;t dissuade you, maybe the link to sex trafficking and horrible treatment of human beings could convince you to stop filling your subconscious with these energies. At the end of the day, you&#39;re either for something or against something. It&#39;s obvious that you are not yet at the point of your life where you can control the simplest of your desires even if it means supporting something blatantly evil. Energetically, morally, and holistically evil. This goes to any and everyone still indulging without any shame or guilt. Nobody is perfect but to not even try to cleanse yourself... that says a lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My take on the apparent incest porn explosion is that it&#39;s mostly a case of mistaken signaling.</p>

<p>&quot;Sister/Daughter&quot; branding is a more reliable indicator than any other right now for &quot;no huge fake tits, not covered in shitty tattoos&quot;.</p>

<p>Which has always been a massively underserved market in porn, is probably the preference of the majority of people or something close to it, but somehow hasn&#39;t otherwise developed a reliable branding/searchable shorthand to distinguish it from the rest.</p>

<p>So producers see &quot;wow there&#39;s really an appetite for this stuff&quot;, but get the wrong message.</p>

<p>Not that there&#39;s probably not also people who are specifically into the incest aspect, but I think that&#39;s far less of it than it seems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, good point.  I have seen people attempt to equate “milf porn” with incest.  The reality is that those of us who came of age with the internet are in our 30’s-40’s...  “milf porn” is more a quick way to search for realistic looking women in that age group.  Pretty mundane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Porn is addictive and with any addiction you need stronger and stronger stuff to get you off. However, if you are normal there does cone a point at where you hit a brick wall.  What i mean is, you can start on the nice lesbian videos, then the hot chicks, then a bit of incest, go down the cuck route, maybe the lighter s&amp;m.  However, once things take a dark turn or it goes a little too gay or too young then your brain just goes into revulsion mode.  </p>

<p>I got into some jav humiliation videos, they were okay because the woman was obviously acting and everything was okay. Then those Baccy videos turned up and there&#39;s no way i could get off to it. They were flat out frightening.   Or blood bag... where the girl is put in a vacuum bag, all the air sucked out once she passes out she&#39;s stabbed. The vacuum just sucks blood out of her... I&#39;m sorry but that shit is horrific.  </p>

<p>I think our brains can get turned on when two people are turned on, or when actors are good at pretending they are turned on. However, if the woman isnt interested and in obvious discomfort or bored a normal person cant be turned on by it. </p>

<p>So mindgeek can try to normalise extreme fetishes, but it won&#39;t work.  Gay porn is the best demonstration.  If you&#39;re not gay,the first time you see gay porn you are repulsed and despite seeing it constantly you are still repulsed every time you see it.  Same with extreme s&amp;m, its never something you &#39;get used to&#39;... what turns us on, will have turned us on the first time we saw it, what repulses us will always repulse us.</p>

<p>As for incest, it&#39;s all about the idea, not the reality.  I love the idea of having a hot sister i could fuck, but in reality i have three sisters and even thinking about having sex with any of them makes me feel queasy.   Same with daddy porn, its a great idea, but the reality would be repulsive.... daughter in law.... that might be okay... lol..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Monoamory &quot;going against our nature&quot; is in fact a direct contradiction to the very theory of evolution itself.</p>

<p>I always hear the argument we are &quot;designed&quot; for polyamory- which would imply design in the first place.  However, the entire theory of evolution is based on the idea that organisms Adapt to a Changing Environment, and it could be considered that different people have different environment even under the umbrella of one society.  Therefore, it is difficult to say conclusively what is best for anyone in any given circumstance besides what works best for them as an individual in a unique situation.  </p>

<p>Saying monoamory is &quot;against our nature&quot; is implying that polyamory is the answer for Everyone, which is ironically the exact sort of fascist homgenizing presumptuousness which the institution of the christian church (etc.) imposed onto its subjects. </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about &quot;human nature&quot; in a general sense.  The reason infidelity will always be prevalent in every society ever is because it&#39;s in our natures to be that way.  There are situations, like family raising, which promote somewhat permanent binding of two people, but even with that, humans are prone to &quot;wander.&quot;</p>

<p>This is a bad argument. </p>

<p>The theory of evolution says 1) random mutations happen 2) some mutants survive better than others 3) these mutants reproduce 4) the mutation gets passed on</p>

<p>What you&#39;ve done is boiled that down to an okay-sounding but misleading summary (&quot;the entire theory of evolution is based on the idea that organisms Adapt to a Changing Environment&quot;) and then applied that to something that evolution does not in fact apply to (different environments in one society).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every organism lives in an environment. And is either suited or not suited to survive in it.  Along with the changes that do or do not take place.  In environments is the ONLY place where evolution takes place.  And it is because of adaptions that species survive.  Different environments require different adaptions to survive in.  </p>

<p>You could define adaptations as strictly beneficial random mutation followed by reproduction, or to expand beyond strictly that, you could consider that some animals migrate during winter, and/or have to deal with different populations of predators/prey in different seasons/locales, build their nests/homes in different places depending on the changes in the environment, ETC and the ones that do a better job at THOSE sorts of adaptations also have an increased readiness towards survival.  Whether or not that readiness/flexibility which increased survival chances is itself caused by genetic randomness is up for debate given recent advances in epigenetics (dna changes on a daily basis based on organisms&#39; choices).  </p>

<p>If you want to get Really scientific about it you could argue that initially monogamy (in western society at least) and commitment to one partner increased chances of survival.  Family plays a crucial role in the long-term survival and health of an individual (this is well documented) - and the frequent wars, famines, plagues ETC in Europe would&#39;ve made for families that may have had to up-and-move quite a bit- so it would be important for those families to stick together.</p>

<p>In those one-size-fits-all polyamory books where they are talking about these tribes in which the parents all had sex with each other and the children were raised by everyone - in that situation, that may have Actually increased survival - in that unique environment.  But that is also dependent on the SOCIAL environment- the fact that it was a TRIBE, a small group of a finite amount of people whose survival was dependent on each other in a basically closed system from the beginning of their lives to the end of their lives.  There was security in that nobody would want to leave their tribe because their survival had come to depend on it, and it would be the same people raising these children their whole lives.  The children would have security in that, they knew all the adults and it was the same adults raising them their entire childhoods.  Everyone knew everyone, and there wasn&#39;t some electronic media they were exposed on a daily basis from the beginning of their lives reinforcing the preeminent importance of sexuality in general.</p>

<p>When you have a society as large, as individualistic and competitive (and arguably isolated and desolate) as ours- where there is no sense of community anymore, there is no tribe- just a mass of people- and a virtually infinite amount of sex partners to choose from- a parent could have sex with a new partner every day, without the children themselves actually receiving any benefit from it whatsoever, and in fact might receive less care and attention if the parents are preoccupied with egotistical sexual conquest.  Not saying this is how all poly parents work, but I will say I have seen it in action multiple times.</p>

<p>Now you could say some swingers choose to have sex with the same partners over and over again for decades in addition to their spouses.  That does happen.  But that additional sex partner rarely takes on a secure additional-parent role.</p>

<p>Now if you want to go live in a commune, to simulate a tribe experience, and have multiple parents for multiple children that stick around their entire lives, great.  Lots of hippies in the 60s and 70s tried that and you can go read about if you want.</p>

<p>Anyone can do whatever they want to do with other consenting adults, that is one of the basic tenets of our modern understanding of how a society should work.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not anti-polyamory in and of itself.  I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s right for EVERYONE. and it bothers me the multiple times I have been harangued by someone who fancies themselves intelligent trying to convince me that I was living my life incorrectly and &quot;against human nature&quot; by choosing not to have promiscuous sex while in a serious relationship.  </p>

E.g how can it be that almost every country I access Pornhub from happens to like incest the most? I&#39;ve seen that in 7 or 8 countries in the last 18 months. It can&#39;t be genuine.</p>

<p>its not how things work. </p>

<p>push ten different things on a person, and one, two or three things will interest him - from there you can offer him more of that - while pushing another ten new things on him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>same as above - they will try to throw 10 different fetishes on you until you decide to check on or tow that you might like.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>they have incentive to keep you as regular user - if you are constantly watching one type of something - sooner or later you will get tired of it and will be coming back less frequently and spend less time on that site on a daily/weekly basis.</p>

<p>But if you constantly discover &quot;new things&quot; on that site - you will spend more time on the site and will be coming back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I personally don’t like this type of porn so I don’t watch it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but you are still getting on your frontpage types of porn that you do not click (ever) and you will be getting it in the future - eventhough by now (if you use the site for a year or two lets say) they know what you like - and by your logic your frontpage should be only type of porn that you like - but its not - there is always 10% or 20% or 30% (whatever) of videos (type of porn/specific fetish) there that you never clicked and will never click but they will be coming back.</p>

<p>Refute the facts, it&#39;s not possible. The links are there and proven.</p>

<p>Defending trafficking is really sad.</p>

<p>Studies have found that frequency of porn use correlates with depression, anxiety, stress, and social problems.</p>

<p>Studies have found that frequency of porn use correlates with depression, anxiety, stress, and social problems.</p>

<p>There are clear differences in brain activity between patients who have compulsive sexual behavior and healthy volunteers.</p>

<p>“Sexual tastes are molded by an individual&#39;s experiences and their culture…” –Norman Doidge, PhD</p>

<p>Porn use has been found to influence some users&#39; sexual preferences, leaving them wanting what they&#39;ve seen onscreen and significantly less satisfied with sex in real life.</p>

<p>After being exposed to pornography, men reported being less satisfied with their partners&#39; physical appearance, sexual performance, and level of affection and express greater desire for sex without emotional involvement.</p>

<p>Among the effects of the use of pornography are an increased negative attitude toward women, decreased empathy for victims of sexual violence… and an increase in dominating and sexually imposing behavior.</p>

<p>A meta-analysis of 33 studies found that exposure to either nonviolent or violent porn increased behavioral aggression, including both violent fantasies and actual violent assaults.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both recognize that pornography is an element that adds to the serious problem of sex trafficking.</p>

<p>How Porn Affects Society</p>

<p>Would you support a business if you knew that they abused some (but not all) of their employees? Pornographers don’t want you to think about it, but even if some of the humiliation, degradation, and sexual violence you see in porn is consensual, some is not. What consumers don’t realize is the abuse and violence that’s so often performed in mainstream porn, sometimes, isn’t really a performance—it’s real exploitation incited by force, fraud, or coercion, which is sex trafficking by definition. Consumers have no way to know what kind of “consent” the actors have given, or if they’ve given it at all. Because of the sheer amount of real trafficking accounts that have come out of the industry, it can’t be safely assumed that just because someone appears in a porn video, that they knew beforehand exactly what would happen or that they had a real choice or the ability to stop what was being done. The chilling cases that have been reported are just the tip of the exploitation iceberg that is being exposed as more victims speak out.</p>

<p>Porn is not the issue, the person who can&#39;t engage temperance. Do too much of anything will have a negative impact on your life.</p>

<p>This should be a no brainer. The real problem a bunch of broke people who gravitate towards instant gratification without regard to their own safety.</p>

<p><em>There.</em></p>

<p>Porn isn&#39;t the problem.</p>

<p>As for sex trafficking - it&#39;s about low hanging fruit. Of course it&#39;s gonna be linked to porn... too damn easy. If sex trafficking could be linked to profits from graham cracker sales they would do it in a heart beat.</p>

<p>It is what it is.</p>

<p>I enjoy my shirts and shoes - both more than like made in a third world sweat shop by kids. Call them out on it, but they&#39;ll move operation to another place and repeat. So you keep that in mind while shopping. It&#39;s an infinite uphill battle. And even if the U.S. did win that battle the rest of the planet would continue to buy sweat shop merchancise.</p>

<p>The point - have perspective which in your post, you&#39;re not showing. You&#39;re demonizing porn instead of looking at the real cause, broken people.</p>

<p>???</p>

<p>You have an impulse issue? Can&#39;t use self-control? You decide how things are going to be. YOU. Nobody is holding a gun to your head to click. Your actions.</p>

<p>This is stupid, take personal responsibility.</p>

<p>Or it&#39;s false, built on fear rather on common sense. And repeating &#39;personal responsibility&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You do know this is how civilization runs, now and in ancient times. Those who could not use self-control were made extinct damn quick. Since those actions means no thought in the long term futures.</p>

<p>Why are you fighting common sense? Water is wet.</p>

<p>If this actually, has to be explained to you. The real problem is you. No citation needed, it&#39;s called life experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sorry you feel so poorly about yourself. There&#39;s no need to lash out and act defensively. Trust me, it only furthers my original point about porn&#39;s affect on mentality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re trying, real hard to make my words into a victim. <em>No.</em> Don&#39;t be tool, kid. You have chosen the path that takes you away from fault. Even when such actions lead directly to your feet. And that&#39;s not me lashing out, but simple reality. One plus one equals two.</p>

<p>Water is still wet too.</p>

<p>Porn is an option; not the only game - as I wrote, gambling, over-eating and drugs.</p>

<p>You want to make it the reason, the only reason. But should you win, then what...</p>

<p>None of that will go away, it will shift to something else.</p>

<p>And that becomes the new big bad?</p>

<p>[shakes heads]</p>

<p>No. It&#39;s all about moderation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Understand that this isn&#39;t a victimless act. Of those victims, including you.. Could be avoided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, not a victim. You have free will. You choose. YOU. And make it clear - some people make poor life choices; never learning from their mistakes. You can&#39;t help them, not until they recognize their own faults.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Millions of women, men and children are exploited due to this industry, every year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is this even new?</p>

<p>Always. Alway been. Just fill in X with something other than porn, same results. Slavery too.</p>

<p>I see you as someone who stuck in the minutia, you can&#39;t see the forrest for the trees.</p>

<p>&quot;Porn And Human Trafficking&quot; low hanging fruit.</p>

<p>&quot;Sex Trafficked Woman Reveals The Dark Reality Of Porn&quot; - all things can be turned dark with money and twisted intent. Hell corn fakes has that tale too and those Sea Monkeys as well. I&#39;m not joking.</p>

<p>&quot;Jessica&#39;s Story: My Life As A Porn Star&quot; - big deal. She made poor life choices, resulting in a poor life. Take out porn and put in someone who spent their life savings on frivolous things, ends up doing thing they could not imagine doing trying to survive since they&#39;re broke.</p>

<p>You get hurt just the same as porn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://pornharmsresearch.com/2010/08/sex-trafficking-of-women-for-the-production-of-pornography-research/">https://pornharmsresearch.com/2010/08/sex-trafficking-of-women-for-the-production-of-pornography-research/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again low hanging fruit.</p>

<p>&quot;Sex Trafficking Isn&#39;t What You Think It Is&quot; - bad people will do bad things for money without any guilt. Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>So you do your best to avoid them. Make choices which have a positive outcome to your life.</p>

<p>&quot;The Connection Between Human Trafficking &amp; Porn&quot; - Frak me. You&#39;re looking at this as a whole, not as elements into a large pot. Yes, there are elements EXACTLY like this. Yes. But not the whole. In the same way not all Blacks are rapists, not all Whites are racists, not all Italians are mobsters, not all gays are child molesters.</p>

<p>You are behaving in absolutes. <em>That&#39;s false.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Millions of women, men and children are exploited due to this industry, every year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Name an high profit industry that doesn&#39;t exploited people. Hell, even Uber and Amazon does. Not new and not unique.</p>

<p>&quot;The Relationship Between Pornography, Trafficking, And The Sexual Abuse Of Children&quot; - Again, not an absolute.</p>

<p>Stop viewing this in black and white. It&#39;s not.</p>

<p>A child does that.</p>

<p>&#39;This is bad people. This is the good people.&#39; Why? &#39;The color of their hats!&#39;</p>

<p>Oversimplified to the point of making it null.</p>

<p>This is an element in it, no debating - <em>yes.</em> But not all of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FFS any logical moral human would agree that pornography at its least, should not be free and easily accesible. Alcohol, ciggaretes, drugs every other vice in the world costs money, but not porn. Porn is very easily accesible to children who stumble on it. Porn should at least cost money to obtain, because the only other thing preventing kids from accessing it is a click of the mouse. </p>

<p>I think there is either a conspiracy to corrupt people and distract them, or there is just blatent ignorace from the executives of this company. For fucks sake, you would think they should at least charge a fucking dollar to access it, that would be millions in revenue!!! but no they want to do the world a justice by making high speed derranged pornography free for the world!

    <div class="md"><p>As long time viewer of porn, &quot;teen&quot; porn was almost much worse back in 2008. Back then, more women were dressed in outfits, talked in certain ways, did certain things that suggested things contradicting their age. From 2005-2009ish you can find some pretty obvious videos suggesting things, more obvious than now.</p>

<p>Nowdays they just seem to recruit young, small, slim girls and dress them up normally. Buzzwords always include &quot;tiny/petite/young/small/etc.&quot; but there&#39;s always a suggestion in the videos.</p>

<p>In fact i can only think of one producer who dresses his women up in such ways, but thats as far as he goes. One or two major American producers do the dress up thing but thats about it. Another is Russia also.</p>

<p>Incest and Cuckold stuff has been on the rise, but i also find it pretty lame and not arousing at all.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough,  the whole &quot;psuedo pedophile&quot; stuff is what got Max Hardcore locked up...Although he was <em>way</em> worse than anything coming out now. He also made the women mention their &quot;Ages&quot; which is mostly what got him in trouble.</p>

<p>I think part of the problem is young women are favored in porn...18-23. Anything older and your washed or probably tired of the profession. If they can&#39;t get the women younger than 18, they might as well act like it huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so I have a theory about this. Also want to mention, I do not believe porn is &quot;sexual degeneracy&quot; but to each their own.</p>

<p>I think porn in itself is taboo, something that pushes the boundaries, and I believe this is just the next big boundary to push.</p>

<p>I think WHY incest is now becoming so common is because well, people are willing to pay for it. People aren&#39;t nearly as likely to pay for vanilla porn anymore. So you push a fetish which may generate real subscription dollars. </p>

<p>I think you are correct that this company is pushing is, but its being pushed because well, it sells the best over vanilla.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the much simpler explanation is that paid fetish porn appeals to a smaller audience, and often seems to have been shot by someone way into that fetish who was perhaps not very concerned with the commercial viability of the content, or just assumed it would be successful because of how much the creator was into it. They then go bankrupt, and sell their catalog to MindGeek, who toss it up on their tube sites, where, due to the clickbait nature of fetish terms, end up higher on the algorithms than &quot;busy teen nudity.avi&quot; just by being more unique content, which causes it to go to the front page and get seen by even more people...</p>

<p>Idk, could be a concerted effort on MindGeeks part I suppose, but what would be their angle on it all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People need to take the red pill about porn. All porn is cuckold porn, you are conditioning yourself to be the observer, forming a very powerful mental link where sexual experience is equated to jacking off while watching two superior people fucking.</p>

<p>Porn is a scourge, if you are jacking it to porn multiple times a day you are causing yourself damage. It fucks your imagination. I won&#39;t go into any no-fap shit, I jerk off, but use my imagination. </p>

<p>Sexual energy is some of the most potent energy you produce. Don&#39;t use it to warp your mind.</p>

<p>You see people&#39;s resistance to thinking about this whenever it&#39;s mentioned. You don&#39;t want to address this problem because, like most men these days, you are addicted to pornography. Break free boys. </p>

<p>Oh look! You did exactly what I said you would!</p>

<p>My argument is that it creates negative behaviour by</p>

I don&#39;t get how you say you&#39;ve looked into them as a company but could only find that they&#39;re an &quot;influencing company&quot;</p>

<p>I know people gonna call me a shill cause y&#39;all are crazy but idc. This post is literally just someone being mad at porn exists. </p>

<p>You have literally no proof of the company wanting to push that content, you just see that stuff on porn sites and decide the only possible reason is a secret conspiracy by a global corporations trying to make people watch fetish porn.. I mean COME ON. How the fuck does this have almost 700 upvotes? What the fuck is wrong with this sub?</p>

<p>Also racemixing is super pushed. Groups of black men always picking a young blonde white very teenage looking girl. Sites like blacked or whatever that famous one. The owner has several sites dedicated to only that. It&#39;s always black men with white women. Never the other way around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There sure are a lot of people on here defending the porn industry and coming up with reasons on the spot, for why things may be the way they are. Then they say, &quot;prove me wrong&quot;. Then they point out a lack of proof to the contrary (spreading doubt).</p>

<p>There certainly seems to be an attempt to at least ruin the respect men have for women, by creating the illusion that all women are whores and love it, when that is absolutely not the case. I know women who waited until marriage to have sex. Too bad there aren&#39;t enough real men in society to take care of their wives and to do the right thing for their children&#39;s futures. Things got so screwed up so fast, that now people are blaming how screwed things are, for the way the internet has developed. It&#39;s the old chicken and egg routine. Defenders of porn claim society was screwed up first (sure but let&#39;s not embrace it!). Society was far less screwed 20 years ago. There are good parts of society too. Why not embrace the good? Why just give in? Just some thoughts. Even if there isn&#39;t a grand conspiracy to overtly sexualize your children and rape them, and cause women to be submissive to rape, there certainly seems to be a strong effort out of Hollywood and the Catholic Church to make this a reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It unironically is. The transexual stuff on /r9k/ that popped up in 2015 or so is known to be a psyop led by a guy called Reiko who tries to get losers to become trans and mutilate themselves. It may have been what caused Shuaibys suicide. If you&#39;ve been on /gif/ for long at all, it&#39;s pretty clear that LGBT stuff is being pushed there too. Over the course of 4 or 5 years it went from a relatively normal porn board with maybe 1/4 of the threads being weird fetish stuff to every other thread being traps, femboys, gifs that make you want to suck cock threads, you are the girl in the post below you threads, and outright gay threads. That was a gradual process too, starting with with trap and shemale threads, moving to femboys and twinks, and then introducing the super gay stuff.</p>
