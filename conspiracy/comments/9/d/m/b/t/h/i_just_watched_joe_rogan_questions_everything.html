        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I almost feel like this show was the beginning of his deception. He literally had the dumbest people on and questioned the dumbest conspiracies. Big foot? Ghost? Seriously? No 911? No school shootings, nobody to acutally discuss anything?</p>

<p>I look forward to the day that someone secretly hi jacks his podcast bringing up real conspiracies that he is unwilling to talk about anymore. Someone with actual knowledge to shut him up and scilence his shilling. Someone with the knowledge like the Corbett report. Anyone! That can talk over him and just ask him questions that he cannot answer. Someone to expose him. His show is live, so it could be done.</p>

<p>It is almost like this entire eddie bravo thing was completely planned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup absolutely. I watched the chemtrails episode... I don&#39;t even care about chemtrails but they way he treated the participants was disgraceful.</p>

<p>soooo disrespectful and disingenuous. i lost a lot of respect for Joe Rogan when I saw how he treated people who were making his show a possibility by speaking with him.</p>

<p>I still listen to Rogan... I just realize what he is now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Joe often gets accused of being a shill, which I think is a little extreme. However I&#39;ve been a long time listener and he has most definitely closed himself off from exploring or even considering conspiracies. These days he&#39;s actually down right rude to any guests that suggest something slightly off the beaten path. </p>

<p>Joe taught me a lot about being open minded and learning new things, it&#39;s sad to see him so against new ideas- whatever the reason might be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I &#39;m close to certain that <strong>JRE#1111</strong> interview with Abby Martin was the beginning of the end.   Pro-Israel groups slammed down on him like a HAMMER.<br/>
Who know what kind of back alley threats him and his family received, cause these guys don&#39;t F-around.  He&#39;s a celebrity and he has a lot to lose.  He probably did this as a cover from that experience.    </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/abby-martin-responds-to-attacks-from-pro-israel-organizations/233002/">Abby Martin Responds To Attacks From Pro-Israel Organizations</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A campaign was also launched against The Joe Rogan Experience podcast and Rogan himself, including a coordinated email harassment demanding he renounce the interview and host a pro-Israel guest as penance. Such pressure against celebrities and journalists who host views sympathetic to Palestinians is typical, and often fierce.</strong><br/>
StandWithUs, which operates on a $9 million annual budget, receives a large amount of funding and direct instructions from the Israeli government itself. In their official funding contract with the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, StandWithUs is employed to manage “interactive media war rooms” to run government messaging.     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;   </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e_dbsVQrk4&amp;amp;t=865s">In response to these “war rooms” now targeting Martin, she released a special episode of The Empire Files on Oct. 1.</a>     </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In an exclusive interview with teleSUR, Martin said “I was getting so many accusations of misrepresenting Israeli society and distorting the treatment of Palestinians, I wanted to let Israelis speak for themselves.”<br/>
This shocking episode features a range of people in Jerusalem’s so-called “Tolerance Square.” Each interview shows with striking clarity how much racist, supremacist and even genocidal views are prevalent in Israeli society.
When asked how to deal with the Palestinian population, one man responded “I would carpet bomb them. That’s the only way … I think we have the right to hate them.”   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another says “I think we should give the Arabs a country. Then it can be a war between countries … we can just drop one big one and, ‘pop!’, done!”    </p>

<p>A young woman declares plainly “we need to kill Arabs” while she and her friend giggle uncontrollably.     </p>

<p>A more merciful man says “Israelis have to take over. We have to kick [Palestinians] away,” then ponders, “it would be better not to kill them, but to send them away to Arab countries.”    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These interviews reveal how mainstream the desire for mass killing and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians are among Israelis, contradicting the manufactured image of as a liberal, democratic and peace-loving nation. This is reflected in polls across the region, showing that over 70 percent oppose Palestinian statehood or ending the occupation, and 50 percent want to ethnically cleanse the 1.5 million Palestinians living inside Israel as citizens.    </p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he was corrupt from the start. UFC and Fear Factor have helped degenerate society. He&#39;s good friends with Alex Jones, a key controlled opposition asset. He runs with that whole circle of degenerate comics. And there&#39;s no way in hell a Top 5 podcast with prime demographics of military-aged, men looking for self-improvement would NOT be controlled.</p>

<p>Sorry to say it, but Joe was a COINTELPRO asset from the start. He fed us good info about psychedelics and physical fitness to get on our good side, to win our trust. I have friends that will fight you if you say a bad word about Joe, because that stuff genuinely improved their lives. Then he started feeding us disinformation. Those same friends think &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; are a bunch of silly bitches. Because Joe.</p>

<p>Fuck that guy.</p>
