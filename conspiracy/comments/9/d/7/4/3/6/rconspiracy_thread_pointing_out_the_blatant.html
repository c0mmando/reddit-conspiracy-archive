      <p>
       Two days ago, I noticed that a
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       regular was getting considerable grief in a thread that questions some claims by NASA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, as a veteran of this forum, it's very clear that certain topics are "hit" more than others. At the top of the list I would put questioning the vaccine schedule, questioning Israel, discussing exotic technology used on 9/11, and secret space/NASA speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In these instances, the "disruptors" try to create a false dichotomy. Disagree with the current extremely excessive vaccine schedule? You're a monstrous anti-vaxxer! Disagree with the foreign aid given to Israel by the US? You're an anti-semite! Doubt Russian collusion? You're a Q fanatic! Question NASA? You're a flat earther!
      </p>
      <p>
       TMOR (and conspiratard etc before them) have long hit me with the anti-vaxxer and anti-semite tags (my flair on that sub used to be a literal death threat in that regard!!). However, being called a flat earther is a new one for me, and it shows how desperate they're getting.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I saw that the OP of
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9clnbq/this_week_in_fake_shit_that_didnt_happen_on_the/">
        this thread
       </a>
       was getting attacked for "daring" to question NASA,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9clnbq/this_week_in_fake_shit_that_didnt_happen_on_the/e5bm1zl/">
        I stepped in and wrote this comment
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Don't take these downvotes personally...you're on the right track.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, at the time I wrote that, the thread was
       <em>
        long
       </em>
       since buried to 0 link karma and it was
       <em>
        nowhere near
       </em>
       the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If you'll notice, despite having 0 points, this thread was viewed
       <em>
        9,000
       </em>
       times...a number almost unheard of for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       threads that are merely downvoted to 0 and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       linked to anywhere else on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who constantly request "proof" of brigading, here's a friendly reminder that reddit
       <em>
        admins
       </em>
       are the only ones with access to the actual
       <em>
        metrics
       </em>
       of the behavior of redditors.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have as "proof" is a consistent series of extremely compelling circumstantial evidence like this scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       To reiterate, I posted my supportive comment to OP long
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the post had been buried and was no longer being seen by
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       regulars.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/9cnc8s/top_mind_axototl_promotes_and_defends_flat_earth/">
        my comment was linked by TMOR
       </a>
       . Soon after, it rocketed down to -50.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        I've never had a comment downvoted to below -50 that wasn't linked to TMOR or another hate sub.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, let's put on our thinking caps. What is the most likely cause of that comment of mine getting downvoted to below -50?
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Dozens of regular
         <a href="/r/conspiracy">
          /r/conspiracy
         </a>
         users/subscribers were offended by my polite support of OP.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Dozens of TMOR users/subscribers brigaded that thread when my comment was linked to their sub.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Yesterday, I
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9cw3da/tmor_brigades_a_polite_and_supportive_comment_to/">
        started a thread
       </a>
       pointing out this manipulation, and it even hit the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       for a good while.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, having a thread that exposes their morbid obsession on the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is apparently unacceptable, as they needed
       <em>
        two
       </em>
       different threads (
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/9cydgy/top_mind_axototl_again_supports_flat_earth_in/">
        1
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/9cxniv/top_crybaby_cries_about_downvotes/">
        2
       </a>
       ) to get it off the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       And bury it they did!
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who incorrectly will attempt to portray my threads on this subject as "complaining about downvotes," allow me to quote

        one of the brigaded threads
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Oh.....this is just whining is it? Pointing out what TMOR is and does is important. Whining about downvotes is not at all what this post is about.
       </p>
       <p>
        If all the nay sayers here had their way and no one "fed the trolls", there would be a whole slew of newcomers here who wouldn't be as informed on why these accounts brigade certain topics and attack others.
       </p>
       <p>
        Exposing the bullshittery in this sub and in others is critical to the ongoing education of all the people who will come after us. Start now.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He's right! While these reminders may be tedious to the veterans (and inconvenient for the brigaders), the constant influx of conspiracy theorist converts need to know exactly what we're up against.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're going to hit this thread too...but the more we force their hand, the more the actions of these reprobates get exposed.

       I just want to know why they do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I don't really give a shit that TMOR exists. Someone like it is always going to.

       Assuming it's organic, why tho? Who enjoys doing what they do? They pretty much just stew in anger and disbelief all day, that's not a fun way to live.

       Hey dude, long time no chat! Been a while since those FL days on discord.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the surface they have to pretend to follow the rules so they can claim plausible deniability, and it's clear that everyone who actively participates in TMOR understands that. The real, unspoken rules is, "harass and dv all you like, but if you get caught you will be disavowed. (After we ban you, please return with an alt kthx lol)"
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, it should come as no surprise to anyone that occasionally they will accidentally acknowledge/infer this; it might be an idea to amass as many examples as possible like the one you've provided.

       FL is much less interesting once you really get in to it, unfortunately. The ideas in the articles are very interesting, and the theories they propose are unique to ForgottenLanguages in a lot of cases. I find THAT as the interesting part of FL.

       Alright, I’ll bite. I sub to TMOR, as well as this sub. It’s interesting to see how a post shows up in my feed in two very different contexts. I like TMOR because I feel like it’s sort of an antidote to a lot of the more extreme stuff on here... I was a hair’s breadth away from having to unsubscribe to this sub as I couldn’t take the flat earth/anti-vax/greatawakening bullshit... if I hadn’t found TMOR, I would have had to ditch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would hazard a guess that a lot of TM folks are probably a lot like me: conspiracy folks from way back (like alt.conspiracy days and Listserves)... hell, I used to subscribe to
       <em>
        print
       </em>
       newsletters. They, like me, are a little disheartened at the rampant insanity and downright maliciousness they see here. In many ways, it’s a shitty community that has only gotten shittier since the Orange One has been elected... TMOR is a good old fashioned Reddit circle jerk where you can shitpost about things you find particularly egregious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Registered users here outnumber TMOR 6 to 1 (and I know lots of folks here have alts as well). How could a small sub overwhelm such a robust
       <em>
        community
       </em>
       . I’m sure a lot of lurkers here downvote the same shit for the same reasons.

       <br/>
       -TMOR are trying to suppress anything that's "ridiculous" (e.g. too complicated for them to follow the argument)

       Yeah, the Russia share is pick a controversial topic that has staunch supporters on both sides. Vaccines, abortion, gun rights, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they plant provocateurs on both sides of the argument to whip each sides supporters into a frenzy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one i'm shocked that worked is flat earth. I mean come one. The earth is not flat. At least the anti-vax argument could have some validity in the quantity given vs essential.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the controversial topic and fan flames on both sides is the obvious tactic.

       Ban every single account that participates in TMoR.  Ban all the mods who have shown themselves TMoR friendly.  Write a script that crawls TMoR and bans accounts as soon as they comment there.

       I'm not that clued up on this battle but I'm guessing the main offenders will be using multiple alts to manipulate the sub, banning their mains would be completely irrelevant.
       <br/>
       Banning people who argue against conspiracy thinking on the reg would probably be a whole lot more effective, then at least the sub would be conspiracy theorists discussing conspiracies and fuck the voting, just read all the comments and agree by providing supporting evidence or complimentary theories instead. Just a thought. Downvotes do nothing to stop me reading all the points.

       Sure, but it certainly can't hurt.  Force them to maintain alts at all times, and just wipe a certain portion of the bad actors out automatically.  Do the same for the neolib / neocon propaganda subs.

       Banning participants in TMOR, and the mods of TMOR, and banning the sub itself would disrupt their group communications. They'd be forced to use their alt accounts and open up another sub like TMOR.  At a minimum, they would lose strength and cohesion as an organized group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why reddit allows this group to continue to exist is more than suspicious.

       that's a thin line that allows you to ban anyone who doesn't 100% buy into every post.  Who decides what "conspiracy thinking" is?  Are we allowed to point out evidence that proves the conspiracy wrong?  What if we they are spreading harmful disinformation?  You ban the one that points out it's all lies?

       I remember about two years ago a website called Coin Fires or something like that had a very very in depth post and article with video proof from a guy who works for a company that pays people to manipulate reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The site was very legitimate and exposed some frauds online in crypto currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       He showed videos of the interface and how it’s desifned to trick reddit. It uses different methods to get users to the place they were supposed to downvote in an effort to seem organic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The software was web based and looked really powerful and yet simplistic in execution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who wants to build the rip off clone version?
      </p>
      <p>
       I really want to find those old screenshots and what not. Sadly the site got purchased by an Israeli firm not long after and even publicly said as much and that article was deleted from the archives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then later the entire site was deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t blame the owner for taking the money though. He was getting death threats on the daily and one fraudster even mailed him a dead animal and told him his family was next.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very interesting stuff.

       It would be too obvious that as a conspiracy sub that goes out of its way to expose corruption, any perception that corruption could be afoot here with the mods would mean absolute credibility loss that you could never recover from.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could see it leading to the ultimate cleaning house of current mods and installing reddit friendly safe-space people who would surely do us all justice.  /s

       From what I can tell, u/axolotl_peyotl has a lot of difficulty reaching conclusions that are justified by evidence. That is fine and expected given this is a conspiracy sub. And it is fine and expected more generally given that u/axolotl_peyotl is human, and we all do this from time to time. The issue I have with axolotl is not the objectionable reasoning skills but a) that axolotl's conclusions consistently lean toward certain sorts of conclusions that are of notable political/social relevance (coupled with a willingness to push beyond the evidence axolotl becomes an individual propaganda machine, churning out claims that have very little basis in reality yet contribute to certain relevant political/social narratives) and b) that axolotl shows a notable unwillingness to recognize the weaknesses in reasoning, the tenuousness of conclusions, while actively working as a gatekeeper (beyond the purview of a mod) of what does and does not count as "legitimate" conspiracies (eg. stickying nonsense partisan crap posts because axolotl deemed the partisan crap to be worthy of the front page while the unending downvotes such posts received were deemed by axolotl to be illegitimate result of brigading without providing any evidence for this claim whatsoever).
      </p>
      <p>
       These trends are evident in this very post. Let's look at the title:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        thread pointing out the blatant manipulation of our sub by
        <a href="/r/TopMindsofReddit">
         /r/TopMindsofReddit
        </a>
        gets blatantly manipulated by TMOR
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In the content of this post, axoltl points out that his comment in a 0karma thread (and thereby organically prone to less traffic) continued to accrue notable amounts of down votes. And he posits an explanation for this by linking to TMOR posts. I find this argument adequate (though I don't want to deny that there may be alternative possible explanations) to support his conclusion that TMOR brigaded that thread. However, there are two notable problems with this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, "brigading" may have marginal influence, or it may have substantial influence. Five people may "brigade" a post with 10k up votes and they will have marginal influence on visibility patterns therein. Alternatively, fifty people may brigade a post with 25 karma and they could have substantial influence on visibility patterns. I found axolotl's evidence for brigading good (indeed, unusually high quality of evidence for this individual), but there is no evidence whatsoever about the relative influence of that brigading. To single out posts from TMOR with a dozen upvotes as representative of some grand successful program to contort the visibility patterns on r/conspiracy as a whole is absurd (axolotl seems to endorse this conclusion by quoting
       <a href="/u/bittermanscolon">
        /u/bittermanscolon
       </a>
       - or quoting axolotl elsewhere
       <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9clu93/why_arent_there_any_discussions_about_the_news/e5blr0a/">
        ""They" aren't letting certain conversations take off on /r/conspiracy"
       </a>
       ). And axolotl has used this spurious conclusion to justify using his mod privileges in an attempt to influence judgement about the
       <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8vih4y/did_sen_warner_and_comey_collude_on_russiagate_if/">
        legitimacy of conspiracies
       </a>
       in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, axolotl claims in this post that his previous post on vote manipulation was itself manipulated. The evidence he offers is two posts from TMOR. This is insufficient evidence to support this conclusion as axolotl also notes that this post was on the front page of r/conspiracy (thereby not being organically prone to less traffic) . Unless axolotl can show that traffic directed to that post from TMOR was more substantial than organic traffic from the front page of r/conspiracy, then axolotl cannot discount the possibility that people downvoted the post off the front page because of issues with the argument (such as those listed in the previous paragraph) or some other non-brigading reason (like those who recognize that axolotl seems to generally endorse conclusions that far exceed what is justifiable, while also wishing to exert some influence on this sub so as to support axolotl's own pet conclusions and conspiracies as genuine while denying such a place for others). As I have noted before, I am a representative of such traffic. I relatively rarely even comment, but I vote more frequently when I see nonsense claims that are inadequately supported (especially if such unsupported nonsense has clear political/social relevance and especially if those claims are on the front page.)
      </p>
      <p>
       My general conclusion is this: calls of shills and brigading are often made, and generally poorly supported by evidence. When they are not supported by evidence, I think they contribute nothing to discussion. Often, such calls serve to justify and reinforce one's own position, even if that position is so silly as to be deserving of mass downvotes. It is a tool that entrenches beliefs and inhibits discussion. The evidence axoltl provided in the post to which this post refers justifies the conclusion of TMOR brigading, but the extent and influence of that brigading is unclear. The evidence axolotl provided does not even justify the title of this post, as it fails to show that the previous post was substantially downvoted as a result of TMOR brigading rather than regular r/conspiracy users finding axolotl's conclusions and methods to be silly or distasteful. If axolotl (and this sub in general) improve the quality of their evidence and conclusions - at the very least with respect to important political/social matters (but conspiratorial inclinations themselves are increasingly politically and socially important) - then they may find that the ostensible brigading problem will become less notable.

       It's fine to disagree with him, but I don't see anything he has done as manipulation.  I see a lot of important topics being brought to light by his efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what was funny?  I totally ignore stickied topics.  Maybe thats bad but here is why I do.....I don't like manipulation so I generally don't digest what's put in front of me, I still go and get it myself.  If I see something interesting for ME, I go searching.  I don't find a topic and delve into it because it is stickied.

       I suppose your comment sounds super reasonable and such but as a detractor of Axol, I only have to wonder why someone would do such a detailed analysis like yours.  Axol has no army at his disposal.  Certainly though, TMOR is a coordinated group who operates and attacks people directly.  TMOR does out of its way to manipulate and
       <em>
        keep
       </em>
       information away from people.  They mock and destroy genuine want for information.  They act like children, but clearly they're not, they have an actual agenda and a target.

      <p>
       Yes, my post sounds reasonable. Yes it is a lot of text for such a seemingly small function (to challenge narrow aspects of axolotl's post). That's what good dissent and argument looks like. It takes work to offer critique.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I noted in my post, I am willing to put some time into challenging axolotl on the rare occasion because I often disagree with the quality of his reasoning, his tendencies to come out on certain politically/socially relevant issues in ways that I fundamentally disagree with, and because he has a lot of influence on this sub. Mainly, though, it is because I think axolotl is representative of broader and concerning trends in contemporary politics and society. In this case the trend of note is this: if your belief is challenged either by someone else or by some facts or metrics, then DON'T debate, DON'T listen, DON'T reconsider your belief, DON'T look for better arguments, DON't weigh evidence. Instead, label things as "fake news" or "libtard" or "fascist" or "shill" or "brigade" or whathaveyou so you justify whatever beliefs you have to yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I will occasionally invest time into creating a lengthy post (on a number of topics and accounts), because I think the post to be of some importance. I hope that people other than axolotl might read this post and think "hey, maybe I shouldn't try to end discussion by yelling shill and brigade anytime my comment gets downvoted. Maybe I should entertain the possibility that my argument just isn't popular, maybe because my argument is shit. Or hey, maybe if I am going to challenge certain taken-for-granted views I should have good reason to do so, other than a willingness to reinforce some sociopolitical desires."

       We understand the reality here and your goals certainly aren't on the honorable side of things at all.  Your "dedication" to your cause is a great way to show how far you have fallen.  People don't even have to take my word for it, they can choose a side and see who represents who.
      </p>
      <p>
       Top mind, you are not.  A guy online who maybe disagree's with stuff?  Sure, whatever.  Though, your association with TMOR shows you're more than just that.  If you're even half of what Axol says....not even including what I have seen and experienced myself, I wouldn't put you anywhere near the "reasonable" end of any scale.  To be TMOR material, one would have to dreg up some dark shit to participate here the way they do, the way you do.

       Also, for those who are watching, you will see that what axolotl does here
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       aligns with the post where I explain my justification for the initial critique. Axolotl sees a reasoned critique of axolotl's claims, and instead of answering to the critique, instead of improving upon the argument or back stepping on the severity of conclusions, or asking questions, or looking for better evidence, axolotl immediately attempts to label me as a fraud of some sort, so that axolotl justifies the perpetuation of the same problematic beliefs and justifications.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a problem when one considers a very reasonable critique to be a "misguided hit piece".

       I agree that posts linked from TopMindsOfReddit are vote brigaded even if not explicitly called for. I have a comment
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/91i97m/that_time_that_tmor_was_caught_redhanded/e2yjakg/">
        here

       with examples.

        In these instances, the "disruptors" try to create a false dichotomy. Disagree with the current extremely excessive vaccine schedule? You're a monstrous anti-vaxxer!

       Isn't that description itself a false dichotomy or at least a dishonest representation?

      <p>
       Posts here are often not that simple and more often, not that honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, let's say someone constantly posts articles from Russian State media, often defending the Russian government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say this person also makes several selfposts ironically calling people who disagree with them "
       <strong>
        babbling paranoiacs
       </strong>
       " and other insulting terms, while simultaneously complaining about being "pigeonholed" for "questioning the Russian collusion/
       <strong>
        bogeyman narrative
       </strong>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       They dismiss any suspicion or discussion of Russian wrong-doing as attempts to revitalize a "Cold War mentality". They say it's xenophobia, propaganda and FUD that causes "
       <strong>
        otherwise free-thinking and intelligent individuals
       </strong>
       " to get caught in a "
       <strong>
        destructive circle-jerking feedback loop
       </strong>
       ". They also refer to those who agree with them as "
       <strong>
        genuine users
       </strong>
       ", implying anyone else is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would not describe those statements as "just disagreeing" or "just questioning things".

       by TMOR. While they likely contributed more downvotes, it was already unpopular. I didn't downvote it but I think it deserves it in that context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, OP's claim about the first user is wrong. They have over 500 comments in this sub and prior to today (when banned), they had only one comment removed in the past year (7 months ago).

        "They downvoted the thread I made about my downvoted comment"
       </li>
       <li>

       I attended an event in Chicago several years back that Alexis from reddit spoke at.

       He said in the early days the users weren’t even entirely real. They used bots to make the site look more active and “faked it” until they made it.

      <p>
       Do you think people who were willing to do that in the beginning won’t be apt to allowing other manipulation or perhaps even help with it?

       Oh botting is still a huge thing not just on Reddit but everywhere. Call me a conspiracy theorist but companies and other countries are definitely using bots to try and influence opinions on social media (for whatever motives wether it be to increase sales or to divide us) , mark my words sometime in the near future Russia will be exposed for a fake bot influence campaign

       TLDR - TMOR is a leftist shill fest that attempts to control social and political narrative on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been the case since early 2016

       I've been coming here for years...  I rarely ever vote on any content.  To me, the voting system of reddit is a clever gamification of thought policing.  I don't want to be a thought-cop.  Even upvotes are thought policing, because you're providing rewards for "right-think."
      </p>
      <p>
       I would imagine that a lot of people on this sub feel similarly.  However, it's very clear that those outside of the conspiracy communities love to participate in the thought-police game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Votes on this subreddit rarely mean much...  Since people with genuine interest in these topics tend to abstain from voting and people who are repulsed by the content here are generally obsessed with voting for their favorite right-think and voting against their most hated wrong-think.

       I kinda agree with you, there's definately something going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if it's to the extent you think, but I nearly quit this sub because I was attacked for not being totally on the pro-vaccination-bandwagon (haha health issues and allergic reactions to vaccines might do that to a person :p ) when I first subscribed. After awhile I realized that the real people subscribed to here also have their doubts about vaccination safety and frequency.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I see, when a post is just r/conspiracy, comments tend to stay within '-10' to about '30' (unless someone is just being a jerk without any actual discussion). Then there's
       <em>
        wild
       </em>
       variance if a post gets linked anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a comment shoots down to -50 or less, or +250 or more, then there's reason to be concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe whenever a person posts here after a day or two we should also make it an unofficial rule to make a "edit: [this many] people viewed after [ie 24] hours" report. We could even make a group chat specifically for these stats/numbers.

       I read the post you linked from this post. My opinion on that post:
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't question NASA's claims as much as he mocked them. Not only that, he was condescending, belligerent and patronizing. He didn't even directly make a claim, other than than:

      <blockquote>

        Amazing how no one has died up there in nearly 20 years. Good thing the "vacuum of space" didn't destroy them after a hole appeared in their space station traveling at about 17,000 mph.

      <p>
       He doesn't actually make a claim there, does he? But, he's implying, my best guess, that somehow it's impossible for a person to plug a hole with their finger to stop an air leak? That's preposterous. P = F/A or pressure = force/area. Our atmosphere exerts 14.7 pounds of pressure per square inch. 1 square inch the atmosphere exerts 14.7lbs of pressure. 2 square inches it's 29.4lbs of pressure and so forth.
       <a href="http://www.physics.org/facts/air-really.asp">
        According to here
       </a>
       we are under the weight of 1 ton of air pressure. The

       </a>
       was maybe a square inch?
      </p>
      <p>
       His rant is as ridiculously nondescript as it is meritless. He deserved to be downvoted. And he doesn't even deserve the effort of trying to convince him otherwise because you can't convince people like that of anything they don't want to believe.
