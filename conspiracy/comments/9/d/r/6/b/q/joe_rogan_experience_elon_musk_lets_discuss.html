    <div class="md"><p>I will get downvotes for this, but Musk is more of a marketing genius than a scientific genius. That&#39;s not meant to be belittling at all. A marketing genius is a real thing and it&#39;s a rare skill.</p>

<p>The reason I say that is because everything he invented was already doable before he did it. Take Tesla, he just made a $130K electric car &quot;cool&quot;. Every other car maker could have made a $130K electric car, but nobody would buy it because it wasn&#39;t cool. Musk&#39;s genius was making a really expensive and sort of impractical electric car cool.</p>

<p>Next is Space X. Companies have been launching rockets into space for decades so this is nothing new. His twist was making one that occasionally can land on its own with varying degrees of success. This is cool, but the reason other rocket companies didn&#39;t do this is because there is really no benefit to it. It adds a lot of risk for not much return.</p>

<p>I just think Musk is a marketing genius and he should be studied for that, not really his scientific opinions. And as I said before, that&#39;s not a slight, because his marketing accomplishments are amazing. He has Joe Rogan thinking he&#39;s alien.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve worked at a few tech companies and in the business world, sales and marketing is waaaaaaay more important than technical skills.</p>

<p>This is why you have brilliant developers working for idiot managers and absolute morons leading the company.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about what you can actually DO. It&#39;s about what you can put in a shiny powerpoint to show to your manager/director/vp/ceo/investors to convince them to fund your hairbrained scheme.... which you then pass off to the developer who actually knows that this is physically impossible and now they&#39;re working 100+ hour weeks to fund your extravagant lifestyle. </p>

<p>Then the real technical geniuses either quit to start the cycle all over again, work on open source projects in obscurity, or start their own thing and realize the only thing that matters is marketing and investor confidence.</p>
