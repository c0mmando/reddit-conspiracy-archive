        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A6al-Saflieni_Hypogeum">Hypogeum of Hal Salfieni</a> was discovered, it was found with an untold number of skeletons. These skeletons have been described as irregular, as if they were suffering from an extreme form of docicephalis. the exact figure is widely held to be in the <a href="https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170402/local/hypogeum-missing-children-alien-skulls-and-7000-skeletons.644151">6000-7000 range</a> But some sources push this up to as much as 33,000. The bones were found disjointed and intimately mixed. None were found in the correct positions. Some skeletons were found buried in a small space 3.17mx1.2m that could only normally accommodate 12 skeletons. But was in fact holding more than 120.</p>

<p>Assuming the 33,000 figure is wrong, of the 6000-7000 skeletons found, only 6 remain viable for view. The are found in plastic crates in the national Museum of Malta. The museum doesn’t know what happened with the rest.</p>

<p>There are other structures in Malta that stretch back to at least 5000 BC, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarxien_Temples">Tarxien temple</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A6a%C4%A1ar_Qim">Hagar Qim</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnajdra">Mnajdra</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A0gantija">Gigantija</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skorba_Temples">Skorba</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%27_%C4%A6a%C4%A1rat_Temples">Mgarr</a> </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tal-Qadi_Temple">Tal Qadi</a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bu%C4%A1ibba_Temple">Bugibba</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that the civilisation responsible for creating these magnificent structures just straight up disappeared is ridiculous. </p>

<p>What was Hal Salfieni for? What were any of these for?</p>

<p>To this day nobody knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>Clapham Junction is an area of sea near or at the supposed site of a sunken temple that was searched for but not found at a place called Marfa Point. The ruts here are referred to as the Marfa Point Ruts.</p>

<p>Cart ruts seem to dot over Malta. According to Anton Mifsud, they are “ validly associated &quot; with a former extension Malta’s landmass. 
Some cart ruts have been recorded in the uninhabited island of Filfla.</p>

<p>No diving is allowed here circa 2006.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. There&#39;s theories about how Malta was connected to Sicily, and from Sicily to Italy via land bridges and there&#39;s comparative cave paintings on both Island states to indicate that.  </p>

<p>The landbridges were, imo, swallowed up by the floods caused by the YDI.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These ruins are definitely going on the list to study more about. Many ruins of this type pop up all over the world and around some of the oldest civilized areas in the world. I’ve always been interested in what was going on in “pre” history and structures like this have always intrigued me. How would a pre metal tools society build something so complex and beautiful so far underground, and why would they do so? I believe, and this is totally just a belief, structures like this along with places such as Gobekli Tepe are from a civilization that predates the Younger Dryas events. It is my belief that these ruins along with places such as Egypt were not built by these people we claim to have built them but instead were “adopted” by the people we claim built them. This is just my belief I’m at work and on my cell so it’s hard to pull up data I’ve collected but this is something I’m very interested in. Thanks for sharing OP. It was a very good write up. </p>
