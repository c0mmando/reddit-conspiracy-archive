      <p>
       Here me out on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Colin Kaepernick was signed with Nike since he hit the NFL, so his Nike contract starts in like 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a middling if not poor QB for about 5 years or so in the NFL. Meanwhile he’s signed by Nike, getting paid a retainer, but without his performance being above par, no one wants to buy his merch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nike at this point sees the political climate rising with black lives matter, alt-right, antifa, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing their 30 year anniversary is coming up, Nike needs a new spokesperson, needs a new campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have a biracial football player with a little popularity on contract. They have a few years to put all their pieces together. So how do they get him to be popular? If he can’t play better, let’s give him some controversy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Boom.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s when they figure it out. Have him protest something. Get his name out there. If people pay attention, we might have a new spokes person. If people don’t, well we just let his contract expire and we are none the worse for wear.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of a sudden, it explodes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two years later Nike has their spokesperson for the 30th anniversary.
      </p>
      <p>
       He’s perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
       He took a stand against racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       He
       <em>
        Just did it
       </em>
       .

       Too me Looks like corporations are getting in the fight with the MAGA movement.  American freedom and racism is not a kneeling sport 🇺🇸 It’s disrespectful in any country 🔮 Picking sides with your home country is not good business and @Nike will pay a High Price. That goes to say they have a record of involvement in child labour in Nike factory’s that makes great awareness for the world  .

       kap had multiple football offers and turned them down to support his cause. He quit football on his own. He believed in something bigger than football. Which im sure its difficult for you to conjure up in your one sided mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This made him more popular then ever , nike was helping his cause prior to the resigning. Tons and tons of people were buying his merch before this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nike is most likely doing this because we have a blatently racist president and they are trying to help the movement with what kap is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really like what hes doing, hes really out here helping his community and actually making a difference instead of posting online and being negative. The only gripe I have is you shouldnt bring politics into your job. Other then that hes really helping people and doing it with good intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its really sad that we have the most negative person in the white house and hes getting him all his friends rich instead of making a difference.

       True. He did make it to the Super Bowl, but he still lost against the Ravens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, as far as I’m aware, he hasn’t really improved. I’ll admit I’m more of a Redskins/east coast fan, but I don’t recall really hearing about the 49ers since then. This too me shows that while the team was good enough to get to the Super Bowl, he didn’t, and can’t carry the team.

       A Ravens team with a stacked defense and Flacco playing like the best ever during that playoff run.

       If I remember correctly, the 49ers had the momentum as well before the power went out.

       Is this rhetorically aimed at the comment or seeking the info?
      </p>
      <p>
       The DoD sponsored on-field anthems in the last decade or so because  jingoism and recruiting.  Before the players had to be in the locker room for the anthem.  Baseball has no on-field displays.  NBA forces players to stand on the court.

       He retweeted anti-Muslim propaganda videos from a British hate group on twitter
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump implied that Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge presiding over a class action against the for-profit Trump University, could not fairly hear the case because of his Mexican heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
       “He’s a Mexican,”.  The guy was born in Indiana and went after mexican drug cartels. So hes implying based on his race he cannot do a good enough job lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hes quoted different rental terms and conditions to black rental candidates than they did with white candidates, and that his company lied to black applicants about apartments not being available.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without admitting wrongdoing, the Trump Management Corporation settled the original lawsuit two years later and promised not to discriminate against black people, Puerto Ricans or other minorities. Then he got sued by the justice department for lying to african americans telling them apartments werent available.
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers at Trump’s casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, have accused him of racism over the years. The New Jersey Casino Control Commission fined the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino $200,000 in 1992 because managers would remove African-American card dealers at the request of a certain big-spending gambler. A state appeals court upheld the fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,” Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump’s Castle, told the New Yorker for a September article. “It was the eighties, I was a teen-ager, but I remember it: they put us all in the back.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump disparaged his black casino employees as “lazy” in vividly bigoted terms, according to a 1991 book by John O’Donnell, a former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino.
      </p>
      <p>
       “And isn’t it funny. I’ve got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it,” O’Donnell recalled Trump saying. “The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.” Lmao so he only trusts jews with his money, thats not racist one bit lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       He refused to condemn the white supremacists who are campaigning for him 
, Three times in a row on Feb. 28, Trump sidestepped opportunities to renounce white nationalist and former KKK leader David Duke, who told his radio audience last week that voting for any candidate other than Trump is “really treason to your heritage.”  but its ok to diss nike and kap but alt right killing people hes silent. Guess why?? Thats his voter base ,

       A leader of the Virginia KKK who is backing Trump told a local TV reporter earlier this month, “The reason a lot of Klan members like Donald Trump is because a lot of what he believes, we believe in.”

       He didnt technically quit football. No one wanted to sign him. Tons of scrubs have jobs and he doesn't. It's not because he retired, it's because his phone was wasnt ringing. Obvious collusion around the league going on.

       If they did it then their long term forecasters saw it would be positive for sales globally.  People keep talking about their stocks but they only fell to a level of where it was last month.  Them going down allowed individuals who pay attention to buy the dip. Only the idiots who believe in all this Kap drama who sold stock lost out.

       A few notes:
      </p>
      <p>
       The middling QB you note changed offense in the NFL for 2 seasons by single-handedly bringing back the read option.  His game agasint GB in the playoffs is one of the all-time, if not THE all-time, greatest individual football games ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nessa was the girlfriend of Aldon Smith when Kaep, a teammate, "stole" her.  Nessa then encouraged Kaep to kneel.  IF Nike had a pre-meditated goal, Nessa was their agent.

       Yea, remember all the talking heads and analysts discussing the read option after the league was gashed by Newton, Wilson, RGIII?  I do not, cuz that never happened.  All the chatter was Kaep.  Kaep literally got a rule changed (can hit QB in backfield if he fakes the run option).

       I think you’d be hard-pressed to find
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       analysis of the read option in 2011 that doesn’t mention RG3. Tebow came up a lot too, but I left him out for obvious reasons. Wilson won the damn Super Bowl in 2013 but no big deal or whatever I guess?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you only remember Kaep coverage, I don’t know what to tell you...do some research outside of those 49ers fanzines you’ve been reading

       True. He did make it to the Super Bowl, but he still lost against the Ravens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, as far as I’m aware, he hasn’t really improved. I’ll admit I’m more of a Redskins/east coast fan, but I don’t recall really hearing about the 49ers since then. This too me shows that while the team was good enough to get to the Super Bowl, he didn’t, and can’t carry the team.
