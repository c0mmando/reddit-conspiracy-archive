       For those that don't know,
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html">
        this article by NY Times
       </a>
       and the recent book "Fear: Trump in the White House" by Bob Woodward is what I am referring to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything I've read about what the book states, combined with the OP:ED, pretty much just confirm all anti-Trump biases. It's just another reinforcement that Trump is some unhinged idiotic lunatic barely in control and we're all on the edge of total and horrific chaos because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the love of God,
       <em>
        think of the children,
       </em>
       <strong>
        we're all going TO DIE!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not really a Trump supporter, but I have never really seen evidence of the fact he's crazy in any way. Instead, I've seen the anti-Trump propaganda go on and on and on about that notion, basing even more opinions and speculations off it. It's clear to me this is to keep fear and hysteria directed at the White House as he is the biggest threat to the establishment and the "natural order" that's arisen in a really long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, "Fear" alleges that Mattis spoke ill of Trump in private. The OP:ED links that detail via
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/us/politics/woodward-trump-book-fear.html?module=Uisil">
        another NY Times
       </a>
       article outlining this. The way they link it is via this statement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That is why many Trump appointees have
        <strong>
         vowed to do what we can
        </strong>
        to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The emphasis is mine, and also the specific part that links to the elaboration on what Mattis allegedly said. To me, this part is key.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mattis is probably the only Trump appointee yet to be smeared and attacked by Trump's opposition. His appointment was met with a lot of support, and I think has been deemed off-limits- at least for now.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's also trusted most by Trump, as far as I can tell, and Mattis's appointment solidified a lot of support. So, I see this as an attempt to drive a wedge between the two. I also see this as an attempt to create disorder and distrust in the Trump administration. To me, his is evidenced by
       <a href="http://archive.is/Grj1B">
        CNN's immediate statement
       </a>
       towards that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, overall, this really looks like an outside attempt via the usage of allegations and "anonymous sources" to try and sow division in the Trump administration. I really don't believe anything that's said and wouldn't put it past the anti-Trump crowds to try something like this. A lot of it cannot be "proven" nor can any of it really be completely disproven either, outside a direct admission from either Woodward or NYT... which I doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that being said, sure, there's plausibility here too. But it fits in too well with the ongoing "by any means necessary" mentality of the anti-Trump world.

       free speech doesn't mean you are free of the consequences of said speech. If you yell 'niggers must die' in the ghetto, it's not going to end well for you, and most people will say it's your own fucking fault.

       There's a gray area here, where enough of civilians become politically relevant and can start pushing policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Trump is politically relevant, and he's got backing of at least a significant minority here. That's something to take into account IMHO. If I were the MSM, I'd thread very carefully, because you are right that freedom of speech hangs in the balance.

       There is no gray area whatsoever. Government cannot interfere with free speech.  The Redditor above suggested having Trump shut down a newspaper until they comply with something Trump wants. That's the very reason  the first amendment exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Civilians being able to push for policies is what democracy is all about. And the right to free speech guarantees them that right, no matter if they advocate for communism or war with Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a civilian thinks he was been done wrong by someone's free speech, he can take that somebody to the court. 
If Trump, the citizen, wants to sue NYT, he is free to do so.  If NYT broke a law, they will be found guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until then everything is alright.

       In a democracy, if enough people vote in favor of something, it becomes law. This means that, if you get enough representatives, who by themselves have to campaign on it, to vote in favor of shutting down NYT you effectively have a crisis on hand in which you can either sideline 1A or you can sideline democracy. This is a grey area in law because there's no law that gives either primacy over the other. This is what I meant.

       It's not a gray area. This is the supermacy clause.
      </p>
      <p>
       Constitution trumps federal law, which in turn is above state laws / constitutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the reason why the supreme court can find laws / court ruling unconstitutional.
      </p>

       As long as NYT free speech does not brake another constitutionally bound law or supreme court decision, there is almost nothing you can do.

       Ok, but which has primacy. The voters or the 1A. Let's say the voters vote in favor of revoking the NYT press licence with a 51% majority. Which do you offer supremacy over the other, the voters opinion or the 1A, in that hypothetical case?

       Philosophically, the constitution. It's what gives the law its power to be a law, and it has guidelines on what can and cannot be a law. Suggested law is against what constitution says, so it is thrown away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relistically, the law will be enforced, NYT will be shut down, the decision will be appealed, the appeal will get rejected because the rulling was according to the law, the case will go to the Supreme court and the Justices will rule it unconstitutional, because it infringes on the first amendment. Then NYT will sue for damages.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand what you are trying to say, that the constitution is a living being and it can change by popular demand either officialy (amendment) or semi-officially (Supreme court decision). It has happened before multiple times (yelling fire in a theater, which is not covered by first amendment / spending money is a a form of expression*).  This very thing is actually the wonder of the US legal system. As a resident of a country that doesn't have it, I am really jealous.

       On the example stated, however, its a direct first amendment infringement againt a specific group. It will be 120% be found unconstitutional, because you don't want a precident. If the hypothetical law was "MSM cannot post anonymous articles that attack federal organisations", you might have had a small chance of changing definition of the first amendment (emphasis on small. You will still need overwhelming population support and events in recent history that caused a problem with what the law is trying to ban).
      </p>
      <p>
       *: obviously it has happened to other articles / amendments. For example the right to bear arms and automatic weapons. I just stated first amendment examples.

       At least you understood what I meant. There are processes, when pushed to the very end, that allow for the constitution to draw the short end. It's not going to go that far IMHO, but it is an option, if you convince enough voters of the need, to amend the constitution.

       Free speech protects you from government action against expressing a form of speech so your example is useless. Any attempts by the government to shut down or limit anyone speaking or writing would end up in the Supreme Court and would be immediately deemed unconstitutional

       Direct threats have always been subject to criminal charges but actually saying "Trump must die" would still be protected speech, if you say "I'm going to kill the president" now you're actually making a threat.

       Not in the US, it's the country with the most liberal free speech laws in the world. Hate speech is even deemed protected, so in your example of calling black people the n word you wouldn't have any legal consequences to worry about

       Clinton was destroyed by Kenn Star and since it was his last term, Dems had to distance themselves to even have a chance at keeping the white house for another 4. Bush was the worst I've seen. With his Neo-con agenda and the PNAC peeps running the show behind the scenes.... he's beats out Trump and his twitter antics... although I'll still reserve my judgement until after his presidency is over. &amp; Obama was the wall street president and expanded Bush's 2 wars to 5. The news was there for those who choose to read it.

       He certainly acts unhinged with his tweets. That can't be denied. As for anything else going on in the west wing, I'll stick with "I don't know" right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read the Op-ed piece. One would think that the NYT vetted the author to make sure it was truly coming from a higher-up in the administration. But who knows at this point. In my 60 years on the planet, I've never seen the country so politically crazed and psychopathic in their methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this Op-ed is true, then there is an unelected group of people running one of the three branches of government without the president's consent. Whether liberal or conservative, one should have a problem with that. If President Trump is truly off the rails, showing signs of dementia and mental instability then these people running the White House need to move to get him out of office, and let VP Pence step in via the 25th amendment. They weren't elected to be the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what is coming out is just manufactured political garbage, then it's the country continuing to go off the rails.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sticking with "I don't know" right now, because I don't know what the truth is. Forming a belief either way just yet would just be a step back into living in slumber.

       We just had the newspaper and evening news then. That was pretty much the feeds. In my memory, it just feels like it wasn't so warlike  and tribal as it is now. I think the difference is the internet. Everything is amplified, like mind can get with like mind en masse and solidify the groups belief systems into a static, unchanging wall. An illusion of a closed system. Anything outside that closed system is a threat and must be vanquished.

       Subversion of the Presidency and behavioral choices do not have a nexus, that is correct. Like an occasional wacko gerbil, the republicans might be eating their own, go complain to them.

       If that is a genuine concern rather than a politically motivated attack, then it should come openly from the Vice President according to the 25th amendment rather than by secret subversion from within his administration.

       I don't disagree and listen some things Trump has done might actually be the right things. I'm just merely pointing out the way he carries himself does not attract respect.

       The answer is neither. This is a complex situation and Trump never shows his full hand of cards to the public. People forget that the President has access to so much more information and intelligence than we do or even the media does. What Trump says and does in public is mostly theater. He doesn't care if people spend two years hating him and insulting him, as long as the end result speaks for itself. The people working so hard to remove him know this and are desperately trying to prevent him from doing his job.

       free speech doesn't mean you are free of the consequences of said speech. If you yell 'niggers must die' in the ghetto, it's not going to end well for you, and most people will say it's your own fucking fault.

       I must have missed it, which part of the constitution says the president isn't allowed to coin nicknames or taunt dictators?
