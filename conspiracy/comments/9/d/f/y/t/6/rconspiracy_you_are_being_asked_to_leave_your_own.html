        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Link to thread: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9cw9jk/a_dedicated_subreddit_for_nonpolitical_conspiracy/">https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9cw9jk/a_dedicated_subreddit_for_nonpolitical_conspiracy/</a></p>

<p>Are we going to allow the infiltration to continue with mods promoting the exodus of conspiracy talk to an incoherently named mini-sub? </p>

<p>It&#39;s mind boggling that r/conspiracy was allowed to be flooded with politics and current events (aka: news). Many times linking articles to run if the mill MSM articles.</p>

<p>Then it was heavily argued: &quot;but politics <em>is</em> conspiracy.&quot; Nope. There is a sub specifically for politics, aptly called <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, where current political events go, specially if they are linked from MSM.</p>

<p>Same for current events, news. There is a specific sub for that. r/news. But nope, r/conspiracy allows the posting of straight MSM news. It&#39;s frankly very off topic and should be redirected to the correct subreddit.</p>

<p>BUT NOW comes the kicker:</p>

<p><strong>Instead of kicking the MSM politics and news threads out of r/conspiracy the conspiracy mods have decided to PROMOTE THE EXODUS of CONSPIRACY to a tiny sub-reddit.</strong></p>

<p>What? Trying to make actual conspiracy talk move away from their own sub, and trying to make MSM news/politics flourish? How long until actual conspiracies aren&#39;t allowed? I&#39;d guess not long until we&#39;ll be fully censored.</p>

<p>Are we going to allow this very blatant coup to succeed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you being intentionally ignorant? I don;t think so. I rather think you are being <em>quite</em> intentional with your comments. </p>

<p>A breakdown anyway.</p>

<p>Step 1. Flood <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with politics and news.</p>

<p>Step 2. Argue it&#39;s &quot;valid&quot; to post news and politics. Trying to make it &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;accepted&quot; by the community.</p>

<p>Step 3. Start to kick out actual conspiracy talk. Softly at first by fragmenting the sub into dozens of pieces and into poorly named sub reddits. Call those who bring it up wrong and accuse them of censorship.</p>

<p>Step 4 (TBA). Aggressively start moderating actual conspiracies by saying &quot;there is a dedicated subreddit for that&quot;.</p>

<p>This very much lessens actual, bonafide conspiracy theories by limiting their potential to gain traction by limiting actual users who might see them. We all know that what conspiracy theorists come up with, more often than not, turn out to be true. This will limit the exposure of those, often valid, theories.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s not <em>the</em> president. It&#39;s <em>a</em> president. One in the line of many idiots your country has had throughout the past many decades. What&#39;s happening now is not different from what has happened throughout your history. A president is just the puppet.</p>

<p>On the left you see a number, which is the actual position each topic has.</p>

<p>Topics 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 16 are not seen. This is because the posters that made those topics generally only posts political junk. It&#39;s always the same guys too getting the top spots on r/conspiracy with their political posts. I use RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) to tag and hide these useless political posts. The funny thing was that I thought I would have to tag and hide new users daily, but it turned out that once I hid about 15-20 users, r/conspiracy became 90% free of political junk. Crazy that so few members can post that much and always have large amounts of upvotes... hmm.</p>

<p>The last topic (17th) is tagged political but not hidden since that user is a moderator at r/conspiracy. That&#39;s right. There are actually 2 mods that posts political junk very regularly.</p>

<p>I doubt users will post the same topics to 2 subreddits. So what&#39;ll happen? A topic gets posted to your poorly named, very small, subreddit (that nobody will find organically by searching for &quot;conspiracy&quot;) and the politics and news remain here at r/conspiracy. It&#39;s completely backwards! </p>

<p>Sooner rather than later we&#39;ll be hard modded into posting our bonafide conspiracies into fragmented subreddits with the message &quot;there&#39;s a subreddit for that!&quot; </p>

<p>But I guess that&#39;s the plan... Diminish real conspiracy as much as possible and replace it with mainstream/establishment gibberish instead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not going to work when there is a fifth column in the mods ranks and the others are more worried about keeping status and being lawyers rather than being generals. Mods hide behind Democracy. Any mod can remove your comment and ban you carte blanche and no questions asked. Want that comment re-instated or your ban reversed?

    <div class="md"><p>Oh hi. I didn&#39;t see your post there until now. You may enjoy the new sub-reddit I created a few minutes ago. Instead of only trying to affect change by talking, I decided to see if making my own dedicated subreddit for political talk would take off: <a href="/r/todays_politics">/r/todays_politics</a> </p>

<p>Anyway, I posted this elsewhere in this topic:</p>

<p>It&#39;s being heavily manipulated, and r/conspiracy is going to be decimated. We either take a stand, or the truth will die.</p>

<p>The war on information is heating up on Reddit and we can&#39;t sit idly by any more.</p>

<p>A breakdown</p>

<p>Step 1. Flood <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with politics and news.</p>

<p>Step 2. Argue it&#39;s &quot;valid&quot; to post news and politics. Trying to make it &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;accepted&quot; by the community.</p>

<p>Step 3. Start to kick out actual conspiracy talk. Softly at first by fragmenting the sub into dozens of pieces and into poorly named sub reddits. Call those who bring it up wrong and accuse them of censorship.</p>

<p>Step 4 (TBA). Aggressively start moderating actual conspiracies by saying &quot;there is a dedicated subreddit for that&quot;.</p>

<p>This very much lessens actual, bonafide conspiracy theories by limiting their potential to gain traction by limiting actual users who might see them. We all know that what conspiracy theorists come up with, more often than not, turn out to be true. This will limit the exposure of those, often valid, theories.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same all over the internet. The reason social media platforms silence republicans or anyone that doesnt believe the official narrative is because Dems are being exposed. MSM is being exposed. Deep state is being exposed. Funny thing is they&#39;re exposing themselves</p>

Obama was an illegitimate traitor to some, to others he was a savior being conspired against. Same with GWB. Same with Clinton. Both sides of this duality are actively promoted in the mainstream media. It’s all a show to work people up, promote tribalism, conflict, and distraction. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, power and resources are further consolidated and people are more deeply subjugated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is a conspiracy - basically the larger global power structure (the cabal, the “Illuminati” or whatever you wish to call it) controls both sides, and the partisan vitriol and conflict is a game. It’s a control mechanism. Having two parties allows for having opposing views on many issues, especially emotional issues like abortion, religion, guns, the environment, immigration and so on. This ensures that more of the public buys into the greater system than if you had an overtly autocratic state, which would drive more people towards rebellion. </p>

<p>This doesn’t mean everyone in the government is a card-carrying member of a shadowy, evil secret society. A few may be, more are members of organizations like the CFR or the Freemasons which steer things in certain directions but whose members are highly compartmentalized regarding the information they have access to. A small number of decision makers in media, government, large corporations, etc can steer things in the direction they want. </p>

Now you have groups claiming to do the same thing but all they do is throw around accusations that fit their view and link articles that also contain no evidence and are just accusations themselves. It happens on both sides. Used to be you&#39;d have a large group going through actual data and trying to find something out, not starting from the conclusion and accusing backwards to support it. And it happens on both sides.</p>

<p>You get massively downvoted for just asking for evidence/sources now. And I&#39;m not talking about posting theories or what-ifs, that has its place too but too often accusations are just posted as fact because they support the views of the group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit was started with seed money from Y-Combinator.  One of the 4 founders of Y-Combinator is Robert Morris. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_(cryptographer)">The father of Robert Morris was the chief computer scientist at the NSA.</a>.  NSA is DoD.</p>

<p>The NSA claims <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=207195207">sufficient evidence for suspicion and active surveillance is &quot;3 hops&quot;</a> or an interlock between three names.  The distance between NSA father to son to Reddit is 3 hops, the NSA&#39;s own basis for suspicion and investigation.</p>

<p>Co-founder of Reddit Steve Huffman went to University of Virginia&#39;s Computer Science program under Anita K. Jones, ex-DARPA &amp; Department of Defense.  Again, using the NSA&#39;s own standard of &quot;3 hops&quot; it looks like an association of opportunity.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_K._Jones">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_K._Jones</a> 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Huffman">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Huffman</a></p>

<p>Using the same standards of suspicion for the NSA that they have for us, we can deduce that Reddit is a DoD project.  The NSA is under the aegis of Department of Defense.  <a href="http://washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/eglin-air-force-base-busted-gaming-reddit.html">Fort Eglin is Department of Defense and they have been caught manipulating social media</a>.  Operation Earnest Voice is Department of Defense.  Its stated purpose is astroturfing.</p>

<p>The &quot;coup&quot; happening now is manipulation.  The same coup happened during 2016, when liberals were instantly downvoted.</p>

<p>The current Reddit downvote operation is driving much-needed right-wing traffic to &quot;Q&quot; subreddits.  By their fruits ye shall know them.</p>

<p>In my opinion, &quot;conspiracy&quot; is just a particular narrative. One that isn&#39;t generally accepted by people with a vested interest in making sure that narrative isn&#39;t espoused.</p>

<p>We have a sort of double-edged sword here; we accept the pejorative moniker of &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; because of these vested interests, and this sort of shields our discussions from those who would attempt to fracture our consensus. It doesn&#39;t <em>really</em> matter if what we conclude is true, because we&#39;re all safely contained here. You wouldn&#39;t want us to lose our label, because then people actually have to start doing something about all of the injustices being perpetuated.</p>
