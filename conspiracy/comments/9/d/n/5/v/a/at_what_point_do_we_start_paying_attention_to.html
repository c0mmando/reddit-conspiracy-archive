    <div class="md"><p>Only two of those flights were investigated by the CDC. </p>

<p>It is strange, but I honestly think some of it is psychosomatic--if you&#39;re getting on a plane after hearing all about what happened the day before on a plane and someone coughs, it might be enough for you to start feeling sick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a hard time with that explanation though. There have been single instance events like this in the past without a flood of &quot;hypochondriac&quot; events following. This seems to me it would be unprecedented in that regard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, fwiw, I believe the first plane yesterday got more publicity than any other similar stories have ever had. It was also the biggest case of this kind of thing, so it&#39;s being told to more people more often about a more horrible case. I think that could result in psychosomatic symptoms.</p>

<p>It would be one of the largest examples (that I know of, anyway), you&#39;re right. It just seems too suspicious otherwise, to me. I don&#39;t know who would be doing <em>what</em>, you know?</p>

<p>I guess we&#39;ll find out what&#39;s up when we see if any of these people get sick or certain symptoms. Diseases have incubation periods, after all.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s meaningless. Only two of the planes were in the US. The CDC works in the US. The planes in the other countries were investigated by their equivalent of the CDC.</p>

<p>Writing down this phenomenon as psychosomatic is beyond condescending and ignorant. If you had read OP&#39;s sources you&#39;d see some people in those planes were actually ill as confirmed by healthcare services in those countries and they&#39;re monitoring other people who were on those planes. No one in those planes is falsely claiming to be ill.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t get basic facts like that right, why bother posting?</p>

<p>Look up psychosomatic illnesses. That doesn&#39;t mean that they didn&#39;t have symptoms or that anyone was purposefully pretending to be ill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is the same as getting on a boat and going on a cruse and people getting sick, but the strange thing is that a flight is what, a couple of hours at the most?

    <div class="md"><p>Logical response. However, how many times have multiple cruise lines, had contagion events simultaneously across the globe within 48 hours? Occam&#39;s razor tells me it is just flu season and coincidence. My gut tells me something different... hope im not getting sick!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it would help the case if we deserted if all the plains where over the same region, or owned by the same parent company. or if we had a passenger manifest, we could get a general makeup of the passengers to determine if an important person(s) was on board, or people connected to a company or political group, or some inventor... the list goes on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But influenza has an incubation period of days, not hours. If it were an influenza infection on an airplane infecting people, there would not be multiple sick people before the flight even landed. Even the longest international flights aren&#39;t long enough for people to go from exposure to showing symptoms of flu on the flight.</p>

<p>If all of the sick passengers were in the same place and exposed to the flu before the flight, that would be a possibility. Otherwise you&#39;re looking at another infectious agent, a food-borne illness, exposure to a chemical or environmental agent, etc. </p>

We don&#39;t even have to test positive for anything. Obama signed the EO shortly before he left office, while believing Hillary was taking over.
