<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html">This</a> is the legal abilities the CDC has. Most of this not-huge quarantine and isolation things are done on a state-by-state basis. That&#39;s why during the Ebola scare, New Jersey did one thing (quarantined a nurse at the airport, for example) and New York did another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My memory looks to be mistaken as both the proposed law and EO came out around the same time in mid-late 2016. They have similar themes and the proposed law doesn&#39;t give exact time frames for forced detainment.

<p>I think you are referring to this E.O., during the Ebola flap,  which was an amendment to an Earlier one made by Bush during the SARS scare. </p>

<p>I am amused that I found this pretty good explanation at this site, considering recent events and actions. </p>

<p>I am not certain because OP didn&#39;t provide much information but I think this E.O. is for people arriving into the U.S. from other countries, this EO dated back to the SARS scar and was updated to include ebola by Obama but another user has posted the final regulation in a link from the CDC site. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (MSEHPA) is a public health act originally drafted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention to aid the United States&#39; state legislatures in revising their public health laws to control epidemics and respond to bioterrorism. The CDC&#39;s draft was revised by the Center for Law and the Public&#39;s Health, a collaboration between Georgetown University and Johns Hopkins University. By December 21, 2001, the act was released to state legislatures for review and approval. Critics immediately charged that the MSEHPA failed to protect the general public from abuses arising from the tremendous powers it would grant individual states in an emergency. The MSEHPA provisions also went beyond the scope of addressing bioterrorism while disregarding medical privacy standards. As of August 1, 2011, forty states have passed various forms of MSEHPA legislation.&quot;</p>
