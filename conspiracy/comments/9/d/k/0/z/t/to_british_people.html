Who in their right mind can look back at Corbyns past and say the man is a racist? Criticising the actions of a state does not amount to racism. What is happening to free speech? Should we just watch the extermination of a people and say nothing, is that how the Jewish people were liberated in WW2? just oh they are allowed to have an apartheid state because it’s racism to say otherwise. I just read what amounts to be propaganda in an article from Laura Kuenssberg, just skimming around the truth missing enough to demonise the Labour Party and anyone who dares criticise Israel. Journalism in the uk is dead, it’s rotten corpse on display everyday to see, we no longer have any trust worthy news source just bile spilling over. And then there’s the government accusing Putin and Russia of sanctioning an attack on the uk without any proof in the matter, just mouthing off how guilty Russia are knowing full well none of it will go to court for proof of liability. speculation and pure fabrication damn the accused without rebuttal. Government and press collude to cover our own crimes and demonise our “enemy’s”.  They’re all chaff,  nothing to be saved, government and media full to bursting with puppet mouth pieces and psychopathic sycophants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is important you realise that your anger has been created by people who you have never met over issues that will likely not affect you personally. The most serious issues that affect your life are kept away from your attention.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>1) Switch off your Television. Cancel your TV license.</p>

<p>2) Stop reading &#39;mainstream&#39; media.</p>

<p>3) Determine your priorities, what do you need to survive? What is stealing your mental or physical resources?</p>

<p>4) Examine where you are dependent upon government and work to end that.</p>

<p>5) Buy some books focused on what you want to know.</p>

<p>6) Help others cease their dependency.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Lots more, but I think these should help you a little.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Corbyn/anti-semitism story was absurd, but Corbyn has enemies on both sides - the Conservatives know Corbyn could win the next election for Labour, and they naturally want Labour to have a different leader. But the Parliamentary Labour Party doesn&#39;t like Corbyn either - they are vestigial Blairites. They want a different Labour leader too, even though Corbyn is far more likely to win them the next election.</p>

<p>Corbyn&#39;s support comes from ordinary Labour Party members and potential voters. Ironically, because Corbyn and Trump are political opposites, both of them rely on grass-roots support, and only receive lukewarm support from their own parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he was corruption then he wouldn&#39;t have constantly praised Venezuela as a example to the world. Surely he knew that Chavez who was president for 14 years (and would have stayed in power if the cancer hadn&#39;t gotten him ) and frequently cited as one of the most corrupt regimes on earth and one that got increasingly corrupt as time when on. There is also mass corruption in the Palestinian authority. I mean Arafat <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/1446309/Arafat-diverted-300m-of-public-money-to-Swiss-bank-account.html">literally diverted millions to his own private account</a> a lot of this was money that was fund raised by well meaning supporters like Corbyn. His priciples on corruption only seem to be vocalized when it is Israel or Trump but very rarely when it is those he supports. As we all know having double standards is akin to having no standards at all and therefore Corbyn can&#39;t be described as being anti-corruption but merely anti-western corruption. </p>

<p>The UK state is &#39;corrupt, violent, oppressive, dishonest &#39; but lets not pretend that the Islamic, IRA, Venezuela, Argentinean and palestinian authorties 
aren&#39;t also. One can&#39;t pretend to be against one but not the others. Corbyn is seletively outragged but certain crimes but happy to make excuses and shy away from criticizing other if it isn&#39;t politically advantageous for him. Politicians are in general professional liars, Corbyn is no different, don&#39;t fool for his facade of good intentions. </p>

<p>Also Corbyn can&#39;t be in anyway described as pro-freedom he frequently calls for more restrictions against freedom of speech under the guise of hate-speech laws, which are open to interpretation. He is also pro-big government, property seizure and despite being a massive rebel even within his own party he is being ironically dictatorial in his own management of the party, with ministers resigning after Corbyn tried to impose a whip on his MPs. </p>

<p>Him being pro-self determination didn&#39;t seem to extend to the people of Northern ireland when he repeated called for british troop withdrawal from our own territory which is majority pro-union or the Falkland islands when he argued against UK intervention (again our own people). Seems that is priciples for self determination don&#39;t extend past the people of the west bank and certainly not to the citizens of the UK. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apology gladly accepted, mate. I’m not here to bicker and argue, just to discuss as openly as I can.</p>

<p>Here’s a decent over view from Channel 4 in 2017 that lays out the rough history.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-corbyn-on-northern-ireland">https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-corbyn-on-northern-ireland</a></p>

<p>He also attended events to commemorate IRA ‘achievements’, the most commonly known one being in ‘88 after four British soldiers were killed by the IRA in Holland. He attended these events for seven years. It is also possible he edited a commemoration programmer that mocked the Conservatives killed and injured in the Brighton bombings.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11924431/Revealed-Jeremy-Corbyn-and-John-McDonnells-close-IRA-links.html">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11924431/Revealed-Jeremy-Corbyn-and-John-McDonnells-close-IRA-links.html</a></p>

<p>I am neither pro or anti royalist. I understand completely how much of a giant fustercluck the whole Irish thing is and that while political communication is and was important to the peace process Jeremy Corbyn voted against the Anglo Irish Agreement in 1985. He also obscures, gives half answers and sometimes just ignores questions on his past involvement with Sinn Fein and the IRA, which leads me to believe he is absolutely hiding his real thoughts and opinions on the subject.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day it all comes down to what you discern as a credible source. If you don’t view the MI5, Channel 4, the Independent or Telegraph as credible you’ll have to tell me who is a credible source and we can go from there.</p>

<p>Well then you had better reexamine the Zionist bastards that are behind the defamation and destruction of Corbyn and Labor.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing"><strong>The King David Hotel Bombing</strong>*</a> was the single <em>deadliest</em> terrorist attack ever carried out in Palestine/ Israeli, killing 91, and injuring scores of others.</p>

<p>The target was British Military Headquarters, housed in that hotel during the British Mandate period -- you know, when the Brits were HELPING the Zionists to establish their &quot;Jewish Homeland&quot; pursuant to promises made, under duress, in the Balfour Declaration nearly three decades previous.</p>

<p>Tan is to the (sometimes reluctant) help of the British, Zionists had finally established a firm foothold in Palestine, and, and thanks to the massive influx of Jews fleeing the horrors of the Holocaust, the finally had the population base of Jews needed to launch the Jewish State that the Zionists had been working tirelessly to achieve co <strong><em>50 years</em></strong>.</p>

<p>With WW2 ending, Zionists were ready to make their move, and the Brits, on whose good graces they had been so utterly dependent, had outlived their usefulness: They fully intended to launch a &quot;blitzkrieg&quot;, snatching as much territory as possible, while simultaneously driving their Arab neighbors out of the area.</p>

<p>The Zionists knew that British would not stand for this, so <strong><em>they had to go</em></strong>, the sooner the better.</p>

<p>It is said that the bombing plot was hatched by <strong><em>Irgun</em></strong>, an outlawed criminal gang of Zionist terrorists whose leaders were being sought for arrest by the controlling British authorities <em>(though it certain that Ben Gurion and other Zionist leaders were in agreement with the *motives</em> of the bombing, if not the act itself)*.</p>

<p>You can read the grisly details of the act at the link provided above  (bearing in mind that the &quot;history&quot; of the event has been whitewashed to minimize this vicious act of treachery, and the callousness of its perpetrators).</p>

<p>The criminal <strong><em>mastermind</em></strong> behind this deadliest act of terror was one <strong><em>Menachem Begin</em></strong>, leader of the Irgun terrorist group.</p>

<p>His identity was known, and his actions were <strong><em>never denied</em></strong> -- indeed, he was <em>&quot;punished&quot;</em> for this crime by being elected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Begin"><strong><em>Prime Minister of Israel</em></strong></a> in 1977.</p>

<p>As for <strong><em>Irgun</em></strong>, the Terrorist Organization he headed, well, they became a &quot;respectable&quot; <strong><em>political party</em></strong> in the fledgling Zionist State, where their political descendants remain highly active to this day... but they changed their name, of course...</p>

<p>These days they are called the <strong><em>Likud Party</em></strong>, and their most prominent member is <strong><em>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</em></strong> -- whose ruthless policies and acts of terrorism against non-Jews surely surpass those of his bespectacled forebearer, Menachem Begin.</p>

<p>The primary difference being that when Netanyahu acts, he does so under the &quot;color of law&quot;, with the official consent of the Zionist Government, and presumably, its (Jewish) citizens and foreign supporters -- in Britain, the US, France, etc.</p>

<p>So while I applaud you for your service to your country, and for your opposition to &quot;terrorists&quot;, I hope that you realize that there are others who are working feverishly to undermine, <em>by whatever means at their disposal</em>, the foundations of YOUR society <strong><em>in pursuit of their own particular interests</em></strong>... and that this tiny, strident and POLITICALLY TERRORISTIC minority is as unconcerned with the well-being of the British People as Menachem Begin and Irvin were with the &quot;well-being&quot; of the British Leaders in the King David Hotel in 1946.</p>

<p>Interestingly, these same Political Terrorists would like to make it a CRIME for anyone to publicly recount the <strong><em>history</em></strong> that I have written above (if they haven&#39;t already pushed through such laws in Britain)</p>

<p>Can you blame them?</p>

<p><em>&quot;Thanks apolitical, it’s not often that I get a chance to expand my knowledge of post war military history, especially via the conspiracy sub.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read, and for your willingness to take what I wrote into consideration. &quot;Political sensitivities&quot; would cause many people to reject that bit of history out of hand.</p>

<p>Understand that, to Zionists, the destruction and defeat of Corbyn and Labour is <strong><em>extremely important</em></strong>: Britain is one of the Five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council -- and as such, it holds VETO power in that body.</p>

<p>Corbyn is being attacked because, they allege, he is &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;, but what does that mean, from the Zionist perspective?</p>

<p>It means that he is NOT TRUSTED to be <strong><em>pro-Zionist</em></strong>, that they fear that they will NOT be able to CONTROL him, and to bribe/ coerce him into serving Zionist interests, especially when said interests contradict the interests of the British People.</p>

<p>Zionists are well aware of such perils, and they go to great lengths to ENSURE that only those they CAN control are elected to leadership positions in <em>&quot;countries that matter&quot;</em> -- the US, Britain, France, etc.</p>

<p>In Britain, Jews comprise a tiny minority: ~0.5% of the population, but as in the US and France, Canada, Australia, etc., their collective wealth, in-group cohesiveness and political influence makes them an <strong><em>extremely powerful</em></strong> minority. Indeed, there is NO other group that can be compared.</p>

<p>The unique history and tribalist/ familial nature of the Jewish people has resulted in an in-group <em>(us vs them)</em> mindset that is remarkably persistent: it has spanned centuries and blurred the lines of political states for countless generations. With rare exception, their genetic/ tribal identity trumps any loyalty to country or sovereign in the nation where they happen to live -- and <em>in most cases</em>, their priorities become readily apparent when the interests of The Tribe conflict with those of the political state where they happen to abide.</p>

<p>Indeed, had we the <em>courage</em> to be honest and forthright in our speech, we <em>might</em> be inclined to call their Tribalist behavior &quot;<strong><em>Semitism</em></strong>&quot; <em>(a predisposition favorable to Jews/ Jewish interests)</em>; conversely, one might be inclined to view anyone who is NOT predisposed to favor Jewish interests <em>(above all others)</em> as <strong><em>anti-Semitic</em></strong>, no?</p>

<p>When we cut through the layers of Political Correctness... of genteel niceties and polite courtesies, that is the PRECISE DE FACTO DEFINITION of <em>&quot;anti-Semitism&quot;</em>: The failure to hold the interests of Jews, as a Tribe, as one&#39;s highest priority -- the interests of <em>any other</em>* group notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Please notice my emphasis on the term <em>&quot;DE FACTO&quot;</em> above -- this is important because, though these demands are rarely <em>spoken</em> (God forbid!), they are a powerfully decisive element that COMMANDS ATTENTION in the <strong><em>real world</em></strong> of politics, in the media, and in daily life -- and those who fail to adhere to these <em>&quot;unspoken demands&quot;</em> are likely to find themselves as an unhappy target of the WRATH of those they Have &quot;offended&quot; -- whether wittingly or unwittingly.</p>

<p>Such is the plight of Jeremy Corbyn, and of George Galloway, and of Cynthia McKinney and James Traficant, and many others whose lives, careers and political/ moral ambitions led them to fall in the crosshairs of these &quot;untouchables&quot;.</p>

<p>Now, lest I be accused of painting with an overly-broad brush, accused of &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; (again... Surprise!), I should note that I do NOT call out every person of Jewish heritage as a participant in this pattern of behavior, rather, I speak in GENERALITIES, focusing NOT on individuals, but on the overall proclivities of THE GROUP (are we <em>allowed</em> to do that? Or is this a right they have reserved to themselves exclusively?)</p>

<p>Perhaps a better term to invoke would be <strong><em>Semitists</em></strong>: Jewish Supremacists? But as that term is not presently &quot;in vogue&quot;, it might be more apropos to call them &quot;<strong><em>Zionists</em></strong>&quot;, though in reality, the terms are synonymous.</p>

<p>So then, who are these people? This hypersensitive, hyper-vocal and hypocritical minority who are <strong><em>obsessed</em></strong> with meddling in the affairs and perverting the interests of countries to which their &quot;loyalties&quot; are provisional AND conditional -- and yet who wield such disproportionate influence over the fates of those who, in their heart of hearts, they <strong><em>Reject</em></strong> as &quot;strangers&quot;?</p>

<p>Whoever they are, I, for one, wish them well... But NOT at the expense and to the detriment of the rest of humanity.</p>

<p>In modern times, such specimens of Cultish Tribalism have become a liability and a threat to humanity as a whole.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time we evolved beyond such mindsets. Failure to do so may be catastrophic.</p>

<p>Good evening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesnt matter what you or I or we think,  as 4chan recently exposed and what you may not be aware of is the fact that only 30% of people have an inner voice.  Think about that.   7 out of 10 people have no language based inner dialogue.  They are literal NPCs.</p>

<p>The government know they only need tell this majority of non thinkers something and they will believe it as true. If you say something that goes against this belief they have been programmed to react aggressively towards you.   </p>

<p>We know this Russian poisoning case is using bullshit as evidence.  The government are rubbing our noses in it by making it so obvious, whilst showing us theyve got the majority firmly under control.   </p>

<p>You cant redpill people who don&#39;t think!  70% of the population are 90 IQ or lower, they have no language based inner dialogue and cannot even internally visualise.   The only time they can is when they have extreme emotions, and even then its only an internal dialogue that looks like this &quot;fucking cunt,  fucking saying that, I&#39;ll fucking tear his fucking throat out, fucking cunt bastard, shit&#39;.....</p>

<p>They run almost entirely on reptile brain.   Most people are reptiles in human skin.   If they are told to kill you, they will.   </p>

<p>We are fucked mate.</p>

They have redefined racism to stifle those who criticise, object or question what they do and the brainwashed masses just go along with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I can tell, it was started when Labour started pulling ahead in the polls. It’s not an organic thing, it’s people trying to find stuff they can use against Corbyn. Because he’s anti-Israeli policy wrt Palestine, it gives them a way of trying to pretend it’s Antisemitism to try and ruin him and get rid of him, because he wants to tighten tax avoidance laws, investigate panama papers, force MPs to declare offshore trusts etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not from there so I dont know the specifics, but sounds like this is a case of people in power using the media for political purposes rather than to delivery actual news, which has happened since the beginning of time. Only difference now is there is no beacon of truth and one to check them or call them on their bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This implies that you can’t criticise anyone without being racist because everyone belongs to a race and as a representative of your race, any critique of your behaviour amounts to unfair criticism of everyone of the same race as you. But that’s a load of bullshit, everyone is accountable for their actions. States even more so because of the power they wield. A country doesn’t just get to do what it wants because it’s an ethnostate that is fucking ridiculous.</p>
