<p>Why you Should Believe</p>

<p>Things to Keep in Mind
• Not every piece of evidence is certain
• Keep an open mind
• This is for you not me 
• Understand that “The Fear of God is the beginning of Wisdom”
• If there is a quote from a website or article I will link it either right after or underneath the point
• THIS IS ALL SPECULATION
• The last pages are for you if u want to believe </p>

<p>Intro:</p>

<p>“Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, ‘Tell us, when will these things be? And what will the sign of your coming, and the end of the age?’ And Jesus answered and said to them: ‘Take heed that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive many. And you will hear of wars and rumors of war. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earth wakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains. Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for my names sake. At that time many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one another. Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. And because of lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end will be saved. And this hospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.”
    -Mathew 24:3-14</p>

<p>2 Timothy 3:1-5</p>

<p>But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God—  having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people.
Jesus said all these signs would come as birth pains, such that all of this would increase in severity and frequency until he arrives</p>

<p>Romans 13:11
“and do this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.”</p>

<p>END TIME PROPHECIES:</p>

<p> “But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy

<li> A study done by the Williams Institute in April 2011 showed that roughly 9 million Americans are homosexual, while 19 million engage in homosexuality without being committed, and 25 million admit to having homosexual emotions either acted on or not.

<li> The leaders of Justice in the USA made it ILLLEGAL to public school children to talk to God, the one who created all, the one responsible for most things good. This happened while Christians did nothing and sat on their hands</li>
<li> The leaders of the Justice in the USA made it LEGAL for Americans to sacrifice their kids, i.e. abortion. In 2015, America was informed that not only are we allowing them to be ripped apart in to pieces, we “collectively” were selling these parts to the highest bidders.
An undercover video released this morning shows a national leader of Planned Parenthood admitting that the abortion provider uses the illegal and highly controversial partial birth abortion procedure to sell intact fetal body parts. 
“The average asking price for fetal body parts? Between $30 and $100 per specimen.” 
Dr. Deborah Nucatola has been senior director of medical services at Planned Parenthood since February 2009, where she oversees medical practices at all Planned Parenthood affiliates nationwide. She has been employed by Planned Parenthood for more than a decade. She also performs abortions up to 24 weeks in Los Angeles.
“We’ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, ‘I’m not gonna crush that part, I’m gonna basically crush below, I’m gonna crush above, and I’m gonna see if I can get it all intact.”
“I’d say a lot of people want liver. And for that reason, most providers will do this case under ultrasound guidance, so they’ll know where they’re putting their forceps. The kind of rate-limiting step of the procedure is calvarium. Calvarium — the head — is basically the biggest part.”

<p>The Devil &amp; Music</p>

<p>Lucifer is the Angel of music
(Isaiah 14:11-15) We are given a description of Lucifer’s fall from heaven and in verse 11 it says, “Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, and the sound of your stringed instruments“ He uses music to get people to worship him.</p>

<p>(Ezekiel 28:13) We’re told that Lucifer was created very beautifully, and that the workmanship of his musical instruments were prepared for him on the day that he was created and then he got lifted up </p>

• “The brain is Prewired for music”
• Music (like a drug) has a very strong influence on the brain
• The brain is heavily affected by music when its developing in teen years
• Ask yourself what else could be used to deceive many other than Hollywood actors and music producers. They sold their soul in order to achieve fame but they must do Satans bidding</p>

<p>Quotes from famous musicians:
• Lil Richard- “I was directed and commanded by another power, the power of darkness, the power of the devil, Satan. We must realize that there is a force that is fighting against us in this world. The devil was controlling our minds, directing our lives.”
• Jimi Hendrix- “I can explain everything better through music. You hypnotize people and when you get people at their weakest point you can preach into the subconscious what we want to say. That’s why the name electric church flashes in and out in my song.”
• Led Zeppelin on one of their songs called houses of the holy- “Let the music be your master, won’t you heed the masters call? Oh Satan.”
• Tori Amos- “I wanted to marry Lucifer. I don’t consider Lucifer and evil force I feel his presence in his music. I feel like he comes and sits on my piano.”
• Jerry Lee Lewis- “I have the Devil in me”
• David Bowie- Rock and Roll has always been the Devil’s music. My overriding interest was in Kabbalah and Crowley ISM (Aleister Crowley). That whole dark and rather fearsome never world of the wrong side of the brain. I’m closer to the golden dawn immersed in Crowley’s uniform.”
o   Hit Parader Magazine reported that Bowie would light candles and draw pentagrams on his walls
• John Lennon- “I’ve sold my soul to the Devil, but my joy is when your like, possessed. Like a medium you know. I’ll be sitting around, and it’ll come in the middle of the night or at the time when you don’t want to do it and that’s the exciting part. I don’t know who wrote it I’m just sitting there and the whole fucking song comes out. So, you’re like driven and you find yourself over on a piano or a guitar and you put it down because it’s been given to you or whatever it is that you tuned in to.” “The whole Beatle idea was do what thou willst.”<br/>
o   Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law is a moral utterance found in the thalamic foundation scripture which is called the book of the law. Do what thou wilt is known as the law of Thelema.
 Aleister Crowley taught this law in mentoring many of the most famous rock bands in the history of mankind. The cover of the Sargent Peppers Lonely Hearts Club band by the Beatles showed Aleister Crowley in the back. All of the people in the album artwork were “People we like and admire”
 Paul McCartney said, “(for the) Sergeant Peppers cover were going to have photos on the wall of all of our hero’s”
 Aleister Crowley was an Infamous Satanist of his time
 Theories suggest that Aleister Crowley is Sergeant Pepper and he is mentoring the Beatles</p>

<p> Led Zeppelin also were influenced by him. 
• Aleister Crowley proclaimed himself as the beast of 666
• Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page bought Crowley’s mansion on the shore of loch Ness where Crowley practiced his rituals
• Ozzy Osborne on Aleister Crowley- “A phenomenon of his time.”
o   Made a song on him called Mr. Crowley
 Lyrics: You fooled all the people with magic, you waited on Satan’s called, Mr. Crowley, won’t you ride my white horse.
• Carlos Santana- “I know it sounds new age but, in my meditation, this entity, called Metatron. We want to hook you back to the radio air wave frequency. We want you to reach junior high schools and universities. Once you reach them, because we are going to connect you with the best artists of the day then we want you to present them a new menu. Let them know that they are themselves, multidimensional spirits with enormous possibilities and opportunities.” 
o   The snake from Pandora’s box
• Keith Richards- “The devil doesn’t bother me, it’s that God that pisses me off. There’s a demon in me and I’ve got four or five of them and we are all good friends. So, I thought I’d just singularize it, it’s like yeah, check yourself and he’s still there in me. I’ve learned how to control him, I guess that’s what demons are about.
• Kurt Cobain- “I will get stoned and worship Satan”
• Black Sabbath- “We sold our souls for Rock N Roll”
• AC/DC- “Highway to hell” (Album cover has horns on their heads)
o   Angus Young- “By the time we are halfway through the first number, someone else is steering me, I’m just along for the ride. I become possessed when I go on stage”
• Michael Jackson- Its all of the sudden, a magic from somewhere that comes, and the spirit just hits you and you lose control of yourself. I wake up from dreams and go WOW, put this down on paper. The whole thing is strange, you hear the words, everything is right there in front of your face and you say to yourself, ‘I’m sorry I didn’t write this, it’s already there. I feel that somewhere someplace it’s all been done and I’m the courier bringing it into the world.”
• Nicole Sherzinger- “To be honest with you, I sometimes wish I were more slutty. I’d probably be a lot more successful if I were. This is such a tough industry, you know. To make it, you really have to sell your soul to the devil.”
• Snoop Dogg- In his autobiography &quot;The Doggfather&quot;, Snoop Dogg says the devil came to him to make a deal that he would be rich and famous in exchange for his soul. Snoop said yes and identifies that as the death of calvin broadus and the birth of snoop dogg.</p>

<p>Rap Songs that Allude to the Devil</p>

<p>Listen to Untitled 1 Kendrick Lamar(01:15-End)
Lyrics: This is the best song for supporting this
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life is long as infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our believe&#39;s the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, they paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling &quot;he&#39;s alive&quot;
Backpedaling christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom&#39;s been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It&#39;s happening) no more running from world wars
(It&#39;s happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It&#39;s happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
&quot;What have you did for me&quot;
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes pray to god that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly &#39;fore you told me
To use my vocals to save man-kind for you
Say I didn&#39;t try for you, say I didn&#39;t ride for you
I tied for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I&#39;mma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I&#39;m running in place trying to make it to church
Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo&#39; cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
Just take it all back before the light switch</p>

<p>• A$AP Rocky-
o   Holy Ghost
They ask me why I don&#39;t go to church no more
Cause church is the new club and wine is the new bub
And lies is the new drugs
My sister the next stripper, my brother the next victim
My usher the next tricker
Satan givin&#39; out deals, finna own these rappers
The game is full of slaves and they mostly rappers
You sold your soul first, then your homies after
Let&#39;s show these stupid field niggas they could own they masters
Holy smokes, I think my pastor was the only folk
To own the Rollie, Ghost and Rolls Royces with no Holy Ghost
And get your shit prepared, face your fears, all you niggas scared
Say your prayers, pray he fit upstairs, it&#39;s our only hope
Church bells and choir sounds, tell &#39;em, &quot;Quiet down&quot;
Bow your head, the Most High&#39;s around, Lord</p>

<p>Who&#39;s more important than your Lord and Saviour?
Won&#39;t let the pearly gates up in this
Probably do that on your poor behavior
My mentor got a couple tips to save ya
Just be sure to count it as my only favour, thank me later
Uh, every night I stayed up sayin&#39; prayer, made me greater, uh
Let&#39;s savior chasin&#39; green for collard greens and baked potatoes
On the table, pray for cable, hit the label, now we major
Ha, I got my own relationship with God, Lord</p>

<p>• Kendrick Lamar- HOLY SHIT WHERE TO START
o   Untitled 2- 
I’m sick and tired of being tired
Can’t pick a side, the Gemini
Prophesize if we live or not, I
Promise momma not to feel no lie
Seen black turn ’em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I’m greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?</p>

<p>Get God on the phone
Said it won’t be long
I see jiggaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
I see jiggaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone
Tell the squad come home
We gon’ ball again ‘fore he call us home
World is going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
It’s a tidal wave, it’s a thunderdome</p>

<p>o   Bitch Dont Kill my Vibe- or a prayer for sinners to be saved
I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don&#39;t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don&#39;t kill my vibe</p>

<p>I am a human
Who is probably going to fall again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don&#39;t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don&#39;t kill my vibe</p>

<p>We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to</p>

<p>o   Alright –
Lord knows, twenty of &#39;em in my Chevy
Tell &#39;em all to come and get me, reapin&#39; everything I sow
So my karma come and Heaven no preliminary hearing
So my record and my motherf*****g gang stand in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it&#39;s too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Try and decide my vices all day
Won&#39;t you please believe when I say</p>

<p>What you want, your house, your car
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I&#39;m your dog
Motherf****r you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know when it&#39;s illegal
I don&#39;t think about it, I deposit every other zero</p>

<p>o   JUST LISTEN TO U!</p>

<p>o   Pride-</p>

<p>I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior you and I
See, in a perfect world, I&#39;ll choose faith over riches
I&#39;ll choose work over bitches, I&#39;ll make schools out of prison
I&#39;ll take all the religions and put &#39;em all in one service
Just to tell &#39;em we ain&#39;t shit, but He&#39;s been perfect, world</p>

<p>o   These Walls-</p>

<p>I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same</p>

<p>If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you&#39;re irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
o   DNA-</p>

<p>Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade</p>

<p>I got millions, I got riches buildin&#39; in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA</p>

<p>And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power’s here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say</p>

<p>Watchin&#39; all the snakes, curvin&#39; all the fakes
Phone never on, I don&#39;t conversate
I don&#39;t compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder — these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way</p>

<p>o   X, or (10)-</p>

<p>CHORUS: 
Somebody pop all day (hol&#39; up)
Somebody on they way (hol&#39; up)
I wore the crown all day (hol&#39; up)
Somebody can&#39;t relate (hol&#39; up)
Stay down with no fakin&#39; (go up)
Top-down, I&#39;ve been racin&#39; (go up)
She wild and been dangerous (go up)
My crown in rotation, yeah</p>

<p>Are you on ten yet? Are you on ten yet? (wait)
Are you on ten yet?
Are you on ten yet? I live on ten (wait)
But are you on ten yet?
Are you on ten yet? (hol&#39; up)
Fuck the place up, fuck the place up
Fuck the place up, fuck the place up
Fuck the place up, fuck the place up</p>

<p>o   Pray for Me-</p>

<p>I&#39;m always ready for a war again
Go down that road again
It&#39;s all the same
I&#39;m always ready to take a life again
You know I&#39;ll ride again
It&#39;s all the same (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me who&#39;s gon&#39; save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who&#39;s gon&#39; save me from myself
Without you, I&#39;m all alone</p>

<p>Who gon&#39; pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
&#39;Cause I&#39;m alone, you see
If I&#39;m gon&#39; die for you
If I&#39;m gon&#39; kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey</p>

<p>I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I&#39;m tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin&#39; hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain&#39;t relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don&#39;t skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin&#39; men
Clutchin&#39; on deaf ears again, rapture is comin&#39;
It&#39;s all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then that&#39;s what it gotta be</p>

<p>“Belly of the beast”?</p>

<p>• Flatbush Zombies alludes to belly of the beast many times</p>

<p>• FEEL
[Intro: Kendrick Lamar &amp; Chelsea Blythe]
Ain&#39;t nobody prayin&#39; for me
Ain&#39;t nobody prayin&#39; for me
Ain&#39;t nobody prayin&#39; for me
Ain&#39;t nobody prayin&#39; for me</p>

<p>[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I&#39;m losin&#39; my focus
I feel like I&#39;m losin&#39; my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you&#39;re miseducated
Feel like I don&#39;t wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain&#39;t no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin&#39;, I&#39;m done pretendin&#39;
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin&#39;
I feel like the feelings are changin&#39;
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain&#39;t feelin&#39; you all
Feel like removin&#39; myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I&#39;ve been in the field for you
It&#39;s real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—</p>

<p>[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Ain&#39;t nobody prayin&#39; for me
Ain&#39;t nobody prayin&#39; for me
Ain&#39;t nobody prayin&#39; for me
Ain&#39;t nobody prayin&#39;</p>

<p>[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin&#39; they pockets
I feel like debatin&#39; on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y&#39;all is peasants
I feel like all of y&#39;all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin&#39; a real mic
I ain&#39;t feelin&#39; your presence
Feel like I&#39;ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music, though
I feel like your feelin&#39; ain&#39;t mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin&#39; of no hope
The feelin&#39; of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin&#39;, the feelin&#39; of false freedom
I&#39;ll force-feed &#39;em the poison that fill &#39;em up in the prison
I feel like it&#39;s just me
Look, I feel like I can&#39;t breathe
Look, I feel like I can&#39;t sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin&#39; of fallin&#39;, of fallin&#39; apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin&#39; the void of bein&#39; employed with ballin&#39;
Streets is talkin&#39;, fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill &#39;em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin&#39; what &#39;Pac was
The feelin&#39; of an apocalypse happenin&#39;
But nothin&#39; is awkward, the feelin&#39; won&#39;t prosper
The feelin&#39; is toxic, I feel like I&#39;m boxin&#39; demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin&#39;
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic
I feel like say somethin&#39;, I feel like take somethin&#39;
I feel like skatin&#39; off, I feel like waitin&#39; for &#39;em
Maybe it&#39;s too late for &#39;em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for &#39;em
But who the fuck prayin&#39; for me?
o   </p>

<p>• Underachievers- (FALSE PROHETS)</p>

<p>o   Gold Soul Theory-</p>

<p>I&#39;m on a path, to move the masses, spiritual tactics
Soul masters, you bastards, spread it through classes</p>

<p>Living in the world filled up with glitter and gold
A nigga could get caught up if he ain&#39;t knowing his soul
His soul, yeah nigga his soul
You ain&#39;t living up your life, that why your shit moving slow</p>

<p>Gender roles, nigga I&#39;m God as far as gender goes
Sell my soul, never I&#39;m gold, word to Gihanny golly</p>

<p>Freeze, repeat, rewind, back to the time I was blind
Never, I always incline the Third Eye
Recognized since a younging and the Indigo that&#39;s inside
Show my signs as an early bird, word I want what&#39;s mine, mine</p>

<p>Get up on your shit, you ain&#39;t living up your life
You&#39;s a fucking living God, why you bowing down to Christ
You ain&#39;t knowing &#39;bout the golden gift that&#39;s trapped up in your mind
Gold soul theory, Indigo&#39;s on the rise</p>

<p>• Underachievers continued
o   My Prism-</p>

<p>Oh, you&#39;re a Jesus Christ fan? I&#39;m the sequel man
See, you&#39;ve got a piece of God trapped in your soul
It&#39;s goes deeper than a motherfucking human though
Christ Conscience shit, living optimal
All the religious bullshit, it&#39;s got go
Because these niggas can&#39;t read their Bible codes
They preach lies to the masses, fill &#39;em up with hope
Takin&#39; lunches from you niggas if your pockets broke
Now the preacher in the Church fuckin&#39; lots of hoes</p>

<p>Now like the Christian religion, he&#39;s filled with holes
Nah, but I don&#39;t kill though
Tryna see if niggas got sense you know
Fuck the Church and go blow your smoke
The new religion is here, nigga, named Beast Coast
Yeah, we&#39;re called Beast Coast
But fuck the US, we turn to the globe
The world inside my hand like a metaphor, poem
Oh, you see the light, it&#39;s best I keep going
I came from the great beyond, from out the light I spawned
I ain&#39;t a homosapien, I&#39;m from the elevated patriarch</p>

<p>Use my three eyes just to demise other villains
Pop, pop, pop, third eyes fuckin&#39; shredder
Little lock, give me props, cause I coulda been a felon
But I, stay golden, path I wrote it
Y&#39;all can&#39;t hold it, rhyme with the words spit
Conscience, keep time with some Earth wind
Vietnam nigga, drop bombs on your loose lip
Holy ghost, I&#39;m back in the flesh
Resurrected, like I never left, architect Imhotep
Yes I&#39;m blessed, steal your bitch, cause a nigga up next
Use that power up inside ya, divinely create desires, just try it
I bet you&#39;ll notice the God within, can&#39;t deny it, huh?
We&#39;re some young Messiah&#39;s, we triumph, nigga, fuck religion
Found a better way of living when the light shines through my prism nigga</p>

<p>• Kanye West:
o   No more parties in LA</p>

<p>• Tupac:
o   Good Life</p>

<p>&quot;I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang 
Now tell if I&#39;m wrong 
but sayin &quot;Fuck the world&quot; got you deeper in my songs 
Drinkin &#39;til I earl, spendin money &#39;til it&#39;s gone 
It&#39;s the good life - maybe niggaz got it goin on&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;why I should change, into a softie 
.. after living so loftily 
It cost me my soul out of control in a devil&#39;s world&quot; </p>

<p>How to be Saved:
When Jesus Christ died on the cross, He provided salvation for all. </p>

<p>(John 12:32-33).
“‘And when I am lifted up on the cross, I will draw everyone to myself.’ He said this to indicate how he was going to die”. Salvation has been provided; it now must be accepted.</p>

<p>Salvation is simply a process of confessing and believing. You must confess that Jesus is Lord, which signifies his realization that Christ must have full rule over your life with all of His righteous requirements.</p>

<p>• You must ask for salvation, and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior</p>

<p>You must believe that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead. This belief in the death and resurrection of Jesus carries with it the realization that the penalty has been paid for sin and power is provided for man to live a life free from sin. Thus, man’s relationship to God is restored. As the Bible tells us, </p>

<p>(Romans 10:9-11)
“For if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by confessing with your mouth that you are saved” (Romans 10:9-11)</p>

<p>• Believe that Jesus was resurrected and died for your sins</p>

<p>You must say the sinner’s prayer and repent for past sins. You must truly believe in your heart that you have done wrong and to your best effort attempt to not recreate past sin.</p>

<p>• Lord Jesus, for too long I’ve kept you out of my life. I know that I am a sinner and that I cannot save myself. No longer will I close the door when I hear you knocking. By faith I gratefully receive your gift of salvation. I am ready to trust you as my Lord and Savior. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for coming to earth. I believe you are the Son of God who died on the cross for my sins and rose from the dead on the third day. Thank you for bearing my sins and giving me the gift of eternal life. I believe your words are true. Come into my heart, Lord Jesus, and be my Savior. Amen.</p>

<p>• Follow the 10 Commandments:</p>

<p>The Ten Commandments</p>

<ol>
<li> You shall have no other Gods but me.</li>
<li> You shall not make for yourself any idol, nor bow down to it or worship it.</li>
<li> You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.</li>
<li> You shall remember and keep the Sabbath day holy.</li>
<li> Respect your father and mother.</li>
<li> You must not commit murder.</li>
<li> You must not commit adultery.</li>
<li> You must not steal.</li>
<li> You must not give false evidence against your neighbor.</li>
<li>You must not be envious of your neighbor’s goods. You shall not be envious of his house nor his wife, nor anything that belongs to your neighbor.</li>
</ol>

<p>What we Know of the Book of Life:
YOU CANNOT BE SAVED UNLESS YOU ARE IN THE BOOK OF LIFE.</p>

<p>Revalation 20:15
“Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.”</p>

<p>Revelation 21:27
“Nothing evil will be allowed to enter—no one who practices shameful idolatry and dishonesty—but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life” </p>

<p>Revelation 3:5
“He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name from the Book of Life; but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels” </p>

<p>Malachi 3:16
“Then those who feared the Lord spoke with each other, and the Lord listened to what they said. In his presence, a scroll of remembrance was written to record the names of those who feared him and loved to think about him”</p>

<p>Those who practice sin won’t be in the Book of Life, but forgiven overcomers will be written there. As Malachi points out, those who fear God and think and talk about Him will be recorded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Riddle me this..
Why did God bother to create the concept of deception in the first place. What about envy or pride? If he is the Creator of literally everything, why did he create Lucifer with the capacity for these things which of course led to his rebellion and thus his banishment from the heavens?<br/>
Don&#39;t say it&#39;s because he loves all his creations.  that smacks of nonsense.</p>

<p>Honestly I have to say, if I were an all powerful, omnipotent being I would not endow my creations, angel or otherwise with anything close to free will or the capacity for thought.
That would be a mistake, as one can plainly see. (From a certain perspective anyway)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are valid questions that should be considered since it is in regards to the very foundation of any knowledge/belief. Though I think the average person does or has considered those questions. </p>

<p>Now in his (the OP&#39;s) defence, he stated in the beginning that his whole post was just speculation and just something to keep in mind. Which means he is not stating anything as a fact (regardless of his personal beliefs) So it&#39;s simply information. </p>

<p>Since he presented his research (proof), the scientific response would be to go through and read his research and see if his religion/bible hold any weight. Though to propose his research is not valid proof would also require proof/facts that his religion or the bible is not correct or factual. Without this the counter argument would be based on speculation/beliefs in which is the very thing brought into question.</p>

<p>Which is a whole lot of work and has yet to be factually proven successfully on either side. In my opinion its best to just save the headaches on both sides.</p>

<p>But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy -2 Timothy 3:1</p>

<p>A study done by the Williams Institute in April 2011 showed that roughly 9 million Americans are homosexual, while 19 million engage in homosexuality without being committed, and 25 million admit to having homosexual emotions either acted on or not. And just because I note this doesn’t mean I hate gays.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so what was the point in bringing up homosexuals? especially after a bible passage that looks looks its condemning them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>..</p>

<p>We are all Yahweh, we are all the vengeful, jealous god, we are getting aided by the enlightened one/ones, who we consider demons/etc, because we are the exact descriptions of God given to us throughout the Bible.</p>

<p>The enlightened are of a higher frequency, but they came to aid us, when those of a higher frequency lower themselves down/fall from grace/etc, it could be seen as a downgrade/a removal, even though its not what actually occurred. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about vibrations and frequencies. </p>

<p>If you do not ascend, it is likely a person is reincarnated to protect the soul from dissipating/disappearing, or to give it another chance to reincarnate, being a ghost may pretty much be purgatory, living as a frequency of your former electromagnetic self, until you dissipate/whatever or turn into something that must hunt a specific electromagnetic signature/something/maybe fear?, so you can sustain your vibrations. Without learning how to raise our frequency/dimension/whatever the fuck, we either get reincarnated (good thing, another chance), or you become a ghost and stagnate until you become a vibrational vampire/monster/whatever. </p>

<p>I love talking this stuff but if your going to bring the bible in it, you have to realize that most of it is misinterpreted, and then a good portion of it was written by the Roman empire afterward to make it about obedience, obeying the law, etc. </p>

<p>I believe in a Supreme Divinity, but I believe there is something more, we are all one being, in the process of learning, and another being, &quot;the enlightened one&quot;, not going to say his name because I am not a worshipper of anything but it sounds pretty bad if you don&#39;t understand my theory, is trying to aide us, in a way we do not understand. </p>

<p>These enlightened souls were still given human forms, they are not reptiles, etc etc, this was on a soul level, not a physical materialistic level, them mating with other humans would have produced NOTHING other than a normal human, EXCEPT.</p>

<p>Astral sex. The Ankh of Egypt was a sex tool used to help control the chakra energy that builds up during sexual interaction, and you feel it start at the root chakra and make its way to the heart chakra, were you loop it out the back of your body (For those who don&#39;t understand, just, pretend your controlling and energy wave as the sexual desire builds and it runs through a tube in your mind) from the heart chakra to the crown chakra back down into the heart chakra, this is said to raise our frequency and was one of the supposed fountains of life.</p>

<p>Ankhs applied to tuning forks cause them to vibrate 3x their normal rate and length of time. </p>

<p>Theoretically, two humans with the power to astrally project for reals could possibly mate in the astral world and create something incomprehendible, etc etc, which would be considered a whole new being, lets pretend humans are fragmetns of Yahweh, and the Elite people of the world are fragments of Satan, if one fragment of Satan and Yahweh mated and created something completely different, doesn&#39;t this give you a completely different take on some mythology as well?</p>

It may feel like an eternity waiting for the end, but that is because God is giving everyone a chance to be saved. The path to redemption is an easy one, but to continue walking it truly is challenging. Do your best to stay in Jesus and all will be well. When they day comes let us not be filled with fear and guilt because we couldn&#39;t become masters of our desires. Let us be filled with joy and confidence that we will be saved, because we have practiced Gods way. Love and perseverance to all who read and all who dont. </p>

The hate/intolerance that derives from the bible is terrible, we as humans can be so much better morally than we see in the bible. If god creates every child in his own image how come being LGBTQIA wrong? Was it not god that created that child? Unless...the devil is stronger than god, which would make no sense. The bible is filled with contradictions and immoral and outrageous beliefs. I would not want to worship a god that would have me doomed to eternal damnation by his rebellious son because  refused to worship him.
