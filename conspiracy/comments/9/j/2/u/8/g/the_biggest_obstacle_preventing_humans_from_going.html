       This post is something I created this morning for another Reddit sub forum I enjoy reading r/unpopularopinion
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I also enjoy reading this sub and sharing thoughts with many of you here, I am posting it here as well
      </p>
      <p>
       It is an appropriate subject for this sub forum too and the posters in this sub forum will be better prepared to debate this than the posters in the other forum I referenced
      </p>
      <p>
       We have hashed out our differences over the Fake Moon Landings versus Real Moon Landings previously, but every time I read content and opinions on this I learn something new or find some new angle to investigate
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously any of you can post whatever you would like to here, but I'm really most curious to see if there is a popular opinion similar to mine in that until we just admit we never went to the moon in the first place it will be the major obstacle to us ever going there for the first time
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my OP:
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Biggest Obstacle Preventing Humans from Going Back to the Moon is Not Admitting We Never Went the First Time
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I love all things Space related ... All of it !
      </p>
      <p>
       Going to the moon, satellites, space probes, future intergalactic travel, stars, other planets, comets, asteroids, other solar systems, suns ... basically anything and everything Space travel related and even just the whole concept of Space itself
      </p>
      <p>
       With technology where it is today and even more so where technology will take us in the future, I'm excited about the different things we may be able to do some day in Space
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the first steps to all of this is to build some type of base on the moon and then to figure out how to live and explore from there
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that we don't know how to get there ... yet
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to just admit that the stunts we pulled in the 1960's relating to the fake moon landings were a necessary step in ending the Cold War and just let the chips fall where they may and move forward from there if we are ever going to get off this rock we call Earth
      </p>
      <p>
       No one cares any more, no one with any critical thinking skills that has done any research into it at all can possibly believe we have ever actually landed live human beings on the moon and brought them back to Earth safely 6 times with 1960's technology and everyone should be happy the Cold War ended without nuclear bombs falling all over the globe
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's just admit what we did, restate why we did it and move forward from there
      </p>
      <p>
       Space travel is an exciting concept, flying astronauts into Space and beyond would be almost magical, pushing ourselves and leveraging technology to its limits would help the entire world in ways we can't even imagine or conceive at this point in time
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope to see incredible progress in Space flight &amp; travel in my lifetime
      </p>
      <p>
       But ... If we don't suck it up and admit that we have never done it before, we will never be able to take the steps necessary to actually do it in the first place

       I believe we went to the moon and there is no doubt in my mind about that. However, I donâ€™t believe that all of the footage is all real, but rather portions of it are a fabrication of what really happened.

       If they can not only fool most of the people that they went, but convince the doubters with the sense to realize the footage is fake, like yourself, that they went in total secrecy with no evidence to show for their actual trip, why would they even bother spending the money and effort to go? Why wouldn't they just say they went?

       Not all â€˜liveâ€™ broadcasts from space are actually live you know. The still do this kind of thing today and so whose to say it wasnâ€™t the same back then. Kind of just need to take NASAâ€™s the word at face value.

       Thatâ€™s besides the point, essentially not all live streams from space are actually â€˜liveâ€™. Idc who lied about it being live the fact of the matter is that how are we to know whether something was in fact â€˜liveâ€™ especially when it happened almost 50 years ago. If this sort of thing happens today it presumably could have happened 50 years ago.

       Apparently Moon Dust can reflect light back, just not to a powerful extent. I personally think it's either moon dust or its hitting something that was brought there, not by apollo but us.

       The Soviets lied about the horrible fate of their animals (Laika) and considering that the crafts did not need a pilot, sacrificial stuntmen were undoubtedly confined to death in various missiles.

       The biggest proofs without a doubt proving at least portions are fake to me are:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The footage of the crew faking the shot of the earth, that was later edited and televised, with Armstrong waiting until another com line told him what to do, this was NOT Houston. They remove a cutout placed in the window and you see them in low earth orbit.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The famously released photos that show undeniably that artificial light was used, like the famous buzz Aldrin shot. The center reticle is not in the center of the image. It is taken at eye level because he appears on even ground and the photographer is supposed to be neil with his chest mounted camera. The reflection however shows neil with his camera on his chest. This is a reflection that was added later. This with the light fall off being consistent with a spotlight there are many examples of fill in lighting being used to illuminate shadow. The argument for the moon surface reflecting enough light to produce that result isn't true. The moon has an albedo of around .7%. This is about as reflective as Ash falt, material put on a road. If it were that reflective it would light up other rocks in the shot that remain in shadow. The fill ins are very specific and deliberate. If the surface can't illuminate the small rocks that cast shadow, how can it illuminate the astronauts? The hot spots that are visible can only be caused by the presence of artificial light.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The TV footage and photos do not line up. Things happen in the photos that just don't in the footage. This is clear evidence showing that they were filmed separately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Give Dark Moon a read, or just watch What Happened On the Moon?. Fantastic documentary that tells all kinds of things I never knew, down to the point that events such as the sinking of the Lucitania and the San Francisco earthquake portrayed deliberately staged footage as genuine footage. Some of the footage of Gagarin was hosted too. Continuity errors and shots in places that no camera could fit, like the capsule, unless it were NOT in the capsule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there's the video of the "coke bottle" going across the screen. I can't even remotely tell what the object is but I noticed it does two things
      </p>
      <p>
       It rolls like an object would on earth on something like sand
      </p>
      <p>
       It rolls behind the flag pole, so it isn't a film artifact, it's an object for sure. With the signal apparently received in Australia then sent to Houston, an edit could easily occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I noticed during footage of an apollo 17 eva, the astronaut got too close the the wall/backdrop and the shadow caused by the wheel was cast on the wall, very obviously destroying the illusion that it was distant landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we went to the moon, just not with the apollo program technology. Everything from apollo was staged. One thing to consider is every apollo mission occurred during Nixon's presidency. The same presidency that came to an end due to a massive conspiracy that revolved around a cover up. Is it not possible tricky dick was up to more than originally thought?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me ever since I was a kid I thought it was obviously faked, I don't see how anyone can look at it and not notice the false background, but that's just always been my view.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just is undeniable that parts were without a doubt faked. And if part of it was faked, then the official story isn't gospel anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the ONLY country to EVER stop on the moon was the US. Kind of odd that we were in a race, but with the Soviet's having very advanced tech in their own right, why did they basically cease all work on getting a manned mission to the moon. Yeah you could say the us had won but all interest involving it was lost? You got both countries having at least partially faked space programs. I smell a conspiracy brothers.

       Can someone explain to me how the docking process works to the ISS?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its pretty amazing to me an object can catch up to another object going 144,000mph and docks flawlessly each and every time....
      </p>
      <p>
       I can barely merge onto the highway going 55mph without someone or something almost fucking shit up each time.....
      </p>
      <p>
       And your going to have me believe we have never had a problem with the ISS?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill believe it when I see video of a launch from blast off to docking with zero cuts or edits.

       I had a good laugh the other day when the news said Japan landed a rover on an asteroid after 2 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit is funny as hell. Landing anything on something going 100,000 mph
Would be a feat in itself but a rover?...gtfo.....same with Wall-E on Mars....I have news for you people....there is no rover on mars and Japan doesn't have a rover on an asteroid .
      </p>
      <p>
       Mars gets as cold as -200Â° and is 50% further away from the sun than earth.
Just those 2 facts alone make it impossible for a rover to work in that atmosphere...
      </p>
      <p>
       and we haven't even started to talk about the probability of launching a rocket from earth and scoring a perfect 10 in landing and getting the thing operational.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who really believe we have a robot driving around mars are delusional and watch too much tv.

       Good post, a lot of common sense
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what started me off about 10 years ago when investigating conspiracy theories became a hobby of mine, but once I started looking at details and both sides of the story it becomes apparent that the official stories don't line up
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 and the Moon Landings are the 2 popular conspiracies I'm best versed in
      </p>
      <p>
       In each/either of these cases, almost nothing makes sense ... as soon as you start thinking about things and looking at the official story lines it becomes laughable what they are saying
      </p>
      <p>
       What really frustrates me is that the questions I have are "easy" ones, it's not like I'm trying to argue some complex mathematical equations and whether or not something is possible
      </p>
      <p>
       My questions are super easy ... using your math on the Mars rover for instance, if it takes X amount of time for communications to go back &amp; forth to Mars, how can x, y &amp; z be possible
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that no one is asking the right questions
