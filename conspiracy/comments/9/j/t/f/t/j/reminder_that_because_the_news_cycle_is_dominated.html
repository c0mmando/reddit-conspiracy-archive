<p>Hes surrounded himself with neocons and bankers, deregulated the big banks, pushed for war with Iran, etc. Basically shilled for the deep state. </p>

<p>I genuinely like AJ, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s fake or a CIA asset or anything. I think he got excited that he might actually win with trump, and cant let it go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually am midway through this new book called &quot;Pale Horse Rider&quot; Seems like a really well researched and credible biography on Bill Cooper. He comes off a bit more con man seeming than I wouldve liked to believe. Was abusive and lied. So I wouldnt say he is that credible. Though Behold a Pale Horse was monumental and prolific. Just interesting to try and see all the sides. Thuugh I wont be able to come to a tru opinion until I have finished the book. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shilled wmds? Nothing so specific. Just the appointment to his role, by whom and when. All very subtle yet important details. </p>

<p>No. I&#39;m talking about Mueller being appointed FBI director by GW Bush in 2001 right before 9/11.</p>

<p>The guy was/is a part of the Bush inner circle. Think about that for a moment if you&#39;re in your early to mid 30s and older. If you&#39;re in your 20s you probably don&#39;t fully understand what that means. </p>

<p>Then consider those on the left cheering him on because it suits their agenda.</p>

<p>Dude is a corrupt, stonefaced fixer with an agenda that is not dispassionate or justice based but rather based on his expertise in certain environments, legal and auditing especially.</p>

<p>Bush inner circle stuff aside. Consider those who says 9/11 was an inside job.</p>

<p>If it was, Mueller would have a very important role steering the FBI as director away from anything damaging and delaying time sensitive evidence gathering and record keeping.</p>

<p>Hmmm 🤔</p>

<p>Lots of coincidences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand now more clearly, yes we have free speech and the market place for ideas should always be a battle ground. THOUGH much of our free speech is being curtailed because they are &quot;private&quot; entities and not subjugated to the constitution. But I beg to differ, we protected ourselves from government becaues those were the largest entitities at the time, had the founding fathers known corporations would become so large and control so much power they&#39;d have protected us from them as well. BUt since they didn&#39;t that is our fight now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comrades you must understand. I think Brett is the most stand up guy to ever be nominated for the Supreme Court. Millions of women don&#39;t believe the accusations against him and call for the investigation of Christine Blasey Ford. Which we should totally do to every single woman who dares accuse men of sexual assaulting them. Right guys? Seriously. Liars.</p>

<p>Brett isn&#39;t so bad. Bush is a nice guy. Republicans are the chillest people fucking ever dude. I really don&#39;t appreciate the attack of an innocent Christian man trying to make America great again.</p>
