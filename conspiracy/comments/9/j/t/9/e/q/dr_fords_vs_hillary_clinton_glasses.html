       Noticed something odd maybe, watching the Kavanaugh hearings where Dr. Christine Blasey Ford was testifying.  If you look at her glasses, they look severely hazy.  Something is "off" about them.  Kind of in the same way that Hillary Clinton's glasses were "off", during her testimony during the Benghazi testimonies.  I can't imagine someone with that much haze on their glasses and not cleaning them off, especially as something as important as this.  I couldn't take my eyes off of it, it seemed ridiculously dirty/hazy, to the point that I had to question it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just struck me as weird, in the same way that Hillary Clinton's glasses were weird during the Benghazi hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure what to make of it.  Is there technology that would allow the glasses to act as a 2 way screen, where to the person wearing them had a screen facing their eyes on the back of the lens feeding real-time responses, and on the front of the lens a screen projecting their eyes in real-time, so as to make it look like regular glasses.  It would be the same as someone wearing an earpiece, except it is put in an unsuspected place- on the face, and with no obvious trace of it?

       I don't know, maybe someone sitting at a computer live feeding them the responses.  Or maybe AI, the stuff that Elon Musk worries about, feeding automatic responses.  The AI that knows us (fears,aggression, etc) better than we know ourselves.

       Ok that’s along the lines that I was thinking. You think some sort of predictive AI might be feeding them responses? Actually curious btw

       Thinking about Elon Musk's interview with Joe Rogan, where I think we got some honest insights, he talked about how the AI, through its learning based on our search queries, etc., is able to construct what our limbic system (reptilian brain, i.e. sex drive, fear, aggression, primitive motivators that motivate our prefrontal cortex), approximates, thus able to predict what our "trigger points" are, what makes us "tick".  Check Mate so to speak

       With the enemies that Trump is building in Silicon Valley, China, etc., where big tech is central, I could see them putting their newest toys to use.  The synergy of technology and centralized power, I fear will be the greatest threat to our future.

       Think about the apple/google eyeglasses discontinued a couple of yers ago. The tech is there. Think about the in helmet guidance assistance air force pilots have projected across their visors. The tech is there also. This and the fact that earpieces can be used that are practically invisible anyway, let alone hidden behind hair draped over them. The tech is there. The FBI needs to spend most of this week of investigation looking at her and an6 of the so called "witnesses" she claims she has. And they need to do more than instigate a 2 question lie detector test that screams of a pre set agenda. Kavenah(?) Is right when he says these accusations and conclusions are straight out of the twighlight zone.

       Yeah, this seems more than "prepared for" by a wide margin. Scripted and rehearsed like a "play" onstage. I see no tears, I see no sobs or pauses to choke back an outburst of emotion anywhere. In truth, most film actors do a much better job than she has done here at portraying false emotions. And I
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       notice the foggy glass lenses. There IS something up with them. When you use low-e glass in windows the only way to really tell is if you look at the glass from the side angle. Looking straight on makes it difficult to see. In truth it reminds me of the "moving pictures" I used to get in Cracker Jacks as prizes. If you tilted them the photo in them changed but they were clear. So it looked like flags waving in the wind or a horse running. If you looked at them from an angle you had the same foggy look.

       I took that as maybe her looking at the panel members. But you make a good point. The panel was MANY feet across. Without turning your head observing the panel members from her seat would be nearly impossible, *especially wearing glasses" which gives you tunnel vision.

       BTW, after watching her I'm not so convinced that she is as genuine and convincing as all the media pundits claim.  I could see through a lot of her acting.  Man people are easily fooled!  I think its convenient she has a degree in psychology, it would take someone that knows how the brain works, how its easily deceived, to be able to pull off something like this.  Probably helped her on her polygraph as well (even though it was ruled inconclusive).

       Yeah, I noticed her voice sound gravely when she got emotional, but her eyes and mouth didn't accompany the affect of someone in pain, like you saw with Kavanaugh.  Like Orson Welles proved, people are easily fooled.

       Also to keep in mind, she must have been coached very intensely before the testimony on what to respond to each potential question, how to evade those she couldn't answer, how to appear, behave, ... Her prepared statements carefully crafted by pros too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe that's why they needed to buy time like they did, that she wasn't prepared..., and the whole lie that she couldn't fly.

       Her responses to some questions were odd, like the question of the strength of her memory of the event, and her answer:  "indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter".  Spoken from someone who is not emotional close to the incident, but from someone who understands how the brain works, and is relaying her understanding how impactful memory is formed in the brain.

       Exactly, Lindsey Graham and Trump sounded a little too optimistic about extending it 1 week.  I hope they have something on her, as I think this whole thing is a conspiracy of the democrats to extend this past the midterm elections.  If they don't, I think its likely democrats will keep adding new victims and the fbi will keep investigating until the midterms come around and women come out in droves because they feel "victimized", and there you go, mission accomplished.

       I'd guess the reflection is just dust or oils that's reflecting the huge amount of light that was probably in the room at that time, but isn't really visible to the wearer.
