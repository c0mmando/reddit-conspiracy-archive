        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Noticed something odd maybe, watching the Kavanaugh hearings where Dr. Christine Blasey Ford was testifying.  If you look at her glasses, they look severely hazy.  Something is &quot;off&quot; about them.  Kind of in the same way that Hillary Clinton&#39;s glasses were &quot;off&quot;, during her testimony during the Benghazi testimonies.  I can&#39;t imagine someone with that much haze on their glasses and not cleaning them off, especially as something as important as this.  I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it, it seemed ridiculously dirty/hazy, to the point that I had to question it.</p>

<p>It just struck me as weird, in the same way that Hillary Clinton&#39;s glasses were weird during the Benghazi hearing.</p>

<p>Not sure what to make of it.  Is there technology that would allow the glasses to act as a 2 way screen, where to the person wearing them had a screen facing their eyes on the back of the lens feeding real-time responses, and on the front of the lens a screen projecting their eyes in real-time, so as to make it look like regular glasses.  It would be the same as someone wearing an earpiece, except it is put in an unsuspected place- on the face, and with no obvious trace of it? </p>

<p>Ideas? Crazy? </p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about the apple/google eyeglasses discontinued a couple of yers ago. The tech is there. Think about the in helmet guidance assistance air force pilots have projected across their visors. The tech is there also. This and the fact that earpieces can be used that are practically invisible anyway, let alone hidden behind hair draped over them. The tech is there. The FBI needs to spend most of this week of investigation looking at her and an6 of the so called &quot;witnesses&quot; she claims she has. And they need to do more than instigate a 2 question lie detector test that screams of a pre set agenda. Kavenah(?) Is right when he says these accusations and conclusions are straight out of the twighlight zone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this seems more than &quot;prepared for&quot; by a wide margin. Scripted and rehearsed like a &quot;play&quot; onstage. I see no tears, I see no sobs or pauses to choke back an outburst of emotion anywhere. In truth, most film actors do a much better job than she has done here at portraying false emotions. And I <em>did</em> notice the foggy glass lenses. There IS something up with them. When you use low-e glass in windows the only way to really tell is if you look at the glass from the side angle. Looking straight on makes it difficult to see. In truth it reminds me of the &quot;moving pictures&quot; I used to get in Cracker Jacks as prizes. If you tilted them the photo in them changed but they were clear. So it looked like flags waving in the wind or a horse running. If you looked at them from an angle you had the same foggy look.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BTW, after watching her I&#39;m not so convinced that she is as genuine and convincing as all the media pundits claim.  I could see through a lot of her acting.  Man people are easily fooled!  I think its convenient she has a degree in psychology, it would take someone that knows how the brain works, how its easily deceived, to be able to pull off something like this.  Probably helped her on her polygraph as well (even though it was ruled inconclusive). </p>
