I say that because America has no high speed ground transportation like high-speed electric trains Etc. Elon Musk is developing the Hyper Loop. The technology for electric cars has been around for several decades no company has invested and pursued the development of electric motor vehicles like Tesla. America has stayed relatively static as have most other Automotive companies due to its relationship with fossil fuel companies. I know that he can be a complete ass hat at times however he is developing technology that will change so many ways current business practices are done. No one else has been able to get the backing and pursue the developments that he has been able to do. he&#39;s only been able to do this because he&#39;s another billionaire and I believe he personally just wants to do it. Just wondered what everybody else&#39;s thoughts about Elon Musk and Tesla are?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Think what you may about Elon Musk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is a conman robbing the tax paying citizens, assisted by elements within the government and the Military Industrial Complex, let me explain.</p>

<p>Elon Musk is a very smart man but Space X is a massively fraudulent company, along with NASA these two are quintessential American frauds based around the weaponized space industry.</p>

<p>I am not saying everything these two companies do is based on outright lies, I except they have made rockets to get in to Low Earth Orbit, but they grossly exaggerate through outright lies and wishful thinking things they do, which is all backed by PR and propaganda to funnel more money into them for other projects.</p>

<p>For instance, NASA has never sent any human beyond Low Earth Orbit, the Apollo program wasn&#39;t about humans traveling through space, it was about making rockerty, specifically ICBM&#39;s. </p>

<p>Space X on the other hand have no intention and never did, of going to Mars, what a load of bullshit that is, they know we can not have humans survive beyond LEO, likewise, the Fulcan 9 reverse rocket landing is also a cock and bull story that I know is all faked.</p>

<p>Ill end with saying I own a Tesla and they are great cars, but I think they are worth 2 or 3 times the list price new, they are making a loss on everyone they sell hoping technology and better production methods will bring the cost down over time, that is why they need Space X, to funnel money into it to keep it afloat and the government are happy with this because it is the first time ever America has been able to compete with the European car market and beat them.</p>

SpaceX has tons of actual hardware for BFR in the works, people and proven expertise.   Actual launches and actual capability now to send things to a mars orbit.   Grow up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have toured the factory too, as well as the museum that holds the LEM, that doesn&#39;t mean humans have walked on the moon.</p>

<p>The BFR is nothing more than an advanced ICBM, sold to the public as a fairytale <em>humans going to Mars</em> bullshit, just like the Apollo program, it is military in nature with great PR and propaganda.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t tell me to grow up when you as an adult are believing in actual fairytales and tall tales.</p>

One thing I do admire though is that his companies seem to be based on finding solutions to problems.   Regardless of beliefs in climate change or not,  figuring out ways to pollute less  is a good thing.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>If I had to guess from a conspiratorial point of view,  I&#39;d say they are trying to take down the face of electric cars to protect the other larger car companies and big oil.  The powers that be might not like his rogue style.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just an average Joe, I don&#39;t have any more info than others and probably less information than alot about Elon Musk. That being said, I describe Elon Musk as literally the most important person on planet Earth.</p>

<p>It seems like everything he&#39;s done or is trying to achieve is for the greater good of all humanity. I couldn&#39;t imagine Elon knowingly committing fraud. I am open to the possibility that fraud was committed, but unless presented with hard evidence he knowingly committed fraud I choose to believe this is a hit job to attack his character, credibility, and everything he has worked to achieve.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my 2 cents.</p>

With all of the projects he is associated with and all the moving parts associated with each it would be very easy for me to believe that this was just a mistake or error in communication to EM about the status of the funding and maybe he just jumped the gun.</p>

<p>He also could also have very well intentionally defrauded public perception. I just don&#39;t (want) to believe it. But that&#39;s just my own personal opinion and bias speaking.</p>
