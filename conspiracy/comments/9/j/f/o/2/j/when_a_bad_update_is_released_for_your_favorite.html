<p>Random bugs get in there all the time, and there&#39;s no such thing as a bug-free game.  Most bugs that end up in release are either things that were genuinely not caught in the dev cycle, or they were deemed ok to ship because the player impact is low.</p>

<p>Why is being annoyed by someone&#39;s supposed ignorance a thing?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done some mild coding before but I&#39;ve yet to understand what introduces random bugs, all I ask is that it can be explained technically, what do I get? a bunch of &quot;fuck off&quot; and &quot;fuck you for asking questions&quot; jeez louise and here I thought reddit was a civil discussion forum</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s annoying because you posited your question as some kind of fact. Why not just ask the question and admit you’re not sure?</p>

<p>But to answer your question, complex systems are really hard and bugs are inevitable. There’s literally  an entire industry (software quality engineering) that costs every tech company millions of dollars to catch <em>some</em> bad bugs before they go to production. It’s also a known fact that it would be impossible to find every bug before deploying to production.</p>

<p>And even more “ignorant” is the idea that a company who makes software would intentionally introduce bugs in the system for ANY reason. If you had a company, would YOU make your product not work right on purpose? That just makes less than zero sense.</p>

<p>I explained some things in my comments. It is not this.</p>

<p>I guess this sub is no good for casual conversation, everything needs to be structured first and seems nobody here can offer the whys or hows on a technical level, rather disappointing</p>
