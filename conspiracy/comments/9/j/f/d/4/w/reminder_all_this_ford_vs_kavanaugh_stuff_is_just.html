    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps... Though, if an investigation found their stories to be inaccurate, it would open the women up to libel suits, and even perjury charges if caught lying to the FBI or the Senate. I suppose the question here is whether these women would intentionally open themselves up to lawsuits and criminal charges, as well as destroy their own reputations, over politics.</p>

<p>Regardless, it seems backwards to me to say that Kavanaugh is being treated as if he&#39;s guilty until proven innocent, when what is actually being asked for is an investigation to assess whether or not he is guilty. The suggestion here is that merely investigating accusations is an assumption of guilt.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Those can result in perjury charges if false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right... But demonstrating that they were false would require some semblance of an investigation. At least getting them to testify would allow them to be challenged on any inconsistency in their stories. Affidavits are nice, but hardly a substitute for actual testimony. And this goes for the accusers, too. It&#39;s good that they decided to allow Ford to testify, but unfortunately, no such consideration was given to the other women, even though they are willing (unlike spineless coward, Mark Judge). And if you think they are lying, then you should want them brought up there so that they can be challenged.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve got to lose your partisan goggles. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me be clear, if this was a Democrat nominee, and I thought these women were lying, I would <em>demand</em> a thorough investigation and for every witness named to be subpoenaed and brought before the Senate. I would want the name of the nominee cleared as much as possible, and if these women were lying, I would want their deceit made plain to the public, and their lives destroyed for it.</p>

<p>And if they weren&#39;t lying, I would want a new nominee chosen, because a rapist has no business being on the Supreme Court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your point about him being a Bush judge is spot on and why I find all of the sexual assault allegations to be a silly distraction in our current climate. Is he a creep? Yes, but not (just) because he may be a sexual predator, but because he&#39;s definitely an elite douchebag that will carry out the whim of his masters. There are a great many on conspiracy who mention that both parties are the same (and I agree for the most part) which is why I find it perplexing how many  are pushing for this clown to be given a lifetime appointment because liberals suck and conservatives are awesome.

<p>As you point out, it&#39;s obviously better for him to get an investigation and have him proven to be innocent.

<li>Kavanaugh&#39;s mother presided over a foreclosure hearing on Ford&#39;s parents</li>

<p>There&#39;s bound to be a book deal waiting for her, another bribe. Ford can&#39;t provide information about a date, time of her &quot;event&quot; nor can she recall how she got to or left the party.  The four people Ford claims were there have written sworn affidavit&#39;s that no such party happened.</p>

<p>The 2nd accuser made accusations with no details</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the last years on the internet I have learned a good way to &quot;debate&quot; is showing how a person presents facts that are open to everybody. Let me show you what I mean</p>

<p>Here is your comment on the gofundme:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ford has received over $680,000 dollars in GoFundMe &quot;donations&quot; when her legal expenses are free (pro bono)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You say she has &quot;received&quot; those. But as we have heard yesterday, she doesn&#39;t have any connection to them. THey were set up by others, she has no received any money from them. You also put &quot;donation&quot; in to &quot;&quot; to show you assume she got &quot;paid&quot;. You have no evidence for that but your personel political leaning. Correct? You also say her defense is pro bono and try to imply that she thus incurred no expenses, this as well would I call a simple deception because you know full well, she has other expenses besides legal costs. You choose to present your argument in a deceving form on purpose. Are you objective?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s bound to be a book deal waiting for her, another bribe. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>About a night she can&#39;t remember?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ford can&#39;t provide information about a date, time of her &quot;event&quot; nor can she recall how she got to or left the party. The four people Ford claims were there have written sworn affidavit&#39;s that no such party happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here again we got evidence that shows us you are either uninformed or lieing on purpose. Given your other comments I would sadly assume the later.</p>

<p>Those testimony did not claim the party didn&#39;t happened. The same as kavanaugh you lie about the contents of those testimonies. Of the top of my head the other girl said she can&#39;t remember. THis does not mean she denied this evening happened. Kavanaugh said the same, given that he is a judge and in a job interview for the most important judgeship he should be denied simply because he either lies or is incompetent.</p>

<p>A person saying &quot;I can recall&quot; does not mean the person claims those events did not happen. Here again we see the power of deception. Are you sure you are here to be objective and present facts in an objective way?</p>

<p>Let me explain how the testimony of her friend is not that important as some suggest. For Mrs Ford the night was traumatic, a major life event. For the other people besides Kavanaugh and Judge, it was just a normal evening 30 years ago. That the others forget this evening is not that surprising. Kavanaughs and Judge would have reason to lie about it.</p>

<p>I want to point out how important this is because we can see how people on the internet will misrepresent important details to deceive others. The other woman present didn&#39;t say this did not happen she said she can&#39;t remember but still believes Ford.</p>

<p>Honest question to you, is your political leaning driving your evaluation of the case? You misrepresented many major points selectively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Supreme Court has been split on partisan lines that effect our lives every day. For example:</p>

<p>A 5-4 Supreme Court just blocked New Deal overtime from being required for &quot;service advisors&quot; by distorting the language of an exemption.</p>

<p>A 5-4 Supreme Court just required unions to continue to pay for services of workers, but insisted that workers who benefit need not pay for the service.</p>

<p>A 5-4 Supreme Court just decided that employers have the right to block workers not only from court but even from joint arbitration.</p>

<p>All of these decisions were perfectly partisan. To suggest none of these decisions matter is to deny any possibility of either change or reaction. History shows plainly that changes and reactions actually take place, so, it does matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the history of the Supreme Court, not many decisions come down as perfectly partisan. This is a phenomenon that has increased dramatically lately. This is what happens when Republicans stack the Court with ideologues rather than fact finders and Constitution analysts. I can go through many more if you like. </p>

<p>Whether it is perfectly partisan or not, these decisions make real differences for real people. For example, if you were one of the people who AT&amp;T ripped off with its unconscionable fraud, thanks to a perfectly partisan Supreme Court, you won&#39;t get an automatic credit. You have to first actually become aware that you were ripped off, then you have to file an arbitration claim, then you have to to arbitration and win. That&#39;s a real difference affecting thousands of people. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Supreme Court choosing not to even hear certain things</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good point and here&#39;s an example: After the Wisconsin supreme court ordered the John Doe investigation ended and ordered the incriminating documents destroyed, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case, thereby protecting Scott Walker and the Koch brothers government of the State of Wisconsin. </p>

<p>We are seeing the same sort of thing lining up in Washington DC now, with many of the same players, specifically Koch brothers cohorts, Republicans, and billionaire Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The question of when a &quot;gun is pointed at your head&quot; itself is a matter of changes in the law. </p>

<p>It is not the purpose of the Supreme Court to do good things, as you seem to be implying.  It is the purpose of the Supreme Court to hear cases and determine whether the legal proceedings involved in those cases are or are not constitutional.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They and many others were perfectly partisan by definition. Five Republicans went one way and four Democrats went the other.</p>

<p>Pick a case and we may discuss how it fits in with the Constitution or precedent. </p>

<p>For example, in the case blocking &quot;service advisors&quot; from overtime, the five Republicans took the exemptions for &quot;parts men&quot; and &quot;service men&quot; and shoehorned &quot;service advisors&quot; into the definition, even though DOL said it was a different position.</p>

<p>For example, in the case allowing free riders to avoid union dues, this case blatantly overturned a 41-year precedent. The simple fact that an old ruling could be changed is such a partisan way speaks volumes about how much the five Republicans abused their power to legislate from the bench and stomped upon long standing expectations.</p>

<p>For example, in the case where workers could be blocked from any sort of redress against the wrongdoing of employers except by one-on-one arbitration, Neil Gorsuch with the four Republicans continued a recent Republican trend to finish off overruling a case dating all the way back to 1956, and applied a 1925 arbitration law to override a 1935 labor law, even though in the past the Court said the 1925 law does not apply to employment.</p>

<p>The gay marriage issue was not a perfectly partisan decision. Keep looking and see if you can find one (because I am not &quot;cherry picking&quot;).</p>

<p>Besides, if you know about strict scrutiny and equal protection, the right of gay people to marry is a very easy case. That&#39;s probably why the Supreme Court avoided it in recent years. The outcome was inevitable. Also, you will note that gay marriage is primarily a social issue and not so much an economic issue. In 5-4 cases where the issue involves economics, virtually all of them have been decided on the side of business for over a decade.</p>

<p>rules only matter when they are enforced and when they exist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Republicans broke the rule of providing advice and consent in 2016 to keep a legitimate nominee by a popularly elected president off the Court for the first time in American history.</p>

<p>Republicans broke the filibuster rule to fill that very same seat with Neil Gorsuch, who went on to decide over a dozen times in perfectly partisan 5-4 decisions.</p>

<p>Republicans broke the rule of FBI investigating complaints about nominees for the first time in American history.</p>

<p>Rules only matter when they are enforces and when they exist. The rules have changed under raw Republican power for no reason other than consolidate that power.</p>

<p>The power of Republicans itself is entirely undemocratic. The American people cast more votes for Democrats than Republicans, yet Republicans control the Senate, then change the rules. The rules are changed so that Republicans can take the balance of the Supreme Court, all the while crying about &#39;liberal activists&#39; and &#39;constitutionalists&#39; even though -- get ready for this -- Republicans have controlled the Court since 1969, and that includes the <em>Roe v. Wade</em> abortion case decided by <em>Republicans</em>. The American people cast about the same votes for Democrats and Republicans in the House, but Republicans hold a solid majority despite that. </p>

<p>So, that&#39;s the Senate, the Supreme Court, and the House of Representatives, all controlled by minority Republicans. Then, there is the White House where the person in residence lost the popular vote by nearly three million people -- and that is in addition to voter purges (which were just upheld by the 5-4 Supreme Court) and all kinds of campaign tricks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps... Though, if an investigation found their stories to be inaccurate, it would open the women up to libel suits, and even perjury charges if caught lying to the FBI or the Senate. I suppose the question here is whether these women would intentionally open themselves up to lawsuits and criminal charges, as well as destroy their own reputations, over politics.</p>

<p>Regardless, it seems backwards to me to say that Kavanaugh is being treated as if he&#39;s guilty until proven innocent, when what is actually being asked for is an investigation to assess whether or not he is guilty. The suggestion here is that merely investigating accusations is an assumption of guilt.</p>
