I seriously think this is intentional and makes me wonder just who is moderating Reddit subs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, I think anyone who is using this sub understands the idea of conspiracy in politics.   </p>

<p>But what&#39;s happening right now in r/conspiracy is not talking about conspiracy theories - it&#39;s getting all caught up in this stupid political theater and arguing with each other because of left/right, red/blue, liberal/conservative, etc. This is becoming just another platform to keep all of us distracted.  </p>

<p>For people who use a sub which has the overall notion of being more aware than the general public, r/conspiracy sure is falling in the trap just like everyone else is ESPECIALLY ATS.</p>

I believe it means the &quot;game&quot; of governance that our leaders participate in.</p>

<p>What&#39;s happening now? How about for a start the people that we &quot;elect&quot; to represent us couldn&#39;t care less about the common person. They are simply beholden to corporations and their high end donors. If you can&#39;t see this...well...I don&#39;t really know what to say to you then.</p>

<p>As far as what they are doing...EXACTLY NOTHING for the common good of the people. If you are labeled &quot;partisan&quot;...give me a few good things your &quot;team&quot; has accomplished. </p>

<p>All the system does now is embolden people to draw lines in the sand and endlessly argue and accomplish nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They all are. Non of the top conspiracy sites are focusing on our way out. Politics is tired and predictable. Politics is like a snake eating its own tail, it just goes round and round. </p>

<p>I think there are hidden truths about the nature of civilisation, extra-dimensional events, UFOs and more importantly consciousness that are all worth exploring.</p>

<p>Many look towards politics as being a magical solution for all of the Earth&#39;s ailments. It isn&#39;t, never has been,never will be. Folk have to make the changes needed by acting as a collective. people have power outside of politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Deep State pulled off the most amazing trick - they unveiled themselves thanks to Trump and in the meantime, created the most hyper-partisan political landscape ever.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the oligarchs in the MIC (obviiusly including big banking, pharma and agri now) carry on with the agenda while everyone is at each other&#39;s throats.</p>

<p>The problem is the regressive left are committed, mobilized and aggressive. I see conservatives and libertarians falling for this Q BS, and many of them have now switched off entirely (&quot;trust the plan&quot;). But WWG1WGA to my mind means be a sheep - they are one of the only types of creature that do that...</p>

<p>There is, in my opinion, one HUGE conspiracy going on, and multiple psy-ops, and they are all working.</p>

<p>We all need to work together and keep focused on the people who are socially engineering us to all hate each other, not on the Kabuki theatre.</p>

<p>BTW I am not a regressive lefty, a conservative or from the US. I&#39;m a classical liberal in the UK tradition but can see that the cultural Marxism from the left, and the cultural imperialism from big tech is destroying Western civilization.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what we all need to focus on. </p>

<p>And yes, I stopped going to Abovetopsecret because it became impossible to have a discussion without someone from the left going on there and hijacking the thread, often arguing the most ludicrous, illogical points in the process.</p>

<p>Just my 2/c.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive lurked on this sub for a long time, because conspiracies are always interesting. This sub isn&#39;t heading there, it is there, has been for a while. What it has become is a safe space for people to discuss their (usually trump supporting, and right wing, but not always) beliefs and conspiracies about their political rivals without feeling attacked by others who chime in with facts and sources that prove them wrong (well, there will be dissenting opinion, but it will be drowned out by people that agree with their point, which is why they have congregated here). If they go to a more mainstream political themed subreddit and start posting their beliefs, they get absolutely crushed by people that actually have resources to back up their claims (the vast majority of the claims on this subreddit are backed up by nothing but popular opinion amongst the userbase, but that&#39;s to be expected in a conspiracy discussion), but 90% of the time these people are not friendly about it at all, so this person isn&#39;t going to bother investigating any claims or following sources, they won&#39;t walk away with a new perspective, they will just cry shill and run away and post here about how horrible and uninformed (insert sub where it happened) is. At least from a lurkers perspective that&#39;s how the slow and steady politicization of this subreddit played out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple obvious solution that people have been asking for for a LONG time is ability to tag and filter posts. For some reason it never even gets consider, as far as I can tell. My guess is that influential mods think it&#39;s a bad idea for reasons and we can&#39;t have it. </p>

<p>Those reasons seem to boil down to not wanting to make it easy for people to see only what they want to see. To a degree, a captive audience that can be propagandized to is what is desired. We can&#39;t have people just wanting to talk about what interests them, no they also need to choke down all this divide and conquer political horseshit at the same time. And if you don&#39;t like it and want to talk about Bigfoot or whatever, well then I guess you can fuck off to one of the barely trafficed subs that does that. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want us constructively sharing information. They want us to self-segregate and fling shit. </p>

<p>Yes it seems to me the point of platforms like reddit is to compartmentalize discussion to the point where posting ideas is mostly preaching to the choir and helping to marginalize anything that contradicts the mainstream media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Intellectual ghettos. You can accept either the mainstream narrative or a heavily left or right slanted rejection of that narrative that your in-group will yesman and your outgroup will reject with frothing hatred. But we absolutely cannot seek middle ground, common understanding, or work towards a synthesis of all these ideas that moves beyond the right/left divide that makes us so easy to control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who stopped posting and lurking here (under a different account which name I have forgotten) prior to the 2016 elections, it was shocking to come back this year to see how awful this sub has become. I remember seeing the obvious rise in astroturfing here around 2011-2012, but now it&#39;s on a whole other level of manipulation and politicization. </p>

<p>When I say politicization I mean the injecting of left vs. right, republican vs. democrat, liberal vs. conservative, etc... When I was active here there was a general understanding here that all politics are just dog and pony shows meant to mislead and distract the masses while the financial ruling class pulled the strings through think tanks, non-profits, what have you. Now it&#39;s like watching two angry, drunk men arguing over a sports team at a bar. What the hell happened?</p>

<p>I would be highly suspect of this sub if it doesn&#39;t get quarantined like 911truth.</p>
