    <div class="md"><p>So why didn&#39;t we big bad Democrats do this to Neil Gorsuch?</p>

<p>Everyone complaining about this news coming out so late in the game are refusing to admit the reality that, of course, no one WANTS to talk about getting sexually assaulted in front of the world on live tv. I don&#39;t think this woman was convinced to make up a story years ago just in case BK was nominated.</p>

<p>They may or may not be able to find proof of the guy actually assaulting someone, but the additional scrutiny this caused has shown him to be a fucking liar. That explanation for &#39;renate alumnus&#39; was pure grade-A bullshit, along with a couple of the other yearbook explanations.</p>

<p>If any of you come back with &quot;oh wow he lied about teen boy bullshit, big deal&quot;, we just differ in opinion. He&#39;s under oath, he&#39;s not supposed to lie. He was lying today. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Democrats knew Trump was going to appoint someone to Scalia&#39;s seat.  They had come to terms with it, and it didn&#39;t upset the balance of the court.  They did not expect Kennedy to retire and give him another SCOTUS pick.  They are much more desperate now.  They don&#39;t have the votes to stop his confirmation.  This is the only thing they can do to stop it.</p>

<p>Feinstein, at the very least, knew about Ford&#39;s allegations during the confirmation hearings, yet she did not ask him about it while he was under oath.  She waited until after the hearings were over and brought it up in the media.  From the start this has been a completely obvious delaying tactic pushed by the Dems.  Democrats know this, but will never admit it.  The ends justify the means, and this is their revenge for not holding a vote on Garland.</p>

<p>Their fear has become a reality, and even worse, it wasn&#39;t Ginsburg or Breyer.  Trump could appoint 4 SCOTUS justices if their worst fears come true.  They will do anything to stop that from happening.</p>

<p>I think Ford is lying and the Democrats know she&#39;s lying.  That&#39;s why they didn&#39;t ask about it during the actual confirmation hearings and instead contrived this kangaroo court of public opinion bullshit we saw today.</p>

There is plenty that stinks to the high heavens with this lady&#39;s accusations. Plenty for any reasonable person to see plausible deniability.  How many times do we have to get these well timed events before you catch on that this is all bullshit?
For me, this sub is about seeing through the politically motivated narratives, thinking critically, and above all else keeping an open enough mind to digest viewpoints that challenge our established beliefs. 
Fact: We are still only watching a show. This is for their entertainment to keep us all nice and busy while someone rams through some nefarious bill in the wee hours of the night. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, you dont know anything about what sources I read or my position on this matter. I am however staying objective and sometimes calling out blatant partisan assumptions made on this sub.</p>

<p>Theres also plenty of stink coming off of Kavanaugh. His behaviour today was grossly inapropriate, partisan and he showed a complete inability to answer questions directly.</p>

<p>Just a short while ago classmates of his called in to CNN (i know i know) who were republicans who said he was lying at the hearing under oath and was regularly black out drunk while at Yale. </p>

<p>This hearing is not just about Ford its about wether or not Kavanaugh is fit for the role.</p>

Your conjecture: &quot;She also testified she couldn&#39;t stop crying during her polygraph.&quot;</p>

<p>My reply to your conjecture: &quot;&#39;She also testified she couldn&#39;t stop crying during her polygraph. This is untrue. If you disagree, show me where she said this in her testimony.&quot;</p>

<p>Ford&#39;s statement from the transcript:
&quot;FORD: OK, so I remember being hooked up to a machine, like, be — being placed onto my body, and being asked a lot of questions, and crying a lot.&quot;</p>

<p>I was correct -- she never said that she &quot;couldn&#39;t stop crying during her polygraph.&quot;</p>

<p>7 F&#39;s is not a stuttering Squee saying Fuck. It stands for &quot;Find them. French them. Feel them. Finger them. Fuck them. Forget them. Forever.&quot;</p>

<p>The Devil&#39;s Triangle is not a drinking game like quarters. It&#39;s a sexual act with two men and one woman, where the two men have sex with the woman at the same time but make sure not to make eye contact with each other.</p>

<p>Boofing isn&#39;t farting. It&#39;s imbibing substances wether drugs or alcohol thr through your asshole.</p>

<p>And Beach Week Ralph Club is getting so drunk you vomit, likely meaning you&#39;re blacked out or close. Either way too drunk.</p>

<p>Regardless of Ford&#39;s and the others accusations, and if they are true or not, what is factual is Kavanaugh is a liar and is not fit for this appointment.</p>

<p>Nope! But I am surprised that he feels the need to lie about it now.   </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t trust someone with small, inconsequential things...then why risk trusting them with big things?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe he truly doesn’t think that’s what he meant and so to him it’s not a lie? Maybe it’s just his mind protecting his ego from the shame of having the whole world judge the current you, having busted your ass in your career for respect, on the embarrassing dumbassery of your sixteen your old self.</p>

<p>I’m around 30, it’s pretty fucking difficult to remember specific nitty gritty details of high school memories, certainly not year book scribblings. I can’t imagine what it’s like at 60. I guarantee there’s references from high school that if you told me I used, I’d be pretty hazy on the details.</p>

<p>IMO, he lied through his teeth on several occasions. I agree with you that it&#39;s reasonable for him to have forgotten random, obscure, stupid things young teenagers joke about. However, he didn&#39;t say, &quot;I&#39;m not sure what that means&quot;...he made up alternative meanings that are <strong>so</strong> obviously BS. </p>

<p>If he forgot, he should’ve just stated he forgot. I honestly don’t care if they vote him in or pull the ultimate mindfuck and nominate the most bleeding heart liberal they can find.</p>

<p>It is just a sad time to be an American when this is what political coverage is reduced to. It’s embarrassing.</p>
