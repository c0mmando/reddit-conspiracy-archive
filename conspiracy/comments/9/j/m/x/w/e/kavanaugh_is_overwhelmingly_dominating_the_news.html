<p>Brett Kavanaugh will protect Donald Trump and his Republican cohorts from any further investigations, from culpability in any crimes, from liability in any civil actions, and even from New York State actions.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s not enough, the 5-4 Supreme Court has a full agenda to take away each and all of the protections for people that came in the past 80 years or so. America will go back to the 19th Century where people were under the near total control of wealthy business people. That&#39;s the long term plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So do you believe the supreme court indicts people?</p>

<p>Democrats openly said they would try to stop Kavanaugh&#39;s appointment at all costs. I would think if your whole lif3e was attacked by petty political tactics you would clearly be upset with the party behind the attacks. If anything the actions and words of the petty democrats have MADE him partisan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>but why do you think they’re stopping his appointment? Because he’s right leaning or because of his: sketchy baseball ticket debt situation possibly being linked to some sort of payoff, multiple sexual assault claims which he strongly denies (but doesn’t want an investigation that would hypothetically clear his name about, or his best friend who could hypothetically clear him to testify on), his history of perjuring himself in front of congress in 2004, etc.</p>

<p>If it was just cause he’s conservative how did Gorsuch escape this?</p>

<p>And honestly the “yeah he’s biased but it’s justified” argument is silly because we shouldn’t have someone on the highest court of office with demonstrable political biases. Different interpretations of the law is one thing but being so blatantly partisan isn’t okay, the SC is supposed to be apolitical </p>

<p>I watch the whole hearing. I know this is a false statement that was the main talking point of the Dems. Just step down from the nomination so you can clear your name. I saw it as a threat/coercion. If you don&#39;t step down we will continue this attack on you. </p>

<p>If he had said nothing against the party that had orchestrated these attacks, protests, made threats to his family, called him evil, brought false accusers at the 11th hour, said they would do anything to stop him.... </p>

<p>If he had said nothing about this I would have lost all respect for him. Doing so would have shown he would submit to political pressure while on the bench. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On December 8, 2017, a 5-4 perfectly partisan Supreme Court majority issued an unsigned and unexplained Order permitting the Donald Trump Administration to withhold official government documents from a court case that would normally be required. The 4 dissenters warned that, &quot;judicial review cannot function if the agency is permitted to decide unilaterally what documents it submits.&quot; So, the Supreme Court already protected Donald Trump. Brett Kavanaugh has made it clear that he would protect the White House, so these kinds of unprecedented 5-4 opinions should be expected -- for example, a ruling permitting Donald Trump to end the Robert Mueller investigation and other things like that, and even to destroy documents as happened in the Wisconsin <em>John Doe</em> case.</p>

<p>In 2010, a 5-4 perfectly partisan Supreme Court majority issued a notorious ruling called <em>Citizens United</em> that overturned one hundred years of campaign funding regulations on the novel theory that corporations have an unlimited right to use undisclosed amounts of money as First Amendment &quot;free&quot; speech, then extended that case to billionaires. A ruling to extend this &quot;freedom&quot; to spend unlimited undisclosed money on campaigns could easily be extended &quot;protect Donald Trump and his Republican cohorts from any further investigations&quot; and culpability on things including the Stormy Daniels payment and the misuse of funds in the Trump Foundation that New York State is investigating.</p>

<p>Bonus: Currently, there is a case pending at the Supreme Court to consider overturning a rule so that New York State could literally be disallowed from investigating Donald Trump and his cohorts. The case is called <em>Gamble v. United States</em>. It&#39;s almost like this case was sent to the Supreme Court a few weeks before Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement so that Republicans could get someone in who would be sure to protect Donald Trump. Enter Brett Kavanaugh, the life-long partisan operative who once &quot;believed&quot; while he was hunting Bill Clinton and writing up explicit sexual questions but now &quot;believes&quot; that, basically, the president is above the law.</p>

<p>Under a Democrat president you would be right that when the media talks about something it&#39;s covering up for something corrupt</p>

<p>Because they&#39;re covering up for the Democrat president</p>

<p>But under a Republican president the same rule doesn&#39;t apply. When the media is talking about something non-stop it&#39;s an attempt to attack the Republican president. Not cover for him</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I feel like this is the most obvious brainwashing attempt in history.  The amount of coverage this got yesterday... I scrolled through hundreds of social media feeds and EVERY SINGLE POST was about this and most of them had a picture of the Dr. looking like an angel figure, eyes closed, hands raised, some kind of odd symbolism.  To be fair, I have no idea what any of this is about. I don&#39;t live in the US and it&#39;s actually disturbing and gross to me, to festishize this the way it has been.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just as simple as, she&#39;s the new Hillary and will be running for the Democrats.  But maybe it&#39;s far more sinister and scary.  I can&#39;t escape this.  I&#39;m actively trying to avoid news of it or to participate in the weird, voyeuristic and perverted ways people are drooling over every tiny description of sexual assault. Why are people so desperate to hear every detail about this?  Why are we so fascinated by this?  We wonder why rampant sexual abuse is going on in every society, but no wonder... we&#39;re basically turning sexual assault into a circus.  </p>

<p>We&#39;re screwed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s starting to disgust me. This is not news.  This is not worth the level of attention it&#39;s gotten.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying, why do we need to focus on every detail of the supposed sexual assault??  On public television and blasted on every website?  Over and over and over until it&#39;s burned into our brains?  I understand the importance.  The entire US system is messed up, compared to what else the US is currently doing around the world right now... this is the equivalent of a soap opera.  </p>

<p>I believe her, even though I barely know the accusations.  I admire what she&#39;s doing and think what she is doing is amazing.  Does that mean I have to worship her as a god-like figure and have thousands (if not millions) of the rich and famous putting her on this pedestal and shoving every detail down our throat 24/7?  No.</p>

<p>I&#39;m getting a little worked up here but from the outside, it&#39;s just so frustrating.  The rest of the world isn&#39;t much better but this has become entertainment.  You can claim it&#39;s oh so important because SUPREME COURT NOMINEE but it&#39;s only a title.  A title that has no meaning except in these politicians&#39; own heads.  They&#39;ve convinced us that sh*t like this matters more than the absolutely horrific things these people are doing behind our back.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s all a show.  And I&#39;d love to know how this particular situation will ever justify the amount of coverage it&#39;s gotten.  There are far more things going on in the world that I&#39;d like to know about and this feels like an obvious attempt to distract us from those important things.  That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think some people, not you, dont see the overall picture. for weeks we kept hearing &quot;roe v wade&quot; and pro-choice arguments - this riles up many of the left protesters. When they couldnt stop the vote using protests, they used Ford - almost like a last resort. Kavanaugh, according to most people on both political sides, was a &quot;fair&quot; choice. The institutions with the REAL problem are the abortion clinics. Having a devout Christian appointed would not bode well for business. You can google what Kamala Harris did in CA for Planned Parenthood when doctors got caught on tape selling fetus material- she was basically paid to get rid of evidence and protect them in the future. She became a senator for just this purpose, to have more influence. If Supreme court rules to abolish sale of unborn babies, clinics/hospitals will lose billions. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah I see that. And I appreciate that there was certainly some kind of fuckery going on behind the scenes when Ford first brought this up months ago and wanted it all sorted it out well before any confirmation hearings, and it was kept back to use as ammo in the public sphere.</p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t heard about this Planned Parenthood tissue-selling debacle, I&#39;ve had a cursory look at the wikipedia page about it, and to me it&#39;s another example of cloak and dagger work from both sides in terms of wanting to push agendas. I couldn&#39;t find any source for your claim that Kamala was paid to get rid of evidence and to protect PP in the future, so I&#39;d be grateful if you could send me a couple.</p>

<p>As to your last point and whether that would be positive or not, I guess it all depends on your personal viewpoint on conception/contraception/reproductive rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of people are underestimating how import this is. </p>

<p>Presidents come and go. Democrats and Republicans pass power back and forth.  </p>

<p>But a supreme court Judge will stay on for 30-40 years.   It doesn&#39;t matter who&#39;s in power if new laws and legislation can&#39;t be passed through the courts. </p>

<p>Think of upcoming legislation that they will control.  Net neutrality, copyright law, patent law, cloning and biological research, criper, open and free internet, banking regulation, etc. </p>

<p>I think the GOP know they&#39;re not going to fair well in the next few elections so they&#39;re stacking the courts while they can. It doesn&#39;t matter in the  Dems control the white house the real LASTING power is the courts.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. So the GOP is putting a person in the courts who&#39;s going to defend the Constitution and America just in case Congress cant</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what made you think that Republican president and Congress was going to nominate a liberal judge?</p>

<p>I&#39;m thankful we have a judge who isn&#39;t going to try to legislate from the bench and take away the Second Amendment and unconstitutional things that the Democrats put</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;re getting close to our Dredd Scott Decision moment.  That decision set the precedent for the legal status of blacks in the United States.  It was not until the constitution was amended that it changed.  It took a civil war to get there though.  The issue then was the country found itself in an uncompromisable position.  Anyone who says the war was about State Rights is cherry picking their history.  The whig party thought you could compromise on slavery to gain the rest of their agenda.  The Republican Party was born when the Whigs divided on the issue.  When the Republicans won their first election with Lincoln, half the country took it as a sign that their way of life (which depended on Slavery... The issue that divided the Whigs) was about to forever be changed.  An uncompromisable position led to a separation of the union, and I&#39;m sure you know the rest.</p>

<p>I believe Our country is divided in kind of a similar way.  I think the issue this time is socialism, and I think the democratic party is the whig party being divided.  It is a fundamental change.  With the new makeup of the supreme court the changes that these &quot;Democratic Socialists&quot; are pushing will inevitablly fail.  They&#39;re going to have to do drastic things like packing the court.  History doesn&#39;t repeat, but I keep asking myself.  Where we go from here in the current state?  The answer to me is definitely states splitting apart along the lines of blue vs red.  It can happen peacefully, but it might also not be peaceful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In short: I agree. </p>

<p>Forgive me if I’m missing something in history or if I don’t know enough regarding this issue.</p>

<p>I don’t see this divide, one that’s been so driven by this wedge of ideas over the years, being fixed without an interaction that the people who live in this modern day and age are prepared for. I see hard times to come, and not just because of the events of the last couple years, but because of the buildup that has lead to this point.</p>

<p>We as a people are so divided amongst party lines that the common sense arguments existing just several years prior for many moderates having views that crossed party boundaries seemingly no longer exist. I’d bet that they exist only if you were to sit down and one on one many people. Never as a population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not sure what you’re getting at regarding the upcoming extermination of all life on earth due to global corporate capitalism but don’t you think bringing the percentage of the world living in absolute poverty down to below 10% is a success? </p>

<p>Don’t you think the incredible luxuries that even the poor in America live with (Air conditioning, cars, televisions, cell phones) is a success of global corporate capitalism?</p>

<p>Don’t you think the innovations that the competitive market encourages are a success of global capitalism? (Innovations in medicine, technology, aviation, countless others) </p>

<p>Don’t you think about the fact that the only reason you’re able to connect with millions of minds on a platform like reddit and complain about capitalism is only possible because of... capitalism?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably the whipping of members of un to allow Syria invasion. </p>

<p>Syria has taken years off their plan. Anyone talking Iran is clueless to the fact they need at least 3-4 years of total control in Syria. </p>

<p>Ultimately the Russian and Chinese members will veto any resolution at the security council so they are probably working on a go around. Isis failed, chemical attacks failed, and evil regime propaganda failed. </p>

<p>My guess is they are at a complete standstill as Russia has drawn the line in Syria. Ultimately ground wars are almost impossible to win, and that&#39;s against a small group of citizens with small arms. If they put troops on the ground in Syria would be the beginning of the hot war of WW3. We&#39;re looking at NATO vs Russian, Syria, and Iran for sure. Will china side with NATO or RSI? That&#39;s probably what they are trying to figure out. If China supports NATO I could see Russia succumbing to the pressure and allowing Syria to fall to the NATO/IMF alliance. </p>

<p>The true question here to me has always been is Russia just playing their role in the global charade or is this a legitimate rebellion against IMF(think of NATO as the IMFs mercenary army)??</p>

<p>That said the Supreme Court is ultimately where the battle for America will be won or lost. As soon as they get the majority of the SC anti-2a it&#39;s all over. The entire globe will fall into complete tyranny once the us constitution is legally done away with. It&#39;s already covertly subverted but they need to bring it to the open to allow evidence gathered thru this illegal mass surveillance grid to be admissible in the court of law. </p>

<p>Basically they need to win the war by taking away constitutional rights. They can&#39;t take them away but they are working to convince us to forsake them for the &quot;greater good&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spot on. It&#39;s crazy to see turkey Greece Saudi Israel Iraq India all speaking in a way that they don&#39;t want anything to spill into their countries. They are also talking about the cost of us wars on surrounding cou tries. Russia is using it as political leverage as the US can&#39;t act through Israel or Saudi for Syria. They want Irans old guard to be crushed so they can put debt captains in charge to rob the people blind. With China looking to secure trade and influence, Russia and the Middle East are talking to Russia and China in a way I&#39;ve never seen. I honestly feel like they are weighing if they can all out attack Iran while using Syria as a new reconstruction debt state. The Supreme Court case is huge In all this but Kavanaugh will be voted in and the multinational teiring for. Global control will be done. The sovereignty of humans will wash. America will lose power and influence as the global shift happens. This will lead to a future war when one group feels they can finally hit the US and take over the Fed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a reliable source, so you&#39;ll have to do your own digging: <a href="https://www.henrymakow.com/was_michael_jackson_another_il.html">https://www.henrymakow.com/was_michael_jackson_another_il.html</a></p>

<p>Also, I believe the original goal was to have Michael Jackson foment race wars, but he refused to go along with it. So that&#39;s why a big media company had to buy out MTV, deep-six the great decade of 80s music, and replace it with gangsta rap, culminating in the 1992 Rodney King riots.</p>

<p>Michael Jackson, in contrast, was trying to promote racial harmony with his 1991 &quot;Black or White&quot; song.</p>

<p>Viacom bought MTV in 1985. I call August 6, 1988 the day the music died, as that is when Yo! MTV Raps debuted.</p>

<p>How many pop songs did you like from last year? Three, four? On New Year&#39;s Eve 1985, MTV aired their Top 100. Every single song was outstanding and even any youth today would recognize a dozen of them. Viacom actively killed this culture.</p>

<p>I go back and forth on whether Michael Jackson abused children. I believe he was innocent of at least the second (2005) lawsuit because his attitude that time was of &quot;you&#39;ve got nothing on me this time&quot;. After his death, his limo drivers came out in his defense saying, &quot;Oh, he was a man alright, he would get frisky with the women in the back&quot;.</p>

<p>But with his children with Lisa Marie Presley obviously adopted, one has to wonder whether he was castrated as a child, despite her pubic defense of Michael&#39;s bedroom performance.</p>

<p>Note the timing of the first (1993) lawsuit. It&#39;s like the labels&#39; revenge going for him going rogue on him with his peaceful Black or White. See the videos late in his life where he divulges the evil power of the labels, asking that his statements not be recorded. But can it be said he never, ever abused? That&#39;s a long shot, if he was abused himself as a child. But it&#39;s still within the realm of possibility, given how strong his will was to distance himself from his own childhood.</p>

<p>When he started getting vitiligo, he started using lots of skin makeup to cover it up, as do most black celebrities with it. But instead of covering up the light patches of skin, he covered up the dark patches. That plus the frequent plastic surgeries it is said were to make himself not resemble his father.</p>

<p>you used to need a large majority to confirm a new Supreme Court judge</p>

<p>democrats change the rules in 2010 to shoehorn Kagan onto the court</p>

<p>outrage, but they succeed</p>

<p>they don&#39;t change it back to supermajority because Clinton is guaranteed to win the election</p>

<p>Trump wins</p>

<p>republicans get to confirm two justices in a short time, dems can&#39;t obstruct because they changed the rules in 2010</p>

<p>playing by the rules is no longer advantageous - now dems lie, cheat, steal, slander, and destroy to block SCOTUS nominee</p>

<p>it works because republicans are spineless cowards</p>

<p>if Kavanaugh doesn&#39;t get confirmed, this sets a precedent that could lead to the dissolution of SCOTUS, and further erode the rule of law</p>
