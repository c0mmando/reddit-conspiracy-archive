<p>What kind of damage is he doing? He&#39;s been illegally prevented free movement for 6 years. His internet has been cut off, his wikileaks associates have been disappeared, defunded, and persecuted all over the world.</p>

<p>JA&#39;s adversaries have carried out a wave of crimes trying to capture and prosecute him for middlemanning truthleaks.</p>

<p>If russia truly is responsible for the emails leak then that means we can trust Russia to leak the truth about the US government more than we can trust the US government to do it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The MIC want people to trust in this fake CIA &quot;Q&quot; guy which is their version of a shitty replacement for Assange, while he is not allowed to communicate and is isolated in an embassy. Sad so many seem to believe one that pushes for CIA talking points while the other has been seemingly thrown under the bus. I think the fakery in this thread should be apparent for anyone with a functioning brain cell, that is not a bot.</p>

<p>If they claim he&#39;s dead or partisan, then they can push their created alternative that really just talks shit in riddles that make no sense.</p>

Maybe work on your writing, specifically your spelling. Would also help if it made sense.

MSM has picked it up saying it’s a text. I’m dying to see what it actually is. It’ll probably just be a test and my hopes will be dashed. I’ll lurk cause it’s better than watching shit on TV.

<p>you also didn’t answer my questions.</p>

<p>there have been larps before, but has any larp lasted longer than a couple months? has any larp posted over 2,000+ times?</p>
