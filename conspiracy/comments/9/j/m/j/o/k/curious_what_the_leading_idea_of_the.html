    <div class="md"><p>I still think it was done by &#39;a power&#39; and used as the downed MH17 flight. It happened 3 months before that plane was shot down, same airline, same plane type etc. There was also some pic somewhere of it landed after the date of it going missing iirc. (if people reading this have sources feel free to add, im at work) :( </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a &quot;fictional story&quot; someone wrote about it, which took place in a think-tank.</p>

<p>They were trying to figure out how to hijack a plane in the post 9/11 world, without a passenger revolt. In short, they chose the 777 plane because of a maintenance compartment access hatch located in the passenger compartment.</p>

<p>If you can access the maintenance compartment, you can connect a computer to the fly-by-wire, turn down the cabin air pressure, put everyone to sleep, and fly the plane wherever you want with no resistance.</p>

<p>The hijackers would be fine, as they had reserve oxygen bottles used for diving, which did not look suspicious because they had diving gear in their carry on.</p>

<p>As it turns out, there were actually 3 russian diving enthusiasts with little to no background info that were on the flight.</p>

<p>This does not explain why the pilot had a flight simulator at home, with a deleted flight path matching the off-course route they flew.</p>

<p>They flew along borders and between towers, so each tower or country would assume the plane was corresponding with the tower on the side of the border. Im told the military does something similar.</p>

<p>Aside from this, the acars system was switched off, but the rolls royce engines have their own data relay to send real time data to the manufacturer. Apparently, the engine were running fine for several hours after the acars was switched off. </p>

<p>My normie commercial pilot friend was even stumped by this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah he had a pretty elaborate simulator at his house. He had flown the course several times apparently, and then had deleted (or so he thought) all traces of the sim.</p>

<p>Its looking like it was a russian op, maybe with the pilot in on it, to take the plane and use it later.</p>

<p>As someone else mentioned, the same type of plane, which was also Malaysia Airlines, was shot down by an anti aircraft missile over Ukrainian airspace about 4 months after 370 disappeared.</p>

<p>Ukraine blamed a Russian false flag, Russians blamed Ukrainian separatists.  It was claimed the plane had a military call sign on radar, which is why they shot it down.</p>

<p>I was upset that both of these stories faded into obscurity, as there was obviously ore going on.</p>
