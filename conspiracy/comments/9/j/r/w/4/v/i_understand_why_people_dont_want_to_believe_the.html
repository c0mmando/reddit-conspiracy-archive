       Sitting with my partner tonight and a 9/11 conspiracy v fact doc was on I didnt say anything and wait for her to say something. Eventually she says how can people believe  we were lied to about the official narrative so I gently bring up some facts about it to gauge her response and that's when I realised by what she said it's not that people don't think that the govt can do that it's that the reality is very scary for people who aren't aware of the real world. She said it was a scary thought and that it would be hard to face that we could be lied to like that. This may be a useless post but bare in mind the next time you are having a conversation with someone about conspiraces that some people can't begin to understand and don't push anything because the last thing we want is people questioning everything on the spot so slow the seeds and let them go at their own pace.

       Look If you wanna know what a red flag is...
Give it an hour or two after a major incident and the media will already have passports and documents of the people involved.
A natural disaster will take weeks or months until all those involved with be named.

       How does this prove anything? It's not like they needed the passport to eventually identify the terrorists. Why  bother planting a passport when there's airport video, flight records, etc.  How is it not a coincidence?

       It's so unbelievably unlikely. The black boxes, devices designed to be near indestructible, were not recovered. Yet, paper passports survived somehow. It's one lie too far.

       But what does the charred passport imply?  Why would the government plant a passport when it didn't have to?  Unbelievably unlikely situations occur every day.  Is there anything more here or is that enough for you?

       What makes it hard to face is that once the reality is accepted how can you, once in formed, do nothing about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that people fear the truth...they fear the consequence of admitting the truth...that now you have to do something about it. That's what's really scary.

       I disagree this isn't a gender thing it's just the reality that most of the population in general just can't face the facts and we as truthers and conspiracy theorists should know that the best approach is to educate true rational communication

       Years ago I worked to convince my very rational father that the official story was wrong. After a LOT of back and forthing, he finally said “I just can’t believe it’s true (a conspiracy)”.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said “I know. I get that. All I’m asking you to do is recognize that you don’t WANT to believe it, and that your desire has very little to do with the actual facts.”
      </p>
      <p>
       We then agreed that he didn’t believe - not be ause he’d been exposed to overwhelming evidence - but because he didn’t want to believe it, and we agreed that believing what you want to doesn’t have very much to do with objective truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we left it at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       He then became more open, once he’d admitted that he’d chosen a belief based on his feelings rather than the evidence. I, OTOH, continues to say “I don’t know, but SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED that’s different from the official story because that one doesn’t add up, and we need a new investigation, at the very least.
      </p>
      <p>
       He now agrees with me. That’s a point we can converge upon.

       The truth is hard to swallow and it only takes small seeds to plant strong thoughts. The truth isn't pretty, it makes most people uncomfortable no matter how much proof you have. Sadly that's the reality of everything. You kinda have to "spoon feed a baby" with truth. Know what I mean?

       This might sound completely stupid but at the moment one of these shows brought up Mohammad attas passport being found on the street my wife lost it.
      </p>
      <p>
       She said she could believe a lot but did they really have to push their luck with the passport that came out of the giant fireball 80 stories up I the air?

       Shouldnt your post be titled "I understand why people dont want to believe alternate theories about 9/11" Or "I Understand why people WANT to believe the official 9/11 story" It just seems like your title is the opposite of your actual post.

       This is spot on.  It’s the same reason most people believe humans landed on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look up at the moon, and tell me you believe people flew 300,000 miles each way in a rocket ship 40 years ago, talked to us while there using radio, drove around on some go carts, and then launched themselves again and came all the way back to earth and did all that successfully on the first try.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to say you don’t believe that would be to say you think your government propagated a massive massive lie to you, and that’s probably very very scary to acknowledge.

       I openly talk about the fake moon landings just to see what people think
      </p>
      <p>
       Most say they believe it happened
      </p>
      <p>
       When I talk about the "big picture" versus the specific details it seems to go over better as to having them question their beliefs
      </p>
      <p>
       Most believe it because they never really thought much about it and just accepted it as fact
      </p>
      <p>
       You summarized what I say in those conversations well in your post
      </p>
      <p>
       I just take the common sense approach ... "Do you really believe that we ... 6 times in a row with 1960's technology ..." and then ask them to think about it

       is a weird way to put it. Ever watched a rocket launch before? I’m betting no. It’s a little sad that your small mind can’t comprehend that sometimes humans do some incredible things.

       Been guilty of this mysef.. you get ppl that you can tell are aching to be red pilled so your natural inclination is to just thrust it all on them at once.. but it can be extremely well overwhelming. Best to just take it slow and go at their own pace. The important thing isn’t getting all the information out, it’s that they’re finally willing to seek it out in the first place
