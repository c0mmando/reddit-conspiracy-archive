        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sitting with my partner tonight and a 9/11 conspiracy v fact doc was on I didnt say anything and wait for her to say something. Eventually she says how can people believe  we were lied to about the official narrative so I gently bring up some facts about it to gauge her response and that&#39;s when I realised by what she said it&#39;s not that people don&#39;t think that the govt can do that it&#39;s that the reality is very scary for people who aren&#39;t aware of the real world. She said it was a scary thought and that it would be hard to face that we could be lied to like that. This may be a useless post but bare in mind the next time you are having a conversation with someone about conspiraces that some people can&#39;t begin to understand and don&#39;t push anything because the last thing we want is people questioning everything on the spot so slow the seeds and let them go at their own pace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Years ago I worked to convince my very rational father that the official story was wrong. After a LOT of back and forthing, he finally said “I just can’t believe it’s true (a conspiracy)”. </p>

<p>I said “I know. I get that. All I’m asking you to do is recognize that you don’t WANT to believe it, and that your desire has very little to do with the actual facts.”</p>

<p>We then agreed that he didn’t believe - not be ause he’d been exposed to overwhelming evidence - but because he didn’t want to believe it, and we agreed that believing what you want to doesn’t have very much to do with objective truth. </p>

<p>And we left it at that. </p>

<p>He then became more open, once he’d admitted that he’d chosen a belief based on his feelings rather than the evidence. I, OTOH, continues to say “I don’t know, but SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED that’s different from the official story because that one doesn’t add up, and we need a new investigation, at the very least. </p>

<p>He now agrees with me. That’s a point we can converge upon. </p>

<p>Look up at the moon, and tell me you believe people flew 300,000 miles each way in a rocket ship 40 years ago, talked to us while there using radio, drove around on some go carts, and then launched themselves again and came all the way back to earth and did all that successfully on the first try.</p>

<p>But to say you don’t believe that would be to say you think your government propagated a massive massive lie to you, and that’s probably very very scary to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Most believe it because they never really thought much about it and just accepted it as fact </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spaceflight-related_accidents_and_incidents">First try</a> is a weird way to put it. Ever watched a rocket launch before? I’m betting no. It’s a little sad that your small mind can’t comprehend that sometimes humans do some incredible things.</p>
