      <p>
       I've noticed many people trying to elucidate on how disturbing it is regarding the precedent of what we're seeing in this situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is that? Well, I think it has something to do with the "trickle down into everyday life" effect we have been seeing from the colluding strategies of the left and the majority of MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've seen it happen with the calls for impeachment...we've seen it happen with the branding of all conservatives as "far right Nazi's"...we've seen it happen with the "russian bots and trolls"...
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, the latest strategy by the left and the MSM is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof rests on the shoulders of the accused.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the coming days and weeks we are going to see stories about civilians trying to use this logic in real life situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can count on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I believe this gets to the root of why this is so disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are witnessing a very insidious and coordinated type of programming that is resulting in "real life" effects within a very short time period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes this whole thing reminds me of basic chemistry. You can have a number of ingredients that are completely benign and harmless within close proximity of each other...but when combined...well, it's a completely different story.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's two ingredients right now that are within close proximity of each other that I want to discuss.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "rising popularity of socialism" and the idea that the "burden of proof rests on the accused".
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect this is what's so disturbing to many on a fundamental level.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like watching somebody light a cigarette while pumping gas. Nothing may happen, but there's definitely a reason why most people know this is a really bad idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last thing...regarding that whole "hate speech" subreddit banning shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen users supply a few instances of how those subreddits caused people to take actions in real life..ie Charlottesville and Pizzagate shooter...
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't have shit on the MSM and the radical left when it comes to causing real life effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       You watch...soon enough we'll be seeing this "burden of proof" strategy playing itself out in different situations across the country.

       Yeah the burden of proof thing is fun
      </p>
      <p>
       When I assert that there's no credible evidence that white men walked on the moon, I'm asked for "proof" that they didn't
      </p>
      <p>
       So I ask them for proof that I "didn't" walk on the moon. Their failure to provide proof is rock solid evidence that I walked on the moon
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I say that remarkable claims require remarkable evidence
      </p>
      <p>
       And their "logical" reply is that it's more remarkable to say that white men didn't walk on the moon, than to say white men did walk on the moon
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a shame stupidity isn't more painful

       Is there a logical reason that you believe that white men are the only ones who have ever been capable of walking on the moon?

      <p>
       Because from my perspective, it seems like a clear cut case of you simply wanting white men to be superior to other men and women

       What fell apart was the lack of any investigation based on the compelling evidence reported. To date there has been NO investigation.  No matter how many times you review disgusting depictions unsuitable for children at a children’s venue, no response. Apparently this lack of response from local authorities  has been seen before in previous exposure of similar crimes in US, Australia, EU, Britain, Nordic countries, etc.

       Yes, there have been instances where authorities failed to investigate actual horrific abuse. It does not logically follow that a lack of investigation means there is abuse.

       You even mentioned UK and Australia. Pizzagate had to be renamed and expanded globally to find a victim. Art and performance which offends your delicate sensibilities is not proof of anything.

       These are
       <em>
        fbi identified symbols
       </em>
       used by pedophiles. You can’t whitewash this away behind “delicate sensibilities.”  Art is proof that an investigation should be done and if these were everyday ppl it would happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I bring up other countries is to establish how it has been dealt with in the past numerous times,
       <em>
        with complicit authorities

       who ignore it.

       However, the franklin scandal  was in US, involved the White House and has recorded testimony —bonacci.

       There was a sign similar to the FBI symbols down the street from CPP. Is that proof of something? Who was using these symbols that you can show me?

       There is no “proof” bec no one has taken the trouble to investigate these very suspicious findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will have to refer to fbi sources to figure out how and where they identified the symbols.
      </p>
      <p>
       So down the street also has pedo symbols?  Yes, it appears several shops on that block were suspicious.

       I also followed from the beginning and those clutching pearls came out from humiliating defeat and  made up “fake news” to try and cover it up. There have been investigator suspicious deaths and never ending new leads.  I know more than I ever thought possible about how bad evil can be. And we aren’t done. Demonic power has made prime time and not everyone is brainwashed enough to forget about it.  However, enjoy your nap.

       It's just conservative virtue signaling. They don't care about sexual assault, they don't even care about pedo's. It's all just leverage to promote their political agenda. If they feel it helps their cause they'll push it. Period. Ever see them "outing" a conservative?
