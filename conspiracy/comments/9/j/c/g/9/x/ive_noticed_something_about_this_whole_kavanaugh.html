        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed many people trying to elucidate on how disturbing it is regarding the precedent of what we&#39;re seeing in this situation. </p>

<p>Why is that? Well, I think it has something to do with the &quot;trickle down into everyday life&quot; effect we have been seeing from the colluding strategies of the left and the majority of MSM.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen it happen with the calls for impeachment...we&#39;ve seen it happen with the branding of all conservatives as &quot;far right Nazi&#39;s&quot;...we&#39;ve seen it happen with the &quot;russian bots and trolls&quot;...</p>

<p>Well, the latest strategy by the left and the MSM is this:</p>

<p>The burden of proof rests on the shoulders of the accused.</p>

<p>In the coming days and weeks we are going to see stories about civilians trying to use this logic in real life situations.</p>

<p>You can count on it. </p>

<p>And I believe this gets to the root of why this is so disturbing.</p>

<p>We are witnessing a very insidious and coordinated type of programming that is resulting in &quot;real life&quot; effects within a very short time period.</p>

<p>Sometimes this whole thing reminds me of basic chemistry. You can have a number of ingredients that are completely benign and harmless within close proximity of each other...but when combined...well, it&#39;s a completely different story.</p>

<p>There&#39;s two ingredients right now that are within close proximity of each other that I want to discuss.</p>

<p>The &quot;rising popularity of socialism&quot; and the idea that the &quot;burden of proof rests on the accused&quot;.</p>

<p>I suspect this is what&#39;s so disturbing to many on a fundamental level.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like watching somebody light a cigarette while pumping gas. Nothing may happen, but there&#39;s definitely a reason why most people know this is a really bad idea.</p>

<p>One last thing...regarding that whole &quot;hate speech&quot; subreddit banning shit.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen users supply a few instances of how those subreddits caused people to take actions in real life..ie Charlottesville and Pizzagate shooter...</p>

<p>They don&#39;t have shit on the MSM and the radical left when it comes to causing real life effects.</p>

<p>You watch...soon enough we&#39;ll be seeing this &quot;burden of proof&quot; strategy playing itself out in different situations across the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the burden of proof thing is fun</p>

<p>When I assert that there&#39;s no credible evidence that white men walked on the moon, I&#39;m asked for &quot;proof&quot; that they didn&#39;t</p>

<p>So I ask them for proof that I &quot;didn&#39;t&quot; walk on the moon. Their failure to provide proof is rock solid evidence that I walked on the moon </p>

<p>Then I say that remarkable claims require remarkable evidence </p>

<p>And their &quot;logical&quot; reply is that it&#39;s more remarkable to say that white men didn&#39;t walk on the moon, than to say white men did walk on the moon</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame stupidity isn&#39;t more painful </p>

<p>Because from my perspective, it seems like a clear cut case of you simply wanting white men to be superior to other men and women </p>

<p>Certainly you don&#39;t simply believe white men walked on the moon based on obviously staged evidence </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there have been instances where authorities failed to investigate actual horrific abuse. It does not logically follow that a lack of investigation means there is abuse.</p>

<p>Face it, there&#39;s bias on both sides and in every instance no one knows what happens behind closed doors, so stop pretending like you do for political leverage.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re over-generalising...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never weighed in on the Weinstein topic...not once.</p>

<p>Also important...did the alleged Weinstein victims file police reports? Did those reports lead to investigations by local law enforcement?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know...never followed the case. But I would think those are relevant questions.</p>

<p>The way they go to bat for this guy is pathetic, especially since they&#39;ll run with any accusation made toward any non conservative with little to no actual proof. </p>
