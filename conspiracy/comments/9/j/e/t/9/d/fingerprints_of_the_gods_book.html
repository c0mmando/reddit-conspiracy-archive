       Has anybody read it? It’s by Graham Hancock and it’s about rethinking the orthodox historical timeline we’ve been told about the history of humanity by exploring other possibilities. I’m about 1/3 finished with the book and so far it’s pretty damn interesting.

       Haven't read the book but he comes on the joe rogan experience podcast quite a bit and talks about some of the types of stuff that are in the book. Super interesting/smart dude you should definitely check out his episodes on the podcast whenever you have time.

       He's on joe rogan a few times, very good interviews,
      </p>

       One appearance he is with Randy Carlson that one is probably one of the best JRE podcasts I've seen.

       Not just pictures. Randal has compiled dozens of peer-reviewed and solid science that supports his hypothesis, and has a mountain of evidence from his own surveys. It's actually insane the amount of data he's put together.
      </p>

       I absolutely love watching his lectures too. You can really tell he loves what he's talking about.

       That is how things should work, most scientists or geologists are so locked into a hypothesis that's all they work towards and will omit or obfuscate evidence that may not work towards proving their hypothesis, I can't see a problem with offering a radical view and under testing find something that fits the data better.

       Just like how astrophysicists present the idea of the Big Bang? Like it's a fact when in reality it's the most accepted hypothesis?

       My point: hypocrisy is everywhere, don't believe that you yourself are not practicing it. If you are upset with someone about how they present their material, consider the source, then consider how we are all raised in our glorious fraudulent society.

       No, there is actual scientifc evidence for the Big Bang thery which is why it is a scientific theory.

       No. No he didn't. I've got the book with me right now and have whole passages with me where he states things like " This is just a theory of course, but I really feel that the academic mainstream need to look into it " and " while its just a theory,  the shcolarly weight behind it is tantalizing "
      </p>

       he's challenged popular belief with his own theory, that theory may have changed over time but what he presents now does hold some merit that's why he is attacked personally what other theory is out there other than the "official" narrative and now piles of evidence has been found to challenge this.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is trying to find a theory that works with the evidence that has been found the dogma you speak of is the official narative and the scientific comunity unwilling to reexamine anything because their carrers were built on what at the time may have seemed logical but no longer works. They are the ones that have turned what should be science into a ridgid structured unchangeable timeline akin now to a religion.  And to call Hancock's backers as sycophants is a joke.   If what Hancock said didn't work with the evidence at all, he wouldn't have very many supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you have leveled against Hancock is what is wrong with main stream "science" and its treating theory as fact.

       Yep, the Antarctica bit from the very beginning hooked me and I couldn’t stop reading. The fact that an old ass map from 1500 had the exact lat and Lon of an island of Antarctica is crazy. Especially since accurately measuring longitude wasn’t possible till the 1800’s. Only explanation is they sourced from an ancient map and that map sourced from an even more ancient source. It’s quite a mystery puzzle.

       Hancock doesn't even go that far. He says there's some significant evidence there was an ancient, now-collapsed, advanced, and global civilization. Beyond that limited claim says there's a chance there was a civilization as advanced or more advanced than us in some specific but limited ways (like spiritually for example).
      </p>
      <p>
       He definitely never uses the word proof, or even insinuates that there's proof, with regard to an ancient civilization being more advanced than us.

       It's led me down an amazing journey researching human history, which has coincidentally crossed paths with many popular conspiracy theories.

       I read the book and loved it. Have you read 1421, the Year China Discovered America, by Gavin Menzies? They are very similar in some of the evidence they refer to, but the latter comes to the conclusion that the Chinese explored the globe before western civilization. He even references Graham in the book. I  not sure which one I believe more. They are both persuasive.

       I found it to be a very useful book. But, Like Michael Cremo's Forbidden Archaeology, it's full of scientific errors and the only thing it is useful for truly now, is the fact that it contains studies and stats no longer easily available to the public.

       I'm reading it right now and it's blowing my mind every time I pick it up. Probably over halfway and it's a little slow going just because there's so much information to digest. The precision of the pyramids and the water erosion of the Sphinx are incredibly interesting. As well as the similarities in the origin stories from civilizations around the world. Highly recommend and I can't wait to read the sequel.
