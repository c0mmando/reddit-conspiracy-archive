<p>After the slip about the Google interns, I gotta wonder.</p>

<p>Is Blasey-Ford involved with some next level AI driven MK-Ultra mind control experiment?</p>

<p>Cause she looks like she&#39;s been MK-Ultraed herself...I&#39;m not even joking. There&#39;s as least two people in that head...and I&#39;m watching them take turns answering questions.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m glad you are not an expert in this field because that is very wrong. </p>

<p>Cognitive behavioral psychologist spend years learning approaches for dealing with all abnormal psychology disorders, including dissociative identity disorder. DID is the result of MK ultra programming. </p>

<p>Because the majority of survivors coming out were adults? The child&#39;s mind is the most malleable and by far the easiest to program. MKUltra was merely the research program into refining the centuries-old practice of Satanic Ritual Abuse. </p>

<p>AKA Satanic Ritual Abuse. </p>

<p>Also, I want to add DID is one of the hardest psychological disorders to diagnose. It is nearly impossible for a psychologist to make an assessment without drawing out the alters. The difference between a MKUltra programmed DID and an unrelated, completely organic, DID case is how the alter/s is called out. MKUltra and SRA victims are programed with phrases and words to cause the alter/s to take control, while an organic DID case can have there alter/s get triggered by nearly anything. A memory association, general anxiety, loud noises, bright lights, etc., can all be triggers. </p>

<p>Honestly, I didn&#39;t have a better name for it and in hindsight, wasn&#39;t the best choice of words. The distinction is if the trauma was used to split your ego, or if your ego split due to trauma. There is a huge distinction between an alter that is specifically programmed vs. an alter created by your own mind, with its own triggers. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to hear that and wish you the best of luck. </p>

<p>How do you feel about the theory of structural dissociation? That the ego states never integrated during childood development (due to trauma)?  Vs the split situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>from my understanding, people who have gone through trauma based mind control have &quot;commands&quot; (don&#39;t really know how to call it) where they will fall back in trance and what not and through neurolinguistics (that&#39;s where the <em>specialized</em> psych would come in play) can &quot;reprogram&quot; certain parts of the mind, memory and what not</p>

<p>what this women feels to me is that she has a false memory about Kavanaugh, but what she&#39;s describing (although with very, very few details) might very well have happened, and it may have been very traumatic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We may speculate about secret &quot;projects&quot; but a few things are out in the open:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Brett Kavanaugh was part of the Kenneth Starr investigation of Bill Clinton and actually wrote the sexually explicit questions. </p></li>
<li><p>Brett Kavanaugh, along with John Roberts, Jr., was part of the legal team that helped to stop the Florida vote count in 2000 so that the Supreme Court would install George W. Bush into the White House.</p></li>
<li><p>Brett Kavanaugh was part of the GWB administration, closely involved with justifying torture (as was DJT appointee Gina Haspel), illegal spying and secret legal justifications, indefinite detention, and who knows what else since establishment Republicans blocked revealing the documents.</p></li>
<li><p>Brett Kavanaugh used hacked Democratic emails to cheat on arguing for judicial nominations, and lied under oath repeatedly about it.</p></li>

<li><p>This one is common knowledge and even Brett Kavanaugh does not dispute it. It&#39;s his own words. The only implication is that he would protect Donald Trump. That follows necessarily: If BK would protect presidential powers, he would protect the person who has those powers.</p></li>
