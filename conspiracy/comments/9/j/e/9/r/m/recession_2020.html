        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The telegraphing couldn&#39;t be clearer, we are being prime for RECESSION 2020. In the middle of this year, world economists being stating they are concerned of a coming recession, maybe by 2020. Now the mainsteam media have been given the go ahead to trickle stories about the eventual, and planned, recession around 2020. Expect many more stories like this during the marketing campaign for RECESSION 2020. Here is a nice example, preparing the population for the coming recession, telling people to not worry and simply retrain after a recession:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2018/09/26/why-those-who-lost-their-jobs-in-a-recession-must-retrain/#50ea62c16a0d">https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2018/09/26/why-those-who-lost-their-jobs-in-a-recession-must-retrain/#50ea62c16a0d</a></p>

<p>Essentially RECESSION 2020 will allow the FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION to go into high gear. For more information on the FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, please see:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/</a></p>

<p>It will go like this, recession hits as planned, tons of people lose their jobs, companies go out of business, we are told in order for businesses to remain competitive automation will need to be implemented, we will see the true potential of blockchain, robotics and AI, we will need to retrain to be able to have employment during the FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.</p>

<p>Once the 2020 recession hits, we will see further concentrated consolidation of wealth, resources, land, properties, basically resources is the catch-all term I would use, as outlined in Piketty&#39;s book, and also just common sense. It will be bad for most, good from some, like 5%, and exactly as planned for 0.00001%. The information, the history, the economic literature, the government literature, is all out there, as most choose to ignore, this agenda continues undeterred.</p>

<p>I would advise all to save as much as you can now, once the next recession hits, posited to be 2020, obviously might be 2021, etc., jobs will go big time, companies will go &quot;bankrupt&quot;, meaning wages will stagnate or even decline, automation will kick in, meaning even less jobs in the future, and by future I mean in 5 years, austerity measures will be imposed by our militant government.</p>

<p>With terrorism on the rise, as planned, and the governments intentionally doing almost nothing to stem it, as inevitably more terrorist attacks occur, for our &quot;safety&quot; the police will need to be armed, we are already seeing the further arming of French and Swedish police, Obama gave the green light for a domestic army in his now infamous speech:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt2yGzHfy7s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt2yGzHfy7s</a></p>

<p>Universal Basic Income will be doled out, as outlined by the World Economic Forum, in exchange you will have to give up ownership and privacy, as outlined by the World Economic Forum. We will all essentially be in a surveillance state, for our own safety of course, it might not be that bad really, at least we will have cool VR to escape reality with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the next event will be WORSE than WW1 and 2 combined. I believe 4x more people died in WW2 than 1. </p>

<p>In WW2, a lot of people still knew how to farm and Garden and live without electricity everyday.</p>

<p>Today , the population will die if they run out of electricity and water.</p>

<p>Everything is mass produced.</p>

<p>When the bombs start hitting the electrical grids, nobody will eat, except the elites</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think this and I still highly doubt we&#39;ll see ww3 soon, but trump has shown us how easily history can repeat itself. Let&#39;s say Trump continues damaging alliances then in 10-20 years, China replaces the US aa the trade deal guy. Then you get more nationalistic leaders. People are stupid, just as dumb as 100 years ago. Tensions rise due to climate change and soon we see a fight break out-this escalates, wala ww3. I think its like the old saying, &quot;ww3 will happen when the ppl in power forget about ww2.&quot; So maybe around 2040?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>WW3 started almost 20 years ago when a coalition of western nations invaded the middle east following some false flag terrorism. They just called it a &quot;global war on terrorism&quot; since I guess that tested better for public relations than to allow people to think the USA had just started &quot;World War 3&quot;. When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, do you think German media would refer to that invasion as having started WW2 at the time? We shouldn&#39;t be surprised that American media would neglect to accurately paint the US government as instigators of a global war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically. The Clinton administration in the 90s was behind de-regulation of banks too, with policies that encouraged banks to loan to people who would be expected to not repay. These de-valued loans were then bundled and re-sold as bundles to disguise the fact that they were likely to default. That was the subprime mortgage fraud thing that was covered in The Big Short for example, but the policies that led to it had been boiling under the surface since the Clinton era. Then, Bush and Obama both worked to ensure that the fraudster bankers didn&#39;t get prosecuted, and in fact, the Obama administration gave them free money in the form of &quot;quantitative easing&quot;. They crashed the economy through fraud, Democrats supported the policies that enabled that fraud. They crashed the economy and were rewarded for it. </p>
