        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been a casual linux user for over a decade, and while my technological expertise is significantly lacking, there&#39;s something very inspiring about the passion in the linux community, and indeed I&#39;ve found that many of my own beliefs and ideologies are very much in tune with those espoused in the open source/free software community.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there appears to be significant turmoil unfolding in the world of linux, and since linux powers a <em>significant</em> portion of the world&#39;s computers, this is an issue that could effect everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Linux powers the internet, the Android in your pocket, and perhaps even some of your household appliances. A controversy over politics is now seeing some of its developers threatening to withdraw the license to all of their code, potentially destroying or making the whole Linux kernel unusable for a very long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In essence, a new &quot;Code of Conduct&quot; is being forced on the linux community. It is already being weaponized, and many developers want absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>This article is a good place to start:</p>

<p><a href="https://lulz.com/linux-devs-threaten-killswitch-coc-controversy-1252/">Linux developers threaten to pull “kill switch”...&quot;threat has teeth.&quot; Most of the internet could be affected as some Linux devs threaten to rescind code in response to CoC controversy.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.fo/LogtF">As has been noted</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is interesting...apparently Linux kernel devs can revoke their contributions to the kernel. This gives them some protection in case they are caught up in arbitrary and false Code of Conduct rulings or ejections from the community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the threat is put into action, ramifications could include large parts of the internet being left vulnerable to exploits, and companies around the world might even inherit bundles of unwanted legal liabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should perhaps come as no surprise as to who is the (at least most visible) culprit: SJWs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Activists from the feminist and LGBTQIA+ communities have been trying to force the Linux project to join the Contributor Covenant since at least 2015. The Contributor Covenant is an agreement to implement a special Code of Conduct (frequently CoC from now on) aimed at changing the predominantly white, straight, and male face of programming. </p>

<p>CC’s Code of Conduct is controversial particularly because it allows anyone to be banned from contributing code for any reason, usually with no mechanism for oversight or accountability.</p>

<p>On September 16 the pro-CoC side got their wish (how this happened is a very strange story of its own, read recent news about Linus Torvalds’ departure if you want to know more) — Linux had officially committed to implementing and obeying the CC Code of Conduct — and they immediately set about using it to remove top Linux coders. Sage Sharp, who describes theyself as a “diversity &amp; inclusion consultant, hufflepuff, non-binary agender trans masculine” and has 7k followers, cites GeekFeminismWiki and targets Google’s Theo Ts’o with accusations of being a rape apologist:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Speculation on 4chan led many to suggest that Theo was targeted because he <a href="https://archive.fo/G9Ic1">famously resisted an Intel &quot;backdoor&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>This last observation leads us closer to the &quot;cui bono?&quot; of it all.</p>

<p>Linux, especially the liberty-loving community it engenders, is directly ideologically opposed to the goals and raison d&#39;etre of TPTB. </p>

<p>The SJW movement, as well-meaning as it alleges to be, has been fully weaponized by the elite, and they are being used to target communities and institutions they deem unpalatable or threatening to their control structure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CC’s Code of Conduct replaces Linux’ earlier Code of Conflict (not to be confused with current use of “CoC”), which asked for civility without having political implications. The change is widely condemned by developers, and opposition has generated thousands upon thousands of posts on 4chan’s technology board alone. Here is a summary of their arguments:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>Insertion of the CoC into other projects has heralded witch hunts where good contributors are removed over trivial matters or even events that happened a long time ago.</p></li>
<li><p>The lack of proper definitions for punishments, time frames, and even what constitutes abuse or harassment leaves the Code of Conduct wide open for abuse.</p></li>
<li><p>It gives the people charged with enforcement omnipotent and unaccountable power.</p></li>
<li><p>It could force acceptance of contributions that wouldn’t make the cut if made by cis white males.</p></li>
<li><p>CC’s Code of Conduct is purely about power.</p></li>
<li><p>“‘In all that time I never had to know or care whether my fellow contributors were white, black, male, female, straight, gay, or from the planet Mars, only whether their code was good’; namely, in a project that receives contributions from volunteers who are anonymous beyond a chosen handle, specious claims of exclusion and harassment crumble beneath the most haphazard scrutiny. Contributors reveal as much about their race, sex, and orientation as they want because no one cares about that tangential shit at the end of the day. If there really was some “straight white males only” mentality, the community would insist on determining whether a new contributor is “one of us” before accepting their code, but they don’t do that in the slightest. Thus, it’s patently clear there is no culture of exclusion, but rather a culture of total indifference to individual differences beyond coding ability. The rhetoric of diversity and inclusiveness is just a weapon being used to attack a community that is inherently opposed to identity politics, which is why they’re seen as such a threat to these SJW gestapo.”</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The following videos provide further context and go into greater detail about the events leading to this situation, particularly the plight of linux creator Linus Torvalds:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwn3gIipCjU">The Absolute State of Linux</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D23mYwPkdyw">Linux Vs SJW&#39;s in the Battle for the Internet</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTeXwFKWci8">SJWs take down Linus Torvald and Linux</a></p>

<p>I found this interesting comment from the first video:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Search &quot;Brendan Eich Trust but Verify&quot; (it was about to prevent Firefox binaries being corrupted with backdoors). A few weeks later, after he wrote it, he had to go. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[<a href="https://brendaneich.com/2014/01/trust-but-verify/">Here is the blog post being referenced</a>]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This all is 100% about gaining control. For Linux - and why Linus had to go - atm it is about KDBUS/BUS1, Secureboot Lockdown, and other RedHat stuff they want to get into the kernel. But not for the SJWs themselves. These &quot;OMG, I*M A FEMINSIT CODER WITCH&quot; SJW types are the ultimate pawns. So do you know who is behind them? Or at least ask yourself...They slowly ruin projects in a way their &quot;handlers&quot; want projects to become. </p>

<p>Linus had to go because of stuff like KDBUS/BUS1, mandatory Kernel Lockdown when SecureBoot is present, etc. Linux Foundation does the dirty work. Profiteur is RedHat. Red Hat is the No.1 contractor of US intelligence agencies and the US military. Think big. (PS: I&#39;m not one of these anti-American European cucks. I love the US and especially the 2nd amendment, the 1st amendment and all - no matter what - folks who protect these freedoms.)﻿</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So...are TPTB using the weaponized SJW movement to attack Linux? What will the outcome of this battle mean for the future of the internet and technology in general?</p>

<p>We appear to be at a major crossroads in <em>numerous</em> areas in our society, and the battle for freedom in the world of technology is going to be one of the most important and contentious fronts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m just going to explain what happened since these are the top comments</p>

<p>Basically for a few years the sjw movement was pushing for more social justice policies that would put gender above capability in Linux programming</p>

<p>basically they felt not enough women were in there so they wanted to force women in even if they weren&#39;t as qualified as some of the others</p>

<p>Lenox resisted for a while but eventually they caved.</p>

<p>which meant according to these new policies some of the old programmers were responsible for key parts of programming it could be kicked off. And I think a few have been</p>

<p>The problem is that every programmer that puts program into the code has the legal rights to that code. And they can resend the rights at any time.</p>

<p>so if they get kicked off and are pissed they can resend Lennox is right to use their programming which would completely kill the entire thing</p>

<p>It&#39;s a copyright issue</p>

<p>and to point out how ridiculous the rules are. There&#39;s no sexism in the Linux</p>

<p>everybody can only be identified by the username if they choose. Nobody knows what race gender or nationality anybody is. It&#39;s all a hundred percent anonymous. the perfect way to know that no sexism is involved</p>

<p>But the radical left decided they wanted to get sexism involved and put gender above quality. The perfect example of 
 leftism is  sexism</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s honestly hard to tell with all of the typos. Maybe there&#39;s some truth in there, but it&#39;s pretty clear the user doesn&#39;t have a whole lot of direct experience and is just regurgitating what they&#39;ve read somewhere. The way they call it &quot;Lenox&quot;, &quot;Lennox&quot;, &quot;the Linux&quot;, and talk about &quot;putting program into the code&quot; sounds like if I asked my computer-illiterate parents to describe how &quot;the cyber&quot; works.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I haven&#39;t been following this whole issue as closely as I should be, so I can&#39;t really offer a better explanation though. I know there has been a big push to get more women into STEM fields in recent years, but I hadn&#39;t heard anything about forcing anyone into &quot;the Linux&quot; specifically or &quot;kicking off&quot; other developers. </p>

<p>Can you provide a source on this? I always read that they demanded more representation in the workforce. I never found any credible information (meaning coming from the organization demanding such representation) that they demand that competent workers be removed for women/sjw&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saying &#39;radical left&#39; is not propaganda. It seems like a baseless claim. The CC asked for more representation. The rest is a narrative pushed by this article; of which, no google or duckduckgo search can yield any evidence that the LGBT+ group is actively trying to remove members in the name of &quot;diversity over competence&quot;. </p>

<p>Without a proper source this reads like prop<em>a</em>ganda.</p>

<p>Namely because the Contributor Covenant&#39;s new code of conduct cites no demand of &quot;taking down competent workers to make room for women&quot;. Instead it&#39;s just a code of conduct to stop harrassment, saying that they want </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>

<p>The reason it comes off as prop<em>a</em>ganda, is because I could not find any source on</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically for a few years the sjw movement was pushing for more social justice policies that would put gender above capability in Linux programming</p>

<p>Linus has stepped down. He was not removed. He said in a BBC interview that he&#39;s taking a break because:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s very polarising, and both sides love egging the other side on. It&#39;s not even a &#39;discussion&#39;, it&#39;s just people shouting at each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of finding any source or other information, outside of lulz.com , I found that it just seems to be a bunch of people getting mad that they can&#39;t harass others. Blaming &quot;SJW&#39;s and the LGBTQ1ANWI&quot;. </p>

 us was plan future.</p>

<p>Linux&#39;s old founder, Linus, has given control to his daughter. She like Mark Zuckerburg and Twitter are controlled by dark forces trying to shut down meaning creative technologies that people have adopted as a means of every day communications.</p>

<p>The Dark age is coming upon us. One that hates free speech, Science, Truth, healthy society, and the very idea that we the underclass should have rights as individuals. This world is birthing Material Satanism into our societies which tolerates no human compassion or creativity. What they are doing is deceiving us with an ideology of inclusiveness as a tool to erase all our freedoms.</p>

<p>Your question reminds me of a theme from the book Atlas Shrugged.  If you have not read it you should, it opened my eyes to how many view the world.</p>

<p>Basically, the mere fact that a developer is capable of contributing means they owe it to the rest of society to give their work and creativity.  If they don’t, then they are evil for withholding their abilities.</p>

<p>How would you feel if the car you drove had its software written by a team of poorly skilled coders hired only on the basis of their skin colour or gender? What about medical equipment or even something simple as your microwave? Take a moment and think about all the planes flying around, all the trucks on the road, the computers protecting your credit card information, the ATM&#39;s at the corner store, the DVR&#39;s recording video in every security system, the mind boggles at all the potentials for failure due to poorly written code. Some harmless, others could put hundreds or thousands of lives at risk across the world. Are you willing to accept the sacrifice in quality assurance because hiring on merit and skill has been traded for hiring a colourful staff and feel good policy? Do you even understand the potential ramifications of poorly written software beyond an application crash?</p>

<p>Clearly not. Diversity doesn&#39;t mean quality, and implementing mandatory diversity at the expense of quality is something we should be working hard to prevent. I don&#39;t care what colour skin someone has, or what they want from their genitals, I care about the quality of their skills and their ability to be civil with others. We should want the best skills and workmanship to come out of our society, not mediocrity. </p>

<p>Greg KH made the patch and Linus Torvals merged it. That&#39;s the top two Linux maintainers. I fail to see how they&#39;re not part of the linux community.

<p>You&#39;re insinuating that they are <em>the</em> community. They&#39;re the ones doing the forcing, so the question is, who forced them? This is sudden and completely out of character, and people have been trying to blackmail Linus for ages.</p>

<p>IMO going forward with that is premature, bit aans resolution it is the only option I see. I&#39;m not positive this situation can&#39;t be resolved, but I&#39;m also pretty sure that a significant number of people won&#39;t be hanging around if it isn&#39;t. Meritocracy is baked in to the programming mindset, this is trying to mix oil and water with a blowtorch, and I think intentionally. This is a burn it down approach meant to drive &#39;wrongthinkers&#39; out of the project (and society as a whole), and it&#39;s just not going to work out well for Linux.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is complete bullshit. Read the actual proposed  CoC, it can be easily boiled down to: Be nice to other people. The argument about this being used so that people who submit patches who are lgbtq/not white etc being accepted over others is completely untrue, and every person who has stated that has not had any real proof other than quoting the same sources saying the same thing. No proof. </p>

<p>This all started because Linus is burnt out at developing, and has admitted that maybe he has been too hard on people submitting shit patches. Nothing to do with non white cis males. That&#39;s all made up bullshit. He&#39;s just saying that maybe he shouldnt have been so cruel to people, like when he suggested that someone should have been retroactively aborted:
<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/7/6/495">https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/7/6/495</a></p>

<p>Also, to the poster above claiming that he handed the Linux project over to his daughter, that&#39;s untrue as well. He said he was taking a brief break, and was going to pass over the reigns to Greg kroah-hartman for the time being. There isn&#39;t any further conspiracy. I think PC/SJW culture is stupid  as well, but I kinda think people are inventing a conspiracy here....</p>

<p>I&#39;m now convinced that this whole movement is a part of a larger scheme. Every notice these people unite with one another quite easily yet are quick to shun/slander anything that opposes or disagrees with it?</p>

<p>It&#39;s now gotten to a point where you&#39;ll be fired, laid off, ridiculed, dox&#39;d, just for going against &quot; feminist and LGBTQIA+ communities&quot;. Reddit is a shit show example of this with the whole quarantined bullshit going on.</p>

<p>what the fuck.... when did I twilight zone here?</p>

<p>Now a century or two later that they have equal and more rights than men. They are going for any straw that they can grab.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This manufactured situation would force linux users into more locked down operating systems, with crappier software, less power and more privacy invasion. The death of linux would not surprise me at all. The latest computers from the stores have been much harder to install linux on lately, and this could be foreshadowing. I have also heard that popular internet sites are being dumbed down for viewing on cell phones anyway, and this could be part of that trend to lead people away from deep research on the internet and more towards top down entertainment broadcasting, like television.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Frankly, I&#39;ve no idea what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>The calling out of specific people and what they&#39;ve done in the past pain a dire picture, though.</p>

<p>Think one of the &#39;rape apologist&#39; accusation was made against a guy that refused to implement closed source hardware reliant function calls in his code, effectively denying Intel backdoor access to Linux through at least that specific method. Hilariously enough the public naming and shaming violated the very CoC they&#39;re so heavily pushing.</p>

<p>Whatever happens to Linux caution it advised and should the Kernel indeed fork close attention should be paid when deciding which route the individual should go for.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not the most avid of Linux users and only recently &#39;switched&#39; (still dual booting) as SteamPlay came around. So I&#39;m fairly fresh as a private user but as a Software Dev I&#39;m well aware of Linux&#39;s position in the commercial/business world.</p>

<p>Ultimately I&#39;ve no idea where this is coming from and I&#39;ve my doubts any SJWs would have the necessary skill set to seriously contribute to an OS kernel, let alone write any type of acceptable code. Plus, in all my Software Developing career not anyone has ever cared about a person&#39;s color, gender, sex - whatever - but the code quality delivered.</p>

<p>Typically Software Developers, youngsters and young prodigies aside, are likely smart enough to boil things down to substance that actually matters. None of these points contain anything SJW could possible cry foul about, in my experience anyway.</p>

<p>In terms of conspiracy I don&#39;t believe too much in coincidence and the fronts SJWs become active in keep on increasing. I&#39;d not be surprised if this was controlled attacks under the guise of SJW agendas.</p>

<p>Generally I&#39;d not expect most of their shit to fly with &#39;nerds&#39; but here we are and I&#39;ve evidently been wrong. Maybe the infiltration of gaming media was the first step to get everyone accustomed to SJW crap in the technical sphere of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this is a conspiracy and I think you&#39;ve exaggerated what&#39;s really happening and why. It stems from some language used by Linux Torvalds which has been called potentially offensive. He sometimes uses expletives or insults in emails. Offensive or not, that language isn&#39;t needed in a professional setting when you&#39;re talking about highly technical things. In essence, people would rather have Linus get to the point and leave out everything without substance. There&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with this. We have these very same code of conducts in schools and workplaces. They&#39;re harmless. Social media is less strict about what you can say and video games even less so. But an emailing list about making an operating system which is used all across the world isn&#39;t about expressing whatever you want like on Reddit: it&#39;s about a very specific, serious topic and it should be limited to that topic and not devolve into insults. It has rules for what you can say just like individual subreddits.</p>

<p>It says: &quot;pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of&quot; ... &quot;level of experience&quot;</p>

<p>However perhaps it is a jump to assume that &quot;level of experience&quot; means quality of code.</p>

<p>Accepting lower quality of contributions is totally unacceptable, but I don&#39;t see that explicitly stated in the CoC.  So I am thinking perhaps it is a &quot;slippery slope&quot; kind of thing which is causing the furor.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with the CC is that the language used demands the members of the community are a certain way and holds them to some good-sounding standards. Trouble is this is overreach. A code of conduct should be a document that describes what will get you kicked out, rather than criteria for being allowed to stay. It is fundamentally against open ideology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t coming at you, I was coming at the other user who is obviously here with an agenda. You and I have our differences, but I have zero issues with your post or any of your comments in this thread. It&#39;s the super partisan user a few comments above that I have a problem with. He very obviously has a passionate hatred for the left and is just using this as another topic to bash them on despite not actually knowing anything about it. As you said, you have some experience in Linux so you should be able to see that from his comment. I even said there might be some truth to it (since it looks like he is just repeating what he heard somewhere) but there is no way the user could explain it in their own words. </p>
